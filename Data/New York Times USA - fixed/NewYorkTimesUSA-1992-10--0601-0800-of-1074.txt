HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats;
Leading in the Homestretch, Clinton's Campaign Grows More Confident

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROMULUS, Mich., Oct. 17

 BODY:
Late Friday night, Gov. Bill Clinton climbed onto his chartered campaign plane to find his staff and a dozen reporters crowded into an aisle, watching a tape of a mock debate that had been televised on "Saturday Night Live."
Relaxed and energized after a day of campaigning in Virginia and Louisiana, Mr. Clinton laughed along with his traveling entourage as comedians Dana Carvey and Phil Hartman ridiculed the three candidates for President. He laughed especially hard at a sequence that portrayed him as a bead-wearing hippy defending himself against accusations that he evaded the draft. 
 Today, he played the tape again for his daughter, Chelsea, as they traveled to Michigan for debate preparations.
Mr. Clinton has seldom displayed a particularly well-honed sense of humor about himself. But as each day brings new signs that he is pulling away in the stretch leading up to the Nov. 3 general election, the tone of both the campaign and the candidate has changed.
 
Republicans Beset
 Within the last few weeks, the Democrats have watched in near astonishment as the Republicans have stumbled their way through the fall campaign, beset by adverse circumstance and misguided political direction.
And while President Bush was slow to recognize that a Rose Garden strategy would only backfire in a year when voters were unhappy with Washington, the Clinton campaign has tried to exploit -- often inadvertently -- the disadvantages of the President's incumbency.
Some of these disadvantages are cosmetic but telegenically important. When Mr. Bush campaigns, he is curtained off in many ways by the strict security that accompanies every incumbent President. Mr. Clinton -- merely a nominee for security purposes -- has been known to shake hands for an hour after his speeches end, and the result is a stream of attractive photographs and footage of the Governor grasping at outstretched hands and kissing babies.
This was never more clear than on Thursday night during the candidates' second debate. The same question that stumped Mr. Bush so thoroughly provided Mr. Clinton with what turned out to be his best opportunity of the evening.
"I have seen what's happened in this last four years," Mr. Clinton said when he was asked to explain how the economic downturn had affected him personally. "In my state, when people lose their jobs, there's a good chance I'll know them by their names. When a factory closes, I know the people who ran it. When the businesses go bankrupt, I know them."
 
Not Rehearsed, Aides Say
 Mr. Clinton's aides said he did not rehearse this answer but that it provided him the natural opportunity to showcase the personal manner of governing he has learned after 12 years at the helm of a small state. And the format -- which allowed direct contact with questioners in almost a round-table setting -- had been a favorite of Mr. Clinton's since the bleak New Hampshire primary campaign.
But there are signs everywhere of the campaign's new confidence. Its communications director, George Stephanopoulos, and its pollster, Stan Greenberg, were so happy with Mr. Clinton's performance after the first Presidential debate that they gave each other an exuberant high five in the middle of the press center, a bit of visual spin control, perhaps.
On the stump, Hillary Clinton has emerged once again as a spokeswoman for her husband, resuming a role that she had been forced to abandon when she became a target for critics who said the Clintons intended to conduct a co-Presidency.
And everywhere he goes, other Democratic politicians -- including recently critical ones like Rep. Charles E. Rangel of New York -- are climbing on his bandwagon with such alacrity that the whole thing threatens to tip over.
 
Polls Show Lead
 If Mr. Clinton is now sitting on his lead, polls that have been conducted for his campaign and for news organizations give him ample reason to believe that is a safe strategy.
The Democrats have decided that Mr. Clinton would not attack Mr. Bush outright, opting for restraint in an attempt to make Mr. Bush look frantic. After the President fiercely attacked Mr. Clinton in New Jersey on Friday, Mr. Clinton's only response was to call it "sad."
But talk of a landslide victory is "way premature," Mr. Clinton told reporters today. "This election is a long way from over. Seventeen days is a lifetime in public life."
His campaign schedule has begun to resemble an elaborate return on investment for the politicians who helped him out early on.
 
Fulfilling Political Promises
 His trip through southern Louisiana on Friday fulfilled a promise to black Democrats that he would help voter registration efforts and to Representative William Jefferson of Louisiana. Next week, he helps out several Western governors by taking his campaign on a hectic, two-day fly-around.
And occasionally he rubs the point. Today, he received the endorsement of a group of attorneys general and of Sarah Brady, the handgun-control advocate who is married to the former Reagan press secretary James S. Brady, who was wounded during a Presidential assassination attempt in 1981.
Mrs. Brady, who described herself as a "lifelong Republican" today, endorsed Mr. Clinton and described Mr. Bush's decision to object to anti-crime bills that included a waiting period for handgun purchases as "cowardly."
Frequently, the Democrats attempt to suppress their rising glee to remind anyone who asks that the race is not yet over. In conversations with reporters aboard the Governor's campaign plane, James Carville, the leading Clinton strategist, was hard-pressed to explain his reason for saying that he expected the race to tighten in its final weeks. Asked what the President should be doing, he demurred. "I don't see how," he responded, letting his response trail off.

HEADLINE: California City Endures A Series of Misfortunes

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LINDSAY, Calif., Oct. 17

 BODY:
It's been a tough decade so far for this Central California farm town: the area's third-largest employer closed in spring, and two years ago half the workers lost their jobs when a freeze wiped out the orange crop.
But now residents in this town of 8,600 residents are facing another economic disaster that could bankrupt the city government. Last month the city's largest employer, Lindsay Olive Growers, closed, taking with it 350 jobs -- a setback that officials said could push the unemployment rate to 35 percent.
As Ron Cain, a car salesman, put it: 
 "It may be as big a disaster as the freeze. It could turn this town into a ghost town."
 
Environmental Woes, Too
 The 311-member cooperative, once the world's largest olive processor, had lost more than $18 million in the past three years. After months of unsuccessful negotiations to sell, it closed its plant Sept. 18. A rival company, Bell-Carter Foods, bought the Lindsay label and its inventory but will process olives at its own plant in another county.
But the job loss is not the only problem legacy of Lindsay Olives. The cooperative, in decades of processing, also left behind 200 acres of sewage treatment ponds tainted by salty discharge.
State water regulators had ordered the city and the cooperative to clean up the ponds, and city officials fear they will be stuck with the bill now that Lindsay Olives has closed. The overall cost could be $30 million for a city with a yearly budget of about $1 million.
The state's water board is scheduled to meet Oct. 23 to discuss the cleanup orders in light of the city's hardship.
"It's sudden and pretty devastating," said Mayor John Maynard. "There's some tough, tough times coming. Those cleanup costs are astronomical, and our candid answer is: We don't have the money. We'd bankrupt ourselves."
In addition, the city lost a $2.6 million lawsuit filed by farmers whose underground irrigation water was tainted by the salty ponds. The city also will need to replace $900,000 that Lindsay Olives paid each year to help maintain the ponds and reduce the smell.
 
Seeking Outside Help
 This farming town, 150 miles north of Los Angeles, has appealed to state and federal agencies for help.
"We've been left holding the bag, and if the state pushes it, we'll go bankrupt," said the assistant city manager, Scot Townsend. "Then all of this would fall on the county and ultimately back on the state."
The fiscal problems arrived just as Lindsay was gearing up for its first lucrative orange harvest since a freeze ruined most of the fruit crop just before Christmas 1990. And the closure of the olive plant came after the loss of 140 jobs when United Cable, a telephone cable manufacturer and the third-largest employer in Lindsay, shut down last spring.
But some residents predict the city will find a way to survive.
"That freeze taught us a couple of things," the Mayor said. "There's a lot of generous people out there, and this community has a lot more vitality than we even suspected."
Jessie Oakley, a flower shop owner and 52-year resident of Lindsay, said: "I do think these people will be O.K. The guys will find jobs. Some of them already have gone to Visalia or found work in the orange groves."
But she added: "I imagine we'll all be affected to a degree. I'm sure people won't be spending as freely."

HEADLINE: Dinkins's Tactic: Start Spreading the News

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins's strategy for his re-election campaign next year became clearer last week when he appointed a political consultant to his cabinet and gave him a mandate to improve his public-relations efforts.
At the same time, Mr. Dinkins announced that Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch Jr., the political adviser who masterminded the Mayor's victory in 1989, will go directly to head the Dinkins re-election campaign after he finishes his stint as deputy director of Gov. Bill Clinton's Presidential campaign in New York. Mr. Lynch was on a leave of absence from his city post. 
 On Thursday, Mr. Dinkins created a new post for a Deputy Mayor with a mandate to oversee public relations efforts, and appointed Randy Daniels, a former television reporter, media adviser and press secretary, to fill it.
In announcing the appointment, Mr. Dinkins made an unusually blunt admission that he thinks his administration's most important initiatives get little attention in the press. Although he did not blame reporters and editors, he said he wanted Mr. Daniels to find new ways to promote those programs, which range from new neighborhood health clinics to special schools that function as community centers.
 
Ties to Stein
 "I wonder how many people know some of the things we've done," Mr. Dinkins said.
Besides helping the Mayor publicize little-known programs, mayoral aides say, Mr. Daniels's media savvy can also help him get re-elected.
As a bonus, Mr. Daniels, a Harlem resident, used to work for Mr. Dinkins's main Democratic rival, Andrew J. Stein, the City Council President. He is close to several politically crucial friends of Mr. Stein's in the black community, notably the Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d of the Abyssinian Baptist Church, who attended the appointment news conference and praised Mr. Daniels.
Mr. Daniels acknowledged the political nature of much of what he will do. "I consider myself a front-line soldier in the effort to give the Mayor a second term," he said.
 
Cutting Public Appearances
 But the 41-year-old Chicago native maintained he would also help shape the city's policies as a member of the Mayor's cabinet. "I am not known for sitting back looking at difficulty and allowing it to go on without saying something," he said.
Mr. Daniels will take over many of Mr. Lynch's duties, overseeing the community affairs and constituent offices. But he will also coordinate the Mayor's press, speech writing and scheduling staffs.
Mayoral aides said Mr. Dinkins wanted Mr. Daniels to pare the number of public appearances on his schedule and to focus on events that highlight his accomplishments and publicize his programs. He has been vexed by an overloaded schedule with many ceremonial appearances of dubious political worth, they said.
Mr. Dinkins articulated for the first time last week a frustration that he often dances around in his daily sparring matches with the press: the feeling that accomplishments that he thinks are important either do not get covered by news organizations or are covered but quickly forgotten.
"I believe many people are not aware or are not sufficiently aware of what we do," he said.
 
Frustration of Inaccuracies
 On a host of issues, from his relationship with the police to his priorities in cutting the budget, Mr. Dinkins often seems perplexed that the public does not seem to understand the reasonableness of his position. He said few people, for instance, know that his administration has balanced three budgets on time during a recession, or that the city has cut overtime costs by nearly $100 million. He often bristles at the suggestion that he has protected the Police Department from budget cuts at the expense of other agencies like the school system. Without safe streets, he says, children would never make it to school.
"I'm not sure everybody has understood these things as we've hammered away at them again and again and again," Mr. Dinkins said. "If people understand why some things exist, I think they are more inclined to accept it and feel there will be a brighter tomorrow."
Mr. Dinkins also expressed frustration that what he considers inaccurate reports of his actions sometimes take on a life of their own.
"To this very day people accuse me of holding back the police in Crown Heights," he said. "It's just untrue. It didn't happen. So when you ask me do people know, well, if you've got somebody misrepresenting our position sufficiently often a lot of people will believe that is what happened."
 
On Grass-Roots Level
 For his part, Mr. Daniels said his job was not to supplant the Mayor's press secretary, Leland T. Jones, who remains a cabinet member and the Mayor's chief liaison with reporters.
Mr. Daniels said his main mission will be to find creative ways to promote Mr. Dinkins's accomplishments on the grass-roots level, at meetings, speeches, and other forums. Part of his job will be educating interest groups and ordinary citizens who are affected by certain mayoral initiatives. But another part will be pure publicity, promoting Mr. Dinkins's good works.
"There are a lot of things that are covered and are even covered favorably but people still don't know about them," Mr. Daniels said.

HEADLINE: Ward H. Dennis, 54, for 15 Years General Studies Dean at Columbia

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Dr. Ward H. Dennis, Columbia University's senior dean and the head of its School of General Studies, died on Friday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 54 years old and lived in Pleasantville, N.Y.
He died of complications from a brain tumor, his family said. 
 Dr. Dennis, who started working at Columbia as a lecturer in 1961, was the general studies dean for the last 15 years. He was the longest serving of the university's current deans. His school has nearly 3,000 students.
Under his administration, the school created programs for premedical students, for economically and educationally disadvantaged students, and for junior faculty development, as well as a program in computer technology for nondegree students and a master's degree in liberal studies.
Dr. Dennis was named associate dean of general studies in 1969, and in 1977 became permanent dean, at the age of 38.
He was a former director of Columbia's Institute for Latin American and Iberian Studies, chairman of its Foreign Languages and Literatures Committee and Committee on University Services, and acting vice president of arts and sciences in 1989.
An expert on Spanish and Portugese literature, Dr. Dennis wrote a book, articles and reviews on the subject and was on the editorial board of Revista Hispanic Moderna, a journal.
Born in Boston, he grew up there and in Newport, R.I., and Madrid. His father was a business executive stationed for a time in Spain.
After graduating from Middlebury College in 1960, Dr. Dennis earned a master's degree in Spanish literature in 1961 and a doctorate in 1965, both at Columbia.
From 1965-67 he served in the Army as a training officer in language. In 1974, under a Fulbright-Hays grant, he was a consultant to the Catholic Universities in Quito and Guayaquil, Ecuador.
Dr. Dennis's first marriage ended in divorce.
He is survived by his wife, the former Sandra Howe; his mother, Amarie Whitters Dennis of White Plains; two sons, Ward of Manhattan and John of Niantic, Conn., and a daughter, Heather Dennis of Madison, N.J.

HEADLINE: Charges of Political Favoritism Mark Charged Battle Over a West Point Hotel

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON with ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HIGHLAND FALLS, N.Y.

 BODY:
For generations, the quaint Thayer Hotel on the grounds of the United States Military Academy here has provided a respite for cadets' families and West Point visitors.
But for the last four years the famous hotel, which remains open although rundown and, some say, dangerous, has been the center of a quiet but furious battle that has sometimes made the Academy's lessons on warfare seem tame. The fight, over which of two competing bidders will win the right to "privatize" the hotel now owned by the Government, has dragged in major Wall Street and construction industry players. And it has brought assertions by one group of contestants that a member of the other group, a top political aide to President Bush, has used his influence and has benefitted from favoritism by military officials. 
 The controversy raises as many questions as it answers about what once seemed the simple idea of turning Government property over to private industry to increase efficency, and about the business activities of Frederic V. Malek, an official in a series of Republican administrations who is currently the general manager of the Bush-Quayle campaign.
 
'Limited Passive Partner'
 Mr. Malek, a West Point graduate, says he is nothing more than a "limited passive partner" in one group of bidders managed by Douglass Bennett, a Washington lawyer and another West Point graduate. "I have never talked to anyone in the Army or in the Government or anyone with influence over the Army and the Government about this project," Mr. Malek said.
But the leader of the other group, John A. Dodson, a Harvard and West Point trained engineer who served in the Army in Vietnam and Iran, says he and his partners have become convinced that Mr. Malek "is using his position of authority to further his own personal interest, which is not right."
Mr. Dodson said he believes Mr. Malek personally intervened to help his group and to hurt Mr. Dodson's group. The winning bidder would take over the hotel, refurbish it, and operate it as a private business. Mr. Dodson said the Army has changed the rules of the contest each time his group appeared to be on the verge of winning. "He was," Mr. Dodson said, "the preselected winner of this contract."
Senior Army officers involved in the project deny there has been any political influence. "I never had any pressure from above to provide favoritism or to look more favorably on one offer than another," said Jack K. Norris, who was the Army colonel in charge of the Thayer contract process until he retired this summer.
But two inquiries, a formal one by an Army Review Board in 1990 and an informal one by a Congressional panel this summer, bolstered to some extent the assertions by the Dodson group. And accounts by people involved in the process support some of Mr. Dodson's assertions.
The controversy had been simmering for two years when it expanded sharply in 1990 after the Army conditionally awarded the contract to start a $50 million renewal of the Thayer to the group that included Mr. Malek. Mr. Dodson's group and a third bidder, Treadway Inns Corporation, were disqualified. Mr. Dodson's group appealed and won a decision from the Army Review Board.
The Army panel concluded that "corrective action is necessary" because the bidders "were not treated equally" in the first bidding process, but it did not find any fault on the part of the group that includes Mr. Malek.
After the Review Board decision, the Army reopened the bidding process. Treadway dropped out.
The reopened procedure, however, has been marked by a series of roadblocks that have frustrated virtually everyone concerned.
 
Inquiry by House Panel
 This summer, after Mr. Dodson complained about what he called continuing unfairness, a panel of the House Armed Services Committee conducted an informal inquiry on his allegations that the unfair treatment is continuing.
The ranking members of the Armed Services Committee's Morale, Welfare & Recreation Panel then wrote to Army Secretary Michael P. W. Stone on Sept. 14. Their letter said they were "concerned" that "commitments have been made" on the Thayer project that could impinge on the panel's ability to monitor military spending.
The letter indicated that the Committee would be watching the actions of the Army, which has yet to decide which of the two competitors it favors.
Mr. Dodson, who has assembled a development team that includes a seasoned hotel operator, a nationally known architecture firm, HOK Architects, and a major contractor, Tishman Construction Corp., said he believes Mr. Malek, whose group is also backed by major construction and hotel companies, has been actively involved in his team's efforts to win the contract.
The Dodson group had obtained a commitment from the First Boston Corp., the New York investment banking house, that it would arrange financing if the Dodson group won the contract. At a key moment in the bidding process this spring, First Boston suddenly resigned and placed the Dodson group in jeopardy of disqualification because it lacked financing.
 
Exploring Investor's Role
 Mr. Dodson and other members of his team said they were told that Mr. Malek telephoned John Hennessy, the president of First Boston and the finance chairman for Bush-Quayle '92 in New York State, to request that First Boston renege on its commitment to the Dodson group.
Through a spokesman, Barry Koling, Mr. Hennessy said Mr. Malek never asked First Boston to withdraw and that Mr. Hennessy did not participate in the decision to withdraw the financing. Mr. Koling said First Boston decided to withdraw for reasons "having to do with the economics of the project." Mr. Malek said he never spoke about the Thayer project with Mr. Hennessy.
But Mr. Dodson and others on his team said that was not what they were told. Owen N. Rabourn, a convention center consultant and a former vice president of the GTE Corp. who is a partner in Mr. Dodson's group, said the timing of First Boston decision's to withdraw appeared suspicious. He said the explanation the Dodson team was given was that Mr. Hennessy was acting at the request of Mr. Malek.
Mr. Rabourn said the news of First Boston's withdrawl was delivered to the Dodson team by Jerome H. Mandel, a Westchester-based construction finance consultant, who had introduced the Dodson group to First Boston. Mr. Rabourn quoted Mr. Mandel as saying that, "a friend of his at First Boston, a vice president, told him Malek called Hennessy and told him not to finance us." Mr. Mandel declined to discuss the incident.
 
Concern Over Malek Role
 Others who were involved in the project also said Mr. Malek, who was at one time president of the hotels division of the Marriott Corporation, appeared to be actively involved in the West Point project.
Michael Crall, a hotel construction consultant who reviewed the bidders for West Point, said that in early 1990 Mr. Malek and Mr. Bennett made a formal proposal before a West Point panel considering bidders.
In the end, Mr. Crall said, he favored the group that included Mr. Malek because of Mr. Malek's experience with Marriott hotels.
Mr. Crall said in an interview that the West Point panel members were concerned that Mr. Malek might have permitted his name to be used by the group only because of his political connections and that they quizzed him about that. "My recollection was, quote, he would be an 'active participant' and he would have a real active role," Mr. Crall said.
 
Political Insider
 Mr. Malek said he recalled addressing a group at West Point about the Thayer project but did not recall what he said.
Mr. Malek has worked in the Nixon, Ford and Bush Administrations and compiled a record as a well-connected political insider who favors Washington-style hardball. He was criticized by the Senate Watergate committee for authoring a "responsiveness" plan to dole out Federal grants in a way that would help Mr. Nixon's re-election in 1972.
President Bush made him deputy chairman of the Republican National Committee in 1988 but he resigned from that post when news accounts showed he had compiled a list of Jews working in the Bureau of Labor Statistics for Mr. Nixon in 1971. Mr. Nixon had suggested to Mr. Malek that Jewish employees in that agency had been trying to embarrass him by reporting negative statistics.
In recent years, before he appeared once again at the helm of Mr. Bush's current campaign committee, Mr. Malek has been working in several major corporate posts and at a Washington, D.C., investment banking firm, Carlyle Group. While there, he persuaded Frank C. Carlucci, the former Secretary of Defense, to join Carlyle.
 
Claims of Unfair Advantage
 Mr. Dodson said the odds against his group remain unfair. He said his group labored through the night, for example, to meet a July 1992 deadline set by the Army for both sides' "best and final offers." Just after he submitted his final proposal, the Army advised him that it had postponed the deadline. Mr. Dodson said the deadline extension gave the other group an unfair advantage.
Colonel Norris, the Army contract officer, said both sides had failed to submit complete new offers.
Mr. Dodson said his bid was complete until the Army changed the rules once again after he submitted it. That change, he said, was a "ruse" to justify the extension.
On another occasion, contract officers said a new analysis of projected revenues showed the Dodson group would lose money in its 10th year operating the hotel. Mr. Dodson said that criticism was based on a faulty mathematical assumption.
 
Increasing Frustration
 Lieut. Col. Marilla Cushman, a spokeswoman for the Army, said that officials are paying special attention to the review because of Mr. Dodson's repeated complaints of unfairness and that a final decision is not expected before March 1993.
Some who have studied the hotel that holds the memories of generations of Army families say the delay will continue a dramatic path toward deterioration at The Thayer.
Mr. Crall, the West Point consultant on the project, said he grew frustrated as he saw the privitization project stretch into years. He has not been involved since the Army decision to reopen the bidding in 1990. But Mr. Crall said he has been in touch with senior Army officials because conditions at the Thayer, which was completed in 1925, are dangerous because of lack of maintenance.
"What is incredible," Mr. Crall said, "is this unconscionable delay by the Army. Nobody back there is willing to make a decision becasue they are afraid of the consequences of the decision they are going to make. So that what is happening is that people are going into that hotel everyday and they are at risk."

Bush's Support With Builders Reveals Cracks

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP

DATELINE: COMMACK, L.I.

 BODY:
It takes all kinds of people to build a house. It takes all kinds to elect a President.
Starting at the foundation is John Sudano, a concrete worker here, who smooths the freshly poured cement for the new Hamlet luxury houses. Mr. Sudano says: "I'm one of the few lucky ones. I'm working." Half the 60,000 unionized construction workers on Long Island are jobless. This is one of a handful of new complexes being built in a suburban region of 3 million people. Mr. Sudano did not vote in 1988, but will this time, he says. Because of the economy, he won't vote for President George Bush. "That's definite. Ross Perot is for me." 
 Russell Andreasi is the foreman who supervises the concrete workers for the new Hamlet luxury houses. Until the late 1980's, his company, Spartan Concrete, kept on 70 men during the summer; last summer they had 15. Mr. Andreasi is a Republican, which is typical here. Registered Republicans outnumber Democrats 3 to 2. He voted for Mr. Bush in '88. "Definitely not this time," he says. He will decide between Mr. Perot and Gov. Bill Clinton.
Ed Esposito drives the truck that mixes the concrete for the new Hamlet luxury houses. He's been driving 24 years. Until last year he worked six days a week; now it's three days. "I voted for Bush in '88. Not this time." He'll pick either "Perot for his business experience or Clinton for his health plan."
Stanley Midura runs the crane that digs the trenches that hold the water pipes for the new Hamlet luxury houses. He's lost three months of work in 1992. This is the first time in a few years he's had a job on a new home site. Mainly he's done road repair. Through the 80's he voted for Presidents Reagan and Bush. "I'm voting for Clinton. Bush is on TV talking about change, but why didn't he do it in office? He probably could have done more."
George Harris drives the coffee truck that feeds the workers breakfast every morning at 8:15 at the new Hamlet luxury houses. He visits several construction sites and industrial parks. His business is down by 30 percent in three years. Mr. Harris voted for President Bush in '88. "This time I don't think so. To tell the truth, I like Perot."
Ron Bloomfield directs the office that makes the sales of the new Hamlet luxury houses. He says he has 38 of 52 houses in contract. The project is selling, he says, because it is aimed at a rare group not hurt by the economy: "people looking for a country club style of living." These are second homes for many. The Hamlet will include an 18-hole golf course and a clubhouse with two restaurants. Houses sell for $369,000 to $445,000. Even so, prices are $100,000 to $200,000 lower than planned because of the economy, he says. This is more good news for the rich who often prosper in bad times -- lots of desperation selling. They can find good deals. Mr. Bloomfield voted for Presidents Reagan and Bush, but says it's time for change. "The main problem is confidence. I'm leaning toward Clinton."
Howard Kane is the publicist who promotes the good life at the new Hamlet luxury houses. "I'm a Republican, but won't vote Republican this time. I'm voting for Clinton because of the economy and abortion."
Elliot Monter is president of the Holiday Organization, which owns the land and does the building and makes the profit from the new Hamlet luxury houses. Since 1950, Holiday has built 6,000 houses on Long Island and 3,000 apartments. It's never been so bad, he says. "We just came off 18 months of not starting anything. That never happened before." He has not built a second phase of $170,000 houses in a Holbrook development because the economy has so hurt the middle class. "I'm a Republican, voted for Reagan and Bush." This year? "Absolutely not. Bush hasn't a clue what's going on." All the President's talk about Mr. Clinton and the draft does not interest him one iota. "A smoke screen. People want their jobs back."
Edwin Schwenk directs the Long Island Builders Institute that represents the developers of projects like the new Hamlet luxury houses. Last year Nassau County had its lowest level of new housing starts since World War II; Suffolk had its worst year in a decade. Mr. Schwenk is a former Republican chairman of Suffolk. "I too voted for Reagan and Bush. This time I'll have an easier time voting for Clinton or Perot."
John M. Kennedy manages the building trades council that represents the unions that provide the workers for the new Hamlet luxury houses. "I started as a union electrician in '52. I've never, never seen it this bad." He's a Democrat. "I never voted for Reagan, never voted for Bush. You can't blame this mess on me!"

HEADLINE: Update;
Congregation in Rockaways To Keep Synagogue Open

 BODY:
For several years now, Derech Emunoh, an 87-year-old synagogue on the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens, has seemed on the verge of extinction as its congregation has shrunk to about 40 members.
So bleak were the prospects for the seaside synagogue that recently the president, Robert Wein, said the congregation would consider shutting down for good. But last week he reported that after discussing the matter, the congregants had decided to try to continue. 
 The once-elegant but now battered temple stands in virtual isolation on a vast, largely empty urban renewal tract in the Arverne area. Thousands of deteriorated buildings were demolished there in the late 1960's, but little new housing has been built because of economic and other obstacles.
Moreover, while the Arverne area was once predominantly Jewish, most Jews left years ago, succeeded largely by poorer black residents. Of the 40 remaining members of the Orthodox Derech Emunoh congregation, fewer than half attend sabbath services at the 600-seat synagogue, which in recent years has been open from April to October only. One reason is that vandals and thieves have ruined the heating system at Derech Emunoh (pronounced DER-ekh eh-MOON-a), at Rockaway Beach Boulevard and Beach 67th Street.
Nonetheless, Mr. Wein said the congregation would continue to operate from April to October. "Maybe a miracle will occur by the end of the century and the area will be developed," he said, raising the possibility that new housing would finally be built on the Arverne renewal tract and would bring an influx of Orthodox Jews to the area.

HEADLINE: The Real Problem With Women and M.B.A.'s

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Regarding "For Women, Fewer M.B.A.'s" (Sept. 27), I searched in vain for mention and discussion of a main deterrent in a woman's quest for this degree: college counselors. 
 As a single working mother, I advocated that both my daughters earn graduate-level degrees. Getting them through the obstacle course of college preparation and acceptance was formidable enough, but imagine my dismay when the eldest first came home from a state university bearing the imperial advice of her college counselor that she seek her degree in home economics rather than business because "it would be easier." She transferred to another university and earned her B.S. in business, but counselors there told her an M.B.A. would be "irrelevant" in her chosen field -- the hospitality industry. She joined the executive training program of a large hotel chain and we are still arguing the wisdom of an M.B.A.
My other daughter, an engineering student, received cursory attention at best from her upper-division college counselors. She was told she "didn't look like an engineer" and was repeatedly asked if she was "serious." Three weeks ago, beginning her fifth year, she called and said in amazement that "I found a counselor who finally takes me seriously." Then the bomb. She called last week and said her new insightful counselor advised her that she didn't "need a master's. He says because I am a woman, the time would be wasted."
My daughters and I don't need luncheons from graduate schools or brochures with more pictures of women in them to entice them to an M.B.A. My daughters grew up believing they would pursue graduate studies. Until the faculty members training young women shed their outdated opinions or totter into retirement, graduate schools are battling a significant impediment they apparently don't know exists.

HEADLINE: Well, About That Energy Prophet . . .

 BODY:
To the Editor:
We in the Tennessee Valley found that S. David Freeman's guessing ("An Energy Prophet Who Guessed Right," Sept. 27) was not as good as ratepayers in the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, for which he now works, might hope. 
 Mr. Freeman was chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority for nearly four years. During that time, our residential electric rates doubled and industrial rates went up by 133 percent. In 1981, President Reagan replaced Mr. Freeman as chairman, although he served on the T.V.A. board until 1984.
In contrast, Marvin Runyon, named T.V.A. chairman in 1988, vowed to put the authority on a businesslike basis. Nonessential programs were terminated and other economies were effected. Electric rates have remained stable for the past six years.
Mr. Freeman's prophecies -- based on the continued availability of cheap natural gas, increased conservation and exploiting renewable energy sources -- should be viewed with skepticism.

HEADLINE: Q: The Economy. A: Incomplete.

 BODY:
The economy in this Presidential campaign is Topic A, B and C. Unemployment, stagnant wages and spiraling health care costs torment voters everywhere. Yet the candidates, in their two debates so far, have responded mainly with snippets.
It's not that they don't have economic plans. Indeed, each has a booklet outlining his answers to economic malaise. But even these documents are complex, incomplete and, in places, internally inconsistent. Tomorrow's third debate gives the candidates a last chance, face to face, to challenge and explain. 
 President Bush responds anemically to unemployment with untargeted cuts in capital gains taxes and small subsidies for first-time home-buyers. His plan to eliminate the deficit isn't much better. And he'd make matters worse by promising an across-the-board tax cut plus hundreds of billions in unspecified spending cuts.
Mr. Bush's long-term strategy is better. He'd spend $2 billion a year training dislocated workers. But his program would leave most employed low-skilled workers to wallow in dead-end jobs. He'd spend more on early-childhood education but not enough to bring every disadvantaged child into the program.
Mr. Bush's health care proposal is typically incomplete. He'd subsidize the purchase of insurance, but not by enough to make it universally affordable. He wisely proposes managed competition -- a system of regulated competition among large insurers -- but shrinks from the tax code changes that would make reform work.
Gov. Bill Clinton hasn't told voters how he'd do what most needs to be done right now -- re-start the economy. But his program for long-term growth is sound, even exciting.
He starts with two shrewd decisions. He aims to cut the deficit, but only in half during four years. That would give him the leeway to raise public investment for infrastructure, education, research and training by $50 billion a year. He would require large companies to upgrade the skills of workers. And he would provide loans to college-bound students, to be repaid from future earnings, while providing apprenticeship programs for those who don't go to college.
However constructive that would be, Mr. Clinton's program contains gaping inconsistencies. His revenue estimates are exaggerated. He doesn't take on runaway entitlement spending and would take only a nick out of defense. He, too, proposes managed competition for health care, but in the next breath calls for price controls. He accepts the free-trade treaty Mr. Bush negotiated with Mexico but then adds conditions that threaten the deal.
Finally, the biggest doubt is whether Mr. Clinton is prepared to take on Democratic leaders beholden to the politics of old. Public investment targeted on worthwhile projects could invigorate the economy -- or turn into traditional pork-barrel waste.
Ross Perot's plan for eliminating the deficit is bold and honest. But eliminating the deficit is not the right place to start. In fact, if deficits were cut at the expense of productive investment, the plan would do more harm than good.
The candidates offer voters starkly different economic prescriptions. Mr. Bush says cut taxes, spending and regulations. Then sit back and watch the private sector cure all ills. Mr. Clinton agrees that the private sector bears major responsibility for training workers and investing in equipment. But he identifies a decisive role for Government investment. And Mr. Perot levels with voters about the sacrifice needed to get the deficit under control.
These are differences worth exploring; tomorrow night's debate may well be the last chance.

HEADLINE: How to Understand Bush's Attacks on Clinton;
Race and the Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In last Sunday's debate, the candidates addressed the "racial division which continues to tear apart our great cities." None of the candidates made the necessary linkages between our deindustrializing economy and massive unemployment, homelessness, unfair housing, high school dropouts, high infant mortality and the nexus between race and class. 
 Ross Perot commented, in his folksy style, "we ought to love one another because united teams win and divided teams lose." He fails to recognize love can't rectify the institutionalized racism plaguing African-Americans and other minorities.
Gov. Bill Clinton responded by stating, "If the American people cannot be brought together, we can't turn this country around." What does Mr. Clinton mean by brought together: wage gaps, educational resources, homicide rates? Or brought together on Nov. 3 to elect him as President?
President Bush addressed this issue in comments on family values. He insisted "the decline in urban America stems from the decline in the American family . . . I believe that discipline and respect for the law -- all of these things should be taught to children." According to President Bush, the urban unrest and racial disparities are the result of poor family values.

HEADLINE: Bush's Gamble

BYLINE: By William Safire; William Safire is a columnist for The New York Times and author of "The First Dissident: The Book of Job in Today's Politics," published by Random House.

 BODY:
I was a Bush-watcher long before I thought it would ever be useful and may be able to pinpoint the time he was seized by his inordinate fear of running without solid support from the far right.
In the 1970 midterm elections, President Nixon sent his most sagacious political aide, Bryce N. Harlow, and two of his speech writers, Pat Buchanan and me, to help Vice President Spiro Agnew barnstorm the country to help Republican candidates defeat liberal Democrats. 
 We smote them hip and thigh with social themes, and awesome alliteration had its day in the oratorical arena. (Pat came up with "pusillanimous pussyfooters"; mine was "nattering nabobs of negativism.") On the campaign plane one day, Bryce came back to the writing section to say: "Scrub Texas from the schedule. Our senatorial candidate, George Bush, thinks he can do better without the red meat you fellows have been throwing in the cage."
That did not trouble Agnew or us; the Texas Democrat, Lloyd M. Bentsen Jr., was not the sort of flaming liberal we had been dispatched to dispatch. "On to Tennessee," said Harlow, the last courtly White House courtier. In that border state, Agnew's ability to rally the far right helped a moderate Republican upset the longtime liberal Senator from that state -- Albert Gore Sr., father of the present candidate for Vice President. Small world: George Bush, who scorned the Agnew red meat, went on to lose the Senate race to Bentsen and never again forgot his need to lock up the culturally resentful right.
The Bush persona has undergone four major shifts in the time I've known him. In the 1970's, after Nixon found a couple of assignments for the defeated Bush, we would take our families to the home of Charles Bartlett, the columnist, and his wife, Martha, an antiques dealer. We sat in the basement, the kids on floor mats, watching the reels of new movies projected on the wall. Five or six couples were regulars, including the Henry Cattos (he's now director of the United States Information Agency) and the John Robsons (he's Deputy Treasury Secretary), some socialites, a former C.I.A. station chief. In conversations over Saratoga water between reels, Barbara Bush was the savviest pol; George was easygoing, wryly funny and open.
Then, in the years as Ronald Reagan's vice president, Bush tightened up perceptibly. "He became guarded," said a member of that set toward the end of that stage. "You notice that defensive look in his eyes? He doesn't want to reveal anything that could be taken as disloyal to Reagan, not to his closest friends. George is keeping his eye on one ball -- inheriting that mantle."
He hardened in other ways; Bill Casey, the C.I.A. chief, a hawk who found a policy ally in Cap Weinberger and an adversary in George Shultz, confided in 1983: "George is with us more often than you think. He plays his cards close to the vest, but he's not the wimp we thought he was."
He shed that guarded persona and the last vestiges of wimpishness at the 1988 convention, asserting his individuality in Peggy Noonan's repeated phrase, "I am that man." (After Bush's "kinder, gentler" promise in 1988, Nancy Reagan is said to have turned to a convention boxmate and tartly asked "kinder than who?" She knew when the cord was being cut, despite her grammatical lapse.) The self-assured Bush served the nation well through the Persian Gulf crisis; nobody can ever take his hundred hours of greatness away from him, nor should conservative waverers forget the historic heights to which he can rise in times of international crisis.
Then Bush the winner was replaced by Bush the loser. For the first half of 1992, he seemed dispirited; many thought he was ill. As his approval rating eroded and the economy failed to respond to the Federal Reserve's dramatic rate cut of December, the President seemed to slide into melancholia. Although, in his State of the Union address, he challenged Congress to meet a spring deadline for action on his proposals, his domestic "line in the sand" disappeared into the sand; the President seemed to lose interest.
"I think I will be re-elected," he said with confidence at the end of last year. "I predicate that, of course, on that I think the economy is going to be doing much better." Well, it hasn't -- not even a little better -- surprising him, befuddling his economists and making pundits like me look less than prescient. As the economy remained dippy into the summer, failing to respond to the stimulus of a huge deficit and the lowest interest rates in a generation, Presidential spirits drooped further. He became listless, almost morose, and it did not help that Sam Skinner, his choice to replace the embarrassing martinet, John Sununu, as chief of staff, found it impossible to get a handle on the job.
At a reception in the Canadian Embassy, Bush struck me as a man unhappy in his work. I tried to cheer him up with a prediction that he would take Texas, then in jeopardy because of the first Perot diversion. "Do you mean that, or are you just saying it?" the President responded. His need for reassurance was uncharacteristic; when I replied that a three-way race would enliven life because, after all, punditry is my job, he shook his head sadly and muttered, "We're talking about my job."
An administration's energy flows from the top; as the Bush spirits sank, a sense of doom permeated the White House. A midlevel aide stopped me on the street outside the Executive Office Building to ask: "You got any software for resumes? Make a fortune with it around here."
July was the low point. The personal turnaround leading to Bush's fourth stage came around the time of the Democratic convention, as Governor Clinton "redefined himself" and surged in the polls. Psychohistorians will focus on Bush's visit to James Baker's ranch in Wyoming, when the two old friends and two of their sons took a deep breath of the wholesome air and together pulled up the Presidential socks. The quartet flew into Jackson and had a long corn-on-the-cob lunch with Senator Alan Simpson, the Republican whip, who at Baker's behest had written down a presentation to make to the President -- not merely a compilation of complaints from frightened Republican officeholders but a sympathetic personal exhortation to get his head centered again.
One aide pinpoints the first week of July as the period of self-rejuvenation. "The June unemployment figures came in, a dismaying jump from 7.5 to 7.8. The President was in the car, on the way to a caucus of House Republicans, and he had a few angry things to say about his economic advisers: 'They briefed me for an hour last week -- and nobody told me it would be this bad.' That was when he realized that Barbara Bush had been right, he really was in trouble, and the economy wasn't going to turn around in time."
Bush looked "one-term Presidency" in the face and snapped out of his lethargy. Concurrent with the Democratic post-convention poll bounce came George Bush's personal bounce back: within two weeks, he was impressing his fretful managers in meetings with what Fred Malek, one of the managers layered over by the Baker movable feast, likes to call "his steely resolve." That's the President in his current stage -- showing more of a desperate than a steely resolve.
The truism about this year's run-up to election is "the electorate is exceptionally volatile." Poll numbers swing wildly; approvals soar and sink. But it is small wonder that the voters are volatile: the campaigners, especially the President, have been destabilizing, and Ross Perot's second squeezing of protest further jerked some of the electorate around. Contributing to the public's uncertainty have been George Bush's personal ups and downs, complicated by his peculiar gamble of shifting radically into a "campaign mode"; his quadrennial metamorphosis from compromising Jekyll to partisan Hyde. He is not the candidate of change; he is the candidate who changes.
AMBIGUITY IS NOT MY THING; I am of two minds about even using the word "ambivalent." Yet here am I, a lifelong Republican, a card-carrying conservative, a right-wing pundit with foursquare opinions on anything you can name -- with two weeks and two days to go before a national election -- and not yet sure about which hole in the card to punch for President.
Other libertarian Republicans are in the same boat. Should we do the unthinkable -- "turn tail and run with the antelopes," as loyalty-first Richard Nixon used to say? Or should we cast "a clothespin vote," so named for those who must put a wooden clothespin on their noses before grimly voting for the party, not the candidate?
As I interpret the polls, one Republican in five -- about 8 percent of the total vote -- is thinking seriously of voting for Clinton. He is not pulling us over the way Reagan attracted Democrats: A "Reagan Democrat" was a voter who identified with most Democratic candidates, saw Republicans as big-shot richies, but was pulled away from voting habits and instincts by the personal and cultural appeal of Ronald Reagan. There are few "Clinton Republicans," attracted by the hyperarticulate pitch or umpteen-point program of the winking, wonking Bill Clinton and his masked army of Little Rock liberals. On the contrary, conservatives who cast a grudging vote for Clinton will be "Bushed Republicans": conservative women turned off in droves by the party platform's unequivocal anti-abortion stand; hawkish males tired of a spent Administration; hard hats with hard feelings about comparatively hard times; young suburbanites put off by the tooting of an uncertain domestic trumpet, and right-wingers of all feathers troubled by a candidate who presents himself as Mr. Nice Guy clanking about in far-right armor.
But polls, while fairly good at detecting the wide pendulum swings of public opinion (Bush way ahead in January, Clinton way ahead in July and the gap narrowing as we approach November), are less able to measure "cognitive dissonance" -- the sort of jangling that goes on in the minds of people in my present pickle who are forced to hold contradictory thoughts. Hence this frankly subjective essay; if I can figure out what's bothering me about the Bush Presidency, perhaps I can show what might motivate large numbers of uncomfortable righties to stick or to switch.
George Bush's central problem on the right is this: Republicans assume that in his heart Bush is a moderate, a centrist -- words that fall gently on the ears of independent voters, but which to even the reasonable right mean "weaseling pragmatist devoid of principle." At the same time, in his efforts to win over a far-right base that has never been his own, George Bush drops his g's, approves (but claims not to have read) the uncompromising platform demanded by evangelical activists, and -- at the crucial kickoff of the campaign -- sent out exclusionary signals under the rubric of "family values" that infuriated the main body of the party.
Result: the righteous right thinks of him as a vehicle to be used while the reasonable right thinks of him as a traitor to his kind. That accounts for the crack, "His support may be narrow, but it runs shallow"; it explains the lack of a hardy band of "Bush people" to energize local campaigns even during hard times, and for the paucity of right-wing punditry to defend him in his hour of underdoggery. Nobody ever says, "Let Bush be Bush," because nobody can be sure what that would be.
Who are the near-right conservatives considering defection? These are Republicans who shy away from what is left of the Rockefeller wing, but cannot identify with the delegates who dominated the Houston convention. We keep muttering that with the glue of anti-Communism dissolved, the party is groping for new cohesion. Less often observed is the likelihood that its core is afflicted with "pluralistic ignorance": because the far right makes the noise and the moderate fringe gets the adulation in the news media, Republicans in the rightist middle do not realize they outnumber those to their left or right.
A segment of that majority is what I'm in -- libertarian (hands off at home) and interventionist (hands on abroad). We're having a hard time this fall because this campaign centers on a decision about George Bush. Not about Dan Quayle, who many of us think is getting a derisive rap from a horde of wise guys who replace argument with ridicule. Nor is our voting decision primarily about Bill Clinton, who talks too fast and fuzzes his positions but is shrewd and gritty enough to present himself as wholly unlike past Democratic losers.
George Bush -- a man with wide mood swings and an inclination to gamble on assuming a dual political personality -- is the underlying issue for my lonely crowd. We know that the Bush who campaigns is not the Bush who governs.
His economic mind-set -- not unduly to interfere with the free-market system -- is our own, even in a dreary period of breath-catching after the long 80's surge. But his campaign theme is Henny Youngman's: "How's your wife? Compared to what?" Central to the White House strategy is to contrast the Bush ship of state, even with all its slow-growth barnacles and prewar Persian Gulf albatrosses, to the untested Clinton-Gore ferry, which would enter the Federal ferry-slip dragging behind it all the philosophical garbage from the liberal harbor.
That is the way the Bush candidacy is being flogged as the campaign enters the home stretch: not so much for what the President has done, but for all the terrible things he is not. Mainstream righties cannot deny that such negativism stirs our viscera: the specter of Ricki Seidman, the Clinton aide who was the character assassin of Judges Bork and Thomas, possibly gaining the power to besmear from a White House office reminds us of the dangers that lurk. We thrill to the fear that Hillary Clinton, now softly coiffed and sweetly embracing the Cookie Monster, once in the White House might impose Federal standards in local day-care centers and otherwise turn the East Wing into the Left Wing.
But we cannot let that rising of our gorge distract us from the essential comparison of George Bush's term to what we had a right to expect. If we are convinced that the first Bush term was largely a flop, and that the next four years would be riddled with that same lack of domestic discipline -- then even loyal Republicans will bail out, on the theory that a failed second term might cripple the party's prospects for a generation. If we are to sink with centrism, goes that line of reasoning, better let the Democrats bear responsibility.
I'm prepared to stipulate that the last four years were -- in the word that Bush's own pollsters find that their sample keeps using most -- "disappointing." A contrarian few of us think that in his foreign policy -- from the Baltics to China to the Persian Gulf -- Bush was woefully behind history's power curve. Many more of us think that here at home the President was inattentive, causing the deficit to swell despite the tax increase. But if Scarlett O'Hara had it right -- if "tomorrow is another day" -- then can we expect a better four years ahead if Bush is returned to office?
The first answer, drilled into living rooms from our worst convention since the short-lived triumph of Barry Goldwater in 1964, was no. For us, the Houston Republican convention of 1992 was even more off-putting than the San Francisco Democratic convention of 1984 -- the one that celebrated liberal pressure groups and led to the Reagan landslide. Pat Buchanan, the protest candidate resoundingly defeated by Bush in all the primaries, declared "religious war" and seemed to deliver our party's message: no untrue believers need apply. Instead of asserting a congenial diversity, we touted a lockstep unity, during which the party displayed the basest of its base.
James Baker cannot pretend all that took place before he rode to the rescue. He knew that a convention was in the works that could make or break the campaign. After a month of destructive delay -- including a lazy vacation taken well after the reconstructive surgery on his friend George's sagging spirit -- he and his team of aides quietly assumed de facto command in the week before the convention. He had time on the bridge to steer away from the iceberg. But Baker signed on to the ill-considered plan to overcome the unpopularity of the President in a slow-growth economy by turning away from the usual Republican "national" campaign. Instead, he went along with George Bush's tendency, derived from his 1970 defeat, to gamble all on locking up a far-right "base" before assembling a coalition of other interests.
That's why "family values," a phrase that raised no hackles in the 1976 platform, dominated the convention. Every speaker was constrained to sign off with "God bless you," as if to respond to a weeklong fit of national sneezing. When Minnie Minoso of the Chicago White Sox began a time at bat by drawing a cross on home plate, catcher Yogi Berra is said to have observed: "God should be allowed to just watch the game." (I just checked that legend with Yogi; pity he never said it.) Bush made his first major postconvention speech to evangelicals in Dallas, pointing out that Democrats had left "G-O-D" out of their platform. That sanctimony went down badly across the country, surprising Bush and Baker.
How did the disaster of Houston happen? "The convention got out of hand," one of its many anguished planners tells me. "We had in mind stressing the good family values, positive stuff that nobody can complain about. But we gave Buchanan prime time at the start -- what a mistake -- and he let loose with all the vicious stuff. Then, when our innocuous family values came on, it was tainted -- we seemed to be endorsing Pat's gay-bashing and the platform's 100 percent anti-abortion plank. Then on ladies' night, Marilyn Quayle, without meaning to, only reinforced the mean-spirited Buchanan message."
Another planner agrees: "We got the blame for being in control, but that's all wrong -- we should get the blame for letting it get out of control."
Thus, at the closely watched start of this campaign, any Republican hoping, in Bill Bennett's apt phrase, "not for four more years but for four different years," was quickly let down. James Baker, Richard Darman and Robert Zoellick, who drafted the President's nearly hourlong acceptance harangue, rejected Bush's original notion of a visionary speech keyed to future plans, drafted by Ray Price, master of rhetorical uplift. They produced instead a shapeless, "fighting" partisan speech, assuming that the first priority was to give the troops a Trumanesque pep talk, and festooned it with a tax-checkoff gimmick that drew deserved derision. Although it had been oversold beforehand as "the speech of his life," the stem-winder wound only the stems in the hall.
Former speech writers may pay too much attention to rhetoric, but oratory can draw responses that illuminate the character of candidates and parties. To me, the most indelible moment of the 1992 Republican convention was when George Bush felt it necessary to admit "it was a mistake" to break his read-my-lips, no-new-tax pledge. The delegate audience reacted with a roar, as if this apology were the latest form of red meat; for a long moment, it seized control from the speaker, its fierce applause at once a chastisement, a warning and an expression of satisfaction that the convention had forced the nominee to submit to its will. Not since Goldwaterites reviled the elitist Nelson Rockefeller, daring to speak for "the mainstream" in 1964, had such a tidal wave of delegate triumph washed up over the speaker's stand.
The President of the United States stood there and dutifully took the abusive applause from delegates not representative of the party's majority of voters. He then promised tax reductions, which seemed to abandon the hope of ever reducing the debilitating deficit. The undertone: No change. "Four more years" meant only that: four more years.
Longtime Republican stalwarts were afflicted with the double-vision thing: two George Bushes were in conflict. We could detect that problem in a second revelatory moment in his acceptance address. Here was a man brought up to be a gentleman, never to stoop to boasting of personal courage, especially at the expense of another. True to that breeding, when he came to a slashing line that was uncomfortable for him -- "I bit the bullet, he bit his nails" -- Bush fluffed it, stumbling over the line and throwing it away. His coach, Roger Ailes, tore what is left of his hair.
By choosing scrappiness over vision, the campaign overseer Baker transmitted an unneeded exclamation point to the harsh message that had overtaken and ruined the convention. Many Republicans watching at home, and the G.O.P. leader I stood next to for a while on the convention floor, were troubled by the way our party's candidate was right-winging it. Uneasiness shifted over to undecidedness. The central Bush problem became stark: the near-right resented his phony pitch to the far-right, and the far-right, despite their stroking by the convention management, felt a kind of bemused contempt for their temporary captive.
Moreover, the political plan called for the redefinition of George Bush as the Democrat Harry Truman. Today's Truman image is that of a peppery underdog, a plain, unvarnished man of the people against the "special interests" and the "do-nothing Congress"; that image (not the "mess in Washington" Truman) was what Bush tried to emulate.
The opposition to Congress fits; the underdog in the polls fits; but nothing else fits. George Bush is patrician, not folksy, and he clanks falsely when he puts on Joe Sixpack nonairs. The "kinder, gentler" rhetoric of his first acceptance, especially in its contrast to the ideological confrontation of the Reagan years, is the man I think he thinks himself to be, most of the time. The Truman identification was ludicrous; not until recently, as Bill Clinton began acting like Tom Dewey, trying to run out the clock, did it gain any validity.
Give Baker credit for cutting losses: recognition of that bad reaction led to a fast change in the Bush strategy. The word "family" was replaced by "traditional," and the central theme switched to "trust," in the hope that personal character and not the economy or abortion could be made the issue. The word went out to Vice President Quayle and the campaign surrogates: dissociate yourself from gay-bashing, Hillary-zapping and from the abortion plank of the platform -- all of which was bothering the near-right Republicans who have someplace else to go. (Socking the trial lawyers was still O.K., because that group is almost as widely despised as the news media.)
But even as "trust" became central, the theme of "change" could not be abandoned to Bill Clinton: the Baker team, better able than Bush to conceptualize and integrate a mind-set into a program, hurriedly put together "An Agenda for American Renewal" to suggest that profound economic change could come without a change of administrations. The anti-tax theme was dressed up in an integrated economic proposal, into which a respectable free-market philosophy was larded, enabling Bush to appear to be, like Paul Tsongas, "a man with a plan."
The message was reduced to this: The Democrat will raise your taxes (true enough), and I'll lower them (patently false). Thematic simplicity is a blessed thing to the writers of television spots, but a slice of the traditional Republican vote thinks it is plain silly to predicate the campaign on tax relief. We think the President is overcompensating for his guilt in breaking his read-my-lips pledge; he seems to be trying to expiate last term's sin by promising to give back the money in the next term.
"He's said he'll do anything to get elected," Clinton has charged repeatedly, which is not quite accurate. The Bush statement that has caused him the most trouble in this campaign, allowing Democrats to exploit the Jekyll-Hyde divide, was made to David Frost late last December: "I'm certainly going into this as a dog-eat-dog fight, and I will do what I have to do to be re-elected."
A Bush family friend I trust insists there was nothing sinister about that; the context was he would determinedly hit the campaign trail and would give as good as he got, not that he would become a political Jack the Ripper. But his assertion is easy for Democrats to exploit now because the charge -- "He said he'll do anything to get elected" -- fits the mode-changing, Jekyll-Hyde Bush.
At heart, and in governing, he's Jekyll: honorable, decent, noblesse oblige, kinder-gentler, offering a hand out to Congress. Come campaign time, however, George Bush turns into Hyde: after the 1984 Ferraro debate, reveling in the kicking of a small donkey (or however he put it); in 1988, Willie Horton, the A.C.L.U., the exploitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. In 1992, the Hyde turned out to be "family values" -- which he knew would be taken as a not-so-subtle dig at philandering, draft-dodging, homosexual moral equivalence, "Willary Horton" and abortion on demand. His governance is too soft and his campaigning too hard.
HIS POLITICAL wilding causes Republicans to ask: What is the campaign about? To achieve a plurality, it has to be about more than staying In, or about keeping the liberals Out.
The 1992 campaign is about George Bush, both of him, in all four stages. It's about his gamble with the support of the near-right detachables by his embrace of the hard-right irreconcilables. It's about Bush's own record and its consequences; only that can determine our judgment about whether he will stick to new promises.
For many conservatives, spending, not taxing, is his Achilles' heel. The far right professes to be upset at the breaking of his old tax pledge -- witness the roar at the convention when he confessed his error -- but economic policy is not their hottest button. Yes, supply-side intellectuals are sore at him for getting ambushed at Budget Gulch; having been let down before, these Kempians suspect that Bush's belated embrace of their policy will be abandoned again by the Baker-Brady-Darman trio at the next budget negotiation. But most conservatives are more concerned with reducing the rate of spending substantially than in reducing income taxes by 1 percent.
"I will fight to reduce spending," insists candidate Bush, but not since the Kennedy years has domestic spending risen so fast. He can accurately argue that Federal spending, as a percentage of the rising domestic product, has held steady, but there stands the deficit's growth from $153 billion to $365 billion on his watch. Bush blames Congress; but as the Republican Governor of California, Pete Wilson, showed recently, a runaway opposition legislature can be stopped.
The most local-smart, national-dumb part of Bush's "fight to reduce spending" was the way he dispensed Federal largesse to swing states. Nine billion dollars in pork went out the window in one campaign week. Michigan is vital for electoral victory; they make M-1 tanks in Michigan. "We already have more of those tanks than we'll ever need," a senior Republican member of the Senate Armed Services Committee told me. "That's pork-barrel politics at its worst." But what you gain on the local swings you lose on the national roundabouts. Because the national news media focus on local pork, no Presidential candidate can credibly denounce Big Spenders while merrily buying local votes with the taxpayers' money. In his budget, issued early this summer, Jekyll-Bush thriftily proposed to eliminate the "export enhancement" subsidy, saving $3 billion over five years; that sensible austerity move cut out the grain boondoggle that had been used in 1989 to finance Saddam Hussein's war machine. But in the fall, Farm Belt votes came before spending cuts, and Hyde-Bush announced "a broadside of Export Enhancement Program initiatives" because he again found the subsidy "vital."
Right-wingers who remember the ravages of 70's inflation have not been driven to "undecided" by the slow growth of the economy. Few are drawn into last year's issue, Iran-contra, though most of us assume Reagan's Vice President was "in the loop," and fewer still are moved to the switching point by next year's scandal, the obstruction of justice in the investigation into Bush's 1989 buildup of Saddam Hussein that we call "Iraqgate." What alienates Republican mainstreamers in 1992 is George Bush's too-occasional sense of purpose at home and abroad, which is giving conservatism a bad record, and his gamble that we will put habit before conscience as he surrenders to the antilibertarian beliefs of what he mistakenly considers our party's core, which is giving Republicanism a bad name.
What would bring us home in November? As this article appears, voters will be sifting through the gaffes and gambits, the planned thrusts and canned ripostes -- as well as character traits revealed in the crucible of the great Debatathon. Republicans like me, with one foot off the reservation, will be ruminating about these questions:
 Would continued divided government -- a Republican President, a Democratic Congress -- be better than an all-Democratic juggernaut in stopping the centralization of power in Washington? It probably would; Bush's finest domestic hours have been his vetoes. No high drama ahead; no "hundred days"; but better a future gridlock than a speed-up of tax-and-spend. Against the spending that Democrats now like to euphemize as "investment," Bush -- for all his compromises -- could at least be expected to drag a foot.$

HEADLINE: New County Lineup For State Assembly

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
WESTCHESTER will have a new profile in the State Assembly next year, with at least three new faces in its seven-member delegation, down from nine, and a possible Democratic majority. Republicans have long dominated the county delegation and now hold a 5-to-4 edge.
The changes stem from the redistricting that redraws political boundaries every 10 years to conform to census changes. This year's changes were so severe in some cases that three incumbent Assemblymen -- the Democrats Gregory P. Young and Michael Spano and the Republican Henry W. Barnett -- decided not to seek re-election. 
 Another incumbent Assemblyman, the Republican Peter M. Sullivan, is finding the advantages of incumbency largely theoretical, with 60 percent of his constituents new to him. Another race is a rerun of the 1990 election, featuring the same players, the Democratic Assemblyman Ronald C. Tocci and the Republican challenger, Charles K. McGoey.
 
Democrats Favored in Three Races
 Three of the seven races have no incumbents, with Democrats favored in each contest. In a year featuring the insurgence of female candidates, at least one woman and possibly four more could be part of the new delegation. And, in another first, Westchester's Assembly team will include a member of the county's minority community.
One of the most interesting races, for the 89th Assembly District, pits Assemblyman Sullivan, an experienced and resourceful politician with an 18-year career in Albany, against the Democrat Naomi C. Matusow, a lawyer and resident of Armonk who came close in 1989 to upsetting an entrenched Republican, Edward J. Brady, in a race for the County Board of Legislators.
Although the district where Ms. Matusow is running has a 2-to-1 Republican majority, she said she will concentrate her campaign in three of the district's nine towns -- Lewisboro, Pound Ridge and New Castle -- where she campaigned before and where there is only a 300-vote Republican-Conservative edge.
 
New Areas for Sullivan
 Mr. Sullivan, a White Plains resident, has only the northern part of that city and the town of North Castle as holdovers from his previous 87th Assembly District. New to him are Somers, North Salem, Bedford, Mount Kisco and Harrison.
The incumbent, who gained visibility by campaigning throughout the district to win a Republican primary, said jobs and the economy are centerpiece issues for the district. He has spoken of the need to control spending in Albany while providing proper financing for schools. Ms. Matusow has stressed her differences with Mr. Sullivan on the abortion issue; she favors a woman's right to choose an abortion and says Mr. Sullivan opposes that right. "He must see it as a problem," she said, "because he used campaign literature in the primary to depict himself and Mary Goodhue," the State Senator, as "Republicans of Choice."
"This was a thinly disguised effort on his part to identify himself with a firm proponent of choice, Mrs. Goodhue, and to suggest that he, too, was pro-choice," Ms. Matusow said. Mr. Sullivan has said he is opposed to abortion and has denied trying to mislead voters. He has also said that his opponents do not have exclusive use of the word "choice."
Ms. Matusow also said that environmental issues were important in the district and that her being endorsed by the Sierra Club could prove crucial. The Right to Life Party candidate is J. John Pastorella.
Another interesting race, for the 88th Assembly District, has an experienced Democratic county legislator, Audrey G. Hochberg, running against Rita M. Blanco, an Eastchester real estate broker and former member of the Tuckahoe Board of Trustees.
 
20 Years in County Legislature
 Ms. Hochberg, who has served for 20 years on the Board of Legislators, characterized the district -- which includes Scarsdale, Eastchester and Pelham as well as most of White Plains, downtown New Rochelle and the northeast corner of Mount Vernon -- as having a 38 percent Republican enrollment with 37 percent Democratic and 25 percent independent.
Ms. Hochberg said she "knows how to do the job and proved it over and over" on the county level, exposing illegal contracts involving dumping fees at the county incinerator in Peekskill, improving public access to county government, forcing the government to provide quarterly budget reports and projections and exposing a "phantom army" of 1,000 unfilled but financed county jobs.
Ms. Blanco is described by her director of campaign operations, Jim Maisano, as "a different kind of candidate, one who operated a business, paid taxes and experienced many of the economic problems that the state and county are facing." Like many Republican candidates this year, she is berating Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the Democratically controlled Assembly as much as she is taking aim at her opponent.
"The most important task is cutting the state bureaucracy," Mrs. Blanco said. She would sell airports owned and operated by the state or the Port Authority, for example, to private interests "to produce revenues and improve efficiency." She would trim government, reducing the amount needed from taxes and thus encouraging expansion in the private sector.
 
Democrats Outnumbered in 90th
 Ms. Hochberg opposes the death penalty; Ms. Blanco favors it. Both favor a woman's right to have an abortion. The Right-to-Life Party candidate is Marjorie Gotsch.
Another experienced county legislator, Sandra R. Galef, a Democrat, is seeking the new 90th Assembly District seat against a Peekskill Republican, Lawrence E. Gomez, who has served for seven years on the Peekskill City Council. The district, which includes Peekskill, Cortlandt, Yorktown, Croton-on-Hudson, Ossining and Briarcliff Manor, has about 2,000 more Republicans than Democrats.
Mr. Gomez, a Peekskill native, is the owner of two small businesses: a dry cleaning service and a laundromat. He has referred to Mrs. Galef as a "professional politician" for her lengthy tenure as a county legislator and said she "would be part of the same tax- and-spend Assembly group that has served Governor Cuomo for years."
Mrs. Galef said she was campaigning on an "agenda for change," based on concerns expressed by residents of the district, while describing achievements of her 13 years as a county legislator. Her main interests are tax and budget reform, environmental cleanup combined with job creation and affordable health care. The Right to Life Party candidate is Patricia Vasta.
Richard L. Brodsky, with 10 years experience in Albany, is being challenged by Kelly Jones, an economist who has said his opponent is "part of a professional core of arrogant incumbents who believe Albany knows how to spend money better than anyone." Mr. Brodsky said he was co-author of a statewide cut in the tax rate that saved taxpayers $43 billion dollars.
Mr. Jones, who promotes American business for a Japanese trading company, said he would reform Medicaid and welfare, control the "taxing and spending spree" of Albany Democrats and open state government by imposing term limits on elected state officials.
Mr. Brodsky said Mr. Kelly is a member of the "Pat Buchanan wing" of the Republican Party, a charge Mr. Kelly denies. He also rejected the Brodsky charge that he is "anti-public education" as a proponent of the voucher system, which would give state tax money to private schools.
They differ on the abortion issue, with Mr. Brodsky favoring a woman's right to choose an abortion and Mr. Kelly in favor of parental notification and of limiting state Medicaid financing of abortions. They also differ on the death penalty, which Mr. Kelly favors and Mr. Brodsky opposes. The district consists of Mount Pleasant and Greenburgh. Noreen E. Donahue is the Right-to-Life Party candidate.
 
A Playback of 1990
 An eight-year Assembly Democrat, Ronald C. Tocci, is facing his 1990 challenger, Charles K. McGoey, a New Rochelle lawyer, and some of the issues are the same as they were in their earlier encounter. Mr. McGoey, who got 30 percent of the vote in the first contest, is again emphasizing what he said are the "bad fiscal policies" of the Cuomo administration.
"High taxes and overregulation are driving businesses out by the thousands," Mr. McGoey said. "New York State has slipped significantly in relation to other states, and the recession has been worsened by the fiscal policies of the governor and Assemblymen like Mr. Tocci, who is only a soldier in the ranks of General Cuomo."
Mr. Tocci, whose Sound Shore district remains virtually the same, stretching from Rye Brook to New Rochelle, agreed that "we need to bring greater fiscal accountability to the state" but said that the Republican-controlled State Senate "spends more than we do." Mr. Tocci also has Conservative Party endorsement. The Right-to-Life Party candidate is Sheila S. Naughton.
Cecile D. Singer, a Republican incumbent seeking her third term in the Assembly, found her district shifted westward through redistricting to an all-Yonkers configuration, losing Eastchester, Scarsdale and parts of New Rochelle and White Plains. Her Democratic opponent, Joseph Schleimer, is a former teacher who now owns a small office building and medical center. The Right-to-Life Party candidate is Frances Silkowksi.
 
A Tale of Two Cities
 Mr. Schleimer seeks support on the basis of his party affiliation, saying that a Democrat in the Assembly can wield more influence than a Republican, "who can only be a minority voice." He would press for higher educational assistance for Yonkers and for more conservative fiscal policies in Albany.
Ms. Singer said she had a "substantial record of accomplishment" as a minority member of the Assembly, especially in the fields of foster care and laws pertaining to the elderly, where she said she was instrumental in converting committee findings into legislation. Ms. Singer had nearly two decades of Albany experience as the top aide to former Assemblyman Gordon W. Burrows, now a Supreme Court Justice.
The 84th Assembly District is a tale of two cities -- Mount Vernon and Yonkers -- with new lines drawn to insure the election of a minority candidate. Seeking the Assembly seat are James Gary Pretlow, an eight-year Mount Vernon City Councilman, who beat Joe L. Farmer, a former Yonkers City Councilman, in a Democratic primary. The Republican-Conservative candidate is Piero Olcese, a resident of Yonkers making his first run for elected office.
Mr. Farmer, who lost by 39 votes out of 8,000 cast in the primary, cited "irregularities" and sought to challenge the results in court, but the appeal was rejected last week as not being timely. He will be on the ballot as a Liberal candidate.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
50-Cents-a-Gallon Tax Could Buy a Whole Lot

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The United States has a budget deficit, a trade deficit and an appetite for oil so huge that the fate of oil-exporting kings and emirs is a major focus of foreign policy. To help get out of this fix, Ross Perot, like the Presidential candidates Paul Tsongas and John B. Anderson before him, has proposed that the United States impose a stiff tax on gasoline, both to stem the national appetite for imported oil and to raise money.
Washington has always assumed that raising gas taxes to rival those in Europe or Japan would infuriate every voter with a driver's license, and neither President Bush nor Gov. Bill Clinton has endorsed Mr. Perot's idea. 
 But it's in the air and the budget deficit looms. A gas tax proposal would give Congress another crack at the oil import problem, which it largely sidestepped earlier this month when it passed an energy bill that makes substantial changes in the electric utility industry but does nothing to raise automobile fuel economy or give oil drillers access to promising prospects in Alaska or offshore. (It does, however, require state governments and Federal agencies to buy themselves some vehicles that run on something besides gasoline.)
More people seem willing to confront the import question lately. Kenneth Derr, the chairman of Chevron Corporation, the nation's biggest oil refiner, told a business group in Philadelphia earlier this month that he would support a large tax on gasoline if it were part of a serious plan to cut the deficit. The president of Conoco has made similar statements.
Mr. Perot has proposed a 50-cent-a-gallon tax, phased in over five years. What exactly would that buy the country?
The nation uses about 110 billion gallons a year. At the current price -- about $1.10 for a gallon of unleaded -- each penny of tax would bring in over $1 billion, and a 50-cent tax would fetch $55 billion a year.
 
Spending the Gas Tax
 The Federal budget deficit next year will probably be about $320 billion. The Pentagon budget will be about $290 billion. Washington's total non-military discretionary budget -- what Congress can really decide about, after entitlement programs and interest charges -- is about $250 billion. Interest on the national debt will be some $200 billion.
In this context, $55 billion is a big piece of change -- more than Washington will spend this year on food stamps plus child nutrition plus the earned income tax credit for poor people plus guaranteed student loans.
There would be no shortage of ways to spend the gas tax revenues if they were up for grabs and not simply applied to the deficit. But since a gas tax is designed in part to curtail gas use, it might be worthwhile to consider what $55 billion would buy in the way of alternative transportation, like bullet trains or electric cars. Even if they aren't driving gas-powered automobiles, people still have to travel. Last year a consortium of European and American firms proposed a 200-mile-an-hour train that would connect Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and Austin, in a 620-mile triangle, at a cost of $5.7 billion. Costs are speculative, but $50 billion a year would more than finance construction of similar trains between Boston and Washington, New York and Chicago, or San Diego and San Francisco or maybe through to Seattle.
The Advanced Battery Consortium, a partnership of Chrysler, Ford, General Motors and the Federal Government, hopes to soon be spending $100 million a year on electric car research. That's a mere twenty-fifth of $50 billion.
Maybe a lower-tech solution is appropriate. There are about 210 million Americans over the age of 10; with $50 billion Washington could buy each of them a very nice mountain bike.
Something that would stimulate the economy more would be popular. In California two years ago, to reduce air pollution, Unocal bought gas-guzzling old cars for $700 and a bus pass. Then it crushed them, improving the average fuel economy of cars on the road.
Last fall the DRI/McGraw Hill consulting firm proposed that the Government do the same with nine million vehicles dating from 1967 to 1978. The cost: only $6.3 billion. Even allowing a hefty sum for administrative costs, a "scrappage" program that had to spend tens of billions would soon be buying old cars that were not so old, perhaps anything that has been on the road long enough to have a full ashtray.
The auto industry would love that, because it would raise demand for new cars, and oil interests would prefer it to having to re-tool refineries, but environmentalists say that many of those cars will be retired soon without Government intervention. Gasoline taxes, everyone agrees, are a more direct approach, but less palatable.
Last fall, Congress considered raising the tax by a nickel but was scared out of it by the White House. The previous year it instituted a 5-cent-a-gallon-increase, and broke with precedent in another major way: For the first time since the Highway Trust Fund was established in 1956, Congress decided that some gas tax money would go elsewhere, into the general fund. The diversion was 2.5 cents.
Major interests are lined up against a bigger gasoline tax, notably the oil industry, which has seen demand stay essentially flat for the last few years and does not want to see it decline. At the American Petroleum Institute, Charles DiBona, the president, played down the value a tax would have.
 
An Insider's View
 In the short term, he predicted, demand would decline only 2 or 3 percent, as motorists drove a little less or slower. As they replaced their cars and chose more fuel-efficient models, demand would decline by a maximum of 10 percent, he said. His numbers seem roughly in line with historical experience. Between 1978, just before the fall of the Shah of Iran and the ensuing oil crunch, and 1982, prices nearly doubled and consumption declined just over 10 percent.
But gasoline is only about 40 percent of oil consumption, he pointed out, so even if gasoline sales dropped by one-fourth, total oil use would decline only about 10 percent. Mr. DiBona thinks that taxes would be catastrophically unfair. In Wyoming, according to statistics assembled by his group, Federal gasoline tax comes to $243 a year per household versus $91 in New York. Increasing the tax by 50 cents would make it $1,580 in Wyoming and $592 in New York, he said. A gasoline tax rise is unpalatable, he said, if it means that "a hard-working, God-fearing farmer in Wyoming will pay seven times as much as a stockbroker in New York."
There are other reasons, too, suggested another oil expert, Joseph A. Stanislaw, managing director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. Europe has gasoline taxes -- France imposes about $2.80 a gallon and Italy even more, $3.56, for example -- because it is resource-poor, he said.
"A history of not having this stuff has allowed it the luxury of taxing gasoline, like other sinful things, like whiskey, cigarettes and perfumes," he said. Americans will not get used to the idea, he said, just as he, living in Paris, cannot get used to paying $60 to fill up the family station wagon.
"But in the U.S.," he said, "it's always been a free good and it's very hard to begin taxing it. We helped discover the stuff, and we treat it as if it's our own."

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about a hypothetical 50-cent-a-gallon increase in the gasoline tax misstated the difference between the revenue that it might raise and the spending projected for electric car research by a Federal-private entity, the Advanced Battery Consortium. The consortium's research-cost figure, $100 million a year, is only one five-hundredths as much as the $50 billion in potential gas-tax income.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The South;
Loss of Democratic Vote Imperils Bush in South

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OXFORD, Ala., Oct. 16

 BODY:
Here in the rolling hills just outside the Talladega National Forest, the leaves are beginning to turn, and so, it seems, are many of the Reagan Democrats.
If enough of them vote Democratic in what was supposed to be the rock-solid Republican base, President Bush's re-election hopes could be doomed. "Clinton's for the common man; Bush is for the rich," said Roger Dunaway, a 43-year-old crane operator from nearby Coldwater who voted for Mr. Bush and Ronald Reagan in the past but seems to have nothing but disdain for Mr. Bush now. "It's time to get the Republicans out of there." 
 For all but one of the past five Presidential elections, voters like Mr. Dunaway have been responsible for the surest thing in Presidential politics: the Republican stranglehold on the South that has seen the Democrats win only of the 11 old Confederacy states in one of the last three elections.
This year enough voters have come back to the Democrats that virtually every Southern state is up for grabs for the first time since the last Democrat, Jimmy Carter, won the White House in 1976.
 
Bush Needs All of the South
 President Bush is in enough trouble nationally that winning almost all the South this year would not guarantee his re-election. But failing to do it would almost certainly guarantee his defeat.
That explains why Gov. Bill Clinton was campaigning today in Louisiana, which has gone Democratic once -- for Mr. Carter in 1976 -- since the election of John F. Kennedy in 1960. Now polls show the candidates to be evenly matched there.
"The No. 1 strategic objective for the Republicans has to be a re-creation of an almost solid South," said Earl Black, a University of South Carolina political scientist. "If they can't do it, I don't see how they can find enough states to win."
From 1880 to 1944 the South regularly voted as a solid Democratic bloc. But by the early 70's the South was becoming a Republican Presidential stronghold, and by the 1980's the Democrats could carry just one Southern state: Jimmy Carter's Georgia in 1980.
This year, however, the South is the nation's most competitive region, including Texas with 32 electoral votes, Florida with 25, North Carolina with 14 and Georgia with 13. For the last eight years, all 11 states, with 27 percent of the nation's electoral votes, went Republican.
"I keep pinching myself," said Al LaPierre, executive director of the Alabama Democratic Party, where Mr. Bush won 61 percent of the vote in 1988 and polls now show the race even. "It's been 16 years since we've come to the middle of October neck and neck. Usually, we're 17 points down."
 
Economy Is No. 1 Issue
 Mr. Bush clearly stands a chance to win all the region, with the exception of Arkansas and perhaps Tennessee; that could salvage his campaign. But there is a fear among some Republicans that his lagging prospects nationally could compound his problems in the South, where the economy remains the dominant issue and the old value-laden issues that once dominated elections seem to have lost their punch.
Not that it is hard to find Bush supporters in the South. Interviews with two dozen white voters at shopping malls Mississippi turned up only one solidly for Mr. Clinton.
And in Alabama, many of those who have voted Republican in the past plan to do so again.
"No way I'd vote for Clinton," said Bobby Miller, poking his head up from under the hood of a car he was working on at his service station here. "Some of his issues, abortion, defending homosexuals, may be O.K. for some people, but not for me."
But here and across the South it is clear that the sour economy, Mr. Bush's political weaknesses, the all-Southern Democratic ticket and the ways in which the political arithmetic of the South can work against the Republicans are imperiling the Republican base.
 
'No Way I'd Vote for Bush'
 All seven of the people congregating near a string of antique and curio shops next to Cotton's produce stand here voted for Mr. Bush in 1988. They were in a majority of 72 percent of the white Alabama voters that year. Now one is firmly for Mr. Bush, one firmly for Mr. Clinton and another leaning that way, one for Ross Perot, one planning to vote for the Libertarian Party, one too disgusted to vote and one too confused to say what she will do.
It is anything but the solid Republican South.
"No way I'd vote for Bush," said Elizabeth Horn, who says she will not vote this year. "We've seen what Reagan and Bush have done. The butter's fallen off the biscuits."
Interviews across the region indicate the problems may be particularly severe with women voters. Lisa Kety, a 31-year-old lawyer from Folsom, La., who voted for Mr. Reagan and Mr. Bush in 1988, said she supported Mr. Clinton largely because of the Republican opposition to abortion rights.
Like the rest of the nation, Mr. Bush is hurt most by the economy. But in the South there is an added kicker. The Republican dominance of the last 12 years has come in states where the Democrats generally dominate at the state level and where Republicans still have to fight the image of being the party of the wealthy.
 
'Hurting Economically'
 Natalie Davis, a political science professor at Birmingham Southern College, said 45 percent of the Reagan Democrats polled in Alabama said they were worse off today than four years ago, as against 31 percent of all voters.
That poses a tough hurdle for any President. But some analysts say Mr. Bush, unlike Mr. Reagan, may not be the kind of Republican who can sell in the South during hard times.
"The rural and small-town South is hurting economically, and who do they see in there?" said Kevin Phillips, a Republican political analyst. "Do they see a middle-class Nixon or Reagan? No, they see Mr. Pinstripes from Kennebunkport and Skull and Bones, who's the old Republican bogeyman."
Also hurting the Republicans is the degree to which economic issues are trumping social ones in this election. In the past, value-laden issues played strongest in the South. This year, even though issues like Mr. Clinton's draft history probably do more for the Republicans in the South than elsewhere, few voters seem to mention the draft as a defining issue.
Even race, the issue that in overt and subtle ways helped transform the South from solidly Democratic to solidly Republican, seems to be off the table.
"I think the Rodney King thing probably blew any chance that they would try to make that an issue, because sometimes issues, even in a subliminal and subtle way, are too hot to handle," said Matt Towery, a Republican who is running unopposed for state representative in Cobb County outside Atlanta.
 
Factoring the Black Vote
 In fact, if race has helped create the new Republican South, this year may show that it can work for the Democrats as well.
Despite the well-publicized squabbles between Mr. Clinton and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, blacks seem solidly and often enthusiastically behind Mr. Clinton and and his running mate, Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, who are both typical of the Democratic moderates who run well in the South.
In states like Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina and Louisiana, where blacks can make up more than 30 percent of the electorate, a solid black vote for Mr. Clinton means Mr. Bush needs more than 60 percent of the white vote to win. To the extent Mr. Perot is a factor, he tends to help Mr. Clinton in the South by drawing white voters from Mr. Bush.
"If Clinton and Bush more or less divide the white vote, the Republicans have no hope," Professor Black said.
Compounding the Republican weaknesses, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore have run close to a perfect race for the South, blunting social issues like the death penalty and welfare and hitting hard on economic ones.
"The key was nominating two moderate Southerners and distancing themselves a bit from Jesse Jackson and appealing to Reagan Democrats to come home," said William Barnard, a history professor at the University of Alabama. "It's worked."
Still, the strength of the Democrats this year is really just enough to keep them in the game, not insured victories. Some supporters of Mr. Bush think the South is too conservative not to finally drift back to the Republicans.
"I know what the polls say, but I think this will be like the Atlanta Braves game the other night," said Mr. Miller, the car mechanic. "It was hard to see how they were going to win, but they did."
For now, in addition to Arkansas and Tennessee, the Clinton campaign is given its best chances in North Carolina, Georgia and perhaps Louisiana. The Republicans seem strongest in Mississippi and South Carolina, and are certain to throw everything they can at must-win states like Florida and Texas. The difference is the Democrats would be thrilled with a split of the South. The Republicans need to come close to wining it all.
"I think this is like 1980, where, with the exception of Texas and Florida, where the Republicans won big, most of these states were very tight races," Professor Black said. "I could easily see all of these states going either way. I could see a sweep for Clinton or a sweep for Bush. But I think it's more likely at this point to be a sweep for Clinton."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Senate Race;
2 Veteran Lawmakers Engage in a Bitter Battle

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore., Oct. 17

 BODY:
The Senate race here between Bob Packwood and Les AuCoin could be a classic, as the candidates confront 1992's spectrum of issues great and small, from trade to health care to the environment, and from term limits to Congressional pay.
But content aside, it is not an elegant contest between these two effective, veteran lawmakers. An angry battle of television commercials, along with the exaggerated knees-and-elbows debating style that both candidates employ, reflect an underlying reality: the two cannot stand each other. 
 The tone of the race between Senator Packwood, a 60-year-old Republican with 24 years in office, and Representative AuCoin, a 49-year-old Democrat who wants Mr. Packwood's job after 18 years in the House, was captured in the opening minutes of a debate here Thursday.
"Bob, do you have no shame about peddling the garbage you put on TV?" demanded Mr. AuCoin.
"Les, I wasn't going to let you throw the first low blow of the campaign," responded Mr. Packwood.
 
Punch and Counterpunch
 When they argue trade, Mr., AuCoin says that the North American Free Trade Agreement would encourage manufacturers to run to Mexico. Mr. Packwood contends that exports boost this state's economy and says Mr. AuCoin sold out to labor in opposing the pact.
When they talk about jobs and the environment, Mr. Packwood runs against the spotted owl and "environmental extremists." Mr. AuCoin argues for slower timber cutting and contends that Mr. Packwood has backed tax measures that subsidize log exports.
Each has a health-care plan. Mr. Packwood attacks Mr. AuCoin's proposal for national health insurance. He contends, without explanation, that it would cost everyone $4,300 a year, and maintains, accurately, that Mr. AuCoin does not say how it would be paid for. Mr. AuCoin says Mr. Packwood's proposals for more complete coverage by employers would bankrupt many companies because it has no cost containment features.
 
Tough Road for AuCoin
 When Mr. Packwood advocates term limits, Mr. AuCoin's advertisements respond that his opponent wants to stay in the Senate for 30 years and asks, "Come on Bob, who are you kidding?" Each accuses the other, correctly, of supporting Congressional pay increases.
The race is close. Some public-opinion polls have put it about even. Others have shown Mr. Packwood with a lead comparable to the 12-point edge his campaign manager, Elaine Franklin, said her own polls showed. But she made it clear in an interview on Friday that she thought the race was far from over.
Mr. AuCoin disputes her polls, saying his surveys put him within the poll takers' margin of error and show Mr. Packwood with less than half the vote. "A dead heat 17 days out goes to the challenger," Mr. AuCoin said today.
One reason for the persistent hope in his camp is that by traditional standards Mr. AuCoin ought to be out of contention by now, and he is not.
First he suffered from the House Bank scandal this year, having 83 overdrafts to his name. Then he came out of a bitter May primary with no lift at all, prevailing only after a recount and without support from his opponent, Harry Lonsdale. And since then, Mr. Packwood has outspent him by about 3 to 1, battering him with heavily negative television and radio commercials.
Mr. Packwood, with the fund-raising access that falls to a senior member of the Finance and Commerce Committees, said he expected to raise $7 million, and, after fund-raising expenses, spend about $4 million on the campaign itself.
 
Not Cuddly, but Ahead
 Another edge for Mr. Packwood is that Mr. AuCoin has been unable to capitalize as much as he might have expected on his record as the House's legislative leader on behalf of abortion rights. Senator Packwood is an important Republican supporter of such rights and is cherished by some liberal groups for revolting against his party. Generally, his willingness to vote in favor of overriding vetoes undercuts Mr. AuCoin's ability to tie the Senator to President Bush, whose popularity has been sinking.
But orthodox Republicans, here or in Washington, do not like those stands, or Mr. Packwood's way of expressing them. "He is tough and he's blunt and you may not like him," said the state Republican chairman, Craig Berkman. After 24 years, Mr. Packwood fits the model of an incumbent ripe for defeat.
Yet, with a television campaign that makes no sustained effort to portray him as warm and cuddly but instead contends, when not attacking his rival, that he is tough and effective, he is ahead.
One element of his lead tickles political memories here. On Thursday Mr. Packwood said it would be "suicide" for a small state like Oregon to abandon the power he had built up in 24 years. He began those years in 1968, when he beat the longtime incumbent, Wayne Morse, arguing that seniority in Congress was overrated.
Besides the popular Democratic Presidential campaign of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, which all sides agree helps Mr. AuCoin, there is another outside factor that could affect this race.
That is the battle over a proposition to amend the State Constitution to classify homosexuality as "abnormal, wrong, unnatural and perverse." Both Senate candidates oppose the measure, though Mr. AuCoin did so first.
This issue has greatly helped propel an increase in voter registration. Mr. Berkman says he thinks that many of the newly registered voters support the constitutional measure and will vote Republican, helping Mr. Packwood in the process.
Democrats disagree, pointing to surging registration by college students. Judy Tuttle, the party's state vice chairman, argued that "lots of new voters" were ready to oppose the measure and to vote for Mr. Clinton and Mr. AuCoin while they were at it.

HEADLINE: Caught in an S.& L. Nightmare

BYLINE: Leah Beth Ward writes on business topics from Santa Fe, N.M.
<BYL>By LEAH BETH WARD

DATELINE: ROSWELL, N.M.

 BODY:
When Thomas D. Ramage was asked in 1983 to serve on the board at Valley Federal Savings and Loan in Roswell, N.M., the young physician jumped at the chance. He says he saw the part-time post as a form of community service, a way to give the growing thrift institution an outside voice. Besides, Dr. Ramage dabbled in real estate in the area -- a prosperous patch of oil and natural gas in southeastern New Mexico sometimes called Little Texas -- and wanted to learn about banking.
Valley Federal gave Dr. Ramage a director's manual to read and he also studied some business journals. The doctor, an internist specializing in rheumatology, was confident he could handle the job, which paid $300 for each monthly board meeting. 
 But today, nearly 10 years later, Dr. Ramage, 47, finds himself in a nightmare. He is spending $8,000 a month to defend himself against the Federal Government in a civil lawsuit that accuses him of being grossly negligent as a director at Valley Federal, which was closed two years ago by regulators who found $36 million in allegedly improper loans and other transactions. The Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency charged with liquidating failed savings and loans, has named more than 20 others in the suit, including Dr. Ramage's wife, Judith, who was listed in the event a judgment against marital community property proves necessary.
 
Out of Their Element
 Whether Dr. Ramage's situation is the result of bad luck, poor judgment, actual negligence or something else has yet to be decided by a judge or jury. It may never be resolved. When the lawsuit was filed last March, Dr. Ramage vowed to fight. But lately, with two children in college and two more heading there, Dr. Ramage sees no way out except to settle. But his last offer of $60,000 was rejected by the R.T.C., which is seeking $500,000.
Dr. Ramage's suit most likely will end up as a footnote in the history of the savings and loan disaster. But for now it is a case study from the underside of the industry cleanup, representative of the parlous situation faced by many outside directors around the country who had little or no banking experience when they became board members and are now, they say, being unfairly asked to pay for the misdeeds of others.
To be sure, many of the 200 civil suits that the R.T.C. has brought nationally against thrift officers and board members have been replete with damning accounts of the behavior of outside directors. These include numerous instances of loans approved to friends, family members and business associates that were incompletely documented, lacking in collateral or simply outright frauds.
But some of the outside directors simply found themselves out of their element as the savings and loans were buffeted by deregulation and a declining economy, said Tim Pryor, a lawyer and vice president of the American Association of Bank Directors, a trade group based in Washington. If they acted incorrectly, the argument goes, they did so out of ignorance or because they relied on misleading information supplied by more sophisticated directors and officers.
"There are literally hundreds of people like this," said Mr. Pryor. "Every one of these people is a doctor, a dentist, a lumberyard owner, a small-time business person who had no idea they would be targeted in this thing and for the most part they are innocent."
Critics of the Resolution Trust Corporation say the agency is pursuing Dr. Ramage and others like him less because of their alleged culpability and more because they are thought to have sizable assets.
 
A Cause Celebre
 Indeed, after publicizing his predicament on local television and granting interviews to journalists -- against his lawyer's wishes -- Dr. Ramage has turned his case into something of a cause celebre. His patients have written to state and Federal officials complaining of big government's "attack" on their doctor, the only rheumatologist within 200 miles of Roswell.
And New Mexico's two United States Senators -- Jeff Bingaman, a Democrat, and Pete V. Domenici, a Republican -- have joined the chorus of outrage. Senator Bingaman has accused the R.T.C. of filing frivolous lawsuits. Senator Domenici, a member of the Banking Committee, has raised the possibility that the agency is trampling on individual rights.
Going after crooks is one thing, the Senator told the agency's chairman, Robert Casey, at a committee hearing in August. "It is a totally different matter," he said, "for the Federal Government to file a lawsuit against citizens simply because they have deep pockets."
But the R.T.C. says the matter is simple: directors have an obligation to do more than just a cursory review of matters that come before their boards and they are negligent if all they do is rubber stamp the improper actions of others. The agency does its homework before filing a lawsuit, said a spokeswoman, Felisa Neuringer, and if an individual is negligent in the Government's eyes, his or her assets are fair game, regardless of the degree of guilt.
"We are in the business of recovering money for taxpayers," said Ms. Neuringer. "We are not going to pursue somebody who is broke."
Some poor decisions were made by the Valley Federal board, Dr. Ramage conceded in a recent interview in his office here. But that is only clear in hindsight, he added, and he refuses to share blame for the institution's collapse. Valley Federal, founded in 1945, was New Mexico's third-largest savings and loan when it failed, with $246.6 million in deposits. The R.T.C. could not find a buyer and the failure has cost taxpayers $130.5 million.
 
'Punk' Lawyers
 Dr. Ramage's bitterness is palpable. He is particularly angry that four of the five questionable transactions outlined in the Government's lawsuit were authorized before he joined the board. The other was voted upon at a meeting he did not attend.
"I'm well over six figures in legal fees and these punk R.T.C. lawyers are still trying to bury me," he said, pounding his desk.
When Dr. Ramage joined the board, most of Valley Federal's collateral consisted of farmland and oil and gas properties. By 1986, oil prices had fallen from more than $28 a barrel to $10. Meanwhile, a Federal court determined that New Mexico owed Texas a huge water debt from the Pecos River. Nearly 100,000 acres of nearby pecan, alfalfa, cotton and soybean farms, irrigated by the Pecos, had to be taken out of production to repay Texas. Land values slumped.
"I controlled none of these things," Dr. Ramage says.
Valley Federal was hardly alone in its failure. Half of New Mexico's 23 thrift institutions have been shut down in the last few years, costing taxpayers $1.7 billion. Indeed, Valley Federal directors served from the mid-1980's without liability insurance, Dr. Ramage said, because insurers, frightened by the national epidemic of thrift insolvencies, would not renew their policies.
But such vagaries as slumping oil prices and land values are beside the point to the R.T.C., which notes that directors assume certain fiduciary duties when they agree to serve. At Valley Federal, the directors "had been ineffective in managing and operating the institution in a safe and sound manner," the R.T.C.'s lawsuit says, quoting the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
Though he did not vote on the original loans in question, Dr. Ramage participated in extending them, R.T.C. officials say. He and the other directors tolerated "nonexistent loan analysis," including loans based on outdated appraisals and unaudited financial statements as well as deals alleged to have benefited thrift insiders, according to the lawsuit. One $5 million loan for an apartment project shifted the risk of failure from a group of private investors to Valley Federal, the lawsuit states, resulting in losses of $7.6 million. Meanwhile, the suit alleges, cash from the project was paid to the limited partners, who included four Valley insiders and two Valley attorneys. (Dr. Ramage obtained several small loans from Valley Federal while a director. These have been repaid and the R.T.C. has never questioned their propriety.)
 
Asking Questions
 For his part, Dr. Ramage says he asked detailed questions of officers about the apartment project loan and the others cited in the lawsuit. "Basically I was always satisfied," he said. "You depend on the officers, the lawyers and the accountants."
Dr. Ramage also thinks it is unfair for the R.T.C. to sue him now when Federal regulators knew they had a big problem on their hands with Valley Federal as far back as 1982, before he joined the board. Then, a Federal audit questioned Valley Federal's lending practices and the role of a stockholder who served as a "loan procurement officer," earning a percentage from the loans he brought in. By 1985, Valley Federal was operating at a loss and agreed to tighten its procedures. But there was no indication in an examination that year by regulators that directors were operating in an unsafe manner.
Dr. Ramage maintains he was an involved director who looked out for Valley Federal's interests. He cites the thrift president's decision, made without board approval, to buy two quarterhorses in an apparent attempt to make a repossessed farm more attractive to potential buyers. "We immediately told him to sell those horses," Dr. Ramage said. "We were not in the horse business."
But there were also moments of ethical ambiguity that Dr. Ramage admits gave him pause. For instance, when the thrift president offered him the use of a condominium in Ruidoso, N.M., a mountain resort area, the doctor said he declined because "I didn't want to be beholden to anyone." Nevertheless, he didn't object to others using the condominium.
 
Targeting Assets
 Dr. Ramage contends he is the arbitrary target of a Government bent on bullying thrift directors into coughing up money to show off to Congress. What's more, he says the R.T.C. is seeking more money from him than from others on the board who had much deeper and longer ties to Valley Federal. One reason, he said, is that the assets of some of the other directors are tied up in trusts, which can be difficult to crack. Another director lost considerable assets in a divorce settlement.
Dr. Ramage puts his pretax income from his medical practice at $150,000, but declines to estimate the worth of his other assets, which include ownership of some vacant land and part interests in both an apartment complex and an Arby's roast beef restaurant. He says "there is no way" he could pay $500,000 in damages.
Looking back, Dr. Ramage wishes he had turned down the board seat in 1983. But his regrets quickly turn to anger. "They are trying to outlast me," says the former high school and college basketball star. "But I'm not used to losing."

 
 
ONE LOAN THAT SOURED
 What would a similarly situated business person on a bank board have done?
Tim Pryor of the American Association of Bank Directors in Washington thinks the question should be asked in the case of Dr. Thomas D. Ramage and other outside directors of savings and loan institutions who are being sued for damages as part of the Government's attempt to recover taxpayer money.
But a director's latitude for judgment has narrowed considerably under the approach taken by the Resolution Trust Corporation in its lawsuits against directors, Mr. Pryor said. And Dr. Ramage, who is being sued over his role as a director of the failed Valley Federal Savings and Loan in Roswell, N.M., says he found too late that he had almost no room at all to maneuver.
In 1984, a "loan procurement" officer for Valley Federal brought to the board a proposed $1.2 million loan to owners of a cattle ranch near Carlsbad, N.M. A four-year-old appraisal indicated the ranch land, near a new Federal recreation area, would be worth $2.3 million if developed into a subdivision. The loan was approved.
Dr. Ramage missed the vote because of his medical practice, board minutes show. Later, Dr. Ramage said he questioned thrift officers about the loan. He said he was told that the land fronted on a lake created by a dam and that the property "would take off after the recreation area was finished."
According to the Resolution Trust Corporation, the loan was made without an updated appraisal, without an audited financial statement and without any evidence of the borrower's ability to repay.
After examiners declared the loan an improper investment, the directors foreclosed. A subsequent appraisal revealed the best use of the land was for grazing, and Valley sold it for $53,000, a mere 4 percent of the original loan amount.
As it happened, the ranch land wasn't lakefront property at all.
"If the lake ever got big enough, it would be lakefront property, but as this thing unraveled, the lake would have to rise substantially," Dr. Ramage said. "The numbers looked good. Was I supposed to go out there and stake the property? I had no reason not to believe the people at the bank. I just took it that these folks knew what they were doing."

HEADLINE: Drug Programs Expand but Waiting Lists Remain

BYLINE: By ANDI RIERDEN

 BODY:
JUST after dawn each day, a 45-year old man drives his Saab through the near empty streets of New Haven's south side to a small methadone clinic next to the city's welfare office. Within five minutes he moves to the front of a line where a nurse checks his chart and empties a vial filled with 100 milligrams of the green liquid into a cup of orange juice. She hands it to him and watches him drink and swallow the mixture, which the man describes as bittersweet.
A talkative man with light blue eyes, a muscular build and a braid that trails to the middle of his back, the artist and martial arts teacher said that the drug had stabilized his life after years of severe drug abuse that nearly crippled his artistic powers and wreaked havoc on his social life. 
 He said he was considering detoxifying from methadone in the next few months but added that he was reluctant. "I just can't imagine going through all that pain again," he said.
He is among the nearly 45,000 people enrolled in drug and alcohol treatment programs in the state, a figure that has jumped nearly 40 percent since 1985, according to the Connecticut Alcohol and Drug Abuse Commission.
 
Better Reporting
 Though the numbers can be attributed in part to better reporting systems by state agencies and an expansion of services for addicts, experts in the drug abuse field say that one of the major contributors to the increase has been the channeling over the past decade of billions of Federal dollars to curtail the so-called war on drugs.
The Government's push toward a punitive solution to the drug problem, instead of an emphasis on more prevention and treatment, has overburdened the court and prison system and done little to halt the destruction that drug abuse has inflicted on communities, said Dr. John C. Higgins-Biddle, the executive director of the Connecticut Alcohol and Drug Abuse Commission. Last year alone, the Government funneled more than 70 percent of the budget for the drug abuse problem into law enforcement and interdiction, he said.
"If you figure in inflation, the price of cocaine has actually declined since the war on drugs began," Dr. Higgins-Biddle said. "The supply from outside the country has not been restricted, which means that the Federal Government has poured about $72 billion down the drain."
Though studies have shown that the most effective way to curb drug abuse lies in prevention, he added, those programs receive the least financing.
As drug abuse continues to rise, educators and drug counselors have seen a decline in use by young people. This is because of the integration of a drug education curriculum into the state school system beginning in 1985 and several regional drug prevention projects aimed primarily at teen-agers, the experts say.
Despite such progress, the state spent about $17 million on drug prevention efforts last year, while about $80 million went toward the treatment of substance abusers, who did not carry medical insurance, Dr. Higgins-Biddle said. Yet, there is little financing available for research to determine which program are the most effective.
 
Two-Month Waiting Lists
 This year, he added, the Connecticut Alcohol and Drug Abuse Commission plans to spend $2 million on treatment centers for women and hopes to expand services for the Hispanic population. Even so, drug abuse counselors say there are far too few services to treat the number of addicts who need help. As it stands, the counselors said, many treatment centers have a waiting list of up to two months or more making it difficult for someone abusing drugs to sustain the momentum to get help.
"There's so many barriers along the way," said Dominick Maldonado, a community health worker with the AIDS Needle Exchange Program in New Haven. "It's like a set-up for the addict."
Dr. Henry Blansfield, a semi-retired general practitioner and drug researcher in Danbury, said that the "war on drugs" has also fueled the public's negative perception of drug addicts, which has created additional roadblocks. Instead of being treated compassionately as an illness, he said, substance abuse continues to be viewed as a moral lapse in character, in most instances curable by imprisonment.
 
Rampant 'Addictophobia'
 "Addictophobia is rampant," he said. And few people, including doctors and counselors, understand the physiological, psychological and social mire of drug addiction that often causes a person to relapse time and time again, he said.
This many times translates into ineffective treatment and the mental abuse of addicts, he said. For example, methadone programs are rarely monitored and addicts often complain of inconsistent policies and the practice of using dosage to control and manipulate behavior, he said.
Next month in Washington, D.C., he will lead a workshop at the annual conference of the Drug Policy Foundation to discuss the impact that laws and treatment program policies have on the lives of addicts.
Joining Dr. Blansfield will be the artist who is in the methadone program in New Haven. In a recent interview at his studio apartment, he said he felt victimized by the program's harsh policies and referred to them as dehumanizing. He said that few addicts spoke out about the problems they encountered in the programs because they were too beaten down by their addictions to fight.
"Besides," he added, "nobody believes an addict. We're the scumbags of the world."
He said he started drinking and taking drugs as a teen-ager; his father, an alcoholic, died when he was 12. At 15 he dropped out of school and joined a motorcycle gang. Three years later, while his mother was dying of breast cancer and was in and out of the hospital, he said he became addicted to heroin.
In 1968 he became suicidal and started thinking of ways to get money so he could leave Stamford, he said. Soon after, he walked into a Stamford bank with his finger in his coat pocket pointed like a gun, held up a teller and walked out with $8,000. The next day he turned himself in to the police and was later sentenced to serve 10 years in the Danbury Federal Correctional Institution.
In those days treatment programs were scarce, he said, and while awaited sentencing, "I kicked cold turkey in the Whalley Avenue jail in the same room with a bunch of other junkies."
For several years after his release in 1971 he ran a print shop and studied at an art school where he began developing his Chinese brush style of painting, a technique that requires intense concentration and agility. In the early 1980's he began snorting cocaine, he said, initially to relieve the pain of stomach ulcers. But for the next six years the drug became the focus of his life, and his art work and relationships suffered. As an attempt to wean himself from cocaine, he began taking six to nine tranquilizers a day along with drinking a six-pack of beer. "I couldn't sleep, I couldn't think straight, it was a nightmare," he said.
Several drug treatment agencies told him that because of his multiple addictions they could not detoxify him. Instead, the drug abuse counselors advised him to go on methadone in 1988.
"No one can tell me that addicts do drugs for fun," said the artist, who also teaches aikido, a martial art. "You're risking your job, family and reputation for fun? Give me a break." 
Over all, only about half those who complete a treatment program of any sort are drug- or alcohol-free a year later, according to studies by the National Institute of Drug Abuse. And 10 to 20 percent of those who stay clean for a year can be expected to relapse in the next two to five years.
One of the focuses of the Rushford Center, a drug treatment and drug prevention center in Middletown, is helping clients prevent relapse, a complex process that often begins long before someone returns to drugs or alcohol.
One 35-year-old man went through three relapses in as many treatment programs before coming to Rushford a year and a half ago. After going through detoxification and an intensive 12-day program, he is now part of the center's long-term residential program that requires him to work outside and attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.
The man, who is a welder, said he started abusing drugs in high school and took his college entrance exams on L.S.D. "I knew I was an alcoholic and drug addict by the time I was 20," he said. At one point, apart from occasionally smoking marijuana, he said he had been drug- and alcohol-free for eight years. During that time, his wife worked at a package store and the couple kept a fully stocked bar at home. But while he and his wife were going through divorce proceedings in 1988, he said he decided one evening to take a drink of scotch. "I killed the whole quart in that one night," he said. "Within six months I was back into everything but heroin." He said he is realistic and he realized that his addiction is an illness and that he can no longer say he will never again abuse drugs or alcohol.
 
'Prod You and Prod You'
 He described the sensation of relapsing: "It's like having someone that you really hate stand there and prod you and prod you. Sooner or later they get you to the point where you have to lash out."
Drug counselors point to other contributors to the surge in substance abuse, like the psychological effects of the poor economy and savvier marketing tactics by the illicit drug industry.
Such marketing strategies began with the introduction of crack cocaine, which started out of a pilot project in the Bahamas before it was marketed in the United States in 1985. Nowadays drug dealers can buy prepackaged heroin powder in small wax envelopes that sell for $20 apiece and are stamped with brand names like He Man and China White. Those who counsel drug addicts said that consumers of the drugs assume that the heroin is reliable because of the brand name, when, in fact, the quality has actually gotten worse. Other product innovations include heroin that can be smoked or snorted and coldshake, a heroin mixed with water that does not need to be boiled before it is injected.
Dr. Higgins-Biddle said that because there were simply not enough resources to care for the numbers of substance abusers in Connecticut, that his only alternative was to stop the problem before it begins by expanding community-based prevention programs.
"The story of addiction is denial and blame," he said. "Socially we've all behaved the same way an addict behaves. So it's not just those 45,000 to 60,000 citizens out there each year who need treatment. We're all part of the problem. And it's all of us who have to change."

HEADLINE: Making a Difference;
Supercomputer Maverick

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
When she founded the Thinking Machines Corporation here in 1983, Sheryl L. Handler was an unlikely candidate to become a major figure in the highly technical field of supercomputers. Ms. Handler had spent the past dozen years running her own economic development consulting firm and while she had a doctorate from M.I.T. it was in urban planning, not computer science.
But Ms. Handler, 45 years old, has spent most of her professional life ignoring preconceived notions about business. In Thinking Machines, the country's second-largest supercomputer maker, behind Cray Research, she has built an offbeat but disciplined organization. 
 Ms. Handler has been somewhat of a mystery figure in the esoteric world of supercomputers, preferring to remain in the background as Danny Hillis, the company's chief scientist, has taken on the role of corporate frontman. "I prefer that the focus be on the company, not on me," she said in a rare interview last week as Thinking Machines unveiled its latest computer, a system selling for under $1 million.
Ms. Handler's concept for Thinking Machines was to bring together experts from a variety of backgrounds to create a new advanced computer.
With little more than a company name, Ms. Handler recruited such diverse talents as physicist Richard Feynman, artificial intelligence guru Marvin Minsky and computer scientist Jack Schwartz.
The key recruit turned out to be Mr. Hillis, a young computer genius and one of Mr. Minsky's graduate students at M.I.T. Mr. Hillis wanted to build a super-fast, high-performance computer that ran thousands of microprocessors simultaneously to solve a problem. The concept was called massively parallel processing.
Despite contrasting personalities, Ms. Handler and Mr. Hillis built the new venture with miraculous speed. Their result, the Connection Machine, which used 64,000 microprocessors, was designed, built and introduced in three years.
Since then, the still-privately held Thinking Machines has grown to nearly $100 million in revenue and 600 employees and has sold more than 100 of its computers.
Analysts who praise Thinking Machines for being at the leading edge of high-performance computing warn that Ms. Handler faces her biggest challenge now as competitive and economic pressures are making sales of the multimillion-dollar machines even tougher.

HEADLINE: Medical Center Seeks Hospital Partners

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: VALHALLA

 BODY:
FIGHTING rising costs and competition from hospitals in the New York City area and also trying to address pressing new public health concerns, the Westchester County Medical Center here is seeking affiliations with other hospitals. The move, administrators say, may be the only way some smaller health-care institutions in the region will be able to survive.
"It is an idea whose time has finally come, because hospitals are really feeling the pressure these days," said Westchester's Hospitals Commissioner, Mack L. Carter Jr., who is behind the drive to forge such alliances with four or more regional health-care institutions. 
 Mr. Carter would not name the hospitals that the Medical Center, which has more than 1,000 beds, is negotiating with, but he did say he hopes to have the first alliance in place by Jan. 1, or possibly sooner.
 
A New Nationwide Trend
 Earlier this year, the Community Hospital at Dobbs Ferry, facing a budget deficit of $1.25 million this year, announced that it was forming an alliance with the Phelps Memorial Hospital Center in North Tarrytown. The alliance, which enables Phelps to extend its patient base into the southern tier of the county, was the first of its kind in Westchester and at the forefront of a new trend in health care taking place throughout the United States, hospital administrators said.
For the Medical Center, which is affiliated with New York Medical College here, cooperative agreements with other hospitals would allow it to specialize further and grow as an acute-care and teaching institution. It is the only public hospital and the only trauma center in a seven-county region north of New York City that can treat certain types of high-risk patients. Although Nyack Hospital in Rockland County has a trauma center, the hospital is not considered a tertiary-care center -- one that can handle the most acutely ill patients.
The County Medical Center's 637-bed main hospital includes a burn center, neonatal and pediatric intensive-care units and a cardiac center for both pediatric and adult open-heart surgery. It also has a helicopter to transport trauma victims to the center.
With admissions almost tripling to 21,500 from 7,300 in the 15 years since the Medical Center opened here at the site of an old county-run almshouse, overcrowding has become a problem, and as Mr. Carter said, "How do you turn patients away?"
"You can't," the Hospitals Commissioner said, "unless you have someplace to refer them to."
 
Referral Network Proposed
 During the same period that the Medical Center has seen admissions rise, many community hospitals have been struggling to fill beds. Referring patients who do not need tertiary care to affiliated hospitals, administrators said, could benefit both the smaller hospitals, which need more patients, and the Medical Center.
In one sense, the growth of the Westchester County Medical Center in recent years might be viewed as an infringement on local community hospitals because of the competition for patients, said Arthur E. Weintraub, president of the Northern Metropolitan Hospital Association, a nonprofit advocacy organization in Newburgh, representing 40 hospitals in Westchester, Rockland, Dutchess, Orange, Sullivan, Ulster and Putnam Counties.
But because the most serious competition to local hospitals comes from health-care institutions in New York City, which are trying to attract more patients from Westchester and surrounding counties, a strong referral network among allied hospitals could keep business in the region.
"It has become a very competitive and, at times, contentious marketplace," Mr. Weintraub said.
 
'Everyone's in a Squeeze'
 In a best-case scenario, such local alliances would enable smaller hospitals in the Hudson Valley region to evolve into specialty-care centers for cardiac catheterization, renal dialysis and some types of orthopedics and add child-and-maternal health centers. Another goal for the Medical Center is the establishment of at least one other trauma center like the one in Nyack.
At the very least, it may mean that some of those hospitals -- which have served their communities for many years and now find themselves struggling to make ends meet -- will not have to close their doors.
"Everyone's in a squeeze, but especially the smaller hospitals," Mr. Weintraub said. "They can ill afford to duplicate services. It doesn't make sense to do open-heart surgery on every street corner, so what we're talking about is a more sensible allocation of resources."
As hospitals look for ways to meet increased costs of doing business and to compete for patients, they are also having to meet the new demands of changing technologies.
Affiliations would allow training in new surgical procedures by the Medical Center's staff of doctors in smaller hospitals and could result in a regional system that works as a unit and "fills a lot of niches in health care for residents here," said Kathleen G. Savolt, director of strategic planning for the Medical Center.
"There is a whole array of new non-invasive surgical procedures, drug therapies and clot-busting drugs," she said. "And those are not all tertiary-care activities. The smaller hospitals can learn to do them."
The concept of alliances is not a new one but one that has "taken on a sense of urgency and bubbled up again," Mr. Weintraub said, not only because of competition from large city hospitals but also because continuing reductions in Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements and cutbacks in insurance coverage are driving up hospital costs.
"There have been some rude wake-up calls for the health-care system in recent years," Mr. Weintraub said.
Hospitals have also been faced with what administrators call "social ills" like drug and alcohol abuse, cocaine-addicted babies, urban violence, homelessness and AIDS.
Those problems, the administrators said, are often associated with patients who tend to be sicker and who are uninsured, which further strains hospital resources.
Moreover, the recession has left many people out of work and without health insurance, and now about 11 percent of Westchester's 94,000 residents have no health insurance, according to statistics from the Northern Metropolitan Hospital Association. Nationwide, 12 to 15 percent of the population is uninsured.
 
A More Businesslike Approach
 Because of pressures on the health-care system and competition not only from metropolitan hospitals but also from an increasing number of private out-patient surgical centers, many hospital administrators say there is a growing need for their institutions to take a cue from the corporate sector -- to adopt a more nuts-and-bolts business approach and become, as one administrator said, "more user-friendly."
Although some health-care professionals "cringe at these business terms," Ms. Savolt said, "let's get real. We're talking about many of the same things as the corporate sector -- consumers and what health care has become today, a big business."
At the White Plains Hospital Center, Jon B. Schandler, president and chief executive officer, said: "There has definitely been an attitude change on the part of the health-care consumer. They're getting more demanding. They're asking more questions, and they want more control over what happens to them."
Ms. Savolt cited the "very fragmented" array of health services in Westchester and said: "For the consumer trying to navigate that system and trying to decipher where to go and how to get what they need, it's very confusing. Something has to change here or they are going to go elsewhere."

HEADLINE: The Executive Life;
In Hollywood, Only the Studio Jet Will Do

BYLINE: By Anne Thompson; Anne Thompson is a Los Angeles-based writer.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
Hollywood may be feeling the recession, but not when it comes to travel perks. The big studios are making progress in the battle against escalating production and marketing costs, but as far as air travel goes, it's strictly status quo.
Take the most conspicuous luxury in the studio travel arsenal, the corporate jet. The Sony Corporation boasts an entire aviation division, which makes its international fleet of corporate jets available to all divisions, says Sony spokesman Bob Zito. "We have two Falcons based on the West Coast." 
 Time-Warner also maintains what one envious rival described as an "air force." One of the jets is housed in L.A. for Warner Brothers' use.
MCA/Universal, Paramount, Disney and 20th Century Fox all own at least one corporate plane, each of which costs upward of $12 million and seats about a dozen.
MCA's chairman, Lew Wasserman, never approved of private jets, which can cost up to $1 million a year to maintain. But three years ago, MCA came around to buying one. "Other studios were using their planes as a perk for talent," explained one senior Universal executive, who admits a plane is useful for wooing stars like Arnold Schwarzenegger.
A studio doesn't hesitate to use its planes to curry favor with a star. "Redford and Streisand are always flying them everywhere," said one Columbia Pictures executive. "Once you have a jet you want to use it; you want to write it off. It's an expensive asset that depreciates." Warner sends its favorite stars by private jet to studio-owned vacation hideaways in Acapulco and Aspen. And Universal paid for the use of Tom Cruise's own plane for his round-the-world tour promoting the film "Far and Away."
Joe Roth, 20th Century Fox's motion picture division chairman, ferried his retinue of executives and talent to the annual ShoWest convention in Las Vegas last February on Fox's Gulfstream 2, which was sold to Barry Diller, its main passenger, when he left the studio. (Rupert Murdoch, the globe-trotting chairman of Fox's parent, the News Corporation, has a Gulfstream 3 of his own.)
While a group of mid-level executives may tag along with their bosses on the corporate jet for a quick turnaround meeting or research preview, most of the time they board commercial carriers. The industry norm (usually dictated by contract) for all executives above the vice president level is still strictly first-class travel -- but only on flights lasting more than two hours. The only option out of range even for Hollywood executives is the trans-Atlantic Concorde, which requires changing planes in New York (no time saved there) and is simply too, too expensive.
Among constant travelers between the two coasts, the popular favorite is the financier Kirk Kerkorian's airline, MGM Grand, which boasts a serene separate terminal and luxury accommodations. The first-class cabin has plush chairs with tables; in "coach," two peach-colored leather seats on each side of the aisle are separated by a a small video screen. The coach is considered equivalent to first class on other airlines: flight attendants spread white-linen tablecloths, offer menus and free booze, and fill the cabin with the aroma of cookies baked in flight.
Even the most conscientious executives find deluxe travel hard to resist. While Evian water is the favored in-flight drink, Kurt Woolner, a partner for the movie-budget insurer Film Finances, fondly recalls imbibing one too many glasses of the Niebaum Coppola Rubicon (from film maker Francis Ford Coppola's Napa Valley vineyard) during one MGM Grand return flight from New York.
Miramax Pictures has negotiated a deal with MGM Grand, which Russell Schwartz, a former Miramax employee who's now president of rival distributor Gramercy Pictures, would like to see duplicated at his new company. In the meantime, Mr. Schwartz uses his T.W.A. gold card, which bumps business-class tickets up to first class. Another advantage of commercial carriers, points out one producer, is accruing frequent-flier miles.
The main justification executives give for first-class travel is that they get more work done. "For a lot of guys it's just another place to have an office," said one Disney executive. "You get on the plane with a satchel full of work and write memos and get in the car and go to the hotel and get back on the phone."
According to one agent at Creative Artists Agency, "first class is a great place to read scripts." At C.A.A., he reported, junior agents generally fly coach unless they're with their boss. "I will not fly in a different class than an associate of mine," he states firmly. "What class you fly depends on how rough the trip is. It might be a one-day turnaround. It's a business thing, not a status thing."
Another reason that top Hollywood executives continue to fly so well is to maintain their image and status. And besides, "the big companies get into this mentality that everyone is taking advantage of the system," said one prominent talent agent. "Most business people in America fly business or first. It's part of the compensation package."
Yet there are some signs of increasing restraint. On their frequent trans-Pacific flights to Asia, Film Finances executives save many dollars by flying business class. One producer who used to run a studio film division reports that "those involved in making movies for a budget end up in business class if they are lucky." On his last picture, the producer persuaded his entire non-star cast and crew to fly coach. Steve Perani, president of the advertising agency Poetic Justice, reports that the studios will no longer reimburse first-class tickets: "They want us comfortable but not indulged."

HEADLINE: WORLD SERIES;
For Baseball, the Worst of Times May Come After the Best of Seven

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
October heroics have a way of wiping from memory even the most rancorous disputes that can tarnish a baseball season. But this year more than most, public and private battles over such issues as Japanese ownership, the powers of the commissioner, National League realignment and escalating economic problems have detracted from developments on the field.
Baseball reached the showcase part of its calendar with the start of the World Series on Saturday night in Atlanta. But once the Braves and the Toronto Blue Jays conclude the Series in the next week, the business side of baseball's dual personality will again take the forefront, coloring the public image of the game and perhaps altering significantly the way it is administered. 
 Among the major issues baseball officials will confront are these:
*Economic problems: According to the club owners, this is the No. 1 concern. The escalation of payrolls has produced a $1 million average player salary that owners say has contributed heavily to financial distress. Television revenue under the current hefty contract -- $401 million will be paid in 1993 -- is expected to decline precipitously when that pact expires after next season. Attendance was down 1.6 percent over all in 1992, and 18 of the 28 teams suffered attendance losses. And a recent Gallup Poll showed baseball continues to lag behind football -- by almost two to one -- as America's favorite sport to watch.
*Labor problems: The potential volatility of the labor situation could lead to a lockout by the owners next spring, and possibly the cancellation of some, or all, of the 1993 season.
*Organizational and image problems: In the wake of the forced, and messy, resignation of Commissioner Fay Vincent last month, baseball is expected to restructure its central office; a commissionership with reduced powers is likely. Squabbling and lawsuits have become almost routine and have tarnished the sport's reputation.
For the immediate future, the baseball fan can wonder whether next season will start on time, or at all. Fans may also see a change in how, and how often, baseball is presented on television. And changing economics are likely to affect the makeup of their favorite teams. For example, the Oakland A's post-season roster included 13 free agents, some of whom will not be re-signed, and some of whom will depart. So the core of the team that won the American League West title four of the last five years is likely to splinter and relocate elsewhere.
 
A Bottom Line In Middle of Field
 According to almost every owner or other management official, finances head the list of problems.
"Clearly, the economic problems are the major problems facing this industry," said Bud Selig, owner of the Milwaukee Brewers and the man in charge of the major leagues since Vincent's resignation. "We've come to a moment where, I believe, there's a significant problem on the expense side. I think in the past we've all taken for granted that revenues would just keep on increasing. I don't know that any reasonable person can say that anymore."
A recently completed accounting report based on information provided by the clubs showed operating revenues rose from $1.33 billion in 1990 to $1.54 billion in 1991. Industrywide operating profits, however, dropped from $143 million to $87 million.
This year, major league officials said, citing information gathered from all of the clubs, the industry essentially will break even, even though revenues again increased, perhaps to $1.64 billion. Officials project a loss for 1993 and, one said, "a disaster" for 1994, the first year of a national television package yet to be negotiated.
The culprit for the deteriorating economy, owners cry in unison, is player salaries.
"We need a new player-compensation system that reflects the economy we live in," Selig said in a telephone interview. "That's where all our energies have to be directed, how we can get a new player-compensation system."
Donald Fehr, head of the Major League Baseball Players Association, has always been skeptical of the owners' financial reports. Not only did he reject the latest dire predictions, which he said he has heard before, but he also questioned the singling out of player salaries.
"When people cry doom and gloom," Fehr said, "it suggests to me their motives aren't to talk about the state of baseball but to set the stage for some new bargaining venture, with the networks or the players or whomever.
"I have been here for 15 years. I have never heard anybody with the sole exception of Peter Ueberroth, when he wanted to look good, say that things were good. What astonishes me is the pervasive notion that the natural and only recourse to solve the problem is to ask for subsidies from the employees. They have to get past that."
Based on the owners' own figures, major league player costs in 1991 amounted to $730 million, or 47 percent of the owners' revenue.
Player salaries, however they are approached, will be the key element in the next round of negotiations between the union and the clubs. The existing labor contract expires after the 1993 season, but either side can reopen it by Dec. 11.
Richard Ravitch, the clubs' chief labor executive, met with groups of owners in Los Angeles and New York in recent weeks discussing the pluses and minuses of reopening. Ravitch initially said he needed the support of three-fourths of the clubs to take that fateful step, but as a result of the meetings that standard was changed to a majority.
The prevailing belief has been that the owners would opt to reopen, but some owners have said recently that too many will be opposed to that move and it won't happen, thus preserving the 1993 season. In fact, there has even been talk that one or more owners might go to court to try to block an effort to reopen the contract.
These owners have learned that tactic from the Tribune Company, the owner of the Chicago Cubs, which in July gained a preliminary injunction in United States District Court in Chicago blocking Vincent's order realigning the National League. Vincent resigned before his appeal of the injunction could be heard, and the owners' executive council, with Selig as chairman, then rescinded the original realignment order.
Owners opposed to reopening the labor agreement do not favor a lockout next spring, which is generally believed to be Part 2 of the labor strategy. Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox, one of the most outspoken and influential owners, has said the owners will shut down the game for a year if necessary. One of the major reasons for Vincent's ouster was the perception by Reinsdorf and others that Vincent was too accommodating to the players union. Now, hard-line owners are insisting that a tough negotiating stance is essential.
 
It Could Be Time To Try On a Cap
 Whether the next negotiations occur sooner or later, the clubs most likely will try to persuade the players to accept a revenue-participation plan with some sort of overall cap on team salaries, such as the National Basketball Association has. The result would be that salary costs would be fixed and not subject to a meteoric rise through salary arbitration.
"But," Fehr said, "the salary cap is premised on the notion that a built-in margin over and above player costs ought to be preset in any or all economic circumstances, whether they manage poorly or not."
If the percentage of the clubs' total revenue is high enough -- the N.B.A. uses 53 percent of nearly 100 percent of its revenue in formulating the salary cap -- the players might at least consider the idea. On the other hand, the players, seeing the clubs freely awarding contracts like the one the Chicago Cubs gave Ryne Sandberg for $7.1 million a year, see no compelling reason to change the system.
Furthermore, the players will ask why the wealthier, large-market clubs can't share their revenue with the poorer, small-market clubs. In other words, why shouldn't the clubs help themselves before they ask the players to bail them out?
Steve Greenberg, the deputy commissioner, who formerly represented players in contract negotiations, noted the projected industry losses and said: "Revenue sharing at that point isn't revenue sharing. You're talking about loss sharing."
The teams in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, among others, would fight any effort to play Robin Hood with their riches. If somehow the poorer clubs could get a revenue-sharing plan through, some or all of those richer clubs could simply go to court and block it the way the Cubs blocked realignment.
The owners who sit on the executive council aren't likely to take any action that would offend a substantial number of their fellow owners. It's entirely possible that no future commissioner would either. Vincent did, and he wound up vacationing in Jamaica instead of attending playoff games.
The owners' ouster of Vincent left them with an even poorer image with baseball fans than they had before, Fehr said.
"It will take some time for baseball to recover from the soap opera that played around Fay's getting canned," Fehr said. "It wasn't so much that the commissioner should or shouldn't be fired or be asked to resign, but the way it was done is quite something else. I don't think I've talked to anyone in the past month who didn't say, 'Do those guys know what they're doing?' People who deal with baseball have to wonder if their dealings are going to be tossed around publicly like that."
A committee of owners has been working on the structure of the major leagues' hierarchy and appears headed toward turning the commissioner into a chief executive officer responsible to a board of directors made up of the 28 owners. The commissioner's best-interests-of-baseball powers likely will be diluted because they will be defined for the first time.
Other problems the owners will have to grapple with include television revenue and attendance.
Baseball will receive $401 million, or $15.4 million a club, in television revenue in 1993. No one knows what the owners will get in the upcoming negotiations for a new national television package, but Greenberg said, "There's absolutely no scenario under which our national television revenues don't drop significantly. Some would say precipitously. If it's a $2 million decrease per club, it's not the end of the world. If it's closer to $5 million, which some people are predicting, it's more disastrous."
As for attendance, some attribute the slight decrease to some unusually bad weather in 1992, the absence of division races and the collapse of some teams that had been expected to be contenders.
If the Mets and the Dodgers had played up to expectations and matched their attendance figures of 1991, the major leagues would have drawn nearly half a million more fans in 1992 than 1991 instead of drawing nearly a million fewer.
Greenberg noted that attendance in 1992 was still more than it was two years ago. "In this economy, that's darn good," he said. "But what is troubling is some of the trends we've seen. In a normal year, with relatively flat attendance, you'd expect to see about half the clubs up and half down. But this year, you saw 18 clubs down over last year and only eight that were up. Thirteen clubs were down more than 100,000. That's a trend we have to reverse."
Some baseball personnel people see another trend they'd like to reverse: the dilution of talent. Adding two teams to the National League spreads the available talent even more thinly across 28 clubs. Some officials candidly acknowledge that owners voted to expand only to create a new source of revenue ($95 million from each of the two new franchises).
While baseball officials and owners ponder all of these problems, they can ignore for the moment, but perhaps not forever, the threat of Congressional intrusion into their antitrust exemption.
A Congressional subcomittee was to have held hearings last month but canceled them in light of plans by the Senate Judiciary Committee to conduct hearings early next year. The owners' ouster of Vincent was among the developments that caught the attention of some members of Congress.

HEADLINE: TV Tunes In to New York, Hollywood Style

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, Oct. 18

 BODY:
Forget those decadent "Dallas" and "Dynasty" and "Falcon Crest" rich people of the 1970's and 1980's on television. Forget the never-never world of "Love Boat" and "Fantasy Island" and "Charlie's Angels." What's hot now, at least in television, are the gritty streets and the grittier characters of New York City.
Never before have so many television series been set in New York in a single season -- but with a twist. Most of these shows with New York settings are actually filmed on Los Angeles studio lots because New York (which really means Manhattan to TV executives) is considered simply too expensive.
 
'Stories Can Be Richer'
 Angela Lansbury, the star and executive producer of the venerable "Murder, She Wrote" on CBS, about a mystery writer in Maine who is now teaching part time at a school similar to New York University, said: "The New York locale just allows us to introduce a far wider ethnic diversity than Maine. We can use more black actors, more Latinos, more Asians. The stories can be richer. But we just can't afford to shoot in New York. Mayor Dinkins probably hates us!" 
 New Yorkers have always served as sources of laughter, and even lightning rods, on television. There were Ralph Kramden and Ed Norton, Archie and Edith Bunker. There were cop shows like "Naked City," "NYPD," "The Defenders" and "Kojak." New Yorkers were generally depicted as blue-collar guys (and gals) with Noo Yawwk accents. (There were exceptions, of course, including the enormously popular "The Cosby Show," which took place in Brooklyn Heights.)
But now, the numerous New York shows are strikingly different. They inevitably take place on the East Side and the West Side of Manhattan, not Brooklyn or Queens as in the old days. And the major characters are not Archie Bunker types married to long-suffering women, but Italian and Jewish neurotics involved with gorgeous WASPs from the Midwest. They usually have a melting pot of black and Hispanic friends.
Precisely why so many shows are set in New York is unclear. Grant Tinker, the former chairman of NBC, said each city has its moment on television -- it was Miami and Boston a few years ago -- and now New York is the favored setting. But Bill Haber, a television agent at Creative Artists Agency, and one of the most prominent in Hollywood, said the nation's economic downturn and apparent darker mood are central to the plethora of New York shows.
"In the 1980's the escape we all wanted was pleasant -- 'Love Boat,' 'Fantasy Island,' " Mr. Haber said. "Now it's a time of reality. People want to see some semblance of truth. The comedies now are meaner, edgier. The shows are grittier. New York is a microcosm. It's a canvas upon which everyone is drawing the reality of the 90's."
Paul Reiser, a comedian who grew up in Stuyvesant Town, is one of the creators and stars of "Mad About You," an NBC show about newlyweds setting up an apartment on 12th Street and Fifth Avenue. "A lot of writers come from New York and tend to write what they know," he said. "To set this show in Istanbul -- or, for that matter, Los Angeles -- makes no sense, even though I live in L.A. New York just has a faster, funnier edge."
 
'It's Nuts Out There'
 He added: "It's realistic to start a scene in New York with a guy walking into his apartment, cursing and saying 'Unbelievable! You wouldn't believe what happened to me! A lady dropped dead on the bus. The doorman spit on my shoes.' Whatever. Here in L.A. it's like, 'You're not going to believe what my agent said to me today.' Who cares?"
Jerry Seinfeld, who was born in Brooklyn and attended Queens College, and whose comedy "Seinfeld" is one of the most popular on television, said: "The older shows set in New York, 'That Girl,' 'The Odd Couple,' weren't scary. Now the city is quite scary. It's crazy. It's nuts out there. And most of the time that's the take of these TV shows. New York characters are generally a certain type. You spend a lot of time walking around, going to movies and ordering Chinese food up."
The shows using New York locales -- and New York characters -- include a range of comedies and dramas that generally underline the toughness of living in the city.
These shows include "Love and War," on CBS, about a woman (Susan Dey) who buys a crummy bar after losing her fancy restaurant, and her relationship with a chip-on-the-shoulder newspaper columnist, played by Jay Thomas, who can't find the right mate. ("One relationship lasted slightly longer than Hanukkah," he says). There is also "Mad About You," on NBC, starring Mr. Reiser and Helen Hunt as Manhattan newlyweds, and "Civil Wars," the drama on ABC about Manhattan divorce lawyers, played by Mariel Hemingway, who portrays a well-bred Minnesotan now living in the big town, and Peter Onorati as her solid, down-to-earth partner.
 
More in the Works
 There is also NBC's "Seinfeld," about a comedian and his neighbors on the Upper West Side; "Law & Order," the Emmy Award-winning series on NBC about lawyers and the police, filmed entirely on location in New York; "Here and Now," on NBC starring Malcolm-Jamal Warner as a New York graduate student in psychology struggling to balance college life with work at a Manhattan youth center, taped before an audience at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens; "Room for Two," the ABC show with Linda Lavin as a merry widow who lives in New York near her daughter, a television producer, and "Brooklyn Bridge," the sentimental comedy on CBS about Brooklyn in the 1950's. There's also HBO's series, "Dream On," about a newly divorced Manhattan book editor, played by Brian Benben, coping with the city and a variety of relationships.
Next year, the list of programs set in New York is scheduled to grow. There will be an hourlong police show, still untitled, created by Steven Bochco, one of TV's most successful writer-producers, as well as a series about the TriBeCa area of Manhattan produced by TriStar Television for the Fox Network by Robert DeNiro's company, TriBeCa Productions.
Trade union problems and costs are often cited as reasons for not making more television shows in New York. A rare exception is NBC's acclaimed "Law & Order."
Dick Wolf, creator and one of the executive producers of the show, said that New York's unions, including the Teamsters, which in the past had tangled with production companies, were "enormously helpful" but that costs escalated in the city. "Everything just takes longer," he said.
 
Anything Can Happen
 "If you have to make a move in the middle of the day in Manhattan, it takes much longer than moving from Encino to Sherman Oaks," he said. "Everything costs more. The soda costs more. The food and coffee is more. The gasoline is more."
But Mr. Wolf said that creating the texture of the show without filming it in New York would be virtually impossible. "You can't replace the acting pool -- it's more classically trained, more theater oriented than Los Angeles," he said. "But it's not only the acting. It's the reality of the place. Our bible for the show is the front page of The New York Post. Anything that happens on the planet, short of Somalia, happens in New York. You never have a believability problem in New York. You can say there are pygmy serial killers and they're operating in New York and it would be believable."
Nina Streich, acting director of Mayor David N. Dinkins's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting, said unions were reaching out to production companies. But she said one of the problems of producing situation comedies in New York, before audiences, was the city had fewer stages than Los Angeles to tape shows.
"There's also the proximity to network and company executives in Los Angeles," said Ms. Streich, who added that the Dinkins administration was actively seeking more New York-filmed television programs, if not more situation comedies. Several full-length feature films are now in production or have just completed work in New York.
 
'Only in New York'
 Several shows set in New York but filmed in Los Angeles, like the critically praised "Civil Wars," a courtroom drama about divorce lawyers, are planning to use the city increasingly in their plots.
The Queens-born creator of "Civil Wars," William M. Finkelstein, said one of the lawyers, played by Alan Rosenberg, will meet a woman on the M104 Broadway bus, forget to get her phone number and place an ad in The Village Voice. She responds and they eat dinner in a Chinese restaurant on Mott Street. "This could only happen in New York," said Mr. Finkelstein, who added that the class and social demarcations of the city will also be highlighted in other episodes.
Two of the central characters are Debi Mazar, who plays a brassy secretary from Queens, and her new husband, David Marciano, who plays an artistic bicycle messenger and poet whose family is very wealthy.
"He lives on Avenue B on the Lower East Side and wants to stay there," said Mr. Finkelstein. "She wants to move to Long Island. To him, moving to Long Island is artistic death. To her, living on the Lower East Side is crazy, the last thing in the world she wants. They opt for a co-op on Central Park West -- remember, he's got family money. It's sufficiently middle-class for her, and sufficiently artistic for him."
Of New York, Mr. Finkelstein said: "It's just a great place for stories. You're at a pay phone and you hear a guy breaking up with his wife. You're constantly surrounded by din. If you listen, you gain access to what you ultimately make dramas about."

HEADLINE: Trade Talk Progress Expected

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Ontario, Oct. 18

 BODY:
The United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, met here today with her counterparts from the European Community, Canada and Japan, then said she expected a breakthrough in stalled world trade talks "in a matter of days."
She and the other ministers offered no specific details to back up their optimism or information on how they might overcome the firm statements by France that it would offer no further compromises to break the stalemate. 
 The broad talks aimed at liberalizing world trade, now in their sixth year, have been stalled by a disagreement between the United States and the European Community over farm subsidies, which Washington is trying to curtail sharply.
 
Political Forces
 President Bush, trailing in the opinion polls in his bid for re-election, has been hoping for a global trade agreement that he could point to as evidence of how his Administration is effective overseas and stimulates economic growth.
Asked whether there had been talk of the Nov. 3 election at the meeting this weekend, Canada's Trade Minister, Michael Wilson, said with a grin: "What happens on Nov. 3?"
The strongest opposition to a deal has come from France, where farmers are a potent political force and a general election is scheduled within six months. At last week's European Community meeting in Birmingham, England, France's President, Francois Mitterrand, appeared unyielding in his opposition to any deal that would require further concessions to Washington.
 
Periodic Meetings
 During the prolonged stalemate, negotiators, trade ministers and national leaders have met periodically and expressed hope or optimism that the impasse could be broken -- with little evident progress.
Still, the expectation that a compromise would be reached "in a matter of days" was the most optimistic statement yet.
The officials meeting here said they expected the breakthrough would come when the United States Secretary of Agriculture, Edward Madigan, meets with Ray MacSharry, the European Community Agriculture Commissioner. They are expected to meet this week, probably in Washington.
The global negotiations involving 108 countries, known as the Uruguay Round because they began in that nation in 1986, are under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Geneva-based world trade organization.
It was not clear how to reconcile the apparently intractable French position with the optimism shown by the trade ministers at their weekend meeting at an Ontario country estate here called Langdon House, about a 90-minute drive west of Toronto.
Asked about the apparent conflict, Frans Andriessen, the European Community's External Relations Commissioner, referred reporters to the final communique from the Birmingham meeting, which "invited the commission to work within its existing mandate for an early, comprehensive and balanced GATT agreement by the end of the year."
"I think we will be in a position to make a deal within the mandate we have been given," Mr. Andriessen stressed. He noted that Mr. Mitterrand was among the signatories of the Birmingham communique.
 
'Progress Has Been Made'
 Joined by ministers from the United States, Japan and Canada, he told a news conference here that the optimism was "based on the determination to bring things to a good end and secondly the fact that progress has been made in all the sectors concerned."
The community has refused so far to accept deep cuts sought by the United States in payments to growers of wheat, oil seeds, dairy products and other foods. Washington, with support from most other farm exporting nations, contends that the subsidies lead to grave distortions of world trade and impoverish treasuries of rich and poor countries alike.
Mrs. Hills, asked if the European and American farm ministers were about to meet, said Mr. Madigan and Mr. MacSharry had been "in contact," though she added that she was "aware of no meeting that has been firmly scheduled."
 
Seeking a Framework
 The issue now, she said, was whether the major trading nations could "create a framework to agree among ourselves to go to Geneva." The formal negotiations broke off earlier this year, and a return to the multilateral bargaining table would be a sign that the parties believe a full-scale accord is close.
"We're looking for a breakthrough in those issues that have blocked progress to date in a matter of days," Mrs. Hills said, "and that would then take the negotiations to Geneva where other parties must make their contribution."
Mr. Wilson of Canada, the host at Langdon House, said the ministers discussed accelerating the negotiations.
"With the impending conclusion this year, it's important to move expeditiously," he declared. Another sign of the American optimism is a United States decision to hold back on retaliation against the European Community in a six-year old dispute over oil seeds.
The Bush Administration calculates that oil seeds subsidies paid to European farmers cost American and other exporters about $2 billion annually, and under strong Congressional pressure has threatened to retaliate against $1 billion of European exports to the United States.
But Washington has yet to push the reprisal button. "We are weighing our future steps very carefully," Mrs. Hills said. "Quite honestly, we are very much beyond time, but we're trying to look for a solution because a settlement would be in the interests of the U.S. and Europe."

HEADLINE: Deficits Bring More Splits, Less Progress

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., Oct. 16

 BODY:
As if things were not bad enough for the states, counties and cities of the New York City region, the deep recession of the early 1990's is underscoring an unhappy lesson of government: When times are tough, partisan bickering only makes things worse.
"It takes difficult times to bring out the worst political cheap shots," said Robert W. Burchell, a fiscal-policy analyst at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J. Earlier this month, his state laid off 1,500 government workers in the aftermath of a heated partisan dispute and legal battle over lowering the state sales tax. 
 To be sure, political tension is all but inevitable during times of economic hardship, when governments must weigh cutbacks against additional taxes at a time when paychecks are shrinking. Still, a comparison of the response of state and local governments in the region shows that while some are locked in fiscal and political paralysis as the recession lingers, others have made painful progress toward solutions.
While the Connecticut cities of Bridgeport and West Haven are near bankruptcy, New York City's finances are, in some ways, the envy of the region. And while state officials in New Jersey are locked in fiscal warfare, Connecticut's finances appear to have stabilized after a politically bruising overhaul of its state tax code.
"It is clearly the case that tough economic times can disrupt the process of government," said David Viser, a spokesman for Thomas S. Gulotta, the Nassau County Executive. Nassau ranks among the nation's wealthiest suburban enclaves even in times of recession, but it was forced this week to seek $665,000 in new debt just to pay the utility bills at the Nassau County Medical Center.
 
Anger Over Taxes and Cuts
 Nowhere in the region have the politics of austerity come closer to gridlock than here, the Nassau County seat. Partisan infighting began last year when Mr. Gulotta, a Republican who was supported by a majority of the county's Board of Supervisors, anticipated revenue shortfalls and submitted a plan to raise property taxes.
But late last year, fearing anger from taxpayers, Republican supervisors who had been allied with Mr. Gulotta rejected the tax increases and presented him with an ultimatum in the form of a sharply reduced 1992 budget, about $2 billion. That led the county to send out 2,500 layoff notices in January and February.
Inevitably, the partisan bickering became even more heated. Faced with mass demonstrations by county employees, Nassau stopped eliminating jobs by March, and Mr. Gulotta called for a slight increase in a mortgage-recording tax and a smaller increase than had earlier been sought in the property tax.
But no consensus has been reached. Mr. Viser says the county's plan now is to borrow money to pay salaries and other bills until Nov. 1, when it can reshuffle its finances by withdrawing funds from the accounts of some departments and programs to pay the bills of others. "We are in a logjam," he said.
In New Jersey, the layoffs on Oct. 5 continued a heated political fight that began in 1990 when Gov. Jim Florio, a Democrat, took office. Faced with a $600 million deficit in the state's $14 billion-plus budget, he pushed a package of tax increases, including an increase in the state's sales tax, through the Democratic-controlled Legislature.
 
Rollback of Sales Tax
 The new taxes generated enough money to pay off the deficit by last year, but they were wildly unpopular. A public backlash helped to give control of the Legislature to the Republicans, who had affinity for Mr. Florio or his new taxes.
In June, the Legislature rolled back the sales tax from 7 percent to 6 percent. To make up for the anticipated budget shortfall, it ordered the layoffs, and specified that state employees making more than $50,000 a year should be first on the layoff list.
The political dispute escalated into a legal battle, not yet resolved. Although the courts said earlier this month that New Jersey could impose 1,500 layoffs, the state is involved in other suits that challenge the Legislature's power to designate which employees should be cut.
In contrast to New Jersey's continuing turmoil, an even bigger battle over fiscal policy appears to have been resolved in Connecticut. It began in January 1991, when Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. took office. Confronting the prospect of a $250 million state-budget deficit, he pushed a reluctant General Assembly into approving the state's first personal-income tax.
 
Harsh Medicine Has Effect
 The measure met stiff resistance because Connecticut had long prided itself on having no income tax and had benefited in the past by attracting wealthy New York City commuters. But the need for harsh fiscal medicine had become apparent by the end of 1991, with Connecticut in deep recession and its projected deficit soaring.
Now, with the income tax gaining grudging acceptance, the deficit has been eliminated. The state ended its most recent fiscal year on June 30 with a $110 million budget surplus, and a spokesman for Mr. Weicker, Avice Meehan, said the state had accumulated a surplus of $4 million so far this fiscal year.
New York State, meanwhile, broadened its sales tax in 1991 to include taxes on rental cars and some other services and has been forced by the recession and a fiscal squeeze to postpone income-tax cuts that had been approved in 1987. The state's personal-income-tax rate -- now 7.875 percent -- was to have been lowered in successive steps to 7 percent by 1991, state officials said.
Even with the higher tax rate, the state has still had to borrow to pay its bills, continuing a policy that has become routine under the administration of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. Although the state said it had a balanced budget for the fiscal year that ended March 31, it said it would sell bonds to raise the $531 million necessary to pay its bills. The state's budget is $56.5 billion.
 
Municipal Malaise
 Among the most fiscally troubled governments in the region are Bridgeport and West Haven, Conn., each grappling with large budget deficits and under the supervision of state-controlled review boards.
Bridgeport's deficits began piling up in the 1980's and reached a peak with a $58 million shortfall in 1988. The city, with an almost $320 million budget, filed for bankruptcy protection last year but later withdrew its application. Although its finances have improved, Bridgeport reported a $7 million deficit at the end of 1991.
In West Haven, fierce partisan battles between a former Republican Mayor and the City Council led last year to adoption of a budget of about $85 million that far exceeded the city's ability to raise revenues, resulting in a $10 million deficit at the end of 1991.
Among all large government jurisdictions in the region, analysts say New York City has presented its taxpayers with the most welcome surprises over the last year. The administrations of Mayor David N. Dinkins and his predecessor, Edward I. Koch, had made a tradition of vastly overestimating the revenues needed to cover their budgets; as a result, they often ended up reporting surpluses at the end of each fiscal year. But the huge surpluses of prior years had shrunken steeply to a $20 million surplus at the end of the fiscal year ending March 31, 1991.
 
Caution in New York
 By the end of the most recent fiscal year, however, Mr. Dinkins was able to report a $550 million surplus. It came only months after he had announced a freeze on property-tax rates until 1994, promising little or no increase for property owners. Officials are now working on the city's estimated $29.5 billion 1994 fiscal-year budget.
Analysts attributed the city's surplus to unexpected success in cutting costs through a combination of layoffs and job cuts through attrition and hiring freezes in the Parks Department, the libraries and other city departments. The city's payroll has been reduced by 10,000 since 1991.
Despite the surpluses, fiscal analysts caution that city's long-term financial status remains precarious.
"The surplus is not a sign of good fiscal health," said Dean Mead, senior research associate for the Citizens Budget Committee, a watchdog group, who added that severe problems that continue to plague New York City's economy may force more spending cuts.
Nonetheless, he added that the swelling balance in the city's bank account over the last year "is a sign that it is doing a good job of reining in the budget."

HEADLINE: Workers Say U.S. Program Took Their Jobs

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DECATURVILLE, Tenn., Oct. 18

 BODY:
The west Tennessee hills are turning red, orange and gold, adding fall color to this ailing town where the most prosperous business is said to be the funeral parlor. Life was never easy here, but it has been a whole lot harder since last year, when the town's biggest employer, a clothing factory, closed and took away 306 jobs from this town of 1,000 people.
But this is not just another recession story about discouraged workers. Instead, it is a story about workers who say they are angry and feel betrayed because of what they have learned since the plant closed: that the Federal Government helped the company move to a new plant in El Salvador through a special subsidy program that is supposed to nurture capitalism in Central America. 
 "I'm not pinching pennies, I'm squeezing them to death," said 46-year-old Lynn Johnson, who was a sewing machine operator at the plant for 25 years. When the plant closed, she was making $300 a week. She has just completed a course to become a licensed practical nurse and says she hopes to get a job on the night shift in a hospital in Jackson, about 60 miles west of here.
 
Ire for Quayle
 Emily Ann Vise, 63, got a $2,500 lump-sum retirement benefit for her 28 years of work at the factory. She is living on a $525-a-month Social Security benefit and $175 of that goes for health insurance. Her husband, James, is a 67-year-old farmer, and he has no retirement plan other than Social Security. "We raise a garden and freeze and can food," Mrs. Vise said.
The way the Decaturville workers lost their jobs was the focus of a segment on the CBS News program "60 Minutes" on Sept. 27 and a source of friction in the Vice-Presidential debate last week when Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, the Democratic candidate, mentioned the town and criticized the Bush Administration for using tax dollars to shift American jobs to other countries. Vice President Dan Quayle dismissed the accusation with a chuckle, and, after giving his rebuttal, said, "That's just totally ridiculous."
The Vice President's response did not play well here in Decaturville. "Quayle was laughing, and we're down here dying," said Brenda Johnson, a secretary with a local government agency. "He really hurt me, and I wish I had been there to stand up and say my piece."
The factory had been the lifeblood of this town since 1961, when the residents contributed to an industrial development fund to convert the burned-out remnants of a school gymnasium. When the town could not persuade companies to look at the factory, they tracked down manufacturers, finally signing up the owners of one clothing company, the Meltzer Brothers, while they were passing through the Nashville Airport in 1961, Decaturville's Mayor, Margaret Alexander, recalled.
 
Factory Was Profitable
 The Meltzer factory evolved into Decaturville Sportswear, a subsidiary of the Marcade Group of New York. And, at its height in the 1970's, the factory employed 1,500 people or about 15 percent of the people in Decatur County.
The plant closed in May 1991 with only seven weeks' notice. Factory officials had always said publicly that the plant was a profitable and high-quality operation that made women's sportswear for the J. C. Penney Company and Sears, Roebuck and Company.
The "60 Minutes" program prompted Congress to enact legislation earlier this month ordering the agency that provided the subsidy to Decaturville Sportswear, the United States Agency for International Development, not to finance any more overseas projects that could result in jobs being lost by Americans. Congress has also asked the General Accounting Office to investigate the program, which has spent more than $1 billion on the program since it was started by the Reagan Administration in 1981.
The agency describes its subsidy program, nicknamed Trade, Not Aid, as a foreign aid program based on the theory that economic development will stabilize Central American governments and ultimately create more consumers for American exports. But critics, like union leaders, say the program has hurt some American workers, particularly those who work in labor-intensive industries like clothing manufacturing, which has lost half a million jobs in the last 12 years.
The subsidy programs have encouraged 58 clothing factories, including Decaturville Sportswear, to close and shift 12,000 jobs to Central America in the last two years, said Charles Kernaghan, executive director of the National Labor Committee for Worker and Human Rights in Central America, which represents 21 labor unions.
The National Labor Committee said the subsidy program provided grants to a trade organization in El Salvador to recruit the Marcade Group. The program also paid for the construction of a $5 million manufacturing plant and provided low-interest loans for the company's costs of starting up and $1.1 million in insurance, the Labor Committee says, adding that the new factory did the same work that was done by the plant here.
El Salvador also exempted the company from corporate taxes and shipping duties, the Labor Committee says. The group also says the current hourly wage for apparel workers in that country is about 45 cents an hour, while most apparel workers in the United States start at the minimum wage of $4.25 an hour.
Marcade officials did not return telephone calls. But officials from the development agency asserted that there was no connection between the closing of Decaturville Sportswear and the expansion of manufacturing in El Salvador by another subsidiary of Marcade.
An agency spokesman, Kelly J. Presta, said on Friday, "The only relationship between these two companies is that they were acquired by the same holding company."
But the residents of Decaturville see it differently. "The bottom line is that the Government used our tax dollars to take our jobs away from us," said Elicia Jo Stain, 29, an unemployed worker. "It's not fair for the Government to pull something like that."
Decaturville, the county seat of Decatur County, has a single stop sign and five short blocks of brick and concrete block buildings, all but one, a single story high.
 
Loan Delinquencies Double
 When Decaturville Sportswear closed, the unemployment rate for Decatur County shot to more than 20 percent and loan delinquencies at the local bank doubled. "Things are not that good in good times, but it's devastating when you lose your major employer," said James A. England, president of Decatur County Bank.
The laid-off apparel workers have been receiving about $125 a week in unemployment benefits, and the benefits are about to expire, leaving only welfare as an option for many.
People are discouraged, but they are determined to keep the town afloat. Last year, as the factory and then some shops closed, Mac Johnson, Brenda Johnson's husband, and five other Decaturville residents invested $125,000 to open a general merchandise store called Big D Dollar Store on Main Street. "It's a risky situation, but, hell, it's our town," said Mr. Johnson, who owns an auto parts shop in the town.
The Mayor said she was on the telephone every day looking for new business. "You may hear people say we should turn the lights off and leave Decaturville, but the lights would not go off so long as there is a breath in me," Mrs. Alexander said.

With her were her daughter Charlotte, Cathie Clifton and Margarett Alexander, Mayor of the western Tennessee town. (Rollin A. Riggs for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Independent;
While Perot's Economic Plans Are Detailed, Other Positions Remain Vague

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Oct. 18

 BODY:
When it comes to slashing the Federal deficit and spurring the economy, Ross Perot has cooked up a meaty stew of specific tax increases, spending cuts and tax incentives. But when he moves into the noneconomic areas of public policy, he serves up ideas that might evoke a cry from a past Presidential election: Where's the beef?
As specific and as bold as Mr. Perot has been on the economy and the deficit in his book, "United We Stand," and in his two 30-minute television presentations, his positions on issues like education, governmental reform, crime and health care have tended to be either vague, not completely worked through, of dubious constitutionality or devoid of any suggestion of how much they might cost or who would pay. Some issues, including affirmative action and gun control, have not been addressed at all. 
 Vagueness is also characteristic of many proposals put forward by President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton, but outside the economic realm, Mr. Perot's ideas tend to seem more nebulous than those of most Presidential candidates because he has taken virtually no questions from reporters or others that might shed more light on his proposals. In at least one area, controlling spiraling health-care costs, Mr. Perot's lack of specificity calls into question whether he could actually achieve his stated goal of balancing the Federal budget in five years.
 
Clear but Incomplete
 On the highly contentious issue of abortion Mr. Perot is very clear. He comes down unequivocally on the side of a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy and for Federal financing of abortions for low-income women.
But while supporting the right to an abortion, Mr. Perot has never commented on limitations like a 24-hour waiting period or parental notification for minors seeking abortions.
The difference between Mr. Perot's specificity on deficit reduction and his tentativeness in other areas reflects the importance he assigns to economic issues. "He had never really formulated positions on what he considered the secondary issues, which was basically everything other than the economy," said Doug Austin, a graduate student at the University of California School of Public Policy who worked on civil rights proposals as part of a task force Mr. Perot hired to help him formulate positions on issues.
 
Issues Development Interrupted
 He and other former members of the task force say they had virtually completed a plan to shrink the deficit but had not finished work in other areas when the Texan dropped out of the race in July.
"We hadn't gotten that far," said John P. White, an Eastman-Kodak vice president who headed the issues staff. "Our focus was to get started on priorities and concentrate on the centerpiece, which was the economics. We were going to get more involved in other issues once we got that out of the way."
Because Mr. Perot's noneconomic platform is a work in progress, some of its features raise questions about his vow of balancing the budget. For example, in the half-hour of television time he bought this weekend, Mr. Perot suggested that $268 billion could be saved by changes in Federal entitlement programs. He said that slightly more than half of those savings, about $141 billion, would come through capping the rising costs of health care, which would result in less money being spent on Medicare and Medicaid.
But Mr. Perot does not provide details on how such savings could be achieved. David Parkhurst, a policy expert who worked on the entitlement section of Mr. Perot's platform, said the $141 billion figure was a goal and represented a 50 percent reduction in the projected increase in health-care costs over five years after discounting for inflation. But "we never got to the point where we could put together a solid health-care plan," said Mr. Parkhurst, a public policy analyst for a Washington law firm.
In his book and in public appearances, Mr. Perot expresses general support for free trade. But like Mr. Clinton, Mr. Perot says he would seek to insure that the North American Free Trade Agreement did not result in the loss of American jobs to Mexico.
 
Similarity in Education Plans
 In education, Mr. Perot's plan is remarkably similar to President Bush's America 2000 proposal. Having pushed through ambitious changes for the Texas school system in the 1980's, Mr. Perot advocates expanding a national program of early childhood education, though he does not say whether it would be open only to low-income children.
He also proposes national tests to measure student progress, more autonomy for schools and opening the certification process so that business people, legal professionals, military personnel or others could become teachers without the normal training.
Siding more closely with President Bush, Mr. Perot advocates allowing parents to choose whether to send their children to public, private or parochial schools; while he does not mention the use of vouchers to pay for this, it seems implicit. Unlike the President, Mr. Perot says pilot programs should be carefully analyzed before a school-choice program is adopted nationwide.
"We won't know if this will work until several states try it on a pilot basis," he says in his book. "The time for debate is after the results are in."
In his book Mr. Perot makes high priorities of changes in both the Government and the way Federal elections are conducted. He has proposed measures like eliminating political action committees, making it illegal for foreign companies or interests to contribute to election campaigns and holding Presidential elections on weekends.
Yet some experts, including the policy analyst who worked on the issue for Mr. Perot, doubt that some of his major proposals are constitutional. In a 1976 case, Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court ruled that PAC contributions could be restricted. But the Justices have never ruled on whether PAC's can be eliminated.
Given the current makeup of the High Court, a number of experts say they believe Justices would find that doing away with PAC's violated the First Amendment's protection of free speech and freedom of association.
"I think the PAC issue would have raised a red flag for the Court," said Mr. Parkhurst, who worked on the issue for Mr. Perot.
 
Many Whats, Few Hows
 Mr. Perot's proposal to outlaw contributions from foreign interests was studied by the Federal Elections Commission two years ago. But the commission's staff determined that it would be difficult to enforce, in part because it would restrict the rights of American employees of foreign-owned businesses that operate in this country.
In the area of crime, Mr. Perot argues for increased emphasis on drug treatment but does not say how it would be financed. He also advocates mandatory drug testing and counseling for all prisoners, parolees and for those on probation, mandatory life sentences without parole for anyone convicted of three violent crimes, and a requirement that any inmate be literate and have a marketable skill before being paroled.
Andrew Wise, an aide to a Republican Texas state legislator and the analyst who worked on Mr. Perot's crime proposals, said the thrust of the candidate's ideas is to reduce the nation's high recidivism rate. But Mr. Wise said that he did not have the opportunity to work through questions like how much Mr. Perot's program would cost, how to get states to implement them, and what would be considered a marketable skill for prison inmates.
"We knew that as we put some of these ideas out for debate, we would have gotten a lot of questions from reporters, and that would have forced us to refine what we said," Mr. Wise said.

HEADLINE: Goodbye, Dime Call?;
25-Cent Toll Sought in Connecticut

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., Oct. 18

 BODY:
When Andy Keleman was growing up in the 60's, his mother would regularly tell him, "When you go out, always take a dime for a phone call."
When Mr. Keleman, a computer consultant from Ridgefield, used a pay phone at the railroad station here, the call still cost a dime. But, under rate increases proposed last week by Southern New England Telephone, the 10-cent phone call in Connecticut would vanish after 39 years into the same nether world as the 5-cent ice-cream cone, the $1 movie ticket and 25-cents-a-gallon gasoline. 
 The proposed price increase to 25 cents, which the phone company is to file with state regulators on Nov. 12, is part of a package intended to increase revenues by $160 million in the next three years. If it takes effect next summer, it will mean that Arkansas will be the only remaining state where local calls of unlimited duration will still cost a dime.
 
New York Went Up in 1984
 In New York State, the cost of a pay-phone call jumped to a quarter from a dime in 1984. New Jersey Bell raised its rate to 20 cents from a dime in 1982. But pay phones not owned by New Jersey Bell may charge more.
Although some users of Connecticut's 25,000 pay telephones say the increase will make little difference, others say that a 150 percent increase is outrageous.
"It bothers me a lot, because I use pay phones frequently and I'll have to keep using them," said Robert Taylor, a Stamford mechanic.
Richard Minio, a recent college graduate from Danielson who does much of his job-hunting via pay telephones, said: "I travel all around the state looking for jobs, and I'm on pay phones all the time. So the additional 15 cents will add up."
Besides the increase for pay-phone calls, Southern New England Telephone is proposing changes in its rates to reduce the difference between what it charges its 1.3 million residential customers and its 563,000 business customers. It would increase most residential rates, and the charge for directory assistance would rise to 40 cents from 24 cents.
 
5.5% in the First Year
 "Business rates are three times as expensive as residential rates now," said William Seekamp, a company spokesman. "We're proposing to close that gap to try to help Connecticut businesses succeed in this tough economy."
Mr. Seekamp said that the specifics had yet to be settled, but regulators said the increases would amount to 5.5 percent in the first year and 12 to 15 percent over three years.
The company, which had a 4.8 percent, $48-million-a-year rate increase in March of 1991, is proposing the increases because it is not earning as much as is permitted under state regulations, Mr. Seekamp said.
"We're significantly under-earning," he said. "The state authorized a level of return on our in-state investment of 11.26 percent and we're currently earning 9.68 percent." He also said that the increase would help cover costs of new equipment.
 
'Why Charge More?'
 But some ask why the company needs to increase its revenues.
"If they're making money already, why charge more?" said Christian Planton of Westport. "It's just another thing you can't do anything about."
The State Department of Public Utility Control, which will hold public hearings on the proposed increases, will evaluate the proposals based on the degree to which the company is investing in "infrastructure modernization" and whether more competition should be permitted, said Louise Rickard, an agency spokeswoman.
However, to many Connecticut residents, the likely demise of the dime phone call signals more than just the inevitable passing of a surprisingly long era of price stability.
"It's losing a tradition," said Mr. Keleman. "It won't mean as much any more to say that you're down to your last dime."

HEADLINE: Seeds of Murder Epidemic: Teen-Age Boys With Guns

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Oct. 18

 BODY:
A new study has found that while the number of adults arrested for murder has declined since 1985, there has been a stunning increase in the number of boys under 18 charged with homicide.
"Murder is plunging to a much younger age group," said James Alan Fox, dean of Northeastern University's College of Criminal Justice and a co-author of the report. "What is so dangerous about this is that a 15-year-old with a gun in his hand is a much more volatile individual than a 40-year-old or even an 18-year-old," Mr. Fox said. 
 The study, by the National Crime Analysis Project at Northeastern University, found that the number of 17-year-olds arrested for murder climbed 121 percent from 1985 through 1991, and the number of 16-year-olds arrested rose 158 percent. But the biggest increase -- 217 percent -- was in the arrest of 15-year-olds. Even the number of arrests of boys 12 and under soared 100 percent in that time.
These figures are the clearest statistical confirmation of what had been just anecdotal evidence, Mr. Fox said.
 
Most Violent Group to Grow
 But even more important, Mr. Fox said, the figures suggest that the United States is on the verge of a vast new epidemic of murder, similar to one in the late 1960's and early 1970's, when the rate of violent crime doubled in five years.
The reason is that because of a decline in the number of babies born in recent years, the proportion of people in the 18- to 24-year-old age bracket, historically the most violence-prone segment of the population, has been declining, he said. "Right now, we have the fewest 18- to 24-year-olds we've had since 1965, but next year they will start to go back up."
"What we've seen in the past few years is nothing compared with what we'll see in the next decade and on into the next century as the resurging adolescent population mixes with changes in our society, our culture and our economy," Mr. Fox said.
In fact, because the percentage of the population age 18 to 24 declined to 10.4 percent in 1991 from 13.2 percent in 1980, the United States received a demographic dividend that should have resulted in a drop in the murder rate, Mr. Fox said. In the late 1970's, he predicted such a decline, but he now admits, "I've got egg on my face."
 
Upsurge Brings Distress
 The arrest rate for murders did decline from 1980 to 1985, as the percentage of young people fell. But since 1985 there has been a 24 percent increase in the homicide rate and a 36 percent increase in overall violent crimes largely because of the unexpected upsurge of violence among young boys, Mr. Fox said.
The report was based on data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Report.
Alfred Blumstein, dean of the John Heinz School of Public Policy and Management at Carnegie-Mellon University and president of the American Society of Criminology, said the new figures were "terribly distressing."
"This should have been a period of improving conditions based on the age shift," he said. "Now the murder rates are likely to grow further."
Mr. Fox, Mr. Blumstein and other experts pointed to a number of reasons for the sharp increase in killings by younger boys, including the drug epidemic among the urban poor, the growing number and firepower of guns, the eroding quality of public schools and the glorification of violence on television and in movies.
 
Breakdown of Families
 Most important, they say, is the continued breakdown of the American family. Mr. Blumstein said many young people are poorly socialized and are more vulnerable to problems like drugs, violence on television, and the easy availability of guns.
"The glorification of violence on television has little effect on most folks, but it has a powerful effect on kids who are poorly socialized," Mr. Blumstein said. "It dehumanizes them and becomes a self-fulfilling process."
Mr. Fox is skeptical of the current vogue of imprisoning people as a solution to crime, noting that the number of people in prison in the United States has doubled in last decade to 1.1 million. "People say, 'Let's just try these kids who kill as adults and lock them up,' " Mr. Fox said.
"But that won't work," he said. "They don't care. They don't think about the consequences, and they don't have a long-term perspective. They face death every day on the street and even at school, so why should they be afraid that maybe the police will catch them and maybe they will be executed?"
 
'Loss of Childhood'
 Marvin Wolfgang, professor of criminology and law at the University of Pennsylvania and director of the school's Sellin Criminology Center, said: "What we're seeing is the loss of childhood. These kids are growing up too fast into the subculture of violence."
"They are learning at an ever-younger age that violence is not only tolerated, but often expected and sometimes required," Professor Wolfgang said. "If you don't respond aggressively to a slur on your mother or your manhood, you're a coward."
Mr. Blumstein said that resolving the problem of younger and younger boys' committing murder would be "a major challenge to the American system of family values. It will take some hard thinking and some radical solutions which we are not doing much about now, so it is reasonable to anticipate that the problem will get worse." Any solution, Mr. Blumstein said, "would require a considerable investment in the socialization process, which we have heretofore left to the family." This would be both expensive and intrusive, and therefore unpopular, he said.
In the Northeastern study, even males in the 21- to 24-year-old segment showed a relatively small increase compared to the younger boys.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans;
Going Their Own Way, Candidates Ignore Bush

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONGMONT, Colo., Oct. 18

 BODY:
More than at any time since 1964, Republican candidates across the nation are putting distance between themselves and their party's Presidential ticket.
They usually explain their failure to mention President Bush, appear with him, or use his picture in their fliers as something dictated by their discerning constituents, who differentiate between Presidential and other races and want the candidates to campaign on their own. But at bottom there is a basic political fear of going down with Mr. Bush as Republicans did 28 years ago with Barry Goldwater and as Democrats did with Jimmy Carter in 1980. 
 An unusually open explanation was given here last week by Terry Considine, a Senate candidate who hardly uses Mr. Bush's name. Jeff Thomas, a reporter for The Longmont Daily Times-Call, said that when Mr. Considine was asked why he did not use Mr. Bush's name, he replied scornfully, "I think George Bush will be our Jimmy Carter."
In Illinois, another flagging Senate candidate, Rich Williamson, debated his opponent, Carol Moseley Braun, the night after the first Presidential debate. He approvingly quoted Ross Perot twice and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas once. He did not quote Mr. Bush.
In Louisville, Ky., a Republican House challenger, Susan Stokes, did not bring up the President in several appearances on Monday. When high school students asked her for whom she would vote, she replied unenthusiastically, "I probably ought to vote for President Bush."
In New York, the two-term Republican Senator, Alfonse M. D'Amato, has been trying for several days to portray his views as close to those of Mr. Clinton. In a debate Saturday with his Democratic opponent, State Attorney General Robert Abrams, Mr. D'Amato scarcely mentioned President Bush, and that only in the final moments.
What these Republicans and others are trying to avoid was demonstrated Thursday in Portland, Ore. The Democratic Senate candidate, Representative Les AuCoin, startled his Republican opponent, Senator Bob Packwood, in a debate Thursday when he asked him, "Are you going to vote for George Bush, and if so, why?"
Mr. Packwood, after a brief pause said he would because "this is a man of decency," whose mistakes on the economy came from listening to bad advice from economists.
Mr. AuCoin pounced: "There you have it. They're teammates."
But Republicans long ago abandoned the idea of campaigning as one big team. All through the spring and early summer, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the No. 2 House Republican, promised that in October all Republican House and Senate candidates would join Mr. Bush on the steps of the Capitol to demonstrate unity and promise to fix things in Congress. The idea has been quietly dropped.
Instead of trips to Washington, politicians are making explanations like the one offered by Dora Kingsley, campaign director for Joan Milke Flores, a House candidate in Southern California. Speaking of Mr. Bush, she said, "In no circumstances have we used his name, his likeness or any campaign themes particular to the Bush-Quayle campaign." She said, "We're running on issues of concern to our local constituents."
Historically, Mr. Bush has had no more political coattails than a golf jacket has. His lonely landslide in 1988 was accompanied by slight losses by his party in the House and Senate, and Republicans lost seats again in 1990. But in neither year did the candidates avoid him.
What is happening now resembles the way Democrats tried to dissociate themselves from Michael S. Dukakis four years ago. As Eddie Mahe, a prominent Republican consultant in Washington put it, his candidates have stopped attacking Mr. Clinton as planning to increase taxes by $154 billion and hanging "support for that tax increase around our opponents' necks." But with Mr. Clinton apparently assured of majorities in Mr. Mahe's candidates' states, the Republicans know that they have to get some of his voters to win and see no sense in offending those Clinton supporters.
 
Some Stand With Bush
 There are some Republicans who volunteer their support for the President. Their North Carolina candidate for governor, Jim Gardner, knows that his party rarely wins statewide if the Presidential ticket does not win big, so he goes out of his way to hail Mr. Bush, as he did Friday in Rocky Mount, crediting him with bringing an end to the Berlin Wall and overseeing the dissolution of the Soviet Union. But some other North Carolina Republicans are less involved. For example, the party's Senate candidate, Lauch Faircloth, was not seen when Vice President Dan Quayle toured the state last week.
Representative Philip M. Crane of Illinois, a very conservative Republican who is no intimate of the President, tells voters in his district that Mr. Bush deserves re-election and lambastes the Democratic candidate as "Slick Willie."
Tommy Hartnett, a Senate candidate in one of Mr. Bush's best states, South Carolina, supports him eagerly.
But except for places where Mr. Bush looks like a sure winner, the degree of Republican support tends to be inversely related to the closeness of a Republican's own race. In Missouri, Senator Christopher S. Bond has kept his distance, concentrating on his own contest. Senator John C. Danforth, who is not running this year, is campaigning for Mr. Bush.
 
Some Direct Criticism
 While most concerned Republicans simply keep quiet about Mr. Bush, some criticize him directly. Representative Wayne T. Gilchrest of Maryland has complained about the Administration's environmental record. Another freshman, Representative Scott L. Klug of Wisconsin, said in a debate last week that he would like to see "George Bush take two steps to the center."
Some Republicans have found heroes to substitute for Mr. Bush. Donna Peterson, a House challenger in Texas, invokes her state's Senator Phil Gramm. In New Hampshire, Gov. Judd Gregg, seeking the Senate seat of retiring Senator Warren B. Rudman, uses Mr. Rudman in television commercials. The candidate's blunt-spoken father, former Gov. Hugh Gregg, speaks caustically of the Bush campaign in the state. "There's nobody in charge," he told The Concord Monitor.
Occasionally Republicans like Senator D'Amato in New York even identify with Mr. Clinton. Mr. Packwood argued in the debate that Mr. Clinton's health-care ideas were closer to his own than to Mr. AuCoin's. Senator Bob Kasten of Wisconsin told The La Crosse Tribune on Friday "I am closer to Bill Clinton than Russ Feingold," his Senate opponent, on the economy and the death penalty.
But generally the tactic is one described by Don Totten, a veteran Republican Party official in Schaumburg, Ill., "I have noticed a number of candidates who have pictures taken with Bush but who have kept them on the shelf."
For example, there is Jennifer Dunn, a former Washington Republican chairman. In her Congressional primary this summer, she used a picture of Mr. Bush in a campaign brochure. No longer. Her campaign manager, John Meyers, said she had not "felt the need to keep using the picture."
But she has not cut all her ties to the White House. Her latest brochure has a picture of Barbara Bush, who, Ms. Dunn says, "represents my view on abortion, that the woman should make the decision."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Issues -- Building and Rebuilding;
While Bush Is Satisfied on Public Works Spending, Opponents Call for More

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18

 BODY:
While Ross Perot and Gov. Bill Clinton both call for increasing public works spending by tens of billions of dollars a year, President Bush insists that he has already done enough to expand Federal investment in what many economists call the foundation of the nation's economy: transportation routes, communications lines, waterworks and the like.
The Administration's commitment to cutting Federal spending and not raising taxes would lock into place the moderate rebuilding program put into effect during the first term. 
 The Clinton program, by contrast, calls for increasing spending on public works by additional $20 billion a year. Some of that money would come from tax increases and the rest from cuts in military spending.
 
A Philosophical Difference
 But the debate over "infrastructure" -- a word that campaign rhetoric traditionally pairs with the adjective "crumbling" -- goes well beyond the most evident question of how much money to spend.
The debate also casts light on a philosophical difference that divides President Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle from Mr. Clinton and his running mate, Senator Al Gore -- a split over shaping the nation's technological future.
The Democrats want to emphasize projects like high-speed intercity trains propelled by magnets, a computerized central nervous system wiring the nation together by fiber optics and pollution-control devices that might create a growth industry out of products designed to satisfy stringent environmental regulations here and abroad. The Republicans, loath to setting a national industrial policy, have only cautiously supported such ideas.
There are also differences about how to balance the Federal Government's role with that of states and private industry, although a close examination shows that the candidates' approaches are more similar in some ways than they are willing to admit as they try to display their differences.
 
Calls to Spend More On Public Works
 "Infrastructure," at its heart, means public works, and about half of the Federal Government's estimated $45 billion annual expenditure in this area is in transportation.
More than a dozen studies in as many years have called for substantial increases in this kind of spending. And an emerging common view is that the nation needs to spend about twice what it has been spending. The bulk of public works expenditures are at the state and local level, but the Federal Government plays a crucial role by providing seed money, matching grants, financing for interstate programs that are too big for local governments and incentives for private partnerships with government.
Public works spending has two important benefits: it creates jobs in the short term, although not immediately; and it enhances economic efficiency by driving down the costs of transportation, spurring growth and productivity over the long haul. Creating jobs gives public works spending considerable appeal in an election year, but economists consider the long-term benefits more important.
When it comes to transportation programs, the Bush Administration, by virtue of its incumbency, can claim to have a detailed prescription already in place. At the same time, Mr. Bush's opponents have not spelled out in much detail what they would do.
The Bush record, paradoxically, includes both new taxes and new spending on transportation. The President raised user fees like taxes on airplane tickets and gasoline to finance programs for air and ground transportation. Mr. Bush now says he would not do that again.
"The President has outlined a plan for transportation investment that Congress has adopted, and the states understand and want to implement," said Transportation Secretary Andrew H. Card Jr., who added that unlike the opposition the Administration has a proven track record.
But Gene Sperling, the Clinton campaign's economic coordinator, said: "If you think everything is fine, in terms of infrastructure maintenance and modernization, then you have your candidate. If you think we need new investment, need to think more to the future, toward the 21st-century equivalent of what highways were to the 20th century, then Bill Clinton is your candidate."
Mr. Card said that even if more money was made available, local governments could not use it quickly. But organizations of city and state leaders have said they have projects worth many billions of dollars ready to go, and only need money to get them started.
"Unless you get considerably more money, you can't do what needs to be done out there," said Francis B. Francois, executive director of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, whose members come from both parties. "We hear Governor Clinton saying we should be doubling expenditures on the highway program. Yeah, that's about right. But the downside of that is, how do you do it, given the resources in the highway trust fund?" That fund collects gasoline-tax revenues and funnels them to the states in the form of transportation grants.
"The kind of action you need is probably the kind of thing that Mr. Perot is talking about," Mr. Francois added. "He says there should be a 10 cent increase in the fuel tax each year. That is the kind of funding we need, and he is the only one who is really talking about it. The reality of doing it is very, very difficult."
 
Increasing Spending, But by How Much?
 Mr. Perot says he would raise $158 billion over five years with gasoline taxes, spending most of it to rebuild highways, build high-tech transportation networks and an advanced telecommunications system. Beyond that, Mr. Perot has said little about the details of his plan.
Mr. Clinton's prescription, while not elaborately spelled out, is simple enough to state. He calls for adding $20 billion a year to the current Federal public works budget, using it not just on transportation but also communications and water projects. (Total Federal outlays for major public physical capital was $46.5 billion in fiscal 1992, including things like military construction, prisons and other Federal buildings, and other construction. Of that, $28 billion went into transportation.)
Mr. Clinton's actions would be somewhat easier than Mr. Perot's to predict, since they would probably include some programs that Senator Gore has backed while in Congress, notably a telecommunications program meant to link the nation's computers.
Mr. Bush's plan also calls for increases in spending, but the Administration points out that the transportation increases are already included over a six-year period by the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, which the Administration helped shepherd through Congress in 1991. (The Administration cannot claim sole authorship of the plan; it was drafted in close consultation with the Democratic Congress.)
That law increases spending to about $151 billion by 1996, and the Administration does not believe in expanding surface transportation spending beyond those levels.
The bill was criticized by some for emphasizing highways over mass transit. But it also won praise because it allowed local governments to shift much of the money from highways to mass transit at their discretion.
And although Democrats have criticized the Administration for not requesting as much money as it might have since the bill establishing and extending transportation programs was enacted, the Administration points out that Congress, in its spending bills, cut the President's budget request even further. That was done because the budget agreement did not permit shifting money from military programs to highways, as some in Congress wanted to do, and as Mr. Clinton has promised.
 
How the Candidates Would Pay for Plans
 The question of how to pay for public works projects helps differentiate the candidates' programs. Mr. Perot is the only one who would favor a big tax increase on gasoline.
The Administration, which generally favors making the users of public works projects pay as much of the costs as possible, agreed to a 5-cent-a-gallon tax increase on gasoline as a way of financing the transportation program now in effect. Future tax increases of this sort have all but been ruled out.
Governor Clinton would continue to use gasoline-tax revenues for highway programs, but his aides say he would not increase the fuel tax further to raise more money for public works.
Rather, the Clinton program envisions paying for rebuilding out of the general pool of tax revenues, which would be expanded mainly by increasing income taxes on people with high incomes and by increasing taxes on foreign corporations doing business in the United States. That has risks for the public works program, which would have to compete as a priority with other programs.
Mr. Clinton also says the savings achieved by his proposal to cut military spending more sharply than President Bush should be diverted to public works spending. He would divert $60 billion over five years in this way.
Economists say that spending on transportation and other public works projects typically creates more jobs than spending on military programs, so Mr. Clinton's proposal should help create jobs. But it is not likely that many people would move directly from, say, an aerospace plant to a bridge project, so the change might still be painful for many.
 
Making Industry More Competitive
 Job creation is just one reason for spending on public works. All the candidates agree that improving the efficiency of transportation, communications and the like will also make American industry more competitive.
One often-cited study says United States industrial productivity would have been 50 percent higher today if the nation had kept investment in highways, bridges and the like at the same level during the last 20 years, instead of allowing them to decline. Others say the cause-and-effect relationship cannot be proven.
According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which keeps data on developed countries, the United States spends a much lower percentage of its gross national product on public works than do other leading industrial nations.
But each of the candidates sees the vision of investing in prosperity through his own ideological filters.
For President Bush, the private sector's role is of crucial importance.
The Administration's national transportation policy emphasized this, encouraging, for example, the wider use of privately financed toll roads to ease traffic congestion. When it endorsed the development of high-speed rail projects in a few places around the country, something the Clinton campaign has effusively praised, it called for research studies but not a huge amount of Federal money. The rail systems would have to pay for themselves and should be run by private operators, the Administration suggested.
Mr. Clinton's camp speaks frequently of using Federal spending to "leverage" private investment, providing money up front for projects that could be financed in part through pension funds, as is suggested by the financier Felix G. Rohatyn. This is an extraordinarily complex proposition, but it has not escaped consideration by the Bush Administration, which under the transportation legislation has convened a commission to analyze just this sort of idea.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "CANDIDATES ON THE ISSUES: Rebuilding America"
 There is a broad consensus among experts that public spending on roads, water works, communications and the like must double. By doing that, the Government could create jobs in the short run, increase future productivity and developing new technologies. President Bush's commitment to reducing Federal spending and avoiding new taxes prevents him from promising big spending increases. Governor Clinton would sharply increase spending, switching military funds to these public programs and using part of the tax increases he has identified for this purpose. Ross Perot says he would steadily increase gasoline taxes to finance public works spending.
 
The Records
In his first term, Mr. Bush agreed to increase gasoline taxes and other fees to pay for investments in transportation. In 1991, the Administration pushed through Congress a bill allocating $151 billion over six years on surface transportation. Although the bill dedicated much of the money to Interstate highway improvements, it also authorized increased spending on mass transit while giving cities and states leeway to choose between highway spending and other forms of transportation.
In Arkansas, Mr. Clinton also increased gasoline taxes to pay for highway programs. His running mate, Senator Albert Gore of Tennessee, has been a leader in Congress in calling for new Federal investment in telecommunications, including a modernized network of computer lines to speed the flow of information around the nation.
 
Prospects
Mr. Bush argues that the program already in place for the next four years is adequate, and that states could not spend more than is being provided even if the Federal budget were increased.
Mr. Clinton believes that cities and states have already identified many worthwhile projects that are ready to go as soon as money is provided.
 
Scorecard
With the advantage of incumbency, Mr. Bush points out that he has already increased spending on transportation programs, which make up the bulk of Federal infrastructure spending. But his Administration has been much less willing to boost Federal spending for other types of public works, such as environmental controls.
Mr. Clinton's ideas are more in tune with those economists who contend that it is important to bolster public-sector investment. But this notion comes at a cost: If Public spending on transportation is increased, the deficit will not be reduced as quickly.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Voters;
AMERICANS SIGN UP IN RECORD NUMBERS TO CAST A BALLOT

BYLINE: By JEFFREY SCHMALZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBUQUERQUE, N.M., Oct. 18

 BODY:
After months of dismissing the Presidential campaign with a mix of cynicism and apathy, Americans have become invigorated by the race, registering to vote in record numbers and clinging to every word of the debates and election coverage.
Throughout the country, election officials say they are swamped by voter registration forms -- most enrolling as Democrats -- as well as by requests for absentee ballots and by their quick return. 
 Here in Bernadillo County, 10,000 people signed up in the last week of voter registration alone. Florida's Hillsboro County, which takes in Tampa, estimates an increase in registration of 60,000 voters since the March primary, more than twice the increase in the same period of the 1988 Presidential election. New Jersey reports the same huge rise over 1988's new registrations, in part because it now allows registration at state motor vehicle offices but mostly because of heightened voter interest.
 
'Overwhelming Response'
 The story is the same in cities and suburbs alike: Los Angeles ran out of its two million absentee ballots and had to print more. New York City has added 613,000 voters, bringing its rolls to 3.2 million, the highest in 20 years. In Snohomish County, Wash., north of Seattle, election officials are too busy even to come to the phone. "We are currently experiencing," a recording says, "an overwhelming response with regard to voter-registration cards and absentee ballots."
The voter interest plays out in other forums as well. On television, the first Presidential debate and the Vice-Presidential debate exceeded the ratings of the debates four years ago. In bookstores, sales are skyrocketing for a book by Ross Perot and another by Gov. Bill Clinton and his running mate, Senator Al Gore, that lay out plans for America's future. Both works are at or near the top of best-seller lists.
"After 20 years of steady voter decline, this is going to be the year when we'll turn it all around," said Pauline Kezer, the Secretary of State in Connecticut, where voter registration ends on Tuesday and is projected to be a record. "People are not coming to our tables mad and saying, 'I don't give a damn.' They're saying, 'Yeah, count me in.' "
Once again, voters are proving wrong the pundits, who had predicted loudly and often that voters' anger and disgust would lead them to pull back this election year, not dive in. Just what accounts for the enthusiasm is not fully clear. But in part, it seems driven by fear.
In interviews with voters around the country, they say they are scared about the economy. And in part, it stems from voters' belief that for the first time in more than a decade, they have a genuine choice between the Republican and the Democrat. Michael S. Dukakis, the 1988 Democratic candidate, is ridiculed in many interviews as a nonentity.
But perhaps the single biggest reason for the voter enthusiasm can be summed up in one name: Ross Perot. Most people say they are not going to vote for him. Yet over and over in interviews they make clear that he has awakened them, poking at their guilt and reminding them that control of the country really is theirs for the taking.
 
The Recently Registered
 "Perot may not be who people are going to vote for," said Fran Nover, the chief deputy clerk who oversees voter registration in Bernadillo County. "But he sure is who they're talking about."
Here on Friday at the Pantry Cafe on Route 66, the lunchtime conversation from table to table of blue- and white-collar workers was of politics, with some diners among those who had recently registered.
"I just got to the point where I lost interest over the years. But we registered two weeks ago," said 35-year-old Nancy Moya, pointing to two co-workers she was having lunch with. "Perot's right. We have to worry about the future. I have a couple of children."
Ms. Moya registered as a Democrat, as did her two friends, Mary Jojola and Patricia Shepard. All three of the women, who work in the business department of a local television station, said they would vote for Mr. Clinton.
Why Clinton? "Because he's young and cute," said a fourth office mate, Lila Trejo, 35.
With that, it was laughter all around.
"No, seriously, we need a change," said Ms. Shepard, 41, who last voted for Jimmy Carter. "There are homeless everywhere."
 
'Bush Doesn't Care'
 Ms. Jojola, 38, agreed. She had once been registered Republican but could not remember when she last voted. She registered two weeks ago as a Democrat. "Bush doesn't care about things here," she said. "He kept looking at his watch in the debate. He was bored."
Indeed, in a signal that does not bode well for President Bush, most of the new registrations throughout the country are Democratic, though they have increased for both parties, as well as for independents. Here in the Albuquerque area, Democratic rolls are up 20 percent, unaffiliated 16 percent and Republican 12 percent. Democrats have always outpaced Republicans in number of registrants here, but with the new registered voters the lead is greater. With 123,000 voters, Democrats now have a registration lead of 30,000 against Republicans, compared with 20,000 earlier in the year.
Polls show Mr. Clinton ahead in New Mexico, a state that has not voted Democratic in a Presidential election since 1964. Based on the return of absentee ballots, turnout on Election Day is expected to surpass 80 percent.
In California, even in Republican strongholds like Orange County, Democrats are outdoing Republicans in the registration of new voters. For the first time in 20 years in California, Democrats have registered more new voters than Republicans have -- albeit, by a small margin. Since June, Democrats have increased a percentage point, to 49 percent of registered voters, while Republicans have fallen a point, to just under 38 percent.
 
Expecting a High Turnout
 In every Presidential election year, voter interest tends to rise as Election Day nears. But this year, the rise has been greater. According to New York Times/CBS News polls, the number of registered voters paying "a lot" of attention to the race rose from 17 percent in January to 54 percent in October -- a figure that is likely to rise still more by Nov. 3. In 1988, the number rose from 13 percent in January to 45 percent just before Election Day.
Although higher registration does not necessarily turn into higher turnout, experts on voter behavior think it will this time. "All the indicators lead me to believe that" voter turnout will be high, said Curtis Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate.
In general, get-out-the vote efforts throughout the country have been extensive this year. "We're up to our knees," said Naomi Bernstein, a spokeswoman for New York City's Board of Elections, where stacks of 30,000 forms await processing. "Everybody is doing a voter-registration drive. Doctors are sending out registration forms with their bills."
Many of the efforts have been nonpartisan. For example, the ABC program "Good Morning America" has repeatedly broadcast deadlines for voter registration. But many others, while officially nonpartisan, have the effect of bringing in more Democratic than Republican voters. MTV, for example, has repeatedly run advertisements urging its viewers -- young, hip and mainly Democratic -- to vote. In the Chicago area, registration drives aimed primarily at blacks have signed up to 250,000 people since March 17.
 
'It's Exciting'
 After being out of influence for 12 years, liberal groups want the Democrats to win so badly that they can taste it, as their intensive registration efforts prove. In San Francisco, one of the country's liberal bastions, election official estimate a phenomenal 95 percent of eligible voters are now registered. Many of the new Democrats around the country are really old Democrats, some of them liberals from as far back as the 1960's, who had simply tuned out politics. Now, it is as if they have awakened from a long sleep.
"We have a lot to catch up on," said Andrew Shows, a 41-year-old art gallery owner here in Albuquerque who recently registered to vote. "The things we wanted to come together for years are coming together now. It's exciting. I feel at one with all the people who want social change."
Republican registration drives have been nowhere near as sweeping as the Democratic ones. Still, many Republicans sense their party under siege and are rallying. "Bush's values are a lot more in line with mine than Clinton's," said Charlie Love, 23, who works making elevators here. "Believe me, I'll vote."
And registration figures are not always what they may seem. Mr. Clinton spoke here recently at the University of New Mexico, where hundreds of students registered to voter. But not all of them are going to vote Democratic. "It looks like it's voting Republican for me," said Rob Haulenbeek, 18. "Clinton didn't say anything when he spoke here. He scares me."
For all the hoopla about the election -- all the talk and interest among voters -- there is little physical sign of it on the streets, except for conversations. In the San Francisco area, lawn signs dot neighborhoods and bumper stickers label cars. But elsewhere those are mostly few and far between, although signs for local elections are everywhere. It is as if the Presidential race this time out is too important to be cheapened by signs.
"This election is on a whole different level," said Anita Lopez, 35, the supervising probation officer at Federal court here. "It's much more serious, I think because of Perot. You get the feeling that this time, it's not a game."

Why? "Because he's young and cute," said Ms. Trejo, 35.; Election officials nationwide say they are swamped by voter registration forms, as well as by requests for absentee ballots. Voters completed absentee ballots at the Bernadillo County voter-registration office in Albuquerque, N.M, where 10,000 people signed up in the last week of voter registration.

HEADLINE: WESTFIELD JOURNAL;
Student Newspaper Finds Bottom Line Is a Hard One

DATELINE: WESTFIELD, N.J.

 BODY:
SADDLED with a $7,700 debt and the weight of a nearly 60-year tradition, the staff of this community's high school newspaper is learning the hard way that even a free press can be expensive.
The Westfield Hi's Eye is one of only a handful of high school newspapers in the country that is published weekly, a distinction compounded by the fact that the paper is entirely student-managed and receives no money from the local school board. 
 But the deficit the four-page tabloid has amassed over the last several years, if not reduced considerably by the end of the year, will mean an end to its weekly publication next fall. The students have been told that to continue weekly publishing, they must raise the money themselves without borrowing from student accounts.
Though cutting back publication would break a revered local tradition, school officials say the change may be necessary to honor another tradition, that of uncensored journalism, which the Westfield students have practiced since the first Hi's Eye was published in 1934.
"I like to say we have a longer history of free press here than in most countries," said the high school's principal, Robert Petix. "Once the school board comes in and gives the money, you can no longer guarantee they won't have an influence over what the students publish."
Of nearly 28,000 public and private high schools in the country, 70 percent publish student newspapers. Of those, fewer than 5 percent publish weekly and most of the rest publish monthly, said Tom Rolnicki, executive director of the National Scholastic Press Association in Minneapolis.
"They're a rare breed and getting rarer," Mr. Rolnicki said, adding that an entirely student-financed newspaper is "especially unusual."
School officials say the Hi's Eye debt reflects the larger problems faced today by small newspapers, many of which are facing cutbacks, redesigns and closings as a result of declining advertising revenue and circulation. In many ways, officials say, the student newspaper is yet another casualty of a troubled economy.
In Westfield, the circulation of Hi's Eye has fallen as the "baby boom" trailed off in the last decade and the school's enrollment fell. The number of students dropped from a high of 2,300 to 1,250, even after the school expanded to include the ninth grade. Now, the newspaper's circulation stands at about 800.
During that time, expenses rose while the advertising rate stayed flat. And the deficit has been passed along for years, always leaving the next class accountable.
"This year, we finally acknowledge the problem," said Lori Chelius, a senior who is one of three editors at The Hi's Eye. "Once we pay it off, we'll work on making sure it doesn't happen again."
School officials believe the newspaper's attempts to erase the debt is as much a part of the students' journalism training as writing editorials.
"In a real newspaper, they would have to pay the debt or close," said the newspaper's faculty adviser, Charles Soriano. "Nobody would bail them out."
Mr. Soriano believes the staff can meet their challenge. "They have pride in this tradition. They know this is something other schools don't have."
This year's goal is to raise $3,000 above the approximately $15,000 required to publish. Money is raised through sponsorships and advertising, which has grown to such an extent that recent issues have only had space for one news story beyond the front page.
The students, who also have plans for fund-raisers like a rake-a-thon, are optimistic. The 28-member Hi's Eye staff, which is drawn from a journalism program at the high school, is propelled by pride in their tradition of aggressive, uncensored journalism.
After attending a statewide Student Press Association meeting last week, Amanda Kong, a junior and one of the three editors this year, said she realized Westfield was doing something unusual.
"It's a really good feeling to see how other papers have a sense of respect for you," Ms. Kong said. As Westfield prepared to publish its seventh edition of the school year last week, she said, other schools in the area had not yet published one.

 BODY:
Even as Gov. Bill Clinton promises a sweeping expansion of health-insurance programs in his Presidential campaign, his own state is cutting health-care benefits for poor people and payments to doctors in its Medicaid program.
To the Bush Administration, the moves reflect a basic incompatibility between what the Arkansas Governor advocates on the campaign trail and what he does as chief executive in Little Rock. 
 To Mr. Clinton, however, Arkansas's struggle to meet the soaring cost of its medical program simply underscores the need for the kind of radical changes in health care that he has proposed for the entire nation.
Arkansas's experience illustrates the agony of many states reeling under the burden of Medicaid, the program for low-income people financed jointly by the Federal Government and the states. The cost of the Arkansas program shot up $207 million this year, to $912 million, as the number of recipients rose 31,958, to a total of 311,015.
When the program ran short of money earlier this year, employees of the state's Department of Human Services were furloughed for five days to alleviate the crisis.
 
New Limits on Payouts
 In other cost-cutting moves this year, Arkansas cut Medicaid payments to doctors and dentists by 20 percent, imposed new limits on prescription drugs, home health care, doctors' visits and other services, and reduced the number of hospital days covered. It also made fewer people eligible by lowering the cutoff level of income -- 33 percent above the poverty level, compared with 85 percent above the poverty level in the past. For example, a family of three can qualify for Medicaid only if its income is below $14,444, while the same family could have earned $20,091 under the old rules.
A confidential memorandum, written in June by Kenny Whitlock, a senior official in the Arkansas Department of Human Services, acknowledged that many of the cuts "will severely impact our most vulnerable clients."
In August, a Federal judge blocked the reduction in Medicaid fees for obstetricians and pediatricians, saying it could irreparably harm pregnant women and young children by curtailing access to medical care. In issuing a preliminary injunction, Judge Susan Webber Wright of the Federal District Court in Little Rock said the new payment rates were so low that Arkansas doctors were quitting Medicaid.
Dr. E. Michael Finan, who works at a clinic in Hot Springs, testified that the cut in payments "forced us to cease rendering prenatal care to Medicaid recipients, leaving hundreds of pregnant women to find the care elsewhere." Nancy C. Chrisman, the administrator of a women's clinic in Jonesboro, said it stopped taking new Medicaid patients for four or five weeks in July and August after the state cut payments for obstetrical care by 20 percent.
Bush Administration officials say the problems of the Medicaid program in Arkansas result, in part, from mismanagement by Governor Clinton. They say he makes the same error on a bigger scale when he underestimates the cost of his proposal to cover 35 million uninsured Americans.
Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, said in August: "Bill Clinton can't even control the Medicaid costs in his own state. Now, the thought of him therefore trying to reform the nation's health-care system is certainly enough to make me sick."
 
State Reflects National Ills
 But Arkansas officials say their woes reflect national problems. President Bush, they say, failed to rein in medical costs, and the number of people on Medicaid soared because of the nation's economic slump.
Moreover, Arkansas officials say it is hypocritical of Federal officials to attack them for trying to balance the state budget when the Federal Government, under Mr. Bush, is running record budget deficits.
"Federal officials have no standing to criticize our fiscal management because their record is much worse," Ray Hanley, director of the Arkansas Medicaid program, said in an interview. "At least we operate under a balanced budget."
States have wide discretion in deciding the scope of Medicaid benefits and setting payment levels, subject to Federal approval. The Bush Administration recently rejected some of Arkansas's new limits on prescription drugs and home health services, saying they would violate a Federal law that guarantees a minimum set of benefits.
As the Democratic candidate for President, Mr. Clinton promises universal coverage: health insurance for all through employers, through groups formed to buy private insurance for nonworkers or through Medicare, the Federal program for the elderly.
 
Need to Control Costs
 Mr. Clinton says the nation cannot afford universal access to health care until it gets health costs under control, and he wants to set an overall limit on health spending, with a separate limit for each state. "That's a prerequisite," said Mr. Hanley, the Arkansas Medicaid director, who added that the Legislature would have to consider a tax increase for Medicaid next year.
Under Federal law, state Medicaid programs must cover certain services like hospital care, doctors' services, X-rays and family planning. States may provide any of more than 30 optional services like prescription drugs, eyeglasses, optometry and dental care.
As part of its cost-cutting campaign, Arkansas recently eliminated many optional services for adults.
Nationwide, Medicaid finances health care for 30 million Americans, including 14 million children. States together pay 43 percent of the program's total cost of more than $127 billion this year. The state share rises with a state's per-capita income and ranges from 20 percent in the poorest state, Mississippi, to 50 percent in the most affluent states.
Arkansas is one of the poorer states. With a median household income of $23,435 in 1991, it ranked 48th among the 50 states, trailed by West Virginia and Mississippi.
A major goal of Medicaid is to increase access to health care for poor people. Medicaid payments are supposed to be high enough to guarantee that care is as available to poor as to the general population.
After receiving testimony from Arkansas residents who had difficulty getting treatment for serious medical problems, Judge Wright concluded that the state appeared to be violating the equal-access requirement.
State officials insist that their actions were legal because no Medicaid recipient was "placed in a life-threatening situation as a direct result of the July 1, 1992, rate reductions."

HEADLINE: Bankers Sour on Economy, but Not Profits

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: BOSTON, Oct. 18

 BODY:
Most of the nation's bankers do not expect the economy to recover sharply in 1993 from its doldrums, but they are bullish about profits next year, according to a poll today of some 1,500 members of the American Bankers Association.
Of the bankers surveyed at the industry's annual meeting here, 78 percent said they expected their regions' economies in 1993 to be stable, with little growth or at most a slight improvement. Only 13 percent expected a strong economy in their regions next year, and 9 percent expected their area's economies to weaken. 
 But asked whether their banks would earn more next year than this year, 59 percent said they would do better, 15 percent said worse and 26 percent saw no change.
At meeting today, the bankers also heard John LaWare, a Federal Reserve Governor, call for a private study on modernizing the nation's banking system to break the long political logjam that has blocked efforts to reform the industry.
His call for a major overhaul of the banking system "before it is too late" was welcome news to bankers who are conducting trench warfare against government regulations.
"We are choking on paperwork," said Alan Tubbs, the association's president and head of the Maquoketa State Bank in Iowa.
The bankers gave Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady a cool reception today as he pledged to prune the industry's regulations. By the end of his 20-minute speech, nearly a third of the audience had left the hall at the Hynes Convention Center in downtown Boston, the site of the four-day annual event, which began Saturday.

HEADLINE: Economic Memo;
Administration Is Playing Blame Game on Recession

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18

 BODY:
In unceremoniously announcing last week that it would dump its three top economic policy makers, the White House tried to lay the blame for the worst four years of growth since the Great Depression on the President's lieutenants.
But economists, Democratic and Republican, liberal and conservative, pin a large chunk of responsibility for the prolonged slump on President Bush and on another set of advisers, his political team, for ducking the tough, politically unpopular decisions that would help restore the economy's health. 
 The three economic officials -- Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady; Richard G. Darman, the budget director, and Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers -- have long insisted that the blame lies elsewhere. They point the finger at Congress, the Federal Reserve, the global slowdown, the debt-plagued consumer, banks refusing to lend and corporations laying off workers.
Despite their protestations that they worked hard to create incentives for growth and to slash the budget deficit, growth has averaged an anemic seven-tenths of 1 percent over the last four years and the deficit soared to a record $320 billion in fiscal 1992.
To be sure, there is no scientific way to assess who deserves how much of the blame for the economy's woes. Certainly there were external factors, like the worldwide slowdown, but, most economists agree, the President, his political team and his economic troika share in the blame.
 
Dropped the Ball
 At many times and in many ways, it is generally agreed, the Bush Administration dropped the ball on the economy. While Secretary Brady, Mr. Darman and Mr. Boskin are awarded high marks in several areas, the Administration often receives low marks for not attacking the deficit as soon as Mr. Bush took office, for never getting an anti-recession plan enacted this year and for not developing and articulating an overall growth strategy until the re-election campaign.
"They could have protected themselves from some of the worst consequences of things happening in the economy, if they had a growth strategy of their own," William Niskanen, president of the conservative Cato Institute and a member of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, said. "But they never put together an overall strategy until the President's speech last month in Detroit."
In essence, Mr. Bush and his economic and political teams are proving victims of their own ideology -- they believe in a hands-off approach to economics.
To all the pleas, advice and recommendations from voters and experts that the Administration needs to take a hands-on approach, Administration officials often respond, "Just what are we supposed to do that won't make matters worse?"
Sometimes it seems Administration officials are so convinced that economic activism will have ill effects that their conviction paralyzes them. Early this year, for example, dozens of prominent economists called on President Bush to embrace a multibillion-dollar pump-priming plan to create jobs and speed growth.
But Administration officials reflexively shudder at such a Keynesian notion, insisting that fiscal stimulus will aggravate the deficit, push up long-term interest rates and be squandered on pork-barrel projects.
In January 1989, the month President Bush took office, he clearly made a big mistake by not attacking the budget deficit with gusto, most economists agree. If he had, they say, then the economy would not be in deep mud today.
Administration officials say Mr. Darman, who was willing to swallow higher taxes, and Mr. Boskin, who backed a flexible freeze on spending, were eager to tackle the deficit early on. But the President, his former chief of staff, John Sununu, and his political advisers quashed the idea.
 
 
'Great Opportunity'
 "When he came into office he was faced with a great opportunity," Barry Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings Institution and an official in the Carter Administration, said. "He had a very strong economy, which is the right time to attack the budget deficit. I fundamentally hold Bush guilty for passing up that opportunity. The game was lost when he made his 'no new taxes' pledge."
Tackling the deficit early on might have prevented the recession that began in the summer of 1990 and at worst would have cushioned it. And that would have enabled the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in 1989 rather than raising them out of fears of economic overheating.
But Mr. Bush did not get serious about the deficit until the middle of 1990, when he was forced into it. But then, the 1990 budget agreement, which cut spending and increased taxes, helped pull down the economy when it was already sliding toward recession.
Droll is the word some critics use when they hear Bush Administration officials say that if only they had not inherited a huge deficit from President Reagan, the economy would be in infinitely better shape today. Such an excuse seems to forget that Mr. Bush signed on to Reaganomics when he was Vice President and ran on a Reaganomics platform in 1988. "He was Vice President back then, and he has to take some responsibility for the terrible mistakes made during the early 1980's," Isabel Sawhill, an economist with the Urban Institute, said.
 
Democratic Flak
 Now, in the heat of the campaign, the Administration faces heavy Democratic flak for hardly lifting a finger to fight the recession, and even some conservatives agree. "I think they deserve some blame for not taking more action to help the economy in 1992," Herbert Stein, who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Nixon, said.
Administration officials insist that they worked vigorously for a growth package, pointing to the plan the President trumpeted in January. That package included a cut in the capital gains tax, an investment tax credit and a tax credit for first-time home buyers.
"We have put forward a growth package that we think will stimulate savings and investment and help entrepreneurial capitalism and small business, but that plan has been stopped by Congress," one senior Treasury official said.
Many critics of the Administration say that package foundered because of the Administration's fixation on a capital gains tax cut. Many Democrats embraced the proposed investment tax credit and home buyers' credit, but they enacted higher taxes on the wealthy to offset the gains a capital gains tax cut would mean for the well-off. The President vetoed the anti-recession package because of that tax increase.
In effect, the Administration's insistence on capital gains tax cuts torpedoed the growth package. But Mr. Bush's political advisers warned him not to jettison the capital gains measure to rescue the package, saying hard-right conservatives, like Representative Newt Gingrich, Republican of Georgia and the minority whip, might mutiny.
Still, Mr. Bush's allegiance to capital gains tax cuts was not enough to prevent many conservatives from castigating his economic policies. Conservative think tanks often said the President talked a good ball game about cutting spending, but acted like a Democrat in letting spending scamper upward. For this, they pin much of the blame on Mr. Darman.
 
'He Hired Them'
 "The only individual more responsible for the economic mess than his three top economic officials was George Bush himself," Edward L. Hudgins, deputy director of economic policy at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research organization, said. "He hired them in the first place, and he kept them on."
Traditionally, the maestro of economic policy is the Treasury Secretary. As a result, many critics say Mr. Brady, more than other economic officials, deserves blame for sins of omission and commission.
One big strike against Mr. Brady was that lacked the charisma of his predecessor, James A. Baker 3d, who became Secretary of State and is now the President's chief of staff. Still, Mr. Brady is widely praised for forging the legislative package to clean up the savings-and-loan mess and for helping bring the third world debt crisis under control.
As for Mr. Boskin, he was the junior member of the policy-making trio. Many economists note that he never had the power of Mr. Sununu or Mr. Darman; Mr. Boskin threatened to resign last year when the President and his political advisers ignored his downbeat readings on the economy, worrying that the President's happy talk made him sound out of touch with Main Street.
Yet however much economists criticize Mr. Brady, Mr. Darman and Mr. Boskin, they sympathize with them, too. "The way these three economic leaders were tossed over the side of the ship was really shameful," Mr. Stein, the Nixon Administration official, said.

HEADLINE: Europe's Blitz on U.S. Earnings

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
As European currencies churned and heads of state squabbled a few weeks ago, the United States calmly stood back, an ocean away from the turmoil.
For America's largest manufacturers, however, the United States now seems like an unsafe haven from European recessions and currency woes. Companies like Ford and I.B.M., which depend heavily on Europe, have begun reporting pinched profits and crimped sales. 
 Many economists and analysts warn that for such companies the worst is yet to come. Most of the major European economies were already in recessions or on the brink before the currency crisis exploded and customers ran for cover, avoiding even purchases they had planned.
"People froze," said David Shulman, chief equity strategist for Salomon Brothers. "Firms could plot it -- it was like falling off a cliff."
 
'People Just Stopped Buying'
 The International Business Machines Corporation, for example, last week blamed a sudden halt in European orders as the prime reason that its third-quarter operating earnings of $86 million came in at only 20 percent of what had been expected.
"I did not anticipate -- and by the way, I think I'm probably in pretty good company -- the effect on business of the enormous currency turmoil that took place in Europe," Frank Metz, the company's senior vice president for finance, told analysts. "People just stopped buying things."
Europe's somewhat unified, somewhat fractured economy is the largest foreign market for American goods, and the principal foreign host of American plants. Many of the best-known companies, the General Motors Corporation among them, in recent years have often been more profitable in Europe than the United States.
Exports, bolstered by a weak dollar that lowers the prices of goods sent abroad, have for much of this year been one of the few sources of United States economic growth. But in August, according to the latest trade figures, American shipments to Europe and the rest of the world were down sharply from the previous month. Lower exports can both retard the recovery and batter some stock prices, Mr. Shulman said.
 
Revising Estimates Downward
 Few economists expect Europe's economy to resume growing before the second half of next year, if then. Among American companies, they say, the makers of automobiles, chemicals, computers and other electronics will be the hardest hit. Analysts are grinding out lower earnings estimates as fast as their secretaries can work the fax machines.
Besides I.B.M., with 40 percent of its sales in Europe, other vulnerable makers of office equipment include the Xerox Corporation, also at 40 percent, and the Unisys Corporation, where total foreign sales are 60 percent, said Daniel Mandresh, an analyst at Merrill Lynch.
The Ford Motor Company also startled investors by saying that slow European business -- with the British market the worst in 40 years -- would leave the company with losses through the end of the year.
Harvey Heimbach, an auto industry analyst at Merrill Lynch, returned from the recent auto show in Paris with word that European auto companies were warning of a weaker 1993 there than Americans who follow the industry had expected. "The outlook is, it's going to get worse before it gets better," he said.
Although General Motors reaps only 21 percent of its sales in Europe, compared with 31 percent at Ford, G.M. has been more dependent on European earnings to offset large losses in the United States, Mr. Heimbach said. The Chrysler Corporation is the least vulnerable, with relatively low sales there.
 
Other Industries at Risk
 The fourth quarter will show the full effects of canceled and postponed orders, Mr. Shulman of Salomon Brothers said. Besides makers of autos and computers, he said, many aluminum, paper and chemical companies risk earnings disappointment.
The major chemical companies, which account for the largest trade surplus of any American industry, achieve between 20 and 35 percent of their sales in Europe. Few have been safe from the blows to earnings estimates delivered by Harvey S. Stober of Dean Witter, recently back from a trip there. "Du Pont we did several weeks ago," he said Friday. "PPG we did this morning. Dow we did a couple weeks ago, Monsanto we have done too."
The food, beverage and tobacco makers are relatively safe from European calamity; recession-bound consumers can still afford a soda or a smoke. But for the third quarter, even the Coca-Cola Company reported double-digit volume declines in some European markets.
Some analysts see falling European interest rates reviving the region and American earnings there next year. But Stephen Cooney, director of international investment and finance at the National Association of Manufacturers, tempers his optimism so much that he sounds almost morose.
"I don't think the future looks too bad," he said, stopping to ponder it. "But I can't predict when the future will arrive."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Election Day Initiatives May Affect Bond Issues

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
In the tax-exempt bond market, traders and investors face political uncertainty even beyond the outcome of the Presidential election. At the state and local level, there are numerous spending and taxing initiatives that could affect the credit outlook for the state and local governments, which would have a major impact on bonds.
There are also about $10 billion in bond issues on state and local ballots that are waiting for the thumbs-up or thumbs-down from the voters. 
 The impact of the spending initiatives, like those awaiting voter decisons in Colorado and Michigan, would be limited to the bonds from the particular state. But the concern is great enough that the credit-rating agencies are closely monitoring the contests for their potential effect on local credit ratings. Investors, too, must proceed with caution. Already in Colorado there is a rush to get issues sold before Election Day.
And while the defeat or approval of billions of dollars in new bond issues is not likely to have an immediate influence on the municipal market, the results will provide a sense of voter sentiment that could affect the longer-term flow of bond issues, said James Cooner, a senior vice president at the Bank of New York.
 
A Vote on Spending Limits
 In Colorado, the initiative in question, known locally as the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, would limit both increases in spending and revenue at the state and the local level to the rate of inflation. Surpassing these ceilings would require advance voter approval.
Because the Colorado proposal would limit the flexibility of govenment to manage its fiscal affairs, "we are very concerned about it," said Ditmar Kopf, assistant vice president at Moody's Investors Service, the credit-rating agency.
Moody's said the proposal might not affect existing bonds. But the firm said in an analysis that "passage could seriously erode the credit quality of local governments because of the severe financial and debt management restrictions which would be imposed, as well as the uncertainty created by portions of the proposal."
 
Property Taxes in Michigan
 In Michigan, two proposals on the ballot could impair the credit rating of new bonds from state and local governments, some analysts say. One measure would cut by 30 percent the property taxes that pay for school operating costs and would limit growth in property tax assessments to 3 percent, or to the inflation rate if it is lower than 3 percent.
A second, competing, measure, which was placed on the ballot by the Legislature, would limit all property-tax assessment increases to 5 percent or the rate of inflation, whichever is lower. In the event both proposals are approved, the one with the most votes prevails.
 
Bond Votes' Negative Trend
 Regarding the actual proposed bond issues on the ballot, Mr. Cooner of the Bank of New York said that if the trend of the last two years continued, a major portion of the bonds on the ballot will be defeated. In 1990, 59 percent of the dollar value of state and local bonds were defeated and in 1991, 52 percent were defeated. These setbacks came after voters approved nearly 90 percent of the dollar value of bonds on the ballot between 1982 and 1989.
Mr. Cooner said the higher level of defeats the last two years indicated that voters "equated new bond sales today with increased taxes in the future." What is more, he said, "voting negatively on bond issues was a way of expressing dissatisfaction with state and local financial operations."
The $10 billion in ballot proposals is small compared with the total $200 billion of new state and local tax-exempt issues this year. But Mr. Cooner said that a defeat of many of them would be a good indicator of "voter comfort or discomfort with bond sales in the future."
Of the $10 billion, about half are on the ballot in California, including $1.9 billion in state general obligation bonds and $1.5 billion in bonds to be issued by Los Angeles. There is also an $800 million State of New York bond issue on the ballot and a $345 million proposal on the state ballot in New Jersey.
 
The Clinton Factor
 The Presidential election will have an additional impact on the municipal bond market if the Arkansas Governor, Bill Clinton, wins. His tax-increase proposal, which would raise taxes on people with incomes of $200,000 and higher, could drive more investors into the tax-exempt municipal market as they seek shelter from higher tax rates, analysts say.
As of now, a tax-exempt bond with a coupon of 6 percent has an after-tax equivalent yield of 8.69 percent. If the current 31 percent top tax rate rises to 36 percent, the after-tax yield for a 6 percent bond jumps to 9.37 percent.
"That is significant," said Clark Wagner, the portfolio manager for municipal bond funds at First Investment Management Company in New York. Although he argued that many of these high-income investors already have their money in tax-exempt municipal bonds, he said the tax increase surely would not hurt the municipal market.
But the election itself, if Governor Clinton wins, may swamp the reverberations from these other Election Day issues.
What investors are most afraid of right now, just over two weeks before Election Day, is Mr. Clinton's promise of a spending package to stimulate the faltering economy.
While investors may want a stronger economy, the resulting rise in the budget deficit and the threat of higher interest rates and rising inflation that it might bring is a cold shower for the entire bond market, from municipals to Treasuries.
But given the fall in the prices of municipal and Treasury bonds recently, including the 3/16 -point drop in the 30-year Treasury on Friday, much of the threat of a Clinton stimulus program may have already been priced into the market.
"Judging from the market reaction, it appears that they have thrown in the towel on Bush," Mr. Wagner said Friday, the morning after the second televised Presidential debate.

HEADLINE: Mr. Perot Presents Some Beef

 BODY:
Ross Perot's advertising blitz over the weekend was cause for admiration, regret and frustration. Admiration because he gave viewers a high-minded seminar on America's fiscal problems, and because he offered a serious and mostly honest program to address those problems.
Regret because Mr. Perot's ideas would surely have challenged his opponents and elevated the tone of the campaign -- if only he had presented them earlier and not cravenly quit the race in July when his candidacy had credibility. 
 Frustration because Mr. Perot insists even now on presenting his detailed remedies in hermetically sealed TV studios, avoiding cross-examination. In the public debates, by contrast, the man who professes to hate sound bites has spoken exclusively in brief and unenlightening generalities.
Almost all the ideas outlined by Mr. Perot in 30 minutes on NBC Friday and in a one-hour ABC broadcast on Saturday are in his book, "United We Stand: How We Can Take Back Our Country" -- a damning indictment of how America's $4 trillion debt has inhibited productive investment and burdened future generations. The television programs presented the numbers in greater detail.
Those numbers add up to a $754 billion package of tax increases and spending cuts that, Mr. Perot says, would yield a Federal budget surplus in six years. Answering critics, Mr. Perot took pains to say that the program could be phased in in ways that would not add to the woes of the current sluggish economy.
Mr. Perot's first priority is to reduce the deficit. He therefore offers far less than Gov. Bill Clinton does in terms of public investment to generate long-term economic growth. Still, on the deficit issue alone, Mr. Perot is much more credible than Mr. Bush, who won't raise taxes at all, and Mr. Clinton, whose spending and revenue projections are wildly optimistic.
His folksy presentation and impressive charts contained two evasions. First, $141 billion in savings comes from containing health care costs. But Mr. Perot did not say how he would do that. Second, he suggested that most of the deficit reduction would come from spending cuts.
Not so, according to the National Center for Policy Analysis. Many of Mr. Perot's "cuts" are in fact higher taxes, including stiffer Medicare taxes and premiums and increased taxes on benefits for upper-income Social Security recipients.
Otherwise, Mr. Perot spoke plainly. The man who once said he could end the deficit "without breaking a sweat" left no doubt that the job would require not just sweat but pain.
The question that his critics have asked him from the beginning, however, still applies: Does he have the courage to test his convictions in the political arena? The courage to allow the two men who have stayed the course from the beginning to examine him? Tonight's debate, the last of this campaign, could provide an answer.

HEADLINE: Clinton Health Plan Covers All Americans

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The Bush-Clinton Health Reform" (editorial, Oct. 10) finally recognizes that Gov. Bill Clinton has long embraced the principle of competition in delivery of health care. But you continue to ignore enormous differences between the reform proposal advanced by Governor Clinton and that of President Bush. 
 Governor Clinton has pledged to secure universal financial access to health care for all Americans. President Bush's plan would leave roughly 20 million uninsured.
Governor Clinton embraces a national health-care budget that would contain growth of health-care costs. Limiting cost growth would spare the millions of insured Americans the fear they will lose benefits in the future. While President Bush's plan might achieve small, one-time savings, it does nothing to slow the continuing growth of health-care costs.
You do well to celebrate the joint adherence of Governor Clinton and President Bush to principles of competition. But you do a disservice to obscure the fundamental choice on reform of health care financing the American people face on election day.

Magazine Ads Push Computer Commercials Out of the Picture

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN

 BODY:
When Apple Computer Inc. ran its eye-popping "1984" commercial introducing the Macintosh during the 1984 Super Bowl, the controversial Chiat/Day ad set off a buying frenzy. When retail stores opened the next day, $6.5 million worth of Macintoshes were sold within four hours.
But changes in the market in the last several years have sharply altered the way in which personal computers are advertised today. 
 As personal computers have become commodities, an influx of new and hungry competitors, price wars and new sales channels have conspired to funnel market share away from leaders like I.B.M. and Apple. Long-running campaigns, like the hugely successful "Little Tramp" campaign for I.B.M., have become a thing of the past.
Promoting brand awareness has given way to product-specific advertising, and companies have for the most part abandoned television in favor of specialty publications with devoted readers.
 
A Big Decline
 Broadcast ad spending by personal computer makers fell to $30 million by the end of 1991, from $125 million in 1988, according to the Capra Research Group in Los Altos, Calif.
Personal computer makers discovered that most buyers made their decisions with help from PC Magazine, PC World, PC Week, Infoworld or any of the 400 other computer-related publications.
The telephone book-sized PC Magazine, for example, published 21 percent of all advertising for personal computers in 1991, or a total of $89 million worth. In 1988, the advertising totaled only $20 million.
"This is not the same as reading Time or Newsweek where the reader's interest is divorced from any advertising," said Marian White, vice president of research at Ziff-Davis, which publishes PC Magazine. "Every one of our readers is looking for something he is going to buy."
 
Detailed Product Information
 There are an estimated 60 million personal computers in business and home offices, and sophisticated buyers want advertising with detailed product information -- and plenty of it. "PC companies today are using advertising to close the sale," said Ted Voss, an advertising consultant with Creative Marketing Inc. in New York, who has worked with NEC Technologies and the International Business Machines Corporation.
The target buyers are information systems managers and technically savvy department managers who purchase personal computers, said Kelly Conlin, vice president of marketing at the International Data Group, publisher of PC World, Macworld and Computerworld.
In order to present so much information, many personal computer makers have abandoned the single- or double-page advertisement in favor of multipage full-color inserts, often with 12 pages of advertising.
"In the good old days, a full-color ad broke the clutter," said Gian Carlo Bisone, vice president of North American marketing for the Compaq Computer Corporation. "Now if you don't have a 20-page insert, you're just part of the noise."
And traditional advertising campaigns that might last for years have all but been abandoned by personal computer makers. "There are no campaigns today," said Grant Schneider, vice president of corporate communications at NEC Technologies Inc. in Boxborough, Mass. The market shifts too fast for that.
"The technology is changing so rapidly, you can't stick to any one particular campaign," he said. "You have to give the impression you are moving."
For I.B.M. and Apple, the recession forced severe cutbacks in advertising spending. According to Capra Research, I.B.M. reduced its advertising spending for personal computers to $32 million last year from $69 million in 1988, while Apple's spending dropped to $27 million from $48 million. Both companies are increasing their ad spending this year, however, particularly I.B.M., which is starting a separate business unit, the IBM Personal Computer Company.
Meanwhile, startup companies like Dell Computer, Zeos International and Gateway 2000 fueled explosive growth of their I.B.M.-compatible computers through bargain pricing, direct-mail promotions and extensive advertising in trade publications. The ads focused on price and product comparisons to I.B.M. or Compaq and boasted of faster and better delivery and service.

 STAYING IN NEW YORK
The Morgan Stanley Group, the financial services company that had been considering moving its New York City headquarters and as many as 4,100 employees to Stamford, Conn., will remain in the city for at least 10 years, company officials said.

HEADLINE: Bond Rating For Nassau Is Lowered

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., Oct. 19

 BODY:
After months of fiscal instability and political deadlock, the rating on $1.3 billion in Nassau County bonds was dropped two levels today, to the lowest investment-grade rating, and the lowest level in the county's history.
In lowering the rating, officials at Moody's Investors Service said that after months of inaction because of a "protracted and contentious political stalemate" the county was within six to eight weeks of running out of cash to pay its bills, unless it acted soon. 
 "There has been no ability of the different parties to move toward a meeting of the minds, there has simply been no program," said Michael Johnston, a senior vice president and manager at the rating agency "The political dispute at this stage appears to have no answer."
 
A Stunning Reversal
 It was a stunning reversal for one of the most affluent counties in the nation, where officials took turns for years bashing the fiscally troubled city to the west, with warnings of the "New York Citification" of the quality of life here.
The new rating of Baa, down from A, is a notch lower than New York City's current rating and is lower than any rating the city has had since 1985.
The rating -- the second downgrade in Nassau County this year -- is the lowest of any county in the metropolitan area, and the lowest for Nassau since Moody's began rating county bonds in 1938. In New York State, only three small upstate counties -- Cattaraugus, Oneida, Sullivan -- have the same rating.
County officials said that the downgrading could cost the county as much as $4 million in interest and insurance costs on $103 million in bonds scheduled for sale on Tuesday and "tens of millions more in the future," according to a statement by the county.
Republicans and Democrats on the county's board of supervisors responded to the latest news with recriminations, including pre-emptive news conferences and press statements, hours before the announcement was made.
Thomas S. Gulotta, the County Executive who has made New York City-bashing a staple of his campaigns, placed the blame for the downgrading on a Democratic Supervisor, Lewis J. Yevoli of Oyster Bay, who did not show up this morning at a meeting with the rating agency.
 
'Fiscal Chaos'
 "The Democratic Supervisors, for political reasons, are creating fiscal chaos, causing a loss in the county's credit and forcing a real property tax increase," said Mr. Gulotta, a Republican.
Mr. Yevoli, in turn, said years of mismanagement by the Republican political machine, which has controlled county government for 75 years, was responsible for the county's fiscal problems.
"Tom Gulotta is scared and he is looking for someone to blame," Mr. Yevoli said. "All he has to do is look in the mirror. He is blaming the newest member of the board for the county's ills."
Asked about the downgrading, Philip R. Michael, the New York City budget director, said that New York City was "on the way up" and he hoped to see the city's bond ratings raised in the near future.
"I sympathize with Nassau County," he said. "I would rather be on the way up as we are than to have just dropped to that point."
Mr. Michael observed that Nassau County's rating dropped, even though Nassau and Suffolk Counties received favorable treatment from the State Legislature, and were given authorization to sell long-term bonds to cover their deficits.
But as a practical matter, in Nassau, where neither Republicans nor Democrats have a working majority on the Board of Supervisors, the board was never able to implement the state-approved plan to sell up to $65 million in bonds, and double a mortgage recording tax to pay for it.
 
Hit by the Recession
 While Long Island has been hit hard by the recession, Nassau has fared better and has a lower unemployment rate -- currently 7 percent -- than either of its neighbors, New York City and Suffolk County. In announcing the downgrading, officials at Moody's noted that the county continues to enjoy a "substantial tax base and affluence."
But Mr. Johnson said the county had "prolonged difficulties in tapping these resources" -- in short a political stalemate, characterized by an inability to raise taxes or cut spending.
The stalemate followed the election of Mr. Yevoli. His election was seen as an unsettling development by Republicans who began to fear a voter backlash over high taxes, including some of the highest property taxes in the country.
Late last year, the budget was cut deeply -- in a plan that would have required the elimination of as many as one in four county jobs -- but when the cuts proved unpopular, the worst of them were not carried out.
As a result, Moody's said the current deficit grew and is now projected to be $130 million or nearly 10 percent of county revenues.
With Democrats and Republicans split along partisan lines this year, Mr. Yevoli agreed to ask the State Legislature to authorize the bonding and the increase in the mortgage recording tax. But after the Legislature approved it, he refused to carry out the plan, saying the Republicans had refused to make deep cuts in what he called patronage jobs in the government.
Today, Mr. Yevoli did not attend a meeting between county officials and Moody's, though he spoke with officials of the rating agency later by telephone.
Tonight, John V. Scaduto, the county treasurer, summed up the situation this way as he struggled to put together the last details on the bond sale. "It's politics," he said. "The county is in fundamentally good shape, always was, and always will be."

HEADLINE: Plans for 14 Theme High Schools Begin Taking Shape in New York

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON

 BODY:
Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez's plan to create small alternative high schools began to take shape yesterday with a decision to give planning grants for 14 proposals to groups including unions, church organizations and colleges.
The proposals, winnowed from 282 applications, offer a glimpse at what the schools might look like. One would be a School for the Physical City, where the students would study bridges, subways and tunnels. Another is a Health Opportunities Program School, where students would learn about science by working in hospitals with health workers. 
 Mr. Fernandez has promised that at least three to five schools will open by September. The schools, with 500 to 700 students each, are part of a plan to establish at least 30 schools over three years that are easier to manage and tailored more to individual needs than is the case now. Mr. Fernandez is also trying to address the overcrowding problem that has burdened many of the 124 high schools.
"Planned from the ground up by the community, parents and teachers, the schools will foster student choice and innovative instruction," Mr. Fernandez said in a statement.
 
Selection by Fund
 The applications were sent by community organizations, parents, public agencies, unions, community school districts, teachers, colleges and cultural institutions. The selection was directed by the Fund for New York City Public Education, which channels money to the school system from foundations and other contributors.
The high schools operated by the community groups are but one componet of the Chancellor's plan to create small thematic schools. Other components include schools begun by the system's high school division and those to be started by two advocates of change in education, Theodore R. Sizer, a professor at Brown University, and Deborah Meier, founder of three schools in East Harlem. A handful of the schools operated by the high school division have opened.
For the health school in the Bronx, planners say they want to incorporate a six-day school week and an introduction to more than 250 health-care careers in the seventh through 12th grades. The school would use Herbert H. Lehman College and the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center. "Our objective is to start to tap the largest sector of employment in the Bronx, the health-care industry," said Miguel Garcia, president of New Directions in Community Revitalization, a development corporation.
 
Church and Social Courses
 One plan, "Enter to Learn -- Depart to Serve," would unite parents and residents who are members of the Abyssinian Baptist Church and the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies in teaching students nonviolent social change.
Another proposal is for a New York City Museum School, where clusters of students would be assigned to a museum and spend one day a week in Community School District 2 to exchange experiences and study. The grants, from the Aaron Diamond Foundation of New York, are to be used to find project directors, identify grade levels, curriculums and staff members, as well as to decide the sites of schools.

HEADLINE: Credit Markets;
Bonds Drop on Fears of Clinton's Economic Plan

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The bond market fell sharply yesterday, as investors and dealers were said to be positioning themselves for the likelihood that Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas would win the Presidential election and would try to stimulate the economy with increases in Government spending.
The plunge in the market suggests how difficult it may be for whoever wins the election to push through a program to reinvigorate the economy. The message from investors, traders and dealers is that bondholders will sell if a stimulus package is deemed too aggressive, pushing the Federal deficit much higher. And if they sell, they could force market interest rates higher and offset any benefits from the stimulus program.
 
 
Persistent Selloff
 The market's selloff has been persistent since the first week of October, when investors and dealers were disappointed that the Federal Reserve chose not to lower short-term interest rates another notch after weak September employment figures were released on Oct. 2. The Fed's reluctance to move has had a significant impact on Treasury bills and intermediate-term notes. 
 Since then, a growing feeling that Mr. Clinton will win the election has focused attention on his intention to propose a program of Government spending on projects from roads and bridges to communications to create jobs and get the economy moving. The perception that such a program might raise the deficit in the short term has affected mostly long-term notes and the 30-year bond.
All this has led to selling that has wiped out much of gain from the strong rally of July, August and September, when yields on the 30-year bond fell to six-year lows and short-term interest rates plunged to 30-year lows.
But since the beginning of October, the yield on the 30-year bond has jumped a quarter of a percentage point, to 7.56 percent, as prices have dropped. The yield bottomed out at 7.21 percent on Sept. 8.
The jump in the yield on the five-year note has been even more pronounced, soaring half of a percentage point, to 5.68 percent. The yield on the 10-year bond is up almost half of a percentage point, to 6.68 percent.
Also impressive has been the rise in short-term interest rates. In the weekly auction of the three-month and six-month bill yesterday, the average discount rates jumped. On the three-month bill, the average discount rate was 2.94 percent, compared with 2.58 percent on Oct. 1, and the rate for the six-month bill was 3.10 percent, compared with 2.73 percent at the beginning of October.
The Fed's decision earlier this month not to cut rates further explains these changes. At the beginning of October the discount rate on three-month bills was below the Federal funds rate of 3 percent in expectation of another cut by the Fed. Now it has moved up to 3 percent again as investors decided the Fed would not act until after the election.
 
 
Selling Seen as Overdone
 Traders and analysts said there was no new news to prompt the selling yesterday, except that more and more investors and dealers appeared convinced that Governor Clinton would win the election.
Several traders and analysts said that they thought the selling was overdone and that the worry about a Clinton victory had pushed prices much lower and yields much higher than they should be, based on the economic fundamentals. A slow-growing economy and low inflation are generally regarded as positive for the bond market.
"Somewhere in here there is a real buying opportunity," said Joseph Liro, chief economist of S. G. Warburg & Company in New York. "Fundamentally, the circumstances do not warrant the yields that are being built into the short end" of the yield curve.
Mr. Liro argued that while he expected an economic stimulus program if Mr. Clinton was elected, "there are limits to how aggressive a fiscal policy the Democrats will be willing to adopt." One of those limiting factors, he said, would be the reaction of the bond market.
Peter McTeague, fixed-income analyst at Thomson Financial Services in Boston, added, "Maybe the market is overdoing the Clinton worry."
 
 
Notes Are Hit Hard
 In trading in the secondary market yesterday, the 7- and 10-year notes were hit hardest. The price of the seven-year note dropped 28/32 to yield 6.24 percent, compared with 6.09 percent on Friday. The price of the 10-year note fell 24/32 to yield 6.68 percent, compared with 6.57 percent on Friday.
Traders said there was talk that widespread selling of the 10-year note stemmed from some holders' belief that the Treasury might decide to issue more of this note. There has recently been a severe shortage of the 10-year note, and the Treasury has said it will sell additional securities, if necessary to end a squeeze.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said in September that it had been gathering data on the shortage of the 10-year note, which would be the first step toward determining if the Treasury needed to take special action.
The price of the 7.25 percent 30-year bond was off almost 17/32 , to 9725/32 , to yield 7.56 percent, up from 7.52 percent on Friday.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three-month and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: New York Finds Typical Family Being Redefined

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
The traditional American family has declined so far in New York City that married couples living with their own children now constitute only one in six households.
The trend is neither new nor peculiar to New York. But a new analysis of the 1990 census has found that the typical family has been radically redefined. 
 The share of married couples living with their own children in the city declined from 19.2 percent of all households in 1980 to less than 17 percent in 1990. Among the nation's major cities, it appeared that the percentage of so-called traditional families was lower only in San Francisco.
 
Beyond Immediate Families
 During the last decade, one phenomenon has contributed mightily to the change: the share of New Yorkers living with aunts, uncles, grandparents and other relatives beyond their immediate families rose by 27 percent, or more than 300,000. As a result of family breakups, the rise in foster care, unaffordable housing and an influx of immgrants with extended families, the number of persons in family households living with other relatives soared from 1.1 million in 1980 to more than 1.4 million a decade later. Of all households, they accounted for 20 percent, up from about 16 percent 10 years earlier.
"This is a significant increase, this is big," said Joseph J. Salvo, deputy director of the population division of the Department of City Planning, which released the new analysis yesterday.
Fully one in four whites do not live in family households at all -- a reflection of the growing number of elderly people who live alone, of unrelated roommates living together to share costs, and, perhaps, of gay and lesbian couples, whom the Census Bureau does not recognize as a separate category.
And one in five households are headed by a woman with no husband present. Female-headed households account for 8 percent of white and of Asian households, 32 percent among blacks and 31 percent among Hispanic people.
 
Median Age Edging Up
 The department's study confirmed two other trends with profound economic, social and political implications.
The median age of New Yorkers edged up, from 32.8 years old to 33.7 during the decade. The median ranges from 40 for non-Hispanic whites to 28 for Hispanic people. Black and Hispanic New Yorkers registered the largest increases in median age -- nearly three years among both groups.
The analysis also found severe overcrowding in rented housing, particularly houses and apartments occupied by immigrants.
Citywide, 15 percent of New Yorkers in rented housing lived in overcrowded quarters in 1990, compared with 9 percent in 1980. Among people identifying themselves as Korean, nearly half live in overcrowded housing, which is typically defined as one or more persons per room. The figure ranged from 5 percent of whites to 38 percent of Asians.
 
Positive Trends
 The analysis also found evidence of two positive trends.
The sharp increase in households headed by women with no husband appeared to have halted, although that may be, in part, because more of them have moved in with other relatives.
And the number of New Yorkers who own their own homes -- typically considered a measure of economic and social stability -- increased substantially. Renters accounted for nearly 77 percent of New Yorkers in 1980, but only 71 percent 10 years later. Asian-Americans recorded the largest gains in home ownership: in 1980, 80 percent lived in rental housing; in 1990, 69 percent did.
Nearly one in three people now own their own home or apartment. That includes 38 percent of whites, 21 percent of blacks, 12 percent of Hispanic residents and 31 percent of Asian-Americans. Some of the increase resulted from the record number of transformatioms of rental apartment buildings into cooperatives during the 1980's.
Earlier census analyses found evidence of a growing black middle class and income gains that enabled blacks in Queens to achieve parity with whites.
Big disparities remain, though, in the median value of owner-occupied housing. It ranged from $209,000 for Asians and $202,750 for whites to $156,000 for blacks. Among whites living in Manhattan, the median was $622,000.
But rents also rose. The median, in 1990 constant dollars, jumped from $340 a month in 1980 to $447 in 1990. Median monthly rent ballooned to $503 from $380 for whites, to $404 from $302 for blacks, to $396 from $300 for Hispanic people and to $535 from $373 for Asian tenants.
 
Jails Overshadow Dorms
 Wide variations were also found among the separate Asian and Hispanic groups analyzed by City Planning Department demographers. Puerto Ricans paid the lowest rent among Hispanic people; Mexicans, the highest. Chinese reported the fewest people living alone; Japanese, the most, with 42 percent -- presumably because so many are business executives whose families remained in Japan.
The city's analysis gleaned these other nuggets from the 1990 census:
*Nearly as many people are housed in correctional institutions in New York City as in college dormitories. Among blacks, more than four times as many are in jail as are living in college dorms.
*More New Yorkers are over the age of 70 than under age 5. More are 62 years old or more than are younger than 10. About one-third of elderly people in the city live alone.
*The percentage of New Yorkers over the age of 15 who are separated, widowed or divorced rose from 16 percent in 1980 to 20 percent in 1990. The 43 percent who are married includes 47 percent of the whites, 32 percent of the blacks, 39 percent of Hispanic people and 58 percent of the Asians.
*The number of persons per household -- 2.5 citywide -- did not change appreciably during the decade. Manhattan recorded fewer than two per household, lower than any county in the country except one in Hawaii that is home to a leper colony.
Among the more than 10,000 homeless people "visible in street locations" in the city, half were black and about one-third were Hispanic people. The census counted three people who identified themselves as Japanese.

HEADLINE: Nationsbank Profits Surge; Chase's Earnings Rise 29%

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The Nationsbank Corporation announced yesterday that its third-quarter profits had quadrupled because of a sharp decline in losses from bad loans, while the Chase Manhattan Corporation reported a more modest 29 percent profit increase, mainly attributable to strong gains in foreign-exchange trading.
Profits of $350 million at Nationsbank, whose acquisitions have made it the country's fourth-largest banking company, were almost twice the $176 million at Chase, which has slipped in the last two years to sixth place from third. 
 Nationsbank's profit, a record for any quarter in its history, puts it on track to earn more than $1 billion this year, the first time its profits will cross that threshold. Chase Manhattan has benefited from rapid growth of its consumer and computer back office businesses the last few years, but its quarterly profit leaves it well behind its performance in 1988, when it earned more than $1 billion.
The earnings reports were better than expected at both companies. Nationsbank's common stock rose $1, to close at $45, while Chase rose 75 cents, to close at $23.25.
While both Nationsbank and Chase were hurt by the downturn in commercial real estate prices and subsequent defaults on loans by developers, the problems appear to be lingering longer at Chase.
Nationsbank wrote off as a loss $141 million of loans, the same amount as in the second quarter, but only half the $280 million write-off in the third quarter of 1991. Nonperforming loans, those which are badly delinquent or not expected to be repaid in full, fell $55 million in the third quarter to $1.7 billion, and are $203 million lower than a year ago.
At Chase Manhattan, the bright spot in its earnings was $120 million of revenues from foreign-exchange trading, up from $61 million in the second quarter and $48 million a year ago.
In other parts of Chase's business, it wrote off as a loss $321 million of loans, up from $297 million in the second quarter, but well below the $656 million of a year ago. Although commercial real estate write-offs fell to $97 million from $120 million in the second quarter, this decline was offset by increases in domestic commercial loans and various kinds of foreign loans.
 
Credit Losses Likely
 Chase said that because of economic weakness in the United States and other countries and depressed real estate markets in the United States, "it is likely that the provision for possible credit losses will continue at relatively high levels." Its $2.23 billion of nonperforming domestic commercial real estate loans was down $130 million from the second quarter, while other kinds of nonperforming loans rose $49 million, to $865 million.
Because Chase's reserves for absorbing loan losses equal only about half the loans it has identified as troubled, many investors assume that its earnings will be hobbled for many quarters to come by a need to write off bad loans and set aside reserves to cover expected loan losses.
The perceived need to increase reserves is one reason that Chase stock sells at only 73 percent of its book value compared with 100 percent or more for most other large banks. Book value is a bank's capital divided by the number of shares. It assumes that a bank's loans are worth the amount shown on its balance sheet and do not require additonal write-offs or reserves.
Nationsbank also reported its first quarterly increase in loans in more than a year. Hugh McColl, its chairman, said loan demand over all was weak but noted that the third quarter average of $67.7 billion of loans was $885 million greater than the quarter ended June 30, with most of the increase coming in loans to businesses. Consumer loans rose $305 million in the latest quarter, mostly from mortgage lending, while commercial real estate loans declined by $305 million.
Nationsbank, which in the last few years has accumulated more than $25 billion of securities because of what it said was weak loan demand from businesses and consumers, has told analysts that it expects to increase profits in coming quarters as increasing loan demand allows it to shift money from securities yielding 6 percent and less to higher yielding loans, particularly consumer loans yielding more than 10 percent.
 
Network of Buyers
 At Chase Manhattan, loans averaged $64.1 billion, down $500 million in the second quarter. Richard Boyle, vice chairman at Chase, said the decline was primarily caused by the sale of loans and noted that sales to other banks had been strong because "they are feeling the same lack of loan demand that we do." After spending years to develop a network of buyers for its loans, he said Chase had resisted the temptation to stop supplying those buyers and keep larger amounts of the loans it makes.
Looking ahead, Mr. Boyle said Chase's success in increasing its capital left it well positioned to provide funds to borrowers when demand increases.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Profits Rise at 2 Bells, But Are Flat at Pactel

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
Two regional Bell telephone companies reported higher third-quarter profits yesterday. But another had posted virtually flat earnings earlier.
The Bell Atlantic Corporation, which serves Northeastern states from New Jersey to Virginia, said its net income rose 16.6 percent from a year earlier. U S West Inc., which serves the Pacific Northwest and some Midwestern states, said net income rose 5.2 percent. 
 But the Pacific Telesis Group, which serves California and Nevada, reported last week that its third-quarter earnings rose less than 1 percent.
Following are the details of the companies' third-quarter earnings:
 
Bell Atlantic
 Bell Atlantic, based in Philadelphia, said third-quarter net totaled $386.6 million, or 90 cents a share, compared with $331.5 million, or 78 cents a share, a year earlier. Quarterly revenue totaled $3.17 billion, up less than 1 percent from $3.15 billion.
Quarterly results would have risen less -- by only 9.3 percent from the year-earlier operating profit of 75 cents a share -- without a one-time gain, the company said. The gain of 8 cents a share is from the sale of an investment related to the acquisition of Metro Mobile, a cellular carrier.
Bell Atlantic said its operating expenses totaled $2.5 billion, down nine-tenths of 1 percent from a year earlier, partly as a result of the early retirement of 3,200 managers.
The carrier reported strong increases in subscribers to its cellular services. It had 617,300 subscribers as of Sept. 30, up 29 percent from a year earlier. Cellular revenue totaled $153.8 million, up 22.5 percent from the year-ago quarter. The company did not disclose cellular earnings.
Bell Atlantic's shares slipped 37.5 cents yesterday, to close at $47.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
U S West
 U S West, based in Englewood, Colo., said quarterly earnings totaled $283.4 million, or 69 cents a share, compared with $269.3 million, or 66 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue dropped 2.1 percent, to $2.56 billion from $2.62 billion. Excluding the company's real estate operations, which are being phased out, revenue rose 1.9 percent, to $2.6 billion.
The company said operating expenses totaled $2 billion, down 1.5 percent from a year earlier, mainly as a result of a 14.1 percent reduction in the cost of services and products.
U S West also reported a strong rise in the number of cellular subscribers, to 372,200, up 40.5 percent from the 1991 quarter. Quarterly cellular and pager revenue totaled $105.3 million, up 23.4 percent from the year-earlier $85.3 million. The company did not disclose cellular earnings.
U S West shares lost 25 cents yesterday, to close at $38.75.
 
Pacific Telesis
 Pacific Telesis, based in San Francisco, said its quarterly earnings totaled $277 million, or 70 cents a share, compared with $275 million, or 70 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose less than 1 percent, to $2.51 billion from $2.5 billion.
The quarterly figures include a restatement of first- and second-quarter earnings resulting from a $56 million refund ordered by the California Public Utilities Commission to settle a dispute over Pacific Bell's development of certain telecommunications services. Pacific Bell supplies ordinary telephone service, the source of most of its revenues.
The company blamed the quarter's comparatively poor results on the persistent recession in the state, which is the nation's largest.
The company said its operating expenses rose 3.6 percent, to $1.49 billion from $1.44 billion.
Pacific Telesis, with the nation's largest cellular market, reported a 28.1 percent increase in the number of subscribers, to 656,000, up from 512,000 in the 1991 period.
Pactel Cellular reported that quarterly net income was flat at $23.2 million. While quarterly cellular revenue rose 20.4 percent, to $181.3 million from $150.6 million, operating expenses rose 26.5 percent, to $141.4 million from $111.8 million, preventing revenue gains from leading to profits.
Pacific Telesis's shares dipped 25 cents yesterday, to $42.625.

HEADLINE: Many Reasons Send Adults to One Place: School

BYLINE: By CHARLES STRUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIDGEWOOD, N.J., Oct. 19

 BODY:
While the debate over the study of Western Civilization rages among the dons from Columbia to Stanford, Philip Dogon remains steadfast in his teaching goals: to help even the clumsiest homeowner learn to rewire a lamp or repair a toilet.
He does this in nine Tuesday nights at the Ridgewood Community School in course No. 502: "Be Your Own Fix-It Handyman, It's Really Easy." His specialty is one of about 170 courses or lectures this fall in this suburb's version of a perennially popular form of learning, the adult education program. 
 With roots in the community forums of the 19th-century Lyceum movement and the Americanization classes for immigrants 75 years ago, the modern adult education program has come to reflect who Americans are, what they want and what they need. And while the poor economy has taken its toll on class rolls in the last four years, the overall picture is strong and growing stronger, said Julie Coates, information director for the Learning Resources Network in Manhattan, Kan., which helps track trends in the field.
In the last decade, she said, enrollment nationwide has doubled, to 15 million, with baby boomers and retired people signing up in large numbers at colleges, public schools or independent programs for everything from acrylic folk art to yoga.
 
Fad, Fashion and Necessity
 The curriculum, from a few dozen courses in some towns to a few hundred offerings in others, is usually a reflection of the community it serves, as well as of fads, fashions or, at the moment, of economic necessity -- the need to find a job in a tenacious recession.
In cities like New York, adult courses are intended primarily to provide access to trades, office jobs or the health-care industry; instruction tends to be skill-related and offered free or at nominal cost. Of the city's 50,000 adult students, 20,000 are learning English as a second language, according to the Board of Education. There are no electives like "Realistic Options in Hair Restoration" (Ridgewood); "About Men -- What Do They Want? For Men Only" (Scarsdale, N.Y.), or "My Aching Back" (taught by a local chiropractor in Milford, Conn.).
Across the country, Ms. Coates said, two-thirds of those enrolled are women, many have college degrees and most have some college experience and higher-than-average incomes. Recently, she said, men and women between the ages of 28 and 46 have been attracted to courses that provide what she called "catered experiences." She cited an apocryphal "gourmet canoeing" class, but also said that lessons in stand-up comedy, dress for success or self-esteem for women were gaining popularity.
 
Lifetime Learning
 Growth has also been rapid among older people.
"They want to remain part of contemporary life and communicate with their grandchildren," Ms. Coates said. "Some want to learn to do spread sheets, to learn what they need to do to manage their own finances in retirement." Some, she said, are engrossed in writing their family histories and want to learn word processing to continue the project.
Ms. Coates said she was also seeing record enrollments in courses on backyard ecology, "hands-on things that individuals can do to help the environment." Ridgewood offers eight of these, but another class on learning to install an underground sprinkler system was canceled for lack of interest. Other big draws are parenting classes, courses on how to communicate with teen-agers and financial planning for retirement or for a child's college education.
Home improvement courses, like Mr. Dogon's, always have an audience. "These classes saw a surge of popularity about four years ago as baby boomers started, in great numbers, to buy the dream home or renovate the old home," Ms. Coates said.
But business, finance and computers seem to hold the edge in popularity, and schools are also branching out to do on-site training in new technology or management techniques in suburban office parks.
 
A Turn Toward the Serious
 "We've become more serious, particularly in the last two years," said Dr. Ronald Verdicchio, executive director of the Ridgewood program. "People are coming to us to be retrained. While we have some crafts and recreation, our focus tends to be substance. That's changed with the economy and the times."
Ridgewood, whose adult program began under private auspices in 1948 and became part of the public school system in 1970, sent its 38-page fall bulletin to 60,000 households in the northern Bergen County area and has a current enrollment of 12,000, though it has been as high as 15,000 in recent years. Like most schools of its kind, it is self-sustaining, based on tuition, and holds classes in public schools as well as churches or other public buildings. It returns about $120,000 a year in rental fees to the Board of Education.
"Our enrollment has eroded over the past two years," Dr. Verdicchio said. "Partly that has to do with changes in our program, but we also got hurt by the Gulf War. The phones stopped dead. People were glued to their television set that winter, and we really took a shot.
"We're also local-economy sensitive. Last October, we took a pretty good hit. People were careful about writing the checks. Adult education is a very competitive business, and it is a business."
 
Practical Skills
 Many schools like Ridgewood's rely on local talent to teach courses, paying, on average, about $15 to $20 an hour. Mr. Dogon, who ran a hardware store in Passaic for 20 years, is perhaps typical of instructors in the hands-on courses.
Lecturing on sockets and friction tape before a dozen eager disciples in a corner of the cafeteria at Benjamin Franklin Middle School, he holds the suburban night-school equivalent of a tenured chair in physics at M.I.T.
And like a large number of the 140 faculty members, his qualifications come not necessarily from a college education but from career paths or simply passionate interest.
"When you have a small hardware business, you spend half your time telling people how to fix things," said Mr. Dogon, who has taught the course for five years. He emphasizes humor, simplicity and repetition in a course that covers door locks, lamps, toilets, window glazing, patching and plastering and faucets.
"There are no handymen anymore," he said. "They're all contractors and they charge a fortune."
Which is why Astrid Baruth of Park Ridge and Ray LaRocco of Ridgewood were rewiring an old lamp under Mr. Dogon's watchful gaze.
"There are lots of things that need to be fixed at my house, and I'm divorced," said Ms. Baruth, explaining her motivation for enrolling. "If I have to call people in to fix things, it would be the end."
Mr. LaRocca, who grew up in New York, said, "I'm from a family where nobody ever used a screwdriver in their life." When he bought a home, though, the need to be self-sufficient became self-evident. "It's nice to do something small," he said.
 
An Inexpensive Getaway
 Although many students are motivated by economics, many just want to have fun. Ms. Coates said that interest in personal enrichment classes was booming this fall. "The reason is that people want to forget their troubles," she said. "Life is hard and life is bleak and they turn to these kinds of programs to give themselves something to get away."
In Milford, Conn., a grim economy has turned the town's adult education classes into a great and inexpensive night's entertainment. Most courses cost $25, about a quarter of a college course.
"This is a night out for me," said Karen Czajkowski of Milford, who was enrolled in a French class. "And it's just not a white-knuckles, pressurized class. It's just a wonderful time learning."
Her friend, Karen Simses, said, "I would love to use the language in France someday, but I think I'd have to be in the investments class down the hall in order to get myself there."
In Scarsdale, N.Y., where class fees range from $10 to $80, the philosophy remains what it was in 1938, when the first course was offered, according to Anita Malina, the curriculum coordinator: "one-third intellectual, one-third self-improvement and one-third hobby courses."
Administrators in Scarsdale and Ridgewood are typical in the way they select courses. Both communities have a board of advisers that meets to suggest ideas. Students are surveyed. Some people come forward with new proposals or teacher recommendations, which are sometimes unrealistic.
"Every year in curriculum meetings," Ms. Malina said, "we have new people who don't understand why we can't have Henry Kissinger."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Shows Some Gains, Especially Against Pound

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mostly higher yesterday on world currency markets, putting in its best performance against the British pound.
Gold prices also gained ground across the board. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $342.70 an ounce, up 30 cents from Friday. Republic National Bank said gold added 20 cents an ounce, to reach a late bid price of $342.40. 
 Traders said the dollar remained within very tight ranges before gradually drifting higher late in the session. Most of the dollar's gains were attributed to problems with other foreign currencies rather than any fundamental strength of its own.
 Traders said the pound was in the spotlight, falling sharply amid worries over the British Government's economic woes and its perceived lack of leadership.
An announcement that the Government was backing down on a plan to close 31 coal mines, which would result in the loss of 30,000 jobs, was seen as "a U-turn in policy," according to a senior London dealer. "The Government's credibility is slipping," he added. Parliament was told only 10 mines would close and a moratorium would be put on further closings until the New Year.
"We're in the throes of a shift in focus," Frank Pusateri, a vice president at the Bank of Boston, said. "We're moving from trading the dollar down on weakening U.S. fundamentals to selling the European currencies on weaknesses in their economies. The dollar will be the beneficiary of other people's troubles."
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 120.05 Japanese yen from 120.53 yen at Friday's close. Later, in London, it fell to 119.75 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 120.45 yen, up from 119.50 yen on Friday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.6330 from $1.6548 late Friday and to 2.4225 marks, from 2.4457 on Friday. In New York it cost $1.6225 to buy one pound, down than Friday's $1.6495.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's rates included: 1.4990 marks, up from 1.4798; 1.3395 Swiss francs, up from 1.3220; 5.0865 French francs, up from 5.0250; 1,316.50 Italian lire, up from 1,302, and 1.2456 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2451.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Preserving G.M.'s Blue-Chip Credit

BYLINE: By Doron P. Levin

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
WHEN Robert C. Stempel, chairman of the General Motors Corporation, was taken to a Washington hospital last week, his illness was diagnosed as hypertension.
Fortunately, Mr. Stempel felt well enough to return to work by week's end. But the enormous pressure to restructure G.M. that is swirling about Mr. Stempel and other senior G.M. executives will not dissipate as quickly. 
 An immediate concern is protecting G.M.'s blue-chip status in the capital markets. G.M.'s common stock and $85.5 billion worth of fixed-income securities have been trading at sharply discounted prices in recent weeks, partly because of uncertainty whether the company's cost-cutting will be successful, worries over economic weakness, and questions about the auto maker's relations with the United Automobile Workers union.
Last week, the Standard & Poor's Corporation warned that it might lower the ratings on G.M. bonds and commercial paper by mid-1993 "in the absence of clear signs of a turnaround in the financial performance of its core automotive operations." S.& P. now rates G.M.'s senior debt and commercial paper A-, a notch lower than the rating assigned by Moody's Investors Service Inc., which earlier warned of a possible downgrade.
Then on Friday, G.M. disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that its third-quarter deficit would be large; analysts say it may top $500 million. Yesterday, G.M.'s common stock slipped 25 cents a share, closing at $29.125, well below its 52-week high of $44.375 and near its low of $26.75.
Some bond traders, who spoke on condition of anonymity, viewed the S.& P. warning as optimistic, since they were bracing for a downgrade as early as year-end. "G.M. is getting a reprieve," one trader said.
G.M.'s outside directors have been pressing Mr. Stempel and Jack Smith, G.M.'s president, more forcefully to cut costs -- leading to the inevitable suspicion that Mr. Stempel's illness reflected the strain.
Yet the pressure bears most directly on Mr. Smith. As head of North American operations, he and a group of executives have been sequestered since April, trying to revamp the auto maker's product strategy. Many inside G.M. and on Wall Street expect word before the end of the year, perhaps soon, detailing which G.M. car and truck models will be canceled and which plants will close.
The national leaders of the U.A.W., though unhappy, are reconciled to more G.M. plant closings and cost-cutting. The question is whether closings will worsen tensions between local unions and plant managers, which erupted into two strikes in September. Despite these tensions, Wall Street regards the shutdown of unused G.M. capacity -- and the retirement or layoff of nonessential workers -- as absolute prerequisites to confirming G.M.'s credit rating.
"We'll be assessing competitiveness in the market sense, and labor will be an important component of that," said Scott Sprinzen, a director of corporate finance for S.& P.
Last week, G.M. and the U.A.W. were negotiating early retirement terms that would allow the auto maker to buy out the contracts of excess workers, instead of paying them until they are needed again. The union would prefer to keep workers on the payroll, but G.M. has some leverage: a fund that pays the salaries of laid-off workers is running low, and G.M. does not have to replenish it.
Just a few years ago, G.M.'s financial strength was thought to be a shield against almost any catastrophe. No more. Ronald Glantz, an automotive analyst for Dean Witter in San Francisco, said flatly, "If the union won't allow the company to match its competitors' productivity, Chapter 11 is possible."
He hastened to add that he believed the U.A.W. would permit productivity increases, and he is recommending the stock for long-term appreciation in the belief that Mr. Smith will lead the stock to outperform rivals.
What the U.A.W. will fight, according to a spokesman, is any plans to send work to Mexico or to nonunion vendors in order to evade the union. When productivity is competitive, the U.A.W. expects G.M. to bring more work into its factories, which will insure employment for the rank-and-file who have survived cost-cutting.

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, Oct. 19

 BODY:
The News Corporation, the global broadcasting and publishing company headed by Rupert Murcoch, has announced the pricing for its public offering of senior debt securities, reduced to $850 million, from $1 billion, because of recent volatility in the United States debt markets.
The company said the coupon rate on $550 million of senior notes due on Oct. 15, 1999, would be 9.12 percent and the rate on $300 million of senior debentures due on Oct. 15, 2012, would be 10.12 percent. 
 The debt offering is part of a sweeping debt-reduction program. Last week, the company raised $697 million through an offering of 40 million common shares.
"The net proceeds of the debt and equity offering will be not less than $1.5 billion," the company said. "The company intends to use all of the proceeds, together with the net proceeds of the $185 million from sale of The San Antonio Express News, to repay bank debt."
The senior notes and debentures are being offered through an underwriting group led by Merrill Lynch & Company.
The News Corporation owns the 20th Century Fox Film Corporation, Sky Broadcasting of Britain and large newspapers in Australia, Britain and Hong Kong.

HEADLINE: Business Scene;
Low Inflation: Is It the Culprit?

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
"MAY I suggest: 'The Great Recession'?" wrote Jeff Connor, commissioner of the New Jersey Banking Department, in response to a recent Business Scene column that reported on the search for a label that adequately describes the economic slowdown. The standard labels -- stagnation and recession -- fail to capture the hardship that many Americans say they are suffering. "Silent depression," "depressed recession," and "cycle of cycles" were among the other names suggested by readers.
But for many, the real question is the source of the problems. "I must say that a descriptive name for America's present economic difficulties seems far less important to me than a correct diagnosis of these difficulties," wrote Samuel M. Greenhouse of Boca Raton, Fla. And among the numerous diagnoses, a new one is appearing that goes a long way toward explaining the national hardship. It is the falling inflation rate. 
 Not since the mid-1960's has the Consumer Price Index hovered for so long a period -- 18 months now -- at an annual rate of 3 percent or less. But while low inflation was a boon in the 1960's, suitable to the times, it is a heavy burden today, helping to explain why the economy fails to revive.
"The downward trend causes the trouble," said Albert Sommers, a senior economist at the Conference Board, a business organization. Going from a 5 percent inflation rate in 1990 to 3 percent today, he said, "is much more disruptive than having had low but steady inflation for a considerable period, as was the case in the 1960's."
The problem today is different for individuals than for companies. Average wages for individuals have virtually stagnated, the Labor Department reports, but some major household expenses have sharply risen: health care, college tuition, home repair, utilities and property taxes. That plus heavy consumer debt loads, a burden absent in the 1960's, squeezes Americans, making them reluctant to buy, a prerequisite for an economic revival.
American corporations, on the other hand, suffer from almost no inflation at all in product prices. Unable to get price increases for a great variety of goods, they have preserved profits by cutting costs, especially labor costs. The results are wage and hiring freezes or outright layoffs, that have prolonged the hard times for workers. What's more, wholesalers and retailers decline to stockpile goods, depressing production. Why stockpile shoes at $50 a pair if the price three months from now won't change, or might even drop?
The corrugated box industry illustrates the problem. Some 95 percent of all packaged goods are shipped or sold in these boxes. But the price of $624 a ton is still well below the $664 selling price in 1989. A recent 3.3 percent increase, to $624, was the first increase in three years.
"We think the resistance has to do with the inability of our customers to pass price increases along to their customers," said Timothy McKenna, an executive at the Union Camp Corporation.
Union Camp, as a result, has stopped hiring and has also installed labor-saving machinery. That did not happen in the 1960's when price increases were also hard to get. With much less foreign competition, American output and sales kept rising, and so did productivity, the amount produced by each worker. The rising productivity -- at a much greater rate than today -- generated revenue for healthy wage increases. But even then, a sluggish economy, in part a result of low inflation, prompted President John F. Kennedy to push through the nation's first investment tax credit.
More important, the 1960's escaped deflation entirely. Prices might not have risen much, but they did not fall, as home prices have fallen in recent times, particularly in California and the Northeast. A home purchased for $500,000 in 1988 might sell for only $375,000 today, often less than the outstanding mortgage.
A family that owns such a home, with a $400,000 mortgage, is forced down one of two paths. If income is sufficient, the family can stay put, maintaining payments on the mortgage. But if the family cannot keep up the payments, because of job loss or wage cuts, the forced sale of the home for $375,000 may mean defaulting on the mortgage. And mortgage defaults are rising.
In either case, some inflation in the value of the home would relax the family. And in a more relaxed mood, family members might become more avid consumers. "With asset values falling, people are stuck with their debts, and that spills over into consumption," said Robert Gordon, a Northwestern University economist.
Some economists argue that allowing inflation to rise even a little might set off an inflationary spiral. But others offer a contrary view: Instead of rising, the inflation rate will continue to decline, hurting the economy. And the evidence increasingly suggests that this might happen.
"Like it or not, we have caught disinflation," said Robert Barbera, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers. "Let's say the next President wants to raise inflation to between 4 and 5 percent; I don't think he can."

HEADLINE: U.S.-VIETNAM TALKS MOVE TIES CLOSER

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
Vietnam and the United States have moved closer to establishing diplomatic relations after two days of talks in Hanoi between a high-level Bush Administration delegation and Vietnamese leaders, the State Department said today.
During the meetings, Hanoi pledged to open to American inspection all archival material relating to American servicemen unaccounted for since the Vietnam War, according to a joint statement issued by Vietnamese officials and the leader of the United States team, John W. Vessey Jr., a retired Army general. 
 "General Vessey indicated in the context of accelerated cooperation to resolve the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue, the U.S. would move more rapidly toward normalization," said Richard Boucher, the State Department spokesman.
The talks were hurriedly arranged by the Administration after Vietnam's Foreign Minister, Nguyen Manh Cam, was invited to Washington two weeks ago for talks with Acting Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
 
Photos Shown to Vietnamese
 At that meeting, the United States apparently presented the Vietnamese with information from Vietnam's own files that revealed Hanoi knew more than it has acknowledged about some cases of missing Americans.
According to officials involved in independent investigations of the issue here and in Southeast Asia, the material shown to the Vietnamese included photographs smuggled out of the country depicting gruesome scenes of Americans mutilated in crashes and military encounters or executed by their Vietnamese captors.
Information that has emerged in recent hearings of the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A Affairs has also indicated that Hanoi may have information it has withheld from American officials for nearly 20 years.
A resolution of some cases of missing Americans has been the last hurdle to lifting an American economic embargo and recognizing Hanoi.
 
November Visit by Senators
 Some Pentagon officials said they believed that Vietnam might also be preparing to release more American remains in the next few weeks, perhaps in advance of a committee visit to Hanoi planned for mid-November.
General Vessey, the President's special envoy to Hanoi, will brief Mr. Bush on his visit on Wednesday or Thursday, the White House said today.
The timing of these new moves is the subject of speculation here among both supporters and critics of improved relations with Vietnam. Experts say Vietnam's leaders are uncertain of what to expect from a Clinton Administration, while they are on a clearly defined "road map" to recognition devised by the Bush State Department.
Douglas Pike, the scholar who has written a history of the Vietnamese Army, said today that Vietnamese leaders in Hanoi asked him over the summer what more they could do to close this issue.
 
Vietnamese Politics Are Cited
 "I would just advise them to overwhelm us with candor," he said, citing the example of Russia. Mr. Pike, director of the Indochina studies at the University of California at Berkeley, said objections to sharing more information had apparently come from civilian security officials in Vietnam and not the military.
He said that in the mid-1980's, military objections to "doling out bones" were reliably reported to have been overruled in the Vietnamese Politburo by civilians in control of policy toward the United States.
"My general sense is that they were deliberately not telling us things they knew, and I think the basic reason was politics."
In Washington, the Bush Administration has been under pressure from American businesses to end the embargo so that they can compete in the rebuilding and industrialization of the country before all the contracts go to the Japanese, Koreans, Taiwanese and Europeans, most of whom have embassies in Hanoi.
Virginia Foote, director of the United States-Vietnam Trade Council, an independent organization supported by American companies, said today that Vietnam, which would like to involve American oil companies in the development of a block of offshore oil concessions in the South China Sea, is being pressed to award contracts soon.
"If Vietnam awards those blocks, that will be pretty much the end of the American role in development of the Vietnamese oil industry," she said.
She added that Japan, in addition to trading with Vietnam, is preparing to resume direct foreign aid in contravention of American wishes. France is at the same time trying to arrange for Vietnam's return to the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, where Washington had consistently vetoed aid to Hanoi.

HEADLINE: British Prime Minister Retreats on Mine Closings

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT

DATELINE: LONDON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
Facing mass public protests and a mutiny among among members of his own Conservative Party in Parliament, Prime Minister John Major reversed ground today and sharply reduced the number of coal mines and miners' jobs scheduled for elimination by the Government.
Less than a week after state-owned British Coal said it was closing 31 of 50 mines and laying off 30,000 workers -- more than three-quarters of Britain's remaining miners -- Michael Heseltine, Secretary for Trade and Industry, told a jeering, raucous session of the House of Commons that the Government now intended to close just 10 mines, at a cost of about 7,500 jobs. 
 Under the revised plan, British Coal will shut down the 10 least viable of its mines, after a 90-day statutory consultation period. Originally, 27 mines were to be closed outright and 4 mothballed over the next five months.
The sharp turn in policy was the latest in a growing number of embarrassments for Mr. Major, whose Government has come under pointed attack in recent weeks for appearing to be adrift and uncertain, just six months after the Prime Minister led the Conservatives to a fourth straight national-election victory over the Labor Party.
Although Mr. Heseltine said the case for closing the intended 31 mines remained "compelling," given the fading market for British coal, he acknowledged that the move had been made too suddenly and caused too much dislocation. As a result, he said, the Government will observe a moratorium on additional closings, pending a public review of the coal industry.
The Prime Minister and members of his Cabinet appeared stunned in recent days by the intensely angry reaction to their announcement last week that they would lay off 30,000 mine workers over the next five months, at a time when as many as 8,000 jobs a week are already being lost in the country's worst recession since the 1930's.
Coal miners and other workers have threatened strikes; tens of thousands of protesters plan a mass march and rally in London next weekend, and newspapers considered to be staunch defenders of the Tory cause have berated the Government, demanding that it reverse course.
By backing off today, Mr. Major hoped to avoid a humiliating rebuff from Conservative back-benchers in the House of Commons, many of whom have threatened to oppose him on Wednesday, when the house is scheduled to vote on the mine closings.
If Mr. Major loses that vote, despite his party's 21-seat majority in Parliament, opposition legislators are likely to seek a vote of no confidence. But while Tory rebels might oppose the Government's coal policy, they are almost certain to rally to Mr. Major on a confidence measure to assure that the Conservatives are not brought down, forcing a new election.
The decision today was the second time in a month that Mr. Major was forced to make a humiliating reversal in economic areas. In mid-September, as turbulence in the international currency markets spread doubts on the future of European union, the Government withdrew the pound from a grid that tied its value to that of other European currencies.
Mr. Major has also been fighting a bitter battle with fellow Conservatives, including former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who are opposed to his support for the Maastricht treaty on European union. The Government faces a battle in the House of Commons when the accord is submitted for ratification this year, as Mr. Major has promised to do.
Several Conservative members of Parliament who had declared that they were determined to oppose the Prime Minister on the proposed coal-mine closings said today that they would now support him in the vote on Wednesday.
"I think the Government has given us 90 percent of what we wanted, and that is an opportunity for a proper examination of what happens next," said one such Tory, Gary Walker.
But Winston Churchill, grandson of the wartime Prime Minister, said that despite the shift, he still intended to oppose Mr. Major's policy on Wednesday. Mr. Churchill and others called on Mr. Heseltine, the architect of the coal policy, to resign.

HEADLINE: CHINESE SHAKE UP TOP PARTY GROUP; FREE MARKET GAINS

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 19

 BODY:
The Communist Party announced a sweeping change in the makeup of its highest executive body today, promoting several enthusiasts of free markets to the seven-member committee that is supposed to rule China for at least the next five years.
The reshaping of the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee is an important victory for those trying to tug the party toward a new world of free markets -- for goods, though not ideas. The shake-up, which included the retirement of two leading hard-liners, sends a clear signal that the party intends to focus its energies not on ideology but on economic restructuring.
 
A Future Power Struggle
 The selection of the seven men as members of the new Standing Committee prepares the battleground for the huge power struggle expected after the death of Deng Xiaoping, China's 88-year-old paramount leader. The seven men will have far more weight than any one else in determining the direction of China after Mr. Deng dies.
While Mr. Deng holds no official position, he clearly was the prime force in picking the new Standing Committee. But as his health deteriorates, he is unlikely to be able to influence it in the way he has in the past.
Mr. Deng emerged today to congratulate the new leaders, in his first televised appearance in eight months. He seemed very frail and his facial expression barely changed. Still, he managed to walk about and wave to the cheering delegates of the just-ended Communist Party congress.
 
Helped by His Daughter
 "The congress was a great success," Mr. Deng said, according to the official New China News Agency. "I hope all people will continue to work hard."
Mr. Deng is known to be virtually deaf and to have difficulty articulating his words, and from the Chinese television footage it appeared that his daughter Deng Rong, who held his arm the entire time, had to repeat his remarks on some occasions so others could understand him. She also spoke into his ear to tell him what people were saying to him.
While Mr. Deng is said to be more alert in the mornings, it is still not entirely clear how a man in such a physical state can exert such a grip over national affairs. One partial answer to this puzzle is that he focuses only on setting broad policy guidelines and on choosing personnel at the highest level. Even so, some Chinese wonder if those around Mr. Deng may be manipulating him or else manipulating the country by sometimes speaking in his name.
It is impossible to know how the new leaders will act once they are freed of Mr. Deng's supervision. But so far there is no sign that they favor a political liberalization to go along with the economic changes that have opened large segments of the Chinese economy to market forces.
Jiang Zemin, the Communist Party General Secretary, remains the head of the Standing Committee. As a stereo system played "Descendants of the Dragon," a ballad that ironically was written by a pro-democracy campaigner expelled from China two years ago, Mr. Jiang strode into a large room in the Great Hall of the People and introduced the other members of the new Standing Committee to several hundred foreign reporters.
 
A Different Atmosphere
 Five years ago, the newly chosen Standing Committee walked around the room, bantering with journalists, but this time the atmosphere was entirely different. As soon as they had been introduced, the members hurried out of the room, some looking nervously over their shoulders at the mobs of journalists shouting questions at them.
One of the most important appointments today was the elevation to the Standing Committee of Zhu Rongji, a former Shanghai Mayor who is sometimes labeled "China's Gorbachev" because of his aggressive efforts to restructure the economy. Mr. Zhu, who is 64, has risen very rapidly and is the leading candidate to replace Prime Minister Li Peng if Mr. Li is edged out when his term expires next spring.
"Now the reformers finally have some advocates in the highest ranks," a Western diplomat said. "It's unrealistic to think that they will lead to a Western parliamentary system. But there probably will be dramatic changes in the economy, and that will lead to political changes even if they don't want that to happen."
The youngest of the new Standing Committee members is Hu Jintao, the 49-year-old party secretary in Tibet. Mr. Hu has played a central role in crushing dissent in Tibet, where troops have fired machine guns on protesting Buddhist monks and nuns, and yet he is generally considered a reformer.
In part this is because Mr. Hu endorsed the repression for practical rather than ideological reasons. Moreover, he was a protege of Hu Yaobang, a former Communist Party leader who sought far-reaching change. On the other hand, Hu Jintao was also promoted early in his career by Song Ping, a hard-liner, and so the accuracy of the labels is open to question.
The other new addition to the Standing Committee is Gen. Liu Huaqing, a 76-year-old army veteran who has tried to make the military forces professional and modern rather like those in the West.
Three other party leaders have been retained from the previous Standing Committee: Mr. Li, the Prime Minister; Qiao Shi, who is in charge of internal security, and Li Ruihuan, who looks after ideology and propaganda. Most Chinese regard Li Peng as a hard-liner and Li Ruihuan as a reformer, with Mr. Jiang and Mr. Qiao somewhere in between.
Those dropped from the Standing Committee were Yao Yilin, the head of the central planning apparatus, and Mr. Song, the hard-liner who has been in charge of party organization.
In addition to the seven chosen to serve on the Standing Committee, 13 others were chosen regular members of the Politburo. The full Politburo meets about once a month, with many other party officials present as well.
The Standing Committee, on the other hand, normally meets at least once a week, with much less ceremony. It is by far the more important body.
Aside from the seven serving on the Standing Committee, 11 officials were elevated to the full Politburo for the first time: Ding Guangen, Mr. Deng's bridge partner; Li Lanqing, the Trade Minister; Qian Qichen, the Foreign Minister; Yang Baibing, a general; Wu Bangguo, the party leader in Shanghai; Zou Jiahua, a Deputy Prime Minister; Chen Xitong, the Mayor of Beijing; Jiang Chunyun, the party leader in Shandong Province; Wei Jianxing, the Minister of Supervision; Xie Fei, the party leader in Guangdong Province, and Tan Shaowen, the party leader in the city of Tianjin.
Two others who had served on the previous Politburo were retained on the present one: Tian Jiyun, who oversees agriculture, and Li Tieying, the Education Minister.
There is a sense in Beijing that other changes -- in policies and personnel -- are likely to follow soon. At People's Daily, for instance, an official spokeswoman paused when she was asked if the hard-line publisher, Gao Di, was still holding his job.
"Well," she said uncertainly, "I have no information that he's no longer serving as publisher."

Transcript of 3d TV Debate Between Bush, Clinton and Perot

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of the Presidential debate at Michigan State University in East Lansing last night between President Bush, Gov. Bill Clinton and Ross Perot, as recorded by The New York Times:
 
Credibility and Believability
 
 Q: Gentlemen, again, welcome and again good evening. It seems from what those voters said at your Richmond debate and from polling and other data that each of you fairly or not faces serious voter concerns about the underlying credibility and believability of what each of you says you would do as President in the next four years. Governor Clinton, in accordance with the draw, those concerns about you are first. You are promising to create jobs, reduce the deficit, reform the health care system, rebuild the infrastructure, guarantee college education for everyone who is qualified among many other things; all with financial pain only for the very rich. Some people are having trouble, apparently, believing that is possible. Should they have that concern?
CLINTON: No. There are many people who believe that the only way we can get this country turned around is to tax the middle class more and punish them more. But the truth is that middle-class Americans are basically the only group of Americans who have been taxed more in the 1980's and during the last 12 years even though their incomes have gone down. The wealthiest Americans have been taxed much less even though their incomes have gone up. Middle-class people will have their fair share of changing to do and many challenges to face, including the challenge of becoming constantly re-educated. But my plan is a departure from trickle-down economics, just cutting taxes on the wealthiest Americans and getting out of the way. It's also a departure from tax-and-spend economics because you can't tax and divide an economy that isn't growing.
I propose an American version of what works in other countries. I think we can do it better, invest and grow. I believe we can increase investment and reduce the deficit at the same time if we not only ask the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their fair share. We also provide over $100 billion in tax relief in terms of incentives for new plants, new small businesses, new technologies, new housing and for middle-class families.
And we have $140 billion of spending cuts, invest and grow. Raise some more money, spend the money on tax incentives to have growth in the private sector, take the money from the defense cuts and reinvest it in new transportation and communications and environmental cleanup systems.
This will work. On this, as on so many other issues, I have a fundamental difference from the present Administration. I don't believe trickle-down economics will work; unemployment is up; most people are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago. I think we can do better if we have the courage to change.
Q: Mr. President, a response. Specifically ----
BUSH: There's one minute -- now, just the ground rules here.
Q: Well, yes, roughly one minute. We can loosen that up a little bit, but go ahead.
BUSH: He doesn't like trickle-down government, but I think he's talking about the Reagan-Bush years where we created 15 million jobs. The rich are paying a bigger percent of the total tax burden. And what I don't like is trickle-down government. And therein I think Governor Clinton keeps talking about trickle down, trickle down, and he's still talking about spending more and taxing more. Government, he says, invest government, grow government. Government doesn't create jobs. If they do, they're make-work jobs.
It's the private sector that creates jobs. And, yes, we've got too many taxes on the American people and we're spending too much. And that's why I want to get the deficit down by controlling the growth of mandatory spending. It won't be painless. I think Mr. Perot put his finger on something there. It won't be painless, but we've got to get the job done. But not by raising taxes. Mr. and Mrs. America, when you hear him say 'We're going to tax only the rich,' watch your wallet. Because his figures don't add up and he's going to sock it right to the middle-class taxpayer and lower, if he's going to pay for all the spending programs he proposes. So we have a big difference on this trickle-down theory. I do not want any more trickle-down Government. It's gotten too big. I want to do something about that.
Q: Mr. Perot, what do you think of the Governor's approach, what he just laid out?
PEROT: The basic problem with it, it doesn't balance the budget. If you forecast it out we'll still have a significant deficit under each of their plans as I understand them. Our challenge is to stop the financial bleeding. If you take a patient into the hospital that's bleeding arterially, step one is to stop the bleeding. And we are bleeding arterially. There's only one way out of this and that is to stop the deterioration of our job base, to have a growing, expanding job base to give us the tax base. See, balancing the budget is not nearly as difficult as paying off the $4 trillion debt and leaving our children the American Dream intact. We have spent their money, we've got to pay it back. This is going to take fair, shared sacrifice. My plan balances the budget within six years. We didn't do it faster than that because we didn't want to disrupt the economy. We gave it off to a slow start and a fast finish to give the economy time to recover.
But we faced it and we did it. And we believe it's fair share and sacrifice. The onething I have done is lay it squarely on the table in front of the American people. You've had a number of occasions to see in detail what the plan is and at least you'll understand it. I think that's fundamental in our country; that you know what you're getting into.
 
Pain and Suffering
 Q: Governor, the word pain -- one of the other leadership things that's put on you is that you don't speak of pain. That you speak of, of all things -- nobody's going to really have to suffer under your plan. You heard what Mr. Perot has said; he said it's got -- to do the things that you want to do, you can't do it by just taking the money from the rich. That's what the President says as well. How do you respond to that, if the numbers don't add up?
CLINTON: For one thing, let me just follow up here. I disagree with Mr. Perot that the answer is to raise -- put a 50 cents gas tax on the middle-class and raise more taxes on the middle class and the working poor than on the wealthy. His own analysis says that unemployment will be slightly higher in 1995 under his plan than it is today. And as far as what Mr. Bush says, he is the person who raised taxes on the middle-class after saying he wouldn't and just this year Mr. Bush vetoed the tax increase on the wealthy that gave middle-class tax relief. He vetoed middle-class tax relief this year. And furthermore, under this Administration, spending is increased more than it has in the last 20 years and he asked Congress to spend more money than it actually spent.
Now it's hard to outspend Congress but he tried to for the last three years. So, my view is that the middle class is the one -- they've been suffering, Jim. Now, should people pay more for Medicare if they can? Yes. Should they pay more for Social Security if they get more out of it than they've paid in and they're upper-income people? Yes. But look what's happened to the middle class. Middle-class Americans are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago and they're paying higher taxes. The tax burden on them has not gone down. It has gone up. I don't think the answer is to slow the economy down more, drive unemployment up more and undermine the health of the private sector.
The answer is to invest and grow this economy. That's what works in other countries and that's what'll work here.
Q: As a practical matter, Mr. President, do you agree with the Governor when he says that the middle class -- the taxes on the middle class -- do your numbers agree that the middle -- the taxes on the middle class have gone up during the last ----
BUSH: I think everybody's paying too much taxes. He refers to one tax increase. Let me remind you it was a Democratic tax increase and I didn't want to do it and I went along with it. And I said I make a mistake -- if I make a mistake, I admit it. That's quite different than some. But I think that's the American way. I think everyone's paying too much. But I think this idea that you can go out and -- he, then he hits me for vetoing a tax bill. Yes, I did. And the American taxpayer ought to be glad they have a President to stand up to a spending Congress. We remember what it was like when we had a spending President and a spending Congress and interest rates -- who, who remembers that? They were at 21.5 percent under Jimmy Carter. And inflation was 15.
We don't want to go back to that. And so yes, everybody's taxed too much and I want to get the taxes down. But not by signing a tax bill that's going to raise taxes on people.
Q: Mr. President, when you said just then that, you admit your mistakes and you looked at Governor Clinton and said, what mistake is it that you want him to admit to?
BUSH: Well, the record in Arkansas. I mean look at it. And that's what we're asking America to have. Now look, he says Arkansas is a poor state. They are. But in almost every category they're lagging. I'll give you an example. He talks about all the jobs he's created in one or two years. Over the last 10 years since he's been Governor, they're 30 percent behind -- 30 percent -- they're 30 percent of the national average, on pay for teachers, on all these categories Arkansas is right near the very bottom. I'll -- you haven't heard me mention this before, but we're getting close now and I think it's about time I start putting things in perspective and I'm going to do that. It's not dirty campaigning, because he's been talking about my record for a half a -- half a year here -- 11 months here.
And so we've got to do that. I got to get it in perspective. What's his mistake? Admit it! That Arkansas is doing very, very badly against any standard -- environment, support for police officers, whatever it is.
Q: Governor, is that true?
CLINTON: Mr. Bush's Bureau of Labor Statistics says Arkansas ranks first in the country in the growth of new jobs this year -- first.
BUSH: This year.
CLINTON: Fourth in manufacturing jobs, fourth in the reduction of poverty, fourth in income increase. Over the last 10 years, we've created manufacturing jobs much more rapidly than the national average. Over the last five years, our income has grown more rapidly than the national average. We are second in tax burden -- the second-lowest tax burden in the country. We have the lowest per capita state and local spending in the country. We're low spending, low tax burden; we dramatically increased investment and our jobs are growing. I wish America had that kind of record, and I think most people looking at us tonight would like it if we had more jobs and a lower spending burden on the Government.
Q: Mr. Perot, if you were sitting at home now and just heard this exchange about Arkansas, who would you believe?
PEROT: I grew up five blocks from Arkansas. Let's -- let's put it in perspective. It's a beautiful state, it's a fairly rural state, it has a population less than Chicago or Los Angeles, about the size of Dallas and Fort Worth combined. So I think probably we're making a mistake night after night after night to cast the nation's future on a unit that small.
Q: Why is that a mistake?
PEROT: It's irrelevant. You know, Jim, I ----
Q: What he did as Governor of Arkansas is irrelevant?
PEROT: Oh, no, no, but you can't -- I could say that I ran a small grocery store on the corner, therefore I extrapolate that into the fact that I could run Wal-Mart; that's not true.
Q: Mr. Perot --
Q: Governor --
PEROT: I can't protect an Arkansas company --
Q: Governor --
CLINTON: Mr. Perot, with all respect, I think it highly relevant and I think that a $4 billion budget, with state and Federal funds, is not all that small. And I think the fact that I took a state that was one of the poorest states in the country and had been for 153 years and tried my best to modernize its economy and to make the kind of changes that had generated support from people like the presidents of Apple Computer and Hewlett Packard, and some of the biggest companies in this country, 24 retired generals and admirals and hundreds of business executives are highly relevant, and you know, I'm frankly amazed that, since you grew up five blocks from there you would think that what goes on in that state is irrelevant. I think it's been pretty impressive. And the people who have jobs, the people who have jobs and educations and opportunities that didn't have them 10 years ago don't think it's irrelevant at all. They think it's highly relevant and they wish the rest of the ----
BUSH: I don't have a dog in this fight, but I'd like to get in on it. Governor Clinton has to operate under a balanced budget amendment. He has to do it. That is the law. I'd like to see a balanced budget amendment for America to protect the American taxpayers. And then that would discipline, not only the Executive Branch but the spending Congress, the Congress that's been in control of one party, his party for 38 years. And we almost had it done and that institution, the House of Representatives, everyone's yelling clean house, one of the reasons is, we almost had it done and the Speaker, a very able, decent fellow, I might add, but he twisted the arms of some of the sponsors of that legislation and had them change their vote. What's relevant here is that tool, that discipline that he has to live by in Arkansas and I'd like it for the American people. I want the line-item veto, I want to check off, so if the Congress can't do it, let people check off their income tax, 10 percent of it to compel the Government to cut spending. And if they can't do it, if the Congress can't do it, let them then have to do it across the board, a -- what we call a sequester. That's the discipline we need. And I'm working for that, to protect the American taxpayer against the big spenders.
 
Leadership at Home
 Q: Mr. President let's move to some of the leadership concerns that have been voiced about you and they relate to something you said in your closing statement in Richmond the other night about the President being the manager of crises and that relates to an earlier criticism that you began to focus on the economy, on health care, on racial divisions in this country only after they became crises. Is that a fair criticism?
BUSH: Jim, I don't think that's a fair shot. I hear it, I hear it echoed by political opponents, but I don't think it's fair. I think we've been fighting for Day 1 to do something about the inner cities. I'm for enterprise zones. I have had it in every single proposal I've sent to the Congress.
And now we hear a lot of talk: Oh, well, they all want enterprise zones. And yet the House and the Senate can't send it down without loading it up with a lot of, you know, these Christmas tree ornaments they put on the legislation.
I don't think in racial, ah, racial harmony that I'm a laggard on that. I've been speaking out since Day 1. We've gotten the Americans for Disabilities Act, which I think is one of the foremost pieces of civil rights legislation.
And, yes, it took me to veto two civil rights quota bills, because I don't believe in quotas. And I don't think the American people believe in quotas. And I beat back the Congress on that, and then we passed a decent civil rights bill that offers guarantees against discrimination in employment. And that is good.
I've spoken out over and over again against anti-Semitism and racism. And I think my record as a member of Congress speaks for itself on that.
What was the other part of it?
Q: Well, it's just that -- you've spoken to it. I mean, but the idea, not so much in specific -- --
BUSH: Yes ----
Q: ---- but that it has to be a crisis before you -- it gets your attention.
BUSH: I don't think that's true at all. I don't think that's true. But, you know, let others fire away on it.
Q: Do you think that's true, Mr. Perot?
PEROT: I'd like to just talk about issues and so ----
Q: You don't think this is an issue?
PEROT: No, well, no. But the point is that's a subjective thing. See, the subjective thing is when does President Bush react. And I, I feel it would be very difficult for me to answer that in any short period of time.
Q: Well, then, let's phrase -- I'll phrase it differently, then.
PEROT: Let's ----
Q: He said the other night in his closing words in Richmond that one of the key things that he believes the American people should decide between, among, the three of you is who they want in charge if this country gets to a crisis. Now, that's what he said and, and the rap on the President is that it's only crises time that he focuses on some of these things. So my question to you -- we're going to talk about you in a minute. My question about you ----
PEROT: I thought you'd forgotten I was here.
Q: No, no, no, no, no, no. But my question to you is -- if you have nothing to say about it, fine. I'll got to Governor Clinton. But ah ----
PEROT: No. I will, I will let the American people decide that. I would rather not critique the two candidates.
Q: All right. Governor, what do you think?
CLINTON: The only thing I would say about that is I think that on the economy Mr. Bush said for a long time there was no recession and then said it would be better to do nothing than to have a compromise effort with the Congress. He really didn't have a new economic program until over 1,300 days into his Presidency, and not all of his health care initiative has been presented to the Congress, even now.
I think it's important to elect a President who is committed to getting this economy going again and who realizes we have to abandon trickle-down economics and put the American people first again and who will send programs to the Congress in the first hundred days to deal with the critical issues that America is crying out for leadership on -- jobs, incomes, the health care crisis, the need to control the economy. Those things deserve to be dealt with from Day 1. I will deal with them from Day 1. They will be my first priority, not my election year concern.
Q: Mr. President.
BUSH: Well, I think you're overlooking that we have had major accomplishments in the first term. But if you're talking about protecting the taxpayer against his friends in the United States Congress, go back to what it was like when you had a Democratic President and a Democratic Congress. You don't have to go back to Herbert Hoover. Go back to Jimmy Carter. And interest rates were 21 percent. Inflation was 15 percent. The misery index -- unemployment and inflation added together -- it was invented by the Democrats -- went right through the roof. We've cut it in half. And all you hear about is how bad things are. You know, remember the question: Are you better off? Well, is a home buyer better off if he can refinance the home because interest rates are down? Is the senior citizen better off because inflation is not wiping out their family's savings? I think they are. Is the guy out of work better off? Of course he's not. But he's not going to be better off if we grow the Government, if we invest, as Government Clinton -- Governor Clinton says, invest in more Government. You've got to free up the private sector. You've got to let small business have more incentives.
For three months -- three quarters -- I've been fighting -- three quarters been fighting to get the Congress to pass some incentives for small business: capital gains, investment tax allowance, credit for first-time home buyers. And it's blocked by the Congress, and then if a little of it comes my way, they load it up with Christmas trees and tax increases. And I have to stand up and favor the taxpayer.
 
Staying the Course
 Q: I have to let -- we have to talk about Ross Perot now, or he'll get me, I'm sure. Mr. Perot, on this issue that I have raised at the very beginning that we've been talking about which is leadership, as President of the United States, it concerns, my reading of it at least, my concerns about you as expressed by folks in the polls and other places. It goes like this; you've got a problem with General Motors. You took your $750 million and you left. You had a problem in the spring and summer about some personal hits that you took as a potential candidate for President of the United States and you, you walked out. Does that say anything relevant to how you would function as President of the United States?
PEROT: I think the General Motors thing is very relevant. I did everything I could to get General Motors to face its problems in the mid-80's while it was still financially strong; they just wouldn't do it. And everybody now knows the terrible price they're paying by waiting until it's obvious to the brain dead that they have problems. Now, hundreds -- thousands of good, decent people; whole cities up here in this state are adversely impacted because they would not move in a timely way. Our Government is at that point now. The thing that I am in this race for is to tap the American people on the shoulder and to say to every single one of you, fix it while we're still relatively strong. If you have a heart problem you don't wait until a heart attack to address it.
So the General Motors experience is relevant. At the point when I could not get them to address those problems, I had created so much stress in the board who wanted just to keep the Lawrence Welk music going that they asked to buy my remaining shares. I sold them my remaining shares. They went their way, I went my way, because it was obvious we had a complete disagreement about what should be done with the company.
But let's take my life in perspective. Again and again on complex, difficult tasks I have stayed the course. When I was asked by our Government to do the P.O.W. project, within the year the Vietnamese had sent people into Canada to make arrangements to have me and my family killed -- and I had five small children -- and my family and I decided we would stay the course. And we lived with that problem for three years.
Then I got into the Texans' War on Drug program and big-time drug dealers got all upset. Then when I had two people imprisoned in Iran, I could have left them there, I could have rationalized it. We went over, we got them out, we brought them back home. And since then, for years I have lived with the burden of the Middle East, where it's an "eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth" country in terms of their unhappiness with the fact that I was successful in that effort.
Again and again and again in the middle of the night and 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning my Government has called me to take extraordinary steps for Americans in distress. And again and again and again I have responded. And I didn't wilt and I didn't quit.
Now, what happened in July we've covered again and again and again. But I think in terms of the American people's concern about my commitment, I'm here tonight folks. I've never quit supporting you as you put me on the ballot in the other 26 states. And when you asked me to come back in, I came back in. And talk about not quitting? I'm spending my money on this campaign. Your two parties are spending your money, taxpayer money. I -- I've put my wallet on the table for you and your children, over $60 million at least, will go into this campaign to leave the American dream to you and your children, to get this country straightened out because if anybody owes it to you, I do. I've lived the American dream. I'd like for your children to be able to live it, too.
Q: Governor, does -- do you have a response to the staying the course question about Mr. Perot?
CLINTON: I don't have any criticism of Mr. Perot. I think the -- what I'd like to talk about a minute is, since you're asking the question, was the -- the General Motors issue. I don't think there's any question that the automobile executives made some errors in the 1980's. But I also think we should look at how much productivity has increased lately, how much labor has done to increase productivity and how much management has done. And we're still losing a lot of auto jobs, in my judgment, because we don't have a national economic strategy that will build the industrial base of this country. Now just today I met with the presidents and the vice presidents of the Willow Run union here -- near here. They both said they were Vietnam veterans supporting me because I had an economic program to put them back to work.
We need an investment, incentive to modernize plant and equipment. We've got to control the health care costs for those people, otherwise we can't keep manufacturing jobs here, and we need a tough trade policy that is fair, that insists on open markets in return for open markets. We ought to have a strategy that will build the economic and industrial place. So I think Mr. Perot was right in questioning the management practices, but they didn't have much of a partner in Government here as compared with the policies the Germans and the Japanese followed, and I believe we can do better. That's one of the things I want to change. We -- I know that we can grow manufacturing jobs. We did it in my state and we can do it nationally.
Q: Mr. President, do you have a response?
BUSH: To this?
Q: Yes.
BUSH: Well, I wondered when Governor Clinton was talking to the auto workers whether he talked about his and Senator Gore's favoring CAFE standards. Those fuel-efficiency standards of 40 miles per gallon. That would break the auto industry and throw a lot of people out of work.
As regarding Mr. Perot, I take back something I said about him. I once said in a frivolous moment when he got out of the race, if you can't stand the heat buy an air-conditioning company. And I take it back. Because I think he ex-- he said he made a mistake. And the thing I find is if I make a mistake I admit it. I've never heard Governor Clinton make a mistake. But the one mistake he's made is fuel-efficiency standards at 40 to 45 miles per gallon will throw many auto workers out of work and you can't have it both ways. There's a pattern here of appealing to the auto workers and then trying to appeal to the spotted owl crowd. Or the extremes in the environmental movement. You can't do it as President. You can't have a pattern of one side of the issue one day and another the next. So my argument is not with Ross Perot. It is more with Governor Clinton.
Q: Governor, what about that charge? That you want it both ways on this issue.
CLINTON: Let's just talk about the CAFE standards.
Q: All right.
CLINTON: That's the fuel-efficiency standards that are now 27.5 miles per gallon per automobile free, fleet. I never said, and I defy you to find where I said -- I gave an extensive environmental speech in April. And I said that we ought to have a goal of raising the fuel-efficiency standards to 40 miles a gallon. I think that should be a goal. I've never said we should write it into law if there is evidence that that goal cannot be achieved. The National Science Foundation did a study which said it would be difficult for us to reach fuel-efficiency standards in excess of 37 miles per gallon for the year 2000. I think we should try to raise the fuel efficiency. And let me say this. I think we ought to have incentives to do it. I think we ought to push to do it. That doesn't mean we have to write it into the law.
Look, I am a job creator, not a job destroyer. It is the Bush Administration that has had no new jobs in the private sector in the last four years. In my state we're leading the country in private-sector job growth but it is good for America to improve fuel efficiency. We also ought to concert -- convert more fuel vehicles to compressed natural gas. That's another way to improve the environment.
Q: Mr. Perot, based on your experience at General Motors, where do you come down in this? This has been thrown about, back and forth during this campaign, from the very beginning about jobs and CAFE standards.
PEROT: Well, everybody's nibbling around the edges; let's go to the center of the bull's-eye, the core problem -- and believe, me, everybody on the factory floor all over this country knows it. You implement that Nafta, the Mexican trade agreement, where they pay people $1 an hour, have no health care, no retirement, no pollution controls, etc., etc., etc., and you're going to hear a giant sucking sound of jobs being pulled out of this country right at a time when we need the tax base to pay the debt, and pay down the interest on the debt and get our house back in order. We've got to proceed very carefully on that. See, there's a lot I don't understand. I do understand business, I do understand creating jobs, I do understand how to make things work. And I got a long history of doing that.
Now if you want to go to the core problem that faces everybody in manufacturing in this country, it's that agreement that's about to be put into practice. Here's -- it's very simple, everybody says it'll create jobs. Yes, it'll create bubble jobs -- you know, watch this, listen very carefully to this --one-time surge while we build factories and ship machine tools and equipment down there. Then year after year, for decades, they will have jobs. And I finally thought I didn't understand it -- called all the experts and they said, "Oh, it'll be disruptive for 12 to 15 years." We haven't got 12 days, folks. We cannot lose those jobs. They were eventually saying Mexican jobs will eventually come to $7.50 an hour, ours will eventually go down to $7.50 an hour. Makes you feel real good to hear that, right?
Let's think it through here, let's be careful. I'm for free trade philosophically but I have studied these trade agreements till the world has gone flat and we don't have good trade agreements across the world.
I hope we'll have a chance to get into that tonight because I can get right to the center bull's eye and tell you why we're losing whole industries in this country. Excuse me.
Q: Just for the record though, Mr. Perot, I take it then for your answer you do not have as position on whether or not enforcing the CAFE standards will cost jobs in the auto industry.
PEROT: Oh, no, it will cost jobs. But, that's not -- let me say this, I'd rather -- if you gave me two bad choices, I'd rather have some jobs left here than just see everything head South, see.
Q: So that means no -- In other words, you agree with President Bush, is that right?
PEROT: No, I'm -- I'm saying our principal need now is to stabilize the tax base, which is the job base, and create a growing dynamic base. Now please folks, if you don't hear anything else I say, remember where the tax -- millions of people at work are our tax base. One quick thought; if you confiscate the Forbes 400 wealth, take it off, you cannot balance the budget this year.
PEROT: It kind of gets your head straight about where the taxes, year in and year out, have got to come from: millions and millions of people at work.
Q: Yes, sir.
BUSH: Well, I'm caught -- caught in the middle on Nafta. Ross says, with great conviction, he opposes the North American Free Trade Agreement. I am for the North American Free Trade Agreement. My problem with Governor Clinton once again, is that one time he's going to make up his mind he will see some merit in it, but then he sees a lot of things wrong with it. And then the other day he says he's for it, however, then we've got to pass other legislation. When you're President of the United States, you cannot have this pattern of saying well I'm for it but I'm on the other side of it. And it's true on this and it's true on CAFE.
Look, if Ross were right, and we get a free trade agreement with Mexico, why wouldn't they have gone down there now. You have a differential in wages right now. I just have an honest philosophical difference. I think free trade is going to expand our job opportunity. I think it is exports that have saved us when we're in a global slowdown, a connected global slowdown, a recession in some countries. And it's free trade, fair trade that needs to be our -- our -- our hallmark. And we need more free trade agreements, not fewer.
Q: Governor, a quick answer on trade then I want to go on to something else.
CLINTON: I'd like to respond to that. You know, Mr. Bush was very grateful when I was among the Democrats who said he ought to have the authority to negotiate an agreement with Mexico. Neither I nor anybody else, as far as I know, agreed to give him our proxy to say that whatever he did was fine for the workers of this country and for the interests of this country. I am the one who's in the middle on this. Mr. Perot says it's a bad deal. Mr. Bush says it's a hunky-dory deal. I say on balance it does more good than harm if -- if we can get some protection for the environment so that the Mexicans have to follow their own environmental standards, their own labor law standards and if we have a genuine commitment to re-educate and retrain the American workers who lose their jobs and reinvest in this economy.
I have a realistic approach to trade. I want more trade. And I know there are some good things in that agreement. But it can sure be made better. Let me just point out: Just today in The Los Angeles Times, Clyde Prestowitz, who was one of President Reagan's leading trade advisers, and a life-long conservative Republican, endorsed my candidacy because he knows that I'll have a free and fair trade policy, a hard-headed realistic policy, and not get caught up in rubber-stamping everything the Bush Administration did. If I wanted to do that, why would I run for President, Jim? Anybody else can run the middle class down and run the economy in a ditch. I want to change it. We've got ----
BUSH: I think he made my case. On the one hand it's a good deal but on the other hand I'd make it better.
Q: All right. We've got ----
BUSH: You can't do that as President. You can't do it on the war, where he says, well, I was with the minor -- minority but I guess I would have voted with the majority. This is my point tonight. We're talking about two weeks from now you've got to decide who's going to be President. And there is this pattern that has plagued him in the primaries and now about trying to have it both ways on all these issues. You can't do that. And if you make a mistake, say you made a mistake and go on about your business, trying to serve the American people.
Right now we heard it. Ross is against it. I am for it. He says on the one hand, I'm for it -- on the other I may be against it.
CLINTON: That's what's wrong with Mr. Bush. His whole deal is you've got to be for it or against it. You can't make it better. I believe we can be better. I think the American people are sick and tired of either-or solutions, people being pushed in the corner, polarized to extremes. I think they want somebody with common sense who can do what's best for the American people. And I'd be happy to discuss these other issues. But I can't believe he is accusing me of getting on both sides. He said trickle-down economics is voodoo economics. Now he's its biggest practitioner.
He promised, you know ----
BUSH: I've always said trickle-down Government is best.
CLINTON: I could run this string out a long time, but remember this, Jim; those 209 Americans last Thursday night in Richmond told us they wanted us to stop talking about each other and start talking about Americans and their problems and their promise, and I think we ought to get back to that. I'll be glad to answer any question you have, but this election ought to be about the American people.
Q: Mr. Perot?
PEROT: Is there an equal-time rule here tonight?
BUSH: Yes.
PEROT: Or do you just keep lunging in at will? I thought we were going to have equal time but maybe I just have to interrupt the other two, is that the way it works?
Q: Mr. Perot, you're doing fine. Go ahead. Whatever you want to say, say it.
PEROT: Now that we've talked all around the problem about free trade, let's go, again, to the center of the bull's-eye.
Q: I thought you wanted to respond to what we're talking about.
PEROT: I do. I do. I just want to make sure -- foreign lobbyists, this whole thing, our country has sold out to foreign lobbyists. We don't have free trade. Both parties have foreign lobbyists on leaves and key roles in the campaigns. And if there's anything more unwise than that I don't know what it is.
Every debate I bring this up, nobody ever addresses it. I would like for them to look you in the eye and tell you why they have people representing foreign countries working on their campaigns. And, you know, you've seen the list. I've seen the list. We won't go into the names, but no wonder they -- if I had those people around me all day every day telling me what's fair and free, I might believe it. But if I look at the facts as a businessman, it's so tilted, the first thing you ought to do is just say guys, if you like these deals so well, we'll give you the deal you gave us.
Now, Japanese couldn't unload the cars in this country if we -- if they had the same restrictions we had, and on, and on, and on and on. I suggest to you that the core problem; one country spent $400 million lobbying in 1988, our country. And it goes on and on, and you look at a Who's Who in these campaigns, around the two candidates, they're foreign lobbyists taking leaves. What do you think they're going to do when the campaign's over? Go back to work at $30,000 a month representing some other country. I don't believe that's in the American people's interest.
I don't have a one of them, and I haven't taken a penny of foreign money, and I never will.
 
Role of Lobbyists
 Q: Mr. President, how do you respond to that? Mr. Perot's made that charge several times. The fact that you have people working in your campaign who are paid foreign lobbyists.
BUSH: Most of the people that are lobbying are lobbying the Congress. And I don't think there's anything wrong with an honest person who happens to represent an interest of another country from making his case. That's the American way. And what you're assuming is that that makes the recipient of the lobbying corrupt, or the lobbyist himself corrupt. I don't agree with that. But if I found somebody that was -- had a conflict of interest that would try to illegally do something as a foreign registered lobby, the laws cover this. I don't know why -- I've never understood quite why Mr. Perot was so upset about it because one of the guys he used to have working for him, I believe, had -- had foreign accounts. Could be wrong, but I think so.
PEROT: And as soon as I found it out, he went out the door. Truth, yes!
BUSH: I don't -- I think you got to look at the integrity and the honor of the people who are being lobbied, and those that are lobbyists. The laws protect the American taxpayer in this regard if the laws are violated so much, but to suggest if somebody represents a foreign country on anything that makes him corrupt, or against the taxpayer, I don't agree with that.
PEROT: One quick relevant specific: We're getting ready to dismantle an airlines industry in our country, and none of you know it. And I doubt, in all candor, if the President knows it. But this deal that we're doing with BAC and USAir and KLM and Northwest -- now guess who's on the President's campaign big-time? A guy from Northwest. This deal is terribly destructive to the U.S. airline industry; one of the largest industries in the world is the travel and tourist business.
We won't be making airplanes in this country 10 years from now if we let deals like this go through. I can -- if the press has any interest tonight, I'll detail it to you. I won't take 10 minutes tonight. All these things take a few minutes, but that's happening as we sit here today. We hammerlock the American companies, American Airlines, Delta, the last few great we have, because we're trying to do this deal with these two European companies. And never forget, they've got Airbus over there and it's a government-owned, privately-owned consortium across Europe. They're dying to get the commercial airline business. Japan is trying to get the commercial airline business. I don't think there are any villains inside Government on this issue, but there sure are a lot of people who don't understand business. And maybe you need somebody up there who understands when you're getting your pocket picked.
Q: All right. We have to -- Governor I'm sorry but that concludes my time with ----
CLINTON: Boy, I had a great response to that.
Q: All right, go ahead quick -- quickly.
CLINTON: Just very briefly.
Q: Yeah.
CLINTON: I think Ross is right and that we do need some more restrictions on lobbyists. We ought to make them disclose the people they've given money to when they're testifying before congressional committees. We ought to close the lawyers loophole. They ought to have to disclose when they're really lobbying. And we ought to limit the -- we ought to have a much longer period of time, about five years, between the time when people can leave the Executive Branch offices and then go out and start lobbying for foreign interest. I agree with that. We've wrecked the airline industry already because -- well there's all these leveraged buyouts and all these terrible things that have happened to the airline industry. We're going to have a hard time rebuilding it, but the real thing we've got to have is a competitive economic strategy. Look what's happening to McDonnell Douglas, even Boeing is losing market share, because we let the Europeans spend 25 to 40 billion dollars on Airbus without an appropriate competitive response. What I want America to do is to trade more but to compete and win by investing in competitive ways and we're in real trouble on that.
Q: I'm going to be in real trouble if I don't bring out -- it's now time ----
BUSH: I promise it's less than 10 seconds.
Q: O.K.
BUSH: I heard Governor Clinton congratulate us on one thing -- first time he said something pleasant about this Administration. Productivity in this country is up. It is way up. Productivity is up, and that's a good thing. There are many other good ones, but I was glad he acknowledged that. Thank you.
Q: Now we're going to move to the second half ----
PEROT: Now give me one second. I volunteered now and all -- I mean, now, look, I'm just kind of a, you know, cur dog here. I was put on the ballot by the people, not the special interests. So have to stand up for myself. Now, Jim, let me net it out. On the second debate, I offered, since both sides want the enterprise zones we can't get together -- I said, I 'll take a few days off, go to Washington and hold hands with you and we'll get it done. I'll take a few days off, hold hands with you and get this airline things straightened out, because that's important to this country.
That's kind of pathetic I have to do it and nobody's called me yet to come up, I might mention. But if they do ----
Q: I want to ----
PEROT: If they do it's easy to fix. If you all want the enterprise zone, why don't we pass the dang thing and do it, right?
Q: All right, now we're going to bring in the three other journalists to ask questions. They are Susan Rook of CNN, Gene Gibbons of Reuters and Helen Thomas of United Press International.
You thought you'd never get in here, did you?
Q: Good evening, gentlemen. Good evening.
Q: O.K., we're going to continue on the subject of leadership and the first question goes to Governor Clinton for a two-minute answer. It will be asked by Helen Thomas. Helen?
 
The Draft and Vietnam
 Q: Governor Clinton, your credibility has come into question because of your different responses on the Vietnam draft. If you had it to do over again, would you put on the nation's uniform and if elected, could you in good conscience send someone to war?
CLINTON: If I had it to do over again, I might answer the questions a little better. You know I've been in public life a long time and no one had ever questioned my role and so I was asked a lot of questions about things that happened a long time ago. I don't think I answered them as well as I could have.
Going back 23 years, I don't know Helen. I was opposed to the war. I couldn't help that. I felt very strongly about it and I didn't want to go at the time. It's easy to say in retrospect I would have done something differently. President Lincoln opposed the war and there were people who said maybe he shouldn't be President. But I think he made us a pretty good President in wartime. We got a lot of other Presidents who didn't wear their country's uniform and had to order our young soldiers to the battle, including President Wilson and President Roosevelt. So the answer is I could do that. I wouldn't relish doing it, but I wouldn't shrink from it. I think that the President has to be prepared to use the power of the nation when our vital interests are threatened. When our treaty commitments are at stake. When we know that something has to be done that is in the national interest and that is a part of being President. Could I do it? Yes I could.
Q: All right, a reminder now -- we're back on the St. Louis rules, which means that the Governor had his answer and then each of you will have one minute to, to respond. Mr. President.
BUSH: Well, I've expressed my heartfelt feel -- difference with Governor Clinton on organizing demonstrations while in a foreign land against your country when young ghetto kids have been drafted and are dying. My argument with him on the question was about the draft -- is that there is this same pattern. It -- in New Hampshire, Senator Kerrey said you ought to level, you ought to tell the truth about it. On April 17 he said he'd bring out all the records on the draft. They have not been forthcoming. He got a deferment or he didn't. He got a notice or he didn't. And I, I think it's this pattern that troubles me more than the draft. A lot of decent, honorable people felt as he did on the draft. But it is this pattern. And again, you might be able to make amendments all the time, Governor, but you've got to, as President, you can't be on all these different sides. And you can't have this pattern of saying, well, I'm, I did this or I didn't. Then the facts come out. And you change it. That's my big difference with him on the draft. It wasn't failing to serve.
Q: Your minute is up, Sir.
BUSH: Yes, sir.
Q: Mr. Perot, one minute.
PEROT: I've spent my whole adult life very close to the military. Feel very strongly about the people who go into battle for our country. Appreciate their idealism, their sacrifices. Appreciate the sacrifices their families make. That's been displayed again and again in a very tangible way. I look on this as history. I don't look on it personally as relevant. And I consider it really a waste of time tonight when you consider the issues that face our country right now.
Q: All right. The next question goes to President Bush. And Gene Gibbons will ask it. Gene.
 
Alternatives to More Taxes
 Q: Mr. President, you keep saying that you made a mistake in agreeing to a tax increase to get the 1990 budget deal with Congress. But if you hadn't gotten that deal, you would have either had to get repeal of the Gramm-Rudman Deficit Control Act or cut defense spending drastically at a time when the country was building up for the gulf war, and decimate domestic discretionary spending including such things as air traffic control. If you had it to do all over again, sir, which of those alternatives would you choose?
BUSH: I wouldn't have taken any of the alternatives. I believe that -- I believe I made a mistake. I did it for the very reasons you say. There was one good thing that came out of that budget agreement that that is we put a cap on discretionary spending -- one-third of the President's budget is at the President's discretion, or really the Congress since they appropriate every dime and tell a President how to spend every dime. We put a cap on the growth of all that spending and that's good, and that's helped. But I was wrong because I thought the tax compromise -- going along with one Democratic tax increase -- would help the economy. I see no evidence that it has done it.
So what would I have done, what should I have done? I should have held out for a better deal that would have protected the taxpayer and not ended up doing what we had to do -- or what I thought at the time would help. So I made a mistake. I -- you know, the difference, I think, is that I knew at the time I was going to take a lot of political flak, I knew we'd have somebody out there yelling, "Read my lips." And I did it because I thought it was right, and I made a mistake.
That's quite different than taking a position where you know it's best for you. That wasn't best for me, and I knew it in the very beginning. I thought it would be better for the country than it was. So there we are.
Q: Mr. Perot, one minute. Mr. Perot?
PEROT: 101 in leadership is to -- is be accountable for what you do. Let's go back to a tax and budget summit briefly. Nobody ever told the American people that we increase spending $1.83 for every dollar tax is raised. That's absolutely unconscionable. Both parties carry a huge blame for that on their shoulders.
This was not a way to pay down the deficit, this was a trick on the American people. That's not leadership.
Let's go back in terms of accepting responsibility for your actions. If you create Saddam Hussein over a 10-year period, using billions of dollars of U.S. taxpayer money, step up to the plate and say, "It was a mistake." If you create Noriega, using taxpayer money, step up to the plate and say, "It was a mistake." If you can't get your act together to pick him up one day when the Panamanian major has kidnapped him, and the Special Forces team is 400 yards away and it's a stroll across the park to get him, and if you can't get your act together, at least pick up the Panamanian major who they then killed, step up to the plate and admit it was a mistake. That's leadership, folks.
Now leaders will always make mistakes. We have created -- and I'm not aiming at any one person here, I'm aiming at our Government -- nobody takes responsibility for anything. We got to change that.
Q: I'm taking responsibility for saying your time's up.
PEROT: I'm watching the light.
Q: All right. Governor Clinton, one minute, sir.
CLINTON: The mistake that was made was making the "read my lips" promise in the first place, just to get elected, knowing what the size of the deficit was -- knowing what the size of the deficit was, knowing there was no plan to control health care costs and knowing that we did not have a strategy to get real economic growth back into this economy. The choices were not good then. I think at the time the mistake that was made was signing off on the deal late on Saturday night, in the middle of the night. That's just what the President did when he vetoed the Family Leave Act. I think what he should have done is gone before the American people on the front and said, "Listen, I made a commitment and it was wrong. I made a mistake because I couldn't have foreseen these circumstances, and this is the best deal we can work out at the time."
He said it was in the public interest at the time, and most everybody who was involved in it, I guess, thought it was. The real mistake was the "read my lips" promise in the first place. You just can't promise something like that just to be elected if you know there's a good chance that circumstances may overtake you.
Q: Mr. Perot, the question is for you. You have a two-minute answer, and it will be asked by Susan Rook.
 
Building Consensus
 Q: Mr. Perot, you've talked about going to Washington to do what the people who run this country want you to do, but it is the President's duty to lead, and often lead alone. How can you lead if you are forever seeking consensus before you act?
PEROT: You're talking about two different subjects. In order to lead you first have to use the White House as a bully pulpit, and lead. Then you have to develop consensus or you can't get anything done, and that's where we are now. We can't get anything done. How do you get anything done when you've got all of these Political Action Committees, all of these thousands of registered lobbyists -- 40,000 registered lobbyists, 23,000 special interest groups, and the list goes on and on and on. And the average citizen out here, just working hard every day. You've got to go to the people. I just love the fact that everybody, particularly in the media, goes bonkers over the town hall. I guess it's because you will lose your right to tell them what to think.
The point is, they'll get to decide what to think! What you've been -- I love the fact that people will listen to a guy with a bad accent and a poor presentation manner talking about flip charts for 30 minutes because they want the details. See, all the folks up there at the top said people -- the attention span of the American people is no more than five minutes, they won't watch it. They're thirsty for it. You ought to have a new program in this country -- if you get grass-roots America excited about it and if they tap Congress on the shoulder and say, "Do it, Charlie," it'll happen and that's a whole lot different from these fellows running up and down the halls whispering in their ears now, and promising campaign funds the next election if they do it.
Now I think that's going back to where we started. That's having a government from the people. I think that's the essence of leadership, Rather than cutting deals in dark rooms in Washington.
Q: Governor Clinton.
CLINTON: Well, I believe in the town hall meetings. They started with my campaign in New Hampshire. And I think Ross Perot has done a good job in having them, and I, as you know, pushed for the debate to include the 209 American citizens who were part of it in Richmond a few days ago. I've done a lot of them and I'll continue to do them as President.
But I'd also like to point out that I haven't been part of what we're criticizing in Washington tonight. Of the three of us, I have balanced a government budget 12 times. I have offered and passed campaign finance reform. Offered -- pushed for and passed in public referendum obvious restrictions. Done the kinds of things you have to do to get legislators together, not only to establish consensus but to challenge in the change. And in 12 years as Governor I guess I've taken on every interest group there was in my state at one time or another, to fight the change. It can be done. That's why I tried to be so specific in this campaign to have a mandate if elected so the Congress will know what the American people have voted for.
Q: President Bush, one minute.
BUSH: I would like the record to show to the panelists that Ross Perot took the first shot at the press. My favorite bumper sticker, though, is: "Annoy the media. Re-elect President Bush." And I just had to work that in. Sorry, Helen. I'm going to pay for this later on.
Look, you have to build a consensus but in some things -- Ross mentioned Saddam Hussein. Yes, we tried. And yes, we failed to bring him into the family of nations. He had the fourth largest army. But then when he moved against Kuwait I said, "This will not stand." And it's hard to build a concensus. We went to the U.N., we made historic resolutions up there. The whole world was united. Our Congress was dragging its feet. Governor Clinton said, "Well, I might have been with the minority. Let's see how sanctions work. But I guess I would have voted with the majority." A President can't do that. Sometimes he has to act, and in this case I'm glad we did because if we had let the sanctions work, and had tried to build a consensus on that, Saddam Hussein today would be in Saudi Arabia controlling the world's oil supply and he would be there, maybe with a nuclear weapon.
We busted the fourth-largest army and we did it through leadership.
 
Women and Minorities
 Q: All right, we're going to go on to another subject now and the subject is priorities and the first question goes to you President Bush and Susan will ask it.
Q: President Bush, gentlemen, I acknowledge that all of you have women and ethnic minorities working for you and working with you, but when we look at the circle of the key people closest to you -- your inner circle of advisers -- we see white men only. Why and when will that change?
BUSH: You don't see Margaret Tutwiler sitting in there with me today?
Q: The key people, President Bush.
BUSH: Huh?
Q: The key people. The people ----
BUSH: I happen to think she's a key person.
Q: ---- beyond the glass ceiling.
BUSH: I think our Cabinet members are key people. I think the woman that works with me, Rose Zamaria, is about as tough as a boot out there and can make some discipline and protects the taxpayer. Look at our Cabinet -- you talk about somebody strong -- look at Carla Hills. Look at Lynn Martin whose fighting against this glass ceiling and doing a first class job on it. Look at our Surgeon General, Dr. Novella. You can look all around and you'll see first class, strong women. Jim Baker's a man. Yeah, I agree -- I plead guilty to that. But look around whose -- look whose around with him there. I mean this is a little defensive on your part, Susan, to be honest with you. We've got a very good record appointing women to high positions and positions of trust and I'm not defensive at all about it. What we got to do is keep working -- as the Labor Department is doing a first class job on -- to break down discrimination, to break down the glass ceiling and I am not apologetic at all about our record with women. We've got, I think -- you know you think about women in government, I think about women in business. Why not try to help them with my small business program to build some incentives into the system?
I think we're making progress here. You've got a lot of women running for office. As I said the other night, I hope a lot of them lose, because they're liberal Democrats and we don't need more of them in Senate, or more of them in the House. But nevertheless, they're out there and we've got some very good Republican women running. So we're making dramatic progress.
Q: Mr. Perot, one minute.
PEROT: Well, I've come from the computer business and everybody knows women are more talented than the men. So we have a long history of having a lot of talented women. One of our first officers was a woman, the chief financial officer. She was the director and it was so far back it was considered so odd and even though we were a tiny little company at the time, it made all the national magazines. But in terms of being influenced by women and being a minority, there they are right out there, my wife and my four beautiful daughters and I just have one son, so he and I are surrounded by women giving -- telling us what to do, all the time.
And for the rest of my minute, I want to make a very brief comment here, in terms of Saddam Hussein. We told him that we wouldn't get involved with his border dispute and we've never revealed those papers that were given to Ambassador Glaspie beyond July the 25th. I suggest, in the sense of taking responsibility for your actions, we lay those papers on the table. They're not secrets to the nuclear bomb.
Secondly, we got upset when he took the whole thing. But to the ordinary American out there who doesn't know where the oil fields are in Kuwait, they're near the border. We told him he could take the northern part of Kuwait and when he took the whole thing, we went nuts. And if we didn't tell him that, why won't we even let the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee see the written instructions for Ambassador Glaspie?
BUSH: I have to reply on that -- that -- that gets to the national honor. We did not say to Saddam Hussein, Ross, you can take the northern part of Kuwait.
ROSS: Well, where are the papers?
BUSH: That is absolutely absurd.
ROSS: Where are the papers?
BUSH: Glaspie has testified and Glaspie's papers have been presented to the United States Senate. Now please.
PEROT: If you have time, if you have time, go to Nexis and Lexis, pull all the old news articles, look at what Ambassador Glaspie said all through the fall and what have you, and then look at what she and Kelly and others in State said at the end when they were trying to clean it up. And talk to any head of any of those key committees in the Senate -- they will not let them see the written instructions given to Ambassador Glaspie. And I suggest that in a free society owned by the people, the American people ought to know what we told Ambassador Glaspie to tell Saddam Hussein, because we spent a lot of money and risked lives and lost lives in that effort and did not accomplish most of our objectives. We got Kuwait back to the Emir, but he's still got his nuclear, his chemical, his bacteriological, and he's still over there, right? I'd like to see those written instructions. Sir.
Q: Mr. President, when you -- just to make sure that everybody knows what's going on here. When you responded directly to Mr. Perot ----
BUSH: Yes.
Q: ---- you violated the rule -- your rule. Now I'm more than willing ----
BUSH: For which I apologize. When I make a mistake I ----
Q: No, it's O.K. No, no, no. I just want to make sure that everybody -- I just want to make sure everybody understands it. If you all want to change the rules, we can do it.
BUSH: No, I don't. I apologize for it. But that one got right to the national honor, and I'm sorry ----
Q: O.K. But, but, Governor Clinton, you have a minute.
CLINTON: Susan, I don't agree that there are no women and minorities in important positions in my campaign. There are many. But I think even more relevant is my record at home. For most of my time as Governor a woman was my chief of staff. An African-American was my chief cabinet officer; an African-American was my chief economic development officer.
It was interesting today -- there was a story either today or yesterday in The Washington Post about my economic programs and my chief budget officer and my chief economic officer were both African-Americans even though The Post didn't mention that, which I think is a sign of progress.
The National Women's Political Caucus gave me an award, one of their good guy awards for my involvement of women in high levels of government. And I've appointed more minorities to positions of high level in government than all the governors in the history of my state combined before me.
So that's what I'll do as President. I don't think we've got a person to waste, and I think I owe the American people a White House staff, a Cabinet and appointments that look like America but that meet high standards of excellence, and that's what I'll do.
Q: All right, next question goes to you, Mr. Perot. It's a two minute -- it's a two-minute question and Helen will ask it. Helen.
Q: Mr. Perot, what proof do you have that Saddam Hussein was told that he could have the oil? Do you have any actual proof? Or are you asking for the papers?
PEROT: I --
 
Penchant for Investigations
 Q: And also, I really came in with another question is What is this penchant you have to investigate everyone? Are those accusations correct? Investigating your staff, investigating the leaders of the grass-roots movement, investigating associates of your family?
PEROT: No. They're not correct. And if you look at my life for the first -- until I got involved in this effort, I was one person. And then after the Republican dirty tricks group got through with me, I'm another person. Which I consider an absolutely sick operation. And all of you in the press know exactly what I'm talking about. They investigated every single one of my children. They investigated my wife. They interviewed all of my children's friends from childhood on. They went to extraordinary, sick lengths.
And I just found it amusing that they would take two or three cases where I was involved in lawsuits and would engage an investigator. The lawyers would engage an investigator, which is common. And the only difference between me and any other businessman that has the range of business I have is I haven't had that many lawsuits. So that's just another one of those little fruit-loopy things they make up to try to -- instead of facing issues, to try to redefine a person's -- that's running against them. This goes on night and day. I will do everything I can, if I get up there, to make dirty tricks a thing of the past. One of the two groups has raised it to an art form. It's a sick art form.
Now let's go back to Saddam Hussein. We gave Ambassador Glaspie written instructions. That's a fact. We've never let the Congress and the foreign relations -- Senate Intelligence Committee see them. That's a fact. Ambassador Glaspie did a lot of talking right after July the 25th. And that's a fact that's in all the newspapers and you pull all of it at once and read it -- and I did -- and it's pretty clear what she and Kelly and the other key guys around that thing thought they were doing. Then, at the end of the war when they had to go testify about it, their stories are a total disconnect from what they said in August, September and October. So I say, this is very simple. Saddam Hussein released a tape, as you know, claiming it was a transcript of their meeting, whereas she said we will not become involved in your border dispute. In effect, you can take the northern part of the country. We later said, no, that's not true. I said, well, this is simple. What were her written instructions? We guard those like the secrets to the atomic bomb, literally. Now I say, whose country is this? This is ours. Who will get hurt if we lay those papers on the table? The worst thing is it's again, it's a mistake. Nobody did any of this with evil intent. I just object to the fact that we cover up and hide things, whether it's Iran-Contra, Iraq-Gate or you name it, it's a serious thing.
Q: Governor Clinton, you have one minute.
CLINTON: Let's take Mr. Bush, for the moment, at his word. He's right, we don't have any evidence, at least, that our Government did tell Saddam Hussein he could have that part of Kuwait. And let's give him the credit he deserves for organizing Operation Desert Storm and Desert Shield. It was a remarkable event.
But let's look at where I think the real mistake was made. In 1988, when the war between Iraq and Iran ended, we knew Saddam Hussein was a tyrant. We had dealt with him because he was against Iran, the enemy of my enemy may be my friend. All right, the war is over. We know he's dropping mustard gas on his own people. We know he's threatened to incinerate half of Israel. Several Government departments, several, had information that he was converting our aid to military purposes and trying to develop weapons of mass destruction. But in late '89 the President signed a secret policy saying we were going to continue to try to improve relations with him, and we sent him some sort of communication on the eve of his invasion of Kuwait that we still wanted better relations. So I think what was wrong, I give credit where credit is due, but the responsibility was in coddling Saddam Hussein when there was no reason to do it and when people in high levels in our Government knew he was trying to do things that were outrageous.
Q: Mr. President, you have a moment. A minute, I'm sorry.
BUSH: Well, it's awful easy when you're dealing with 99 hindsight. We did try to bring Saddam Hussein into the family of nations. He did have the fourth-largest army. All our Arab allies out there thought we ought to do just exactly that. And when he crossed the line, I stood up and looked into the camera and I said this aggression will not stand. And we formed a historic coalition and we brought him down. And we destroyed the fourth-largest army. And the battlefield was searched and there wasn't one single iota of evidence that any U.S. weapons were on that battlefield, and the nuclear capability has been searched by the United Nations, and there hasn't been one single scintilla of evidence that there's any U.S. technology involved in it.
And what you're seeing, on all this Iraqgate is a bunch of people who were wrong on the war trying to cover their necks here and -- and try to do a little revisionism. And I cannot let that stand because it isn't true. Yes we had grain credits for Iraq and there isn't any evidence that those grain credits were diverted into weaponry. None. None whatsoever. And so I -- I just have to say, it's fine.
Q: We have to go on.
BUSH: You can't say there, Governor Clinton, and say well I think I'd have been -- I've supported the minority, let sanctions work or wish it'd go away, but I would have voted with the majority. Come on, that's not leadership.
 
Leadership and Crisis
 Q: All right. The next question goes to Governor Clinton and Gene Gibbons will ask it. Gene.
Q: Governor, an important aspect of leadership is of course anticipating problems. During the 1988 campaign there was little or no mention of the savings and loan crisis that has cost the American people billions and billions of dollars. Now there are rumblings that a commercial bank crisis is on the horizon. Is there such a problem, sir? If so, how bad is it and what will it cost to clean it up?
CLINTON: Gene, there is a problem in the sense that there are some problem banks and on Dec. 19 new regulations will go into effect which will, in effect, give the Government the responsibility to close some banks that are not technically insolvent, but that are plainly in trouble. On the other hand, I don't think that we have any reason to believe that the dimensions of this crisis are anywhere near as great as the savings and loan crisis. The mistake that both parties made in Washington with the S.& L. business was deregulating them without proper capital requirements, proper oversight and regulation, proper training of the executives. Many people predicted what happened and it was a disaster.
The banking system in this country is fundamentally sound with some weak banks. I think that our goal ought to be first of all not to politicize it, not to frighten people. Secondly, to say that we have to enforce the law in two ways. We don't want to overreact as -- as the Federal regulators have in my judgment, on good banks so that they've created credit crunches that has -- that have made our recession worse in the last couple of years. But we do want to act prudently with the banks that are in trouble. We also want to say that insofar as is humanly possible, the banking industry itself should pay for the cost of any bank failures, the taxpayers should not. And that will be my policy and I believe we have a good balanced approach. We can get the good banks loaning money again, end the credit crunch, have proper regulation on the ones that are in trouble. And not overreact. It is a serious problem, but I don't see it as the kind of terrible, terrible problem that the S.& L. problem was.
Q: President Bush, one minute
BUSH: Well, I don't -- I don't believe it would be appropriate for a President to suggest that the banking system is not sound. It is sound. There are some problem banks out there. But what we need is financial reform. We need some real financial reform -- banking reform legislation. And I have proposed that and when I am reelected I believe the first -- one of the first things ought to be to press a new Congress, not beholden to the old ways, to pass financial reform legislation that modernizes the banking system, doesn't put a lot of inhibitions on it and protects the depositors through keeping the F.D.I.C. sound, but I -- I think that -- that -- I just was watching some of the proceedings of the American Bankers Association, and I think the general feeling is most of the banks are sound. Certainly there's no comparison here between what happened to the S.& L.'s and where the banks stand right now. In my view.
Q: Mr. Perot, one minute.
PEROT: Well, nobody's gotten into the real issue yet on the savings and loan. Again, nobody's got a business background, I guess. The whole problem came up in 1984. The President of the United States was told officially it was a $20 billion problem. These crooks -- now Willie Sutton would have gone to own a savings and loan rather than rob banks because you -- he robbed bank because that's where the money is -- only the saving and loan is where the money was. Yeah. In 1984, they were told. I believe the Vice President was in charge of deregulation. Nobody touched that tar baby till the day after elections in 1988 because they were flooding both parties with crooked PAC money and it was in many cases, stolen PAC money.
Now you and I never got a ride on a lot of these yachts and fancy things it bought, but you and I are paying for it. And they buried it till right after the election. Now if you believe The Washington Post and you believe this extensive study that's been done -- and I'm reading -- right after election day this year they're going to hit us with 100 banks -- it'll be a $100 billion problem. Now if that's true, just tell me now. Yeah, I'm grown up, I can deal with it, I'll pay my share. But just tell me know. Don't bury it until after the election twice. I say that to both political parties. The people deserve that since we have to pick up the tab. You got the PAC money, we'll pay the tab. Just tell us.
 Q: All right, Mr. Perot, the next question -- we're going into a new round here, on category just called differences and the question goes to you Mr. Perot and Gene will ask it. Gene?
 
Reforming Government
 Q: Mr. Perot, aside from the deficit, what Government policy or policies do you really want to do something about? What really sticks in your craw about conditions in this country? Beside the deficit, that you would want to fix as President?
PEROT: Well, if you watched my television show the other night, you saw it and if you watch it Thursday, Friday, Saturday of this week you'll get more. So, a shameless plug there, Mr. President. But, in a nutshell, we've got to reform our Government or we won't get anything done. We have a Government that doesn't work. All these specific examples I'm giving tonight, if you had a business like that, they'd be leading you away, boarding up the doors.
We have a Government that doesn't work. It's supposed to come from the people; it comes at the people. The people need to take their Government back. You've got to reform Congress. They've got be servants of the people again. You've got to reform the White House. We've got to turn this thing around and it's a long list of specific items. And I've covered it again and again in print and on television, but very specifically, the key thing is to turn the Government back to the people and take it away from special interests and have people go to Washington to serve.
Who can give themselves a 23 percent pay raise anywhere in the world except Congress? Who would have 1,200 airplanes worth $2 billion a year just to fly around in? I don't have a free reserved parking place at National Airport, why should my servants? I don't have an indoor gymnasium and an indoor tennis court; an indoor every other thing they can think of. I don't have as place where I can go make free TV to send to my constituents to try to blame Washington -- to elect me the next time. And I'm paying for all that for those guys. I'm going to be running an ad pretty soon that shows -- they promised us they were going to hold the line on spending, a tax and budget summit; and I'm going to show how much they have increased this little stuff they do for themselves and it is silly putty folks, and the American people have had enough of it.
Step 1, if I get up there, we're going to clean that up. You say how can I get Congress to do that? I have millions of people at my shoulder -- shoulder to shoulder with me, and we will see it done at warp speed. Because it's wrong. It's just -- we've turned the country upside down.
Q: Governor Clinton, you have one minute. Governor.
CLINTON: I would just point out on the -- the point Mr. Perot made. I agree that we need to cut spending in Congress. I've called for a 25 percent reduction in Congressional staffs and expenditures. But the White House staff increased its expenditures by considerably more than Congress has in the last four years under the Bush Administration. And Congress has actually spent a billion dollars less than President Bush asked them to spend. Now when you outspend Congress, you're really swinging.
That, however, is not my only passion. The real problem in this country is that most people are working hard and falling farther behind. My passion is to pass a jobs program and get incomes up with an investment incentive program to grow jobs in the private sector, to waste less public money and invest more, to control health care costs and provide for affordable health care for all Americans. And to make sure we've got the best trained work force in the world. That is my passion. We've got to get this country growing again and this economy strong again or we can't bring down the deficit. Economic growth is the key to the future of this country.
Q: President Bush, one minute.
BUSH: On Government reform?
Q: Sir?
BUSH: Government reform?
Q: To -- yes, exactly, well to respond to what the -- the subject that Mr. Perot mentioned.
BUSH: Well -- how about this for a Government reform policy? Reduce the White House staff by a third after or at the same time the Congress does the same thing for their staff; term limits for members of the United States Congress; give the Government back to the people. Let's do it that way. The President has term limits. Let's -- let's limit some of these guys sitting out here tonight. Term limits and then how about a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Forty-three -- more than that have -- states have it, I believe. Let's try that.
And you want to do something about all this extra spending that concerns Mr. Perot and me? O.K., how about a line item veto. Forty-three governors have that. And give it to the President and if the Congress isn't big enough to do it, let the President have a shot at this excess spending. A line item veto, that means you can take a line and cut out some of the pork out of a meaningful bill. Governor Clinton keeps hitting me on vetoing legislation. Well that's the only protection the taxpayer has against some of these reckless pork programs up there. And I'd rather be able to just line it right out of there and get on about passing some good stuff but leave out the garbage.
Q: All right, we have --
BUSH: Line-item veto. This is a good reform program for you.
Q: All right. A -- next question goes to Governor Clinton. You have -- you have two minutes, Governor, and Susan will ask it.
 
Who Will Pay More?
 Q: Governor Clinton, you said that you will raise taxes on the rich, people with incomes of $200,000 a year or higher. A lot of people are saying that you will have to go lower than that. Much lower. Will you make a pledge tonight below which an income level that you will not go below? I'm looking for numbers, Sir, not just a concept.
CLINTON: My plan -- you can read my plan. My plan says that we want to raise marginal incomes on family incomes above $200,000 from 31 to 36 percent; that we want to ask foreign corporations simply to pay the same percentage of taxes on their income that American corporations play in America. That we want to use that money to provide over $100 billion in tax cuts for investment in new plant and equipment, for small business, for new technologies and for middle-class tax relief.
Now, I'll tell you this: I will not raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs. If the money does not come in there to pay for these programs, we will cut other Government spending or we will slow down the phase-in of the programs. I am not going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs. Now, furthermore, I am not going to tell you read my lips. On anything. Because I cannot foresee what emergencies might develop in this country. And the President said never never never -- would never would he raise taxes in New Jersey and within a day Marlin Fitzwater, his spokesman, said Now, that's not a promise. So I think even he has learned that you can't say read my lips because you can't know what emergencies might come up.
But I can tell you this. I'm not going to raise taxes on middle-class Americans to pay for the programs I recommended. Read my plan. And you can -- you know how you can trust me about that? Because you know, in that first debate, Mr. Bush made some news. He had just said Jim Baker was going to be Secretary of State but in the first debate he said, No, now he's going to be responsible for domestic economic policy. Well, I'll tell you. I'll make some news in the third debate. The person responsible for domestic economic policy in my administration will be Bill Clinton. I'm going to make those decisions. And I won't raise taxes on the middle-class to pay for my programs.
Q: President Bush, you have one minute.
BUSH: That's what worries me. That he's going to be responsible. He's going to do -- he would do -- and he would do for the United States what he's done to Arkansas. He would do for the United States what he's done to Arkansas. We do not want to be the lowest of the low. We are not a nation in decline. We are a rising nation. Now, my problem is I heard what he said. He said I want to raise -- take it from the rich. Raise $150 billion from the rich to get it -- to get $150 billion in new taxes, you got to go down to the buy that's making $36,600. And if you want to pay for the rest of his plan, all the other spending programs, you're going to sock it to the working man. So when you hear tax the rich Mr. and Mrs. America, watch your wallet. Lock your wallet; he's coming right after you. Just like Jimmy Carter did and just like you're going to get -- you're going to end up with interest rates at 21 percent and you're going to have inflation going through the roof. Yes we're having tough times, but we do not need to go back to the failed policies of the past when you had a Democratic President and a spendthrift Democratic Congress.
Q: Mr. Perot.
CLINTON: You permitted Mr. Bush to break the rules. He said to defend the honor of the country. What about the honor of my state? We rank first in the country in job growth. We got the lowest spending state and local in the country and the second lowest tax burden, and the difference between Arkansas and the United States is that we're going in the right direction and this country is going in the wrong direction, and I have to defend the honor of my state.
Q: We've got a wash, according to my calculation we have a wash and we go to Mr. Perot for one minute. In other words, it's a violation of the rule, that's what I meant, Mr. Perot.
PEROT: So I'm the only one that's untarnished at this point.
Q: Right, you're clean, you're clean.
CLINTON: Go ahead, Ross, go ahead.
PEROT: I'm sure I'll do it before it's over. The key thing is, see, we all come up with images. Images don't fix anything. I think -- you know, I'm starting to understand it, you stay around this long enough, you think about it -- if you talk about it in Washington, you think you did it. If you've been on television about it, you think you did it. What we need is people to stop talking and start doing. Our real problem here is they have -- both have plans that will not work. The Wall Street Journal said your numbers don't add up. And you take it out on charts, you look at all the studies that different groups have done, you go out four, five, six years, we're still drifting along with a huge deficit.
So let's come back to harsh reality. And what I -- you know, everybody says, "Gee, Perot, you're tough." I'm saying, well, this is not as tough as World War II and it's not as tough as the Revolution. And it's fair-shared sacrifice to do the right thing for our country and for our children. And it will be fun, if we all work together to do it.
Q: All right, this is the last question and it goes to President Bush for a two-minute answer, and it will be asked by Helen.
 
Standing in the Polls
 Q: Mr. President, why have you dropped so dramatically in the leadership polls from the high 80's to the 40's? And you have said that you will do anything you have to do to get reelected. What can you do in two weeks to win re-election?
BUSH: Well, I think the answer to why the drop, I think, has been the economy in the doldrums. Why I'll win is I think I have the best plan of the three of us up here to do something about it. Mine does not grow the government, it does not invest -- have government invest. It says we need to do better in terms of stimulating private business.
We got a big philosophical difference here tonight between one who thinks the government can do all these things through tax and spend, and one who thinks it ought to go the other way. And so I believe the answer is I'm going to win it because I'm getting into focus my agenda for America's renewal, and also I think that Governor Clinton's had pretty much of a free ride on looking at -- specifically at the Arkansas record. He keeps criticizing us, criticizing me, I'm the incumbent. Fine. But he's an incumbent and we've got to look at all the facts. They're almost at the bottom on every single category. We can't do that to the American people.
And then, Helen, I really believe we -- people are going to ask this question about trust, because I do think there's a pattern by Governor Clinton of saying one thing to please one group and then trying to please another group. And I think that pattern is a dangerous thing to suggest would work for the Oval Office. It doesn't work that way when you're President. Truman is right, the buck stops there. And you have to make decisions even when it's against your own interests. And I've done that. It was against my political interests to say go ahead and go along with the tax increase, but I did what I thought was right at the time.
So I think people are going to be looking for trust and experience. And then I mentioned it the other night, I think if there's a crisis people are going to say, "Well, George Bush has taken us through some tough crises, and we trust him to do that." And so I'll make the appeal on a wide array of issues. Also I got a philosophical interest -- I've got to watch the clock here -- I don't think we're a declining nation. The whole world has had economic problems; we're doing better than a lot of the countries in the world. And we're going to lead the way out of this economic recession across the world and economic slowdown here at home.
Q: Mr. Perot ----
BUSH: So I think I'll win.
Q: Mr. Perot, you have -- sorry, excuse me, sir. Mr. Perot, you have one minute.
PEROT: I'm the last one, right?
Q: No, Governor Clinton has a minute after you. Then we have the closing statements.
PEROT: I have one minute after you.
Q: Correct.
PEROT: I'm totally focused on the fact that we may have bank failures and nobody answered it. I'm totally focused on the fact that we are still evading the issue of the Glaspie papers. I'm totally focused on the fact that we still could have enterprise zones according to both parties, but we don't. So I'm still focused on gridlock, I guess.
And I am also focused on the fact that isn't it a paradox that we have the highest productivity in our work force in the industrialized world and at the same time have the largest trade deficit and at the same time rank behind nine other nations in what we pay our most productive people in the world and that we're losing whole industries overseas.
Now, can't somebody agree with me that the Government is breaking business' legs with these trade agreements? They're breaking business' legs in a number of different ways. We have an adversarial relationship that's destroying jobs and sending them overseas while we have the finest workers in the world.
Keep in mind the factory worker has nothing to do with anything except putting it together on the factory floor. It's our obligation to make sure that we give him the finest products in the world to put together and we don't break his legs in the process.
Q: Governor Clinton, one minute.
CLINTON: I really can't believe Mr. Bush is still trying to make trust an issue after "Read my lips" and 15 million new jobs and embracing what he called voodoo economics and embracing an export enhancement program for farmers he threatened to veto and going all around the country giving out money in programs that he once opposed.
But the main thing is he still didn't get it from what he said the other night to that fine woman on our program, that the 209 people in Richmond -- they don't want us to talking about each other, they want us to talk about the problems of this country.
I don't think he'll be re-elected, because trickle-down economics is a failure and he's offering more of it. And what he's saying about my program is just not true. Look at the Republicans that have endorsed me -- high-tech executives in Northern California. Look at the 24 generals and admirals retired have endorsed me, including the deputy commander of Desert Storm. Look at Sarah Brady, Jim Brady's wife -- President Reagan's press secretary who endorsed me because he knuckled under to the N.R.A. and wouldn't fight for the Brady Bill.
We've got a broad-based coalition that goes beyond party, because I am going to change this country and make it better with the help of the American people.
 
Closing Statements
 Q: All right. Now that -- that was the final, that was the final question and answer and we now go to the closing statements. Each candidate will have up to two minutes. The order was determined by a drawing. Governor Clinton you are first. Governor.
CLINTON: First I'd like to thank the Commission and my opponents for participating in these debates and making them possible. I think the real winners of the debates were the American people. I was especially moved in Richmond a few days ago when 209 of our fellow citizens got to ask us questions. They went a long way toward reclaiming this election for the American people and taking their country back. I want to say, since this is the last time I'll be on a platform with my opponents, that even though I disagree with Mr. Perot on how fast we can reduce the deficit and how much we can increase taxes on the middle class, I really respect what he's done in this campaign to bring the issue of deficit reduction to our attention. I'd like to say to Mr. Bush, even though I've got profound differences with him, I do honor his service to our country. I appreciate his efforts and I wish him well. I just believe it's time to change.
I offer a new approach. It's not trickle-down economics. It's been tried for 12 years and it's failed. More people are working harder for less, 100,000 a month losing their health insurance, unemployment going up, our economy slowing down. We can do better. And it's not tax and spend economics. It's invest and grow, put our people first, control health care costs and provide basic health care to all Americans. Have an education system second to none and revitalize the private economy.
That is my commitment to you. It is the kind of change that can open up a whole new world of opportunities to America as we enter the last decade of this century and move toward the 21st century. I want a country where people who work hard and play by the rules are rewarded, not punished. I want a country where people are coming together across the lines of race and region and income. I know we can do better. It won't take miracles and it won't happen overnight, but we can do much, much better if we have the courage to change. Thank you very much.
Q: President Bush, your closing statement, sir.
BUSH: Three weeks from now -- two -- two weeks from tomorrow America goes to the polls and you're going to have to decide who you want to lead this country to economic recovery. On jobs, that's the No. 1 priority and I believe my program for stimulating investment, encouraging small business, brand new approach to education, strengthening the American family and yes, creating more exports is the way to go.
I don't believe in trickle-down government. I don't believe in larger taxes and larger government spending. On foreign affairs, some think it's irrelevant. I believe it's not. We're living in an interconnected world. The whole world is having economic difficulties. The U.S. is doing better than a lot, but we've got to do even better and if a crisis comes up I ask who -- who has the judgment and the experience and yes, the character, to make the right decision.
And lastly, the other night on character, Governor Clinton said it's not the character of the President, but the character of the Presidency. I couldn't disagree more. Horace Greeley said the only thing that endures is character. And I think it was Justice Black who talked about great nations like great men must keep their word. And so the question is, who will safeguard this nation? Who will safeguard our people and our children? I need your support. I ask for your vote. And may God bless the United States of America.
Q: Mr. Perot -- Mr. Perot, your closing statement. -- Mr. Perot, your closing statement, sir.
PEROT: To the millions of fine, decent people who did the unthinkable and took their country back in their own hands and put me on the ballot, let me pledge to you that tonight is just the beginning. These next two weeks, we will be going full steam ahead to make sure that you get a voice and that you get your country back. This Thursday night on ABC from 8:30 to 9, Friday night on NBC from 8 to 8:30 and Saturday night on CBS from 8 to 8:30, we'll be down in the trenches, under the hood working on fixing the old car to get it back on the road. Now, question is: Can we win? Absolutely we can win 'cause it's your country. Question is -- really is: Who do you want in the White House? It's that simple. Now you got to stop letting these people tell you who to vote for, you got to stop letting these folks in the press tell you you're throwing your vote away. You got to start using your own head.
Then the question is: Can we govern? That -- I love that one. The "we" is you and me. You bet your hat we can govern because we will be in there together and we will figure out what to do and you won't tolerate gridlock, you won't tolerate endless meandering and wandering around and you won't tolerate non-performance. And believe me, anybody that knows me understands I have a very low tolerance for non-performance also. Together we can get anything done. The President mentioned that you need the right person in a crisis. Well, folks, we got one. And that crisis is a financial crisis.
Pretty simply -- who's the best qualified person up here on the stage to create jobs? Make your decision and vote on Nov. 3. I suggest you might consider somebody who's created jobs. Second, who's the best person to manage money? I suggest you pick the person who's successfully managed money. Who's the best person to get results and not talk. Look at the record and make your decision. And finally, who would you give your pension fund and your savings account to -- to manage. And last one -- who would you ask to be the trustee of your estate and take care of your children if something happened to you. Finally, to you students up there, God bless you. I'm doing this for you. I want you to have the American dream. All right. And to the American people -- to the American people, I'm doing this because I love you. That's it. Thank you very much.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Debate;
BUSH PUSHES HARD IN 3D DEBATE BUT FOES PUT HIM ON DEFENSIVE

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

 BODY:
The last of the three Presidential debates ended last night with President Bush still on the defensive about his first-term record and laboring to revive his campaign by warning that Gov. Bill Clinton lacked the leadership, the record and the character to be President.
In their most spirited, direct exchange yet, Mr. Bush assailed Mr. Clinton's record in Arkansas, his economic proposals and what Mr. Bush asserted was a habit of trying to have it both ways on issue after issue. 
 Mr. Clinton, responding to the President's attacks, hammered Mr. Bush's economic stewardship and resurrected his broken pledge from 1988: "I really can't believe Mr. Bush is still trying to make trust an issue after 'read my lips.' "
 
Focus on Iraq Conflict
 The Democratic Governor also joined with Ross Perot, the independent candidate, in opening a withering critique of Mr. Bush's handling of events leading to the conflict with Iraq.
Mr. Bush, who entered this debate with a clear and persistent deficit in public opinion polls, gave his most aggressive performance yet but did not appear to deliver the devastating blow to Mr. Clinton that Republicans had hoped for. [Transcript, pages A20-A23.]
Mr. Bush contended, repeatedly, that Mr. Clinton was a throwback to Democratic big-government and tax-and-spend policies that were abhorrent to the voters. "Mr. and Mrs. America, when you hear him say we're going to tax only the rich, watch your wallet because his figures don't add up, and he's going to sock it right to the middle-class taxpayer and lower, if he's going to pay for all the spending programs he proposes," Mr. Bush declared.
 
Bush Chided on Baker
 In one of the sharpest exchanges of the evening, Mr. Clinton criticized the President for initially saying that James A. Baker 3d, the White House chief of staff and former Secretary of State, would return to the foreign-policy post and days later saying that Mr. Baker would be in charge of the economy.
"I'll make some news in the third debate," Mr. Clinton said. "The person responsible for economic policy in my administration will be Bill Clinton."
Mr. Bush responded hotly: "That's what worries me. He's going to be responsible."
And striking a persistent theme from last night -- reminiscent of the Republican attack against Gov. Michael S. Dukakis in 1988 -- he added that Mr. Clinton "would do for the United States what he's done to Arkansas."
 
Defending His State
 That remark prompted Mr. Clinton to interrupt "to defend the honor of my state" and defend his record.
But Mr. Clinton also delivered a biting critique of Mr. Bush's economic stewardship, saying that the President's "trickle-down economics" had been a failure. He defended his accomplishments as Governor and presented himself repeatedly as a man committed to easing the lot of the middle class.
"We're a low-spending, low-tax-burden" state, he said. "We dramatically increased investment, and our jobs are growing. I wish America had had that record."
In a sharp response to Mr. Bush's assertion that he had repeatedly waffled on important issues, Mr. Clinton reminded the national television audience that Mr. Bush had once described Ronald Reagan's economic proposals as "voodoo economics" only to embrace them when he joined the ticket in 1980.
 
Direct Attacks Avoided
 Both Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton avoided direct attacks on Mr. Perot, reflecting the belief of strategists in both camps that many of the Texas billionaire's supporters would drift away in the final days and be up for grabs.
And Mr. Perot, who remains mired in a distant third place in the public opinion polls, used his closing statement to urge voters to disregard the pundits who say he is not electable.
"You got to stop letting these people tell you who to vote for," he said. "You got to stop letting these folks in the press tell you you're throwing your vote away."
Mr. Perot also returned to one of his strongest appeals. "Who would you give your pension fund and your savings account to to manage?" he asked.
A CBS News Poll of 553 registered voters taken immediately after the debate found the race virtually unchanged since the previous CBS Poll taken over the weekend. The new poll, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points, found Mr. Clinton with 48 percent, Mr. Bush with 33 percent and Mr. Perot with 16 percent.
 
Attacked on Strong Suit
 The third and final debate, held at Michigan State University in East Lansing, and moderated by Jim Lehrer of PBS, was the first in which the candidates had energetically squared off on a foreign-policy issue, and it came on a subject that Mr. Bush's camp had long considered a strong point: the Persian Gulf war.
Mr. Perot maintained that Mr. Bush had given the Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, a green light to seize the Kuwaiti oil fields just across the border from Iraq. Mr. Bush interrupted to "defend the national honor" and denied Mr. Perot's accusation.
But most of the skirmishing of the night occurred around taxes: the subtext was Mr. Bush's attempt to box Mr. Clinton in as a tax-and-spend liberal and Mr. Clinton's attempt to cast his proposals as a third way between traditional Democratic and Republican economic philosophies.
Mr. Clinton maintained that he would limit any tax increases to the very wealthy, flatly asserting, "I will not raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs." But he refused a questioner's invitation to pledge to forswear, under any condition, tax increases on the middle class. "I am not going to tell you, 'Read my lips,' " he said. "I can't tell you what emergencies are going to develop."
Mr. Bush, in his case against Mr. Clinton, emphasized the Democratic challenger's draft record less than he has in previous encounters. But he repeatedly tried to connect Mr. Clinton with the high inflation and high-interest rates of the Carter Administration.
"We remember what it was like when we had a spending President and a spending Congress and interest rates -- who remembers that? -- they were at 21.5 percent under Jimmy Carter and inflation was 15," Mr. Bush said. "We don't want to go back to that."
At one point in the debate, Mr. Clinton tried to turn one of Mr. Bush's favorite issues against him, saying, "He is the person who raised taxes on the middle class."
Mr. Bush responded, "I think everybody's paying too much taxes."
 
Focus on Arkansas
 In their most spirited, direct exchange yet, Mr. Bush assailed Mr. Clinton's record in Arkansas. He carefully prefaced his critique by saying, "It's not dirty campaigning" to take a hard look at the Democrat's state and asserted, "Arkansas is doing very, very badly against any standard."
Mr. Clinton responded by reciting his litany of accomplishments as Governor, including a rating that put Arkansas No. 1 in the creation of jobs in the last year.
The exchange led to the evening's first laughter as Mr. Perot made his contribution to the discussion. "I grew up five blocks from Arkansas," the Texas entrepreneur said. "It's a beautiful state." But he said it was also so small and atypical that "it's irrelevant," and compared the leap from its governorship to the Presidency to the difference between running a corner grocery and running Wal-Mart.
The state's Governor took offense. "I think it is highly relevant," Mr. Clinton said. "I think it's been pretty impressive."
 
Bush Objects to Question
 Mr. Bush was on the defensive when Mr. Lehrer asked whether he ignored domestic problems like race and health care until they became crises. "I don't think that's a fair shot," the President said.
Mr. Bush also took pains to blame Congress for frustrating the promise of his domestic proposals. Mr. Clinton tried to present himself as a man who would enter office with a brisk, 100-days agenda for domestic needs.
The President suggested that voters look back at the last time there was a Democrat in the White House.
"The misery index went right through the roof," he said. "Remember the question, 'are you better off?' " Mr. Bush asked. "Well, is a home buyer better off because he can refinance a home because interest rates are down? Is the senior citizen better off because inflation is not wiping out their family's savings? I think they are.
"Is the guy out of work better off? Of course he's not, but he's not going to be better off if we grow the government, if we invest, as Governor Clinton says, invest in more government."
Mr. Perot also bridled at a question from Mr. Lehrer, who asked whether he was a perennial quitter. As evidence of his commitment, he said, he would spend more than $60 million of his own money on the campaign.
"I'm here tonight, folks," he added. "When you asked me to come back in, I came back in. I've put my wallet on the table for you and your children."
The candidates clashed on the North American Free Trade Agreement, a pact reached by the United States, Mexico and Canada. Mr. Bush accused Mr. Clinton of straddling the fence on the issue after Mr. Perot condemned the agreement, which awaits Congressional approval.
The draft issue arose in the second half of the debate, when the questioning was done by a panel of reporters: Helen Thomas of United Press International, Gene Gibbons of Reuters and Susan Rook of CNN.
 
Suspicions Over 1990
 Mr. Clinton said his decision in 1969 to avoid the draft was not a mistake and would not affect his ability to command the armed services. But he also acknowledged that he had not adequately handled the questions that surfaced about how he had avoided military service.
"If I had it to do over again, I might have answered the questions a little better," he said.
During a round of questions about whether more women should serve in high government positions, Mr. Perot said the Bush Administration had withheld information about whether the American Ambassador in Baghdad, April C. Glaspie, had encouraged Saddam Hussein to invade Kuwait in the summer of 1990.
"We told him you can take the northern part of Kuwait," Mr. Perot said.
Mr. Bush interjected angrily, "We did not say to Saddam Hussein, Ross, that you can take the northern part of Kuwait."
In response to criticism from Mr. Perot, Mr. Bush strongly defended his decision to reach out to Iraq in the years before the war in the Persian Gulf. He repeated his assertion that offering loan guarantees and other assistance to Mr. Hussein was part of an effort, albeit a failed one, to bring Iraq into the "family of nations."
He portrayed the growing scandal over United States-Iraqi relations as politically motivated and fomented by Democratic members of Congress who had initially supported his overtures to that country.
Mr. Clinton praised the President for his leadership during the Gulf war. But he said the Administration had gone too far in courting a dangerous dictator.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: News Analysis;
A Late-Round Flurry for Bush
But Shape of Race Appears Unaltered

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

 BODY:
The last Presidential debate, the politicians and pundits said before it began, was President Bush's last best hope to shift the tone and the dynamics of the campaign. Do something different, they told Mr. Bush, or prepare to lose the Presidency on Nov. 3.
He changed his ways for the better. There was no looking at his watch in last night's encounter in East Lansing, Mich., as there had been last week, and no suggestion of languor. His message was clear. He did his best to make voters think about character and trust, rather than blaming him for costing them their jobs, even invoking Horace Greeley to the effect that character counts most. 
 But by the end of 90 minutes, the President had plowed little new substantive ground, and it appeared doubtful that he had done enough to alter the course of a campaign in which his own economic record had been a political millstone and Bill Clinton had taken a commanding lead. Instant polls suggested that he had not.
Because Mr. Bush is behind in so many states, he had hoped to lift his national standing in the debates, then go after individual states with big blocks of electoral votes in the remaining two weeks. If it turns out that he failed, he faces longer odds in picking up the swing states that he badly needs, like Ohio, Michigan and Illinois.
The President's job was made harder because he was under attack not only from Mr. Clinton this time but for most of the evening from Ross Perot as well. On Iraq, Panama and the savings and loan scandal, Mr. Perot blamed Mr. Bush for blunders that had cost the nation dearly.
Mr. Perot provided much of the evening's fireworks and, as before, most of its sparse supply of humor. He tried bravely to shake the label of "quitter," from which he had suffered since his sudden withdrawal last July, with an account of his steadfastness in earlier crises. But he offered few specific programs of his own.
 
Little Excitement, No Blunders
 Once again, Mr. Clinton was calm, well-organized and direct, and he stood up well in the crunch. If he generated little excitement, he also ended his three long confrontations with his rivals without having made any significant misstatements or errors.
Mr. Bush, trying to walk a fine line between manifesting Presidential dignity and an underdog's aggression, laid out his arguments with a new vigor, particularly his assertions that Mr. Clinton had been a failure as Governor of Arkansas and would fail again if elected President.
A Clinton victory, he argued repeatedly, would give the nation "a spending President and a spending Congress" like those he said it had had when Jimmy Carter was in the White House in the late 1970's and both taxes and interest rates were high.
Seeking to portray Mr. Clinton as slippery and indecisive while winning himself a degree of absolution for the recession, Mr. Bush kept saying, "If I make a mistake, I admit it," and he kept accusing Mr. Clinton of working both sides of every issue.
 
Perot Cites Noriega and Hussein
 But in one of the most dramatic moments of the nationally televised debate, Mr. Perot swiftly counterattacked, accusing Mr. Bush without mentioning his name of using taxpayers' money to bring Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and President Saddam Hussein to power, and calling on him to admit those mistakes. That weakened Mr. Bush's point considerably.
Mr. Perot also accused the President of having told Mr. Hussein that he could annex northern Kuwait and demanded that he release relevant papers. Mr. Bush reacted with a flat, heated denial, and the impact of that exchange was difficult to discern.
The President kept his concentration sharp. There was "a pattern," "this pattern," "your pattern" of indecision and inconsistency, he argued, trying to fix that word and the ideas he associated with it firmly in voters' minds as a description of Governor Clinton.
Twitting Mr. Bush for having said his chief of staff, James A. Baker 3d, would take charge of a second-term economic program, Mr. Clinton said he would be the one to take charge of such a program in a Clinton Administration. The President deftly shot back; "That's what worries me. He's going to be responsible." 
 
Composure Unshaken
 But the Democratic candidate's composure was never shaken, and he returned Mr. Bush's fire, round for round. It was the President, he said, who had signed a big tax increase after promising not to; it was the President who had embraced Ronald Reagan's economic policies after denouncing them as "voodoo economics."
Mr. Clinton also found a number of ways to suggest that he and Ross Perot, the independent candidate, were talking about the issues while President Bush sought to return to the kind of personal attacks that voters had complained about.
Clearly, Mr. Bush and his strategists had concluded that he had to get tough. In his own terms he did so, taking the fight to Mr. Clinton with lines like "watch your wallet, because his figures don't add up." Breaking the rules agreed to by his representative, Mr. Bush responded immediately and directly to Mr. Perot's accusations about Iraq.
But in the end the President is not a slasher, any more than Mr. Clinton is. That role belongs to Mr. Perot in this year's electoral melodrama. Mr. Bush's basically easy-going nature peeked through his carefully constructed plan when, after attacking the House of Representatives, he said of the Democratic speaker, Thomas S. Foley, "very able, decent fellow, I might add."

HEADLINE: Brochures, Fliers, Polls, Ads: Politics as a Business Slumps

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 19

 BODY:
There will be many winners come Election Day, but it is already clear who the big losers in politics are this year.
They are the people who print the brochures, mail the fliers, take the polls and broadcast the spots for the candidates. Election Day is to this industry what Christmas is to retailing, and neither Democrats nor Republicans are buying big this season. 
 The recession has changed the rhythm and character of campaigning in America. In almost all parts of the country, candidates squeezed by dwindling contributions are saving their scarce advertising dollars for the last minute and looking for more efficient ways to harvest votes.
 
Crying the Blues
 As a result, voters are getting a measure of merciful relief from months of hortatory advertising and other political schlock, though it might not seem so during this final election blitz. But the consultants, printers, advertising agencies, television stations, newspapers and others who drink at the trough of commercialism that has replaced old-fashioned campaigning are laying off people, cutting costs and crying the blues.
"This always seemed like a recession-proof industry," said Frank L. Tobe, president of Below Tobe & Associates of Marina del Rey, Calif., a vendor of computerized voter lists and other technical services to Democratic candidates nationally, including Gov. Bill Clinton. "But this time it really has affected us. You learn a lot in a year like this when people don't have money."
Here in California, with two important races for United States Senate, the four major candidates only recently began to advertise -- just a month before the election. A continent away in Connecticut, Paul Horgan's Ace Printery in Hartford is having its worst political year since 1970. Only 6 of the 10 or 11 Democratic state senators he usually prints for are doing mailings this year, meaning billings are down 40 percent.
"The political season is usually the boost my guys look for," Mr. Horgan said. "It comes right before Christmas and gives them some extra money. This year, there's no boost."
The recession is also speeding technological changes in campaigning in a year scrambled by redistricting and an anti-incumbent mood. With contributions way down, candidates are using new communications and computer techniques to aim at certain voters rather than relying on costly broad-based advertising.
While President Bush and Governor Clinton get Federal campaign funds, candidates for nearly all other offices, from Senate to local city council seats around the country, depend largely on local givers. And it seems that nearly everybody, even the proverbial fat cat, is broke.
 
Few Real Estate Dollars
 "Four years ago in Massachusetts, 25 percent of the Democratic dollars raised came from people connected to real estate development," said Michael A. Goldman of Goldman Associates, a consultant in Boston. "This year it's been about 5 percent. Nothing is being developed. When a candidate who hopes to raise $300,000 raises only $150,000, everybody gets hurt."
Thus, radio station WLLH, which serves the Merrimack Valley cities of Lowell and Lawrence, Mass., has had to beat the bushes for political advertising. Its five-member sales staff solicited about 50 candidates and got business from 20. "It used to be a walk-in business," said Perry G. Kapiloff, general manager. "But this year nobody had money. They said, 'I want to do more, but this is what I've got.' "
And in Portland, Ore., The Oregonian, the state's largest newspaper, has cut its rates for political advertising in half -- with only marginal results.
Republicans, normally flush, have been hit especially hard, given both the recession and President Bush's weakness in the polls. "In 1988, with Bush riding high, you had a coattail situation," said Jay Severin 3d, an advertising consultant in New York who works for Republican candidates in New Jersey. "Even with money tight, people would buy into that. Now the coattail resembles an anvil." He said his revenues were down about 15 or 20 percent.
In California, the four United States Senate candidates are each having to make do with a fraction of the $16 million that Pete Wilson, now the state's Republican Governor, raised to run for the Senate in 1988. According to Kam Kuwata, campaign manager for Dianne Feinstein, one of the Democrats, the campaign is not going to come anywhere near the $10 million it thought it needed. Her Republican opponent, Senator John Seymour, is in much the same boat.
 
Cutting Direct Mail
 In the past, advertising started here almost the day after the June primary; this time not until October. Also, Mr. Kuwata said, to save money direct mail is being used much more narrowly than before, just at the crucial "swing" voters who typically make the difference.
Some companies have capitalized on the downturn. John J. Jarrett, owner of Button King in San Jose, Calif., said orders were up by 30 to 40 percent. He attributed this to two factors: Badges are used as a cheap reward for unpaid volunteers, and many campaigns are selling them this year, rather than giving them away.
Orders for essentials like posters and yard signs are good, according to Herbert Barker, president of the Barker Specialty Company, a printer in Cheshire, Conn., but almost nobody is buying novelties like emblazoned litter bags, refrigerator magnets and pencils.
To be sure, the big pros in the business are not going broke. "But they are all saying they're working harder for the same amount of money," said Jerry Hagstrom, a Washington-based author writing a book on political consultants. "The very top firms are doing as well as ever in the numbers of clients. But for ones starting out it's really rough."
The uncertainties injected by redistricting and anti-incumbency have given a certain boost to outfits like the Garin-Hart Research Group in Washington, which polls for many incumbent Democratic Senators and Representatives.
 
Redistricting Has Helped
 "Political funding is off," said George Shipley, a consultant in Austin, Tex. "But redistricting has destabilized the American political system and most consultants benefit by that instability."
But whatever their ideological differences, Democratic and Republican candidates share the frugality platform. In Bellingham, Wash., the campaign to re-elect Al Swift to an eighth term in Congress has saved $18,000 by designing its own campaign brochures instead of using graphic artists, and has told some of its nine paid staff workers that they may be let go before the election.
"If it's a choice between an extra four television commercials and one staffer, I have to factor in which expenditure is going to reach more voters," said Jeffrey Morris, campaign director for the Democratic Representative. "This is the first year where incumbents, including Al, are on the phone saying 'I need help.' "
This kind of thing is bad news for big vendors like Below Tobe & Associates. Out of its quarters near the colorful yacht harbors at Marina del Rey annually come millions of pieces of political mail and voter lists for campaigns in New Hampshire, Missouri and dozens of other states. But this year the staff is down to 25 from 40 four years ago.
The company mainly works for political consultants. The consultants have cut back substantially on the slate cards they sell to candidates and which are a staple of Below Tobe's business. "Many of our major clients cannot get money from their candidates," said Mr. Tobe, the president, adding that the industry was being convulsed by breakneck changes in technology, such as broadcast faxing, satellite interviews and raising money through "800" numbers.
 
Shedding Its Mainframe
 "This is truly the year of technological change," he said. "All these things are contributing to faster response, smaller universes, more focus -- and less volume." The day after Election Day, the 21-year-old company will shut its big mainframe computer room, saving $20,000 a month, and shift to cheaper personal computers.
Four hundred miles to the north on Mission Street in San Francisco, Winning Directions, one of the nation's leading direct-mail houses, is struggling, too. The imaginative creations of its chief designer, Ted Cabarga, are coveted by candidates nationally. But this year, according to its president, Anthony Fazio, the company is doing more campaigns than ever but business is still down because each customer buys less than before.
Normally, he said, a candidate for, say, county supervisor in California would buy six to eight mailings, one early in the campaign, another about a month before Election Day, followed by a blitz of four or five in the final two weeks. "Now we're lucky to do four," Mr. Fazio said.

HEADLINE: At Edge of Campaign, Jackson Labors On for Democratic Victory

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BLAINE, Wash., Oct. 18

 BODY:
In a howling rainstorm at the far western edge of the continent, the Rev. Jesse Jackson huddled under a tent. If he searched the length of the United States, he probably could not find a place more removed from the hot lights of national politics than this small town on the Canadian border.
"This is a season of pain," Mr. Jackson told several hundred union members from both sides of the border who had gathered to protest provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement. "We must turn our pain into power." 
 For Mr. Jackson, a central figure in Presidential politics for the last 12 years, a man who has always had an acute sense of his daily standing in the rough drafts of history, this year may appear to be one long season of pain as he works the periphery of the main campaign.
With the help and occasional guidance of the Democratic National Committee, which has provided Mr. Jackson with a private plane, he has been to 27 states, sometimes visiting five towns in a single day. His tour has taken him in the last week from Colorado to Montana to rural Washington and Oregon. These are not the kinds of places, he said, "where you talk about Sister Souljah," referring to the rap performer who became a focal point of the differences between him and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas. But Mr. Jackson, in scheduling his itinerary, has chosen places like the Northwest.
 
Heavy Schedule of Touring
 At age 51, Mr. Jackson has visited more places this year than the touring rock star Axl Rose, his aides point out. But if the tour's goal is registering voters, as was stated early on, his presence in states like this one where the deadline for voter registration has long passed raises questions.
"One of my jobs is to generate enthusiasm for a big turnout," he said in an interview. Mr. Jackson said he was in the distant Western states in the closing days of the campaign rather than populous Eastern states because other issues and candidates, like gay rights in Colorado and Oregon, a close Congressional race in Montana and free trade in Washington, are also part of his agenda.
With Mr. Clinton appearing to be on the verge of achieving what Mr. Jackson could not, forging a diverse coalition to win the ultimate electoral prize, Mr. Jackson shows only a hint of envy. He may be on the sidelines, but the issues he has long stressed, like health care, education, job losses and racial division, are winning the race for Mr. Clinton, he said.
Mr. Jackson scoffs at the oft-heard claim that Mr. Clinton has been able to regain the Democrats who voted for Ronald Reagan by distancing himself from Mr. Jackson and the liberal wing of the party.
"I talked to Governor Clinton two days ago," Mr. Jackson recalled. "I said: 'You're not winning because you're giving blacks the elbow. You're winning because the objective economic circumstances are so bad, because Anita Hill energized women and because Bush is running an inexplicably weak campaign.' "
The two men talk frequently on the telephone, he said, asserting that his substantive differences with Mr. Clinton have been resolved.
"We said there had to be a big-tent strategy, that there was not enough campaigning in the cities, not enough association with blacks," he said. "These concerns have been largely met."
Some political friends say Mr. Jackson has put most of the pain of this year behind him. Still, there are sore points.
 
'A Separate Standard'
 "When Ross Perot entered the race, nobody talked about his lack of electoral experience, but that's one of the main criticisms you've always heard about Jesse," said Charles Rolland, an aide to Mayor Norm Rice of Seattle. "I guess there's a separate standard for billionaires."
The Democratic National Committee credits Mr. Jackson with helping to register an enormous number of voters, particularly in the South, where the Presidential race is considered to be close in many states.
But he is not just registering new voters. He literally led voters to the polls last week in Colorado. It is one of two states where the general election is stretched out over several weeks to allow voting similar to absentee balloting. After a rally in Denver, he led a parade to the voting booths. He plans to lead a similar march in Texas, which also allows early voting.
And the payoff for Mr. Jackson? "I'm not looking for a job," he said. "I'm looking for a President." The Clinton campaign has not talked to him about a possible Cabinet post, he said.
On the stump, Mr. Jackson seems more passionate when criticizing President Bush than when he is praising Governor Clinton. What really gets him excited, he said, is the prospect of electing 40 blacks to Congress this year, up from 25.
He said the electorate had been transformed from four years ago by redistricting and the rise of female candidates that followed Prof. Anita Hill's testimony in the Supreme Court nomination hearings of Judge Clarence Thomas.
"You see, Gov. Clinton is reaping something he didn't sow," he said. The collapse of Communism, which weakened the Republicans' appeal to the need for military strength, and the bad economy made this year tailor made for a Democrat, he said.
When asked if he would have preferred to be that Democrat, Mr. Jackson said he had no regrets. But he did point out how much better he did in many states than Senator Al Gore, the Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee, when they sought the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1988.
"Our concern right now is Clinton versus Bush," he said. "But another struggle begins Nov. 4. It is a struggle for the soul of the country. I don't think it will be a hostile struggle."

It's Your Choice, Lilian: The Cad or the Cluck

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:

Folly
By Susan Minot
278 pages. Houghton Mifflin/Seymour Lawrence. $19.95.
In her latest novel, Susan Minot, the acclaimed author of "Monkeys" and "Lust," takes a step backward into the past, to the years between World Wars I and II. But while "Folly" is set in a different era from her previous books, it takes place in a familiar world of old families and genteel wealth, and it tackles familiar themes of familial and romantic love. 
 At the age of 18, Ms. Minot's heroine, Lilian Eliot, is a pretty, optimistic girl, the daughter of one of Boston's good Beacon Hill families. Her life takes place within the circumscribed social rituals of her parents' circle: holiday get-togethers at the houses of friends, skating parties in the winter, the occasional concert and Historical Society tour.
Though she has vague yearnings for a wider world, though she is sometimes amazed "by the amount of feeling sloshing about inside her," Lilian is basically a conventional young woman. She knows that her choice of a husband will define her, and once she marries, she knows her husband's choices will "determine her life." "Not only did she not think of making certain choices herself," writes Ms. Minot, "she was completely unaware of having the desire to do so."
This theme of a young woman's coming of age in a strict, highly stratified society, was of course a favorite of writers like Edith Wharton and Henry James; and like those authors, Ms. Minot seems interested in using her heroine's sentimental education to explore the consequences that the strict social mores of an earlier age could have on a malleable young mind.
As depicted by Ms. Minot, Lilian's Boston emerges as a stultifying, suffocating place. The women chatter mindlessly at teas and luncheons about clothes and hair and the latest news: "who was engaged, who had cut whom, how the children were behaving." The men spend their free time golfing, playing tennis and drinking.
When Lilian sees people walking up and down Beacon Street or Tremont Street, she notices that none of them reveal "anything of what was going on inside." They seemed to be "putting their feelings in one hidden place and the rest of themselves out in life."
Then, suddenly one evening, everything changes for Lilian when she meets a friend of a friend from New York, an intense, fiercely independent man by the name of Walter Vail. Lilian's parents are put off by Walter's abrupt manners and overall "look," but Lilian is smitten. Even when he breaks a date to have dinner with another woman, Lilian remains steadfast in her infatuation. Walter makes her feel "like someone else," someone more exciting and vivid, and she resolves to wait for him when he goes away to war.
The war eventually ends, but Walter does not return, and for years Lilian hears nothing further from him. While her friends marry and begin having children, she resigns herself to being a spinster. Just as she has begun to abandon all hope of connecting to another man, she meets Gilbert Finch, a quiet, agreeable fellow, who impresses her with his decency and reserve. Gilbert fits in easily with Lilian's family and friends, and in his presence, she feels herself "returned to herself."
The pair announce their engagement, marry, set up housekeeping in Boston, and -- in a fast-forward leap -- have three children. Although Gilbert has a nervous breakdown at one point, he eventually recovers, and life in the Finch household soon settles into a predictable routine. It's a boring, emotionally empty routine, but Lilian is determined to be a dutiful wife. Her life seems "airtight, all the seams sewn up," with "little space for anything new" -- that is, till Walter Vail unexpectedly resurfaces and once again insinuates himself in her life.
As "Monkeys" clearly demonstrated, Ms. Minot has a gift for delineating her characters' inner lives with economy and precision, and she does a nimble job here of tracing the emotional arc of Lilian's life, revealing her gradual move from innocence into awareness and eventual disappointment.
Unfortunately, the people surrounding Lilian are little more than sounding boards, two-dimensional automatons who are meant to give her something to react to. Her Boston girlfriends, for the most part, are a shallow, unremarkable lot, differentiated only by their different styles in flirting with men. Her parents are cliches: her father is a cold, intolerant patriarch; her mother, a parody of the passive, long-suffering wife.
Worst of all are the two men in Lilian's life, who are crude stereotypes of the charming cad and the ineffectual dolt, types epitomized, for many readers, by Heathcliff and Linton in "Wuthering Heights" and by Rhett and Ashley in "Gone With the Wind." It's apparent from the first that Walter is a complete ne'er-do-well: his charm is smarmy and insincere; his cynicism, all too apparent. As for Gilbert, he's a simpering wimp: weak, self-absorbed and crushingly dull. Perhaps their portraits are meant to be satiric; perhaps their two-dimensionality is simply a result of Ms. Minot's difficulty in creating a full cast of characters in period emotional dress.
Whatever the reason, both Gilbert and Walter are so broadly drawn that we have difficulty understanding why Lilian would spend an afternoon (much less a lifetime) with either one, a fact that can't help but undermine our sympathy for her.

Business at the Tracks Is Beating the Odds

BYLINE: By JOSEPH DURSO

 BODY:
New York racing closed its 42-day autumn meeting at Belmont Park yesterday with no further erosion of attendance or betting, and officials were optimistic that the full year might show the first gain in attendance in 10 years.
The year's totals will depend on what happens during the next 62 racing days at Aqueduct in Queens, where the New York season will be resumed tomorrow. Between then and the end of the year, nine races a day will be run six days a week, with 33 stakes offering more than $4 million in purses. 
 Racing people were clearly pleased with business at Belmont for the last seven weeks because it seemed to be stabilizing after years of recession in the horse industry. At least, attendance and betting were only fractionally off last year's totals for Belmont's fall season.
The average daily attendance was 10,601, which was almost identical to last year's total, and the betting handle averaged $2.4 million, which was about $8,000 below last year's average. And for the 251 days of racing so far this year at Belmont, Aqueduct and Saratoga, attendance has gained slightly more than 1 percent over last year.
"There is something positive happening here," said Jerry Lawrence, executive vice president of the New York Racing Association. "If we can keep it going for the rest of the year, we will accomplish something that hasn't happened here in over a decade."
Lawrence noted that New York's racing business has held its own despite the extensive series of betting programs begun at the Meadowlands track in New Jersey, where bets can be placed on races from as far away as England and Scotland.
"It's no secret that money is tight right now," he said, "and there is increasing competition for the entertainment and gambling dollar. In spite of increased competition for the New York City bettor with full-card simulcasting day and night at the Meadowlands, it is an outstanding accomplishment that our business figures remained level."
Lawrence also said that the quality of racing was energized when Belmont bunched stakes races on Sept. 19 and Oct. 10 as previews for the Breeders' Cup, which will be held Oct. 31 at Gulfstream Park in Florida.
"We were able to re-establish New York as the center of fall racing with our two Super Saturdays," he said.
The autumn meeting also crowned a new riding champion: Jerry Bailey rode 37 winners and edged out Chris Antley, who rode 33, with Mike Smith and Julie Krone next. The leading trainer was Shug McGaughey, who saddled 17 winners, three more than Peter Ferriola. During five weeks at Saratoga this summer, McGaughey saddled only two winners during an unlikely dry spell.
Aqueduct will put a dozen juveniles on stage tomorrow for its opening stakes race, the $100,000 Cowdin at seven furlongs. The early favorite: the McGaughey entry of Not for Love and Ferociously, half-brother to the similarly well-named Furiously.
 
FINISH LINE
 When you're hot, you're hot. And ANDRE FABRE, the French trainer, is hot. He won the Arc de Triomphe two weeks ago and then headed to America, where he won the All Along Stakes at Laurel on Saturday, the Long Island Handicap at Belmont on Sunday and the Tidal Stakes there yesterday. He also finished first in the Rothmans International at Woodbine on Saturday, but his horse was disqualified for crowding and was dropped to third. Fabre scored at Belmont yesterday with the 3-year-old filly Revasser, who stayed off the lead until the homestretch, when she ran down Honor Rajana and beat him by two lengths, with Time for Lightning three lengths back in third. The winner ran the mile and three-eighths on the turf in 2:14 3/5 and paid $8.20 for $2 to win as second choice to Stagecraft, who faded to seventh.
 
Arazi Classic-Bound?
 LONDON, Oct. 19 (AP) -- Arazi is expected to run in the $3 million Breeders' Cup Classic and would lead three European 3-year-olds in the premier race on Breeders' Cup Day at Gulfstream Park on Oct. 31, an English newspaper reported today.
The Racing Post today quoted Allen Paulson, a co-owner of Arazi, as saying that the French-trained colt was likely to enter the mile-and-a-quarter Classic.
"Francois Boutin favors it," Paulson said, referring to Arazi's trainer. "He says Arazi is back to his old self, has never been better."
Rodrigo de Triano, winner of the English 2,000 Guineas and Champion Stakes, is set for the Classic, as is St. Jovite, the Irish Derby winner.

BELL LABORATORIES HIRES 27 RUSSIAN RESEARCH SCIENTISTS

 BODY:
A.T.& T. Bell Laboratories, in its second such venture, said yesterday that it had hired 27 more Russian scientists, this time from St. Petersburg. The scientists, working under a one-year contract from Bell Labs, are from the A. F. Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute. They will conduct fundamental research into semiconductor physics and semiconductor lasers. As the Russian economy collapses and government subsidies disappear from huge scientific enterprises, many Western companies, including those in the United States, have become concerned that Russian scientific work would founder for want of paychecks. 
 The value of the new A.T.& T. contract is less than $100,000, including salaries, travel expenses and equipment. In May, A.T.& T. and Corning Inc., announced separate agreements in which each hired the services of more than 100 Russian scientists in the field of fiber-optic research.

HEADLINE: An Asian Voice for Democracy

 BODY:
Few people doubt that foreign broadcasts contributed powerfully to the democratic ferment in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Why shouldn't American radio programs do the same in the still-Communist countries of Asia and for the unfree Burmese?
A special Congressional commission makes a persuasive case for creating an Asia Democracy Radio or Asia Information Radio to provide the kind of coverage now offered in the West by Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty. 
 Such programming could fill a conspicuous gap at modest cost. "Radio is an instrument of peace, not a weapon of war," declares the Commission on Broadcasting to the People's Republic of China. "It is inexpensive and it maims no one."
And radio is king in China: there were 200 million sets in 1989, compared with 30 million television sets. Of 350 hours of foreign broadcasting to China each week, only 15 percent is in Chinese -- and more than half of that comes from Taiwan, much of it hard-line propaganda.
Hence there is room for balanced, professionally prepared programming, in native languages, that would cover internal developments in China -- and in North Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Myanmar, the new name given to Burma by its military overlords.
The commission's report follows the very different recommendations of another high-level panel concerned with the future of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, based in Munich. That panel urged, unwisely, that these stations be phased out and television be given higher priority than radio. But that overvalues TV, slights radio and too readily dismisses the case for independently managed stations that would cover day-to-day events within the listeners' own country.
A majority on the Asia commission reasonably holds that the proposed new service should be organized like Radio Free Europe, under a separate board, independent of Voice of America, thus assuring diversity of voices. Part of the start-up cost could be met, the report argues, by closing down TV Marti, a failed Cuban service that Fidel Castro has effectively jammed. Given America's immense political and economic stake in the Pacific, Asia Democracy Radio deserves a trial.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
No Hiding Place

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Now we have to hurry up and decide for ourselves the one critical question about a candidate's fitness to hold the Presidency that the debates failed to answer.
Can he walk and chew gum at the same time? 
 Spelled out: Can he recapture Americans' faith in their economic future and at the same time deal properly with "foreign" problems that will become American problems whether we like it or do not like it?
In the last debate Ross Perot put in a vivid reminder of the Bushbaker appeasement before the war. But that was a maverick moment in a series in which the world outside America was made to disappear. The assumption of questioners and candidates was that for the next few years the President could concentrate solely on domestic matters while the world stood docilely by awaiting his eventual attention.
That is startling naivete. So here are a few examples of minefields Americans might want to think about now, because after Inauguration Day we will be watching our President try to walk his way through them:
1. Russia is going down. Many old Communists are ready and eager to put on their other face, never really hidden. If the United States cannot get its eye off its economic navel we will spend billions confronting a Fascist Kremlin instead of a Communist Kremlin -- hardly a great example of cost-efficiency.
2. Proliferation. China has become the supermarket of third-world dictators hunting for missiles and nuclear technology.
China not only produces and sells modern weapons and nuclear technology but is getting more of both at discount prices from Russia. Adding a decent markup, it sells them to customers like Syria and Iran.
From Czechoslovakia and other Eastern European buffets various Middle Eastern dictatorships snap up good cheap tanks and other delicatessen of war.
The problem is, we sell billions in our own death specialties, like fighter planes, to Taiwan and freedom-loving Saudi Arabia, among other countries. So it does get difficult to put an anti-proliferation squeeze on the Russians or East Europeans.
Still, the life and death issue of the years ahead will be whether West and East will again arm dictatorships to the point where they can start war. That will be far more important economically to us than owls or even capital gains cuts.
3. Beijing is ditching some of the economic ballast of Communism but not its political noose. Hitler and Japan showed what the combination of dictatorship and state capitalism can bring in domestic oppression. Economic sanctions could force Beijing to ease off on brutality against its own people. But that could mean less grain sold to China, fewer cheap-labor products on the American market. Are we ready?
4. Europe has the military power to deal with the Bosnian horror. But, surprise, Europe took a walk.
American jets attacking Serbian artillery and military planes could still prevent more massacres. Well?
5. Cuba. During the next four years, there's likely to be a revolt against Castro's oppression. The rebels will ask for United States help. Then?
I think if I were an editor whose team of reporters forgot to ask candidates about these things I might be real annoyed. But we will just have to find our own clues.
Mr. Bush would rely on James Baker to "coordinate" the economy -- to chew while he walks. Presumably that would leave Mr. Bush to devote himself again to foreign affairs.
History will remember Mr. Bush as the man who organized and won the victory in the Persian Gulf. It will also remember him as the man who threw the victory away and who tried to revive the Soviet corpse when it was dead and stinking.
Mr. Clinton has solid government background, but no important foreign policy experience. But he does have something important. He seems to know where he is going.
In his foreign affairs talks is a sense of constancy. It is the belief that promotion of democracy abroad is in America's interests, that dictatorships cannot be appeased, that in their very nature lie the genes of war.
I voted for Mr. Bush but have found it increasingly difficult to understand his political philosophy about the conduct of world affairs or where consistency and constancy exist. I no longer know what he is telling us, and where he is walking.

HEADLINE: Singling Out Blacks Where Few Are to Be Found;
Amid Hills of Rural New York, Students From Inner City Find Not-So-Hearty Welcome

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ONEONTA, N.Y., Oct. 17

 BODY:
Derrick Forbes's first day at school was like a page torn from a journal of the old South.
The afternoon he arrived here from Brooklyn two years ago, the lanky, soft-spoken soccer player waited downtown for a bus. When it arrived, Mr. Forbes said, a police officer blocked his way, forcing him to wait until all the whites had climbed on. 
 "I was wondering if the cop was drunk, or if he had something personal against blacks," Mr. Forbes said. "He couldn't know me at all."
A small city of Victorian houses in upstate New York, Oneonta has become emblematic of the rural towns across New York that draw thousands of blacks from the inner cities to college campuses every September, promising a tranquil path to mainstream America. But the city youths arrive as aliens in a distinctly white world, and say they remain on its fringes, feeling unwelcome in its stores, on its streets and in its bars.
 
Sense of Existing Apart
 The sense of existing apart from the community, a buried discomfort for many of the black students and faculty, surged to the surface six weeks ago, when the State University of New York's College at Oneonta supplied the names of all its black male students to police officers investigating the attempted rape of a 77-year-old white woman who had described her assailant as a young black man. With a few keystrokes on a computer, the school transformed 125 students into suspects in the criminal investigation, solely on the basis of color. To the consternation of government and business leaders, the action catapulted race to the front and center of the local agenda.
For blacks here, the college's action was a watershed, exploding the internal dams that kept frustration and anger at bay. In looking at the way they lived, students, faculty and longtime residents recalled a torrent of indignities, subtle and profound, that together betrayed the underside of a rustic town's charms. They realized their small decisions were often circumscribed by race.
And whites reacted with such astonishment that an outsider could wonder whether the two races were living in the same town at all.
"The last time something like this happened," said Kevin Slater, who has worked as a consultant to the school on multicultural programs, was in 1955 in Montgomery, Ala., when Rosa Parks refused to give up her bus seat to a white person "and it became a national issue."
"That one situation made people look at the whole fabric of society," he said.
Last week, the students began describing their experiences in Oneonta to a team of lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union, who will likely bring a class-action suit on behalf of those whose names were given to the state police.
Providing the list, the college's president, Alan B. Donovan, has acknowledged, violated the Family Right to Privacy Act of 1974. It appears, however, that the Civil Liberties Union may bring suit on broader grounds.
"Their birthright entitles them to equal protection under the law," said Scott N. Fein, a partner in the Albany firm of Whiteman, Osterman & Hanna. "This appears not to be a universally held view in the community."
Officials here say that beyond releasing the list -- which they deplore as a humiliation and a political blunder -- they do not feel black students are regarded with suspicion. Aside from a party that grew too loud and went too late a few weekends ago, the town's population of 15,000 -- 97 percent white -- has never had to deal with disturbances from the 400 or so black students at Oneonta. It is far more accustomed to weekend noise and violence from the school's 5,100 white students, said Police Chief John H. Donadio.
"There's discrimination against students," he said. "We realize they're crucial to the economy, but they build resentment, an awful resentment, among people here."
 
Matters of Race
 Chief Donadio denied that officers harassed blacks or ignored their complaints, and he labeled Mr. Forbes's description of his first day in Oneonta "preposterous." David W. Brenner, the Mayor of Oneonta, laments that the issue of race has "contaminated the environment."
But black students like Derrick Forbes, Frederic Sanon and Lawrence Plaskett -- who came to these picturesque hills to learn far from New York City -- say the environment here has always been contaminated by matters of race, it was just that the whites never had much reason to notice.
Mr. Forbes said he had had several jarring run-ins with the Oneonta police. A soccer star, he reversed the team's losing streak when he joined. One night, he went out drinking with the team after a winning game. His teammates threw their arms over his shoulders. "They said I was their lucky charm," he recalls, and smiled.
But when they left the bus, five police cars waited, with officers accusing him of selling drugs to his teammates. They searched him for drugs and found none, he said.
"If there's a black guy and white guys hanging around him, he must have something they want," Mr. Forbes said. "That's my perspective on how they thought."
 
'A Very Wrong Decision'
 Chief Donadio does not deny that some of his men may be prejudiced, but he said they were professionals who would not let it affect their work.
Come June, Mr. Forbes plans to leave Oneonta. "Right now, I think coming to Oneonta was a very wrong decision," he said.
Frederic Sanon complained that shopkeepers tended to watch black customers more closely than whites, as if they expected them to shoplift.
"When you go shopping, you make sure you don't have a book bag, no loose pants, nowhere they could say I put something on me," said Mr. Sanon, a sophomore from the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. "I feel on edge. Every time I go shopping I check myself."
Mr. Sanon was arrested for disorderly conduct last spring after he asked to see a copy of the store policy when the manager of a supermarket demanded he check his knapsack.
"When he threatened to call the police, I said, 'Go ahead,' because I thought the cops would agree that it wasn't fair," Mr. Sanon said. But the police officer upheld the store's position, and Mr. Sanon shouted epithets labeling Oneonta and the store as racist. "That's it. You're under arrest," he quoted the police officer as saying before hauling him away.
The police chief said Mr. Sanon's arrest "was not a matter of race."
"We got a call for disorderly conduct," he said, "and when we got there, that's what we found."
Mr. Sanon thinks about going back to Bushwick, but wants to finish his studies here. "If I go home I'm just going to be partying with my friends, and my chance of getting in trouble is great," said Mr. Sanon, who is majoring in political science. "Here, I know if I just do my work, I'll make it."
"You come to the point where you expect the city to harass you," added Mr. Sanon. "But what hurts is to learn your own school is furnishing a list to help them harass you. School's supposed to be like your family. They are supposed to help you through."
Kevin Slater, the multicultural consultant, said that many disputes between blacks and whites in Oneonta entailed the overt or unspoken threat to call the police. And that reflex, he added, was driven by fear.
"All the images you see on television and film, up until a few years ago, were of black men as big, destructive and threatening," he said. "Police see themselves as protectors of the whites. When it comes to blacks, they see themselves as suppressing an insurrection."
Mayor Brenner attributes the tension to the behavior of black students, who he says are quick to take offense.
"A part of that is the place from which they came, the baggage they bring with them, the heritage they bear," he said. "The white student is less likely to answer viscerally. He doesn't feel threatened as much as a black person would."
As a move toward healing, Mayor Brenner said the police force would hire its first minority officer.
However, the Mayor noted that some things are not easily changed. He confessed that he had spoken with a top executive of Bresee's, the 93-year-old family-owned department store that anchors Main Street, who told him the store had a policy of following blacks and those who display suspicious behavior.
"In her mind, she combined the two," Mayor Brenner said. At weekly community meetings on race relations, the store's practices are the topic of regular discussion, as is a possible boycott. Mark Bresee, the owner, denied his store had a policy of following black customers, but he said sales people were instructed to call security "if they felt intimidated." Most of the shoplifters the store catches are white, he added.
Mr. Bresee, like many whites here, said there were no racial problems in Oneonta. He appeared shocked to hear that the black students and residents have felt persecuted, and presumed they were viewing unrelated slights through a prism of race.
Mr. Bresee said most disturbances were among white students on weekend nights. Clashes between fraternities have left three white students hospitalized since school started. He recalled a visit to the store by 20 drunk fraternity brothers who frightened sales people. But one of the youths explained they were hazing a new member, who had to try on women's underwear.
"Of course, I let them do it," he said. "There were 20 of them and they'd been drinking."
But black students asked to imagine themselves in the same situation said they could not. "That's like saying I want to go to jail," said Lawrence Plaskett, who said he had been thrown off a bus in a downpour because he refused the driver's order to leave his candy bar at the front. "For a candy bar, they had sirens running for me."
Barbara J. Potter, executive director of a community dispute resolution center called Mediation Services Inc., said she believed that many whites in Oneonta were unaware that race dictated their reactions at all. "This belongs to the realm of things that you don't know you don't know," Ms. Potter explained.
Earl W. Roberts 3d, pastor of the Elm Park United Methodist Church, said he knows he is not striking a responsive chord when he sermonizes about blatant racism.
"I tell them that racism is not just in the K.K.K. or in the neo-Nazis, it's in nice people who wouldn't knowingly discriminate against anybody," he said and smiled sadly. "Most people in my congregation would say they're not racist, without thinking about what goes on inside of them when they step into a bus with black passengers and feel frightened."

 CORRECTION:
Because of transmission errors, an article yesterday about race relations in Oneonta, N.Y., referred incorrectly to the police chief and to an incident in which officers accused a student of selling drugs. The chief is John J. Donadio; the incident occurred as the student was leaving a bar, not a bus.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Pledges 4-Year Corporate Tax Freeze

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
Saying he wanted to make the city more hospitable to business, Mayor David N. Dinkins yesterday promised to freeze New York City's general corporate tax for the next four years.
Although Mr. Dinkins already assumed in the city's financial plan covering the next three years that there would be no rise in corporate taxes, his pledge yesterday to freeze the current rate of 8.85 percent for four years carried a far greater commitment and was meant to send a soothing message to a jittery business community, mayoral aides said. 
 In the words of one aide, Mr. Dinkins had moved from "a silent assumption" to a firm "policy announcement" in the financial plan that corporate taxes would not rise. "It's a commitment versus an assumption," said the Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, Barry F. Sullivan. Mr. Sullivan, a former banker who is perceived by many in the business community as their voice at City Hall, was crucial in persuading the Mayor to hold the corporate tax rate, mayoral aides said.
Mr. Dinkins said that at the least, his promise amounted to extending his tacit commitment on corporate taxes for a year beyond the three years in the financial plan. But he said he hoped that by announcing this policy he could create "a pro-business environment" in the city.
"I won't ask you to read my lips," he said. "We all know where that got us. But I am committing this administration to a four-year freeze on corporate tax rates."
Executives said the Mayor's pledge marked a watershed in his evolving relationship with big business, which was not part of the coalition of unions, minority groups and liberals that elected him in 1989. Several said the high corporate tax rate and a bevy of other business taxes unheard of anywhere else in the United States were major reasons behind the departure of so many companies.
"I think it's sending out a message that he recognizes the future prosperity of New York depends on retaining businesses," said Ronald K. Shelp, president of the New York Chamber of Commerce.
Lewis Rudin, the real-estate developer who heads the Association for a Better New York, called Mr. Dinkins's vow "a positive signal that international and national companies have to think very seriously before leaving New York."
 
Courageous or Safe?
 Felix G. Rohatyn, the financier and chairman of the state Municipal Assistance Corporation, said the announcement, coupled with news that Morgan Stanley, the financial services concern, had agreed to stay in the city, would encourage businesses that for a variety of reasons -- high crime, poor schools, high taxes -- are thinking of pulling up stakes. "The Mayor is very courageous in doing what he's doing," he said.
But others said Mr. Dinkins's pledge was a fairly safe strategy because, with the national recession continuing to crimp corporate profits, it is unlikely the city will lose much revenue by freezing the corporate tax rate for four years. Losing businesses to other cities and states might hurt city revenue more. In addition, there is little support in Albany or the City Council for raising taxes on businesses in any case.
"It's a nice reassurance for economically tough times that doesn't come at great cost to the city," said the Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messenger. "It's not all that big a deal."
The general corporation tax accounts for 5.5 percent of tax revenue in the current budget, or about $912 million. The rate has been reduced in the last 15 years from 10.1 percent in 1974 to the current 8.85 percent.
 
Some Complaints Remain
 But businesses still complain that it is too high, city officials and business executives said. Companies also groan that they are saddled with two other taxes unique to New York: Enterprises that rent their premises pay a tax on their monthly rent and unincorporated partnerships must pay a special business tax, so that partners in effect find their salaries taxed twice. New York is also the only American city with a progressive personal income tax.
Mr. Sullivan, who joined the administration last spring, has taken aim at many of these taxes in his effort to make the city, in his words, "a friendlier, more customer-oriented location for businesses." Though it is not possible to reduce or to eliminate these taxes in the present climate, Mr. Sullivan said, in the long term he would like to see many business taxes decline, especially the rent tax and the unincorporated business tax.
"If I had my druthers, I would deal with the most unpopular stuff," he said.

HEADLINE: New York Incentives For Morgan Stanley Prevent a Relocation

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
The Morgan Stanley Group, a major financial services company that had been considering moving its New York City headquarters and as many as 4,100 employees to Stamford, Conn., will remain in the city for at least 10 years, company officials said yesterday.
The city and state have agreed to almost $40 million in tax credits and other incentives over the next decade to help keep the company in New York, city and state officials said at a news conference yesterday at Morgan Stanley's midtown offices. At the same news conference, Mayor David N. Dinkins also promised to freeze the city's general corporate tax rate for the next four years. [page B9.] 
 Morgan Stanley pays between $90 million and $100 million a year in taxes to the city and state, and will pay an estimated $911 million in taxes over the next 10 years, said Mayor Dinkins, who contended that the tax incentives were a modest investment given the financial returns that Morgan Stanley's decision to stay will mean for the city.
The company's flirtation with Stamford was very public -- two years ago, it took an option to buy a parcel of property in that city's downtown -- and the city and state's pledge of tax breaks was the latest in a series of incentive packages offered this year to keep major companies in New York.
In August, Prudential Securities promised to keep its headquarters in lower Manhattan for 20 years, after looking into relocating to Jersey City, Houston, San Francisco or Los Angeles. The brokerage is to receive at least $106.2 million in tax incentives and energy savings over 20 years.
Also in August, four of New York's five commodities exchanges reached final agreement on a plan that prevented their moving to Jersey City. They will move to a city-owned site near their current location in the World Trade Center. The state will invest $27 million in the project and the city will provide a $26 million grant and $22 million in capital construction financing.
Last month, though, a financial services subsidiary of the First Chicago Corporation announced it would leave Manhattan next year for Jersey City, taking 1,000 jobs with it. After negotiating with the company, city officials dropped out of the competition, saying they could not match the terms offered by Jersey City.
Morgan Stanley's decision to stay in New York was described by one senior business representative as a "watershed," because if the company had left, it would have forced many other large financial services companies with whom it competes to re-examine whether they should leave.
Ronald K. Shelp, the president of the New York City Partnership, a business group, said that when his organization studied the financial services industry several years ago, a top official of a major company said that if any of his competitors moved out of the city, he would also have to consider doing so to cut costs and remain competitive. So far, Mr. Shelp said, none of the major companies in the industry has moved its headquarters, although many have relocated back-office operations.
 
Dinkins Praises Agreement
 At the end of the First Chicago negotiations last month, city officials said that they would have had to offer an incentive package worth $50 million to match the terms of New Jersey offer -- or $50,000 for each of the 1,000 jobs. The cost to New York City for even the most generous incentives offered in the past was no higher than $20,000 per job, city officials said.
The $39.6 million in incentives negotiated with Morgan Stanley would be worth slightly less than $10,000 for each of the 4,100 jobs. For Prudential, which made a commitment to stay twice as long, the cost was $11,600 in tax incentives for each of the 5,000 jobs retained, or $21,000 per job if the energy savings -- realized through the purchase of low-cost energy from the state power authority -- was figured in.
Mr. Dinkins said he was thrilled by Morgan Stanley's decision. He said the company generates $2 billion in economic activity in New York each year, and he argued that the symbolism of its determination to stay was even more significant than the financial value of the commitment.
"It sends an invaluable, priceless message to the world's businesses," the Mayor said, "that New York City is the place where businesses do their best business, where the giants and the leaders choose to headquarter themselves."
 
Plea From Businesses
 So critical was the company's decision viewed by other political and business leaders that, at a breakfast meeting sponsored two years ago by the New York City Partnership and held at The New York Times, many of the city's business, political and cultural leaders implored Morgan Stanley officials to remain in New York.
In briefly explaining the announcement yesterday, the company's chairman, Richard B. Fisher, said, "The key reason for our decision is that New York leaders, in our view, are committed to making the city a hospitable place to do business."
Morgan Stanley's president, Robert F. Greenhill, noted that the company's officers have an obligation to shareholders to control costs. He also said that what he described as the city's "deteriorating social and economic" climate in recent years had caused many corporations to consider alternatives.
In the end, though, company officials did not say precisely why they had decided to stay in New York, and they did not indicate whether their decision was based entirely on financial comparisons.
 
Incentives From Connecticut
 The state of Connecticut offered incentives as well, said city officials, who added that they did not know the details of Connecticut's offer. A telephone message left for Stamford Mayor Stanley J. Esposito late yesterday was not returned.
Mr. Shelp of the New York City Partnership said that for most companies it is less expensive to operate outside New York. The corporations that decide to stay in the city usually do so for several related reasons, including New York's intense concentration of business services and talent, its cluster of potential clients and its transportation and communications advantages.
The ability to interact face-to-face with customers keeps many companies in the city, he said. "There are a lot of factors other than cost that go into it," Mr. Shelp said. "It is still the place to be, the financial services center of the world."
The $39.6 million incentive package offered by the city and state to Morgan Stanley includes $4.2 million in what officials called real-estate tax stabilization, in which the city would limit property-tax increases; $17.2 million in credits on the company's commercial rent tax, and $18.2 million in relief on city and state sales-taxes, largely for the purchase of equipment.
In return, Morgan Stanley will remain for at least 10 years in its headquarters at 1251 Avenue of the Americas, near 49th Street, as well as in office space it rents in two other midtown buildings and in Brooklyn Heights, where it moved its back-office operations several years ago.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans;
Debating Done, Bush and Clinton Begin Final Push

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SPARTANBURG, S.C., Oct. 20

 BODY:
No longer able to hope that Presidential debates would lure swarms of voters back to his ranks, President Bush and his advisers dropped the pretense today that campaigning as usual would win his re-election two weeks from now.
Now it is trench warfare, and the battle plan became evident today along the railroad tracks and picture-book crossroads of small-town Georgia and South Carolina. 
 Campaigning by passenger train one day after his best debate showing, an energized Mr. Bush hit Mr. Clinton with everything he had.
To throngs that filled main streets and spilled into alleys, the President assailed Mr. Clinton's record as Arkansas Governor, attacked his economic proposals, warned over and over that he "flip flops" on difficult issues and recalled the "sorry" history of his avoiding the Vietnam War draft.
 
Polls Shrugged Off
 Mr. Bush and his aides appeared to be buoyed by the debate on Monday in East Lansing, Mich., in which the President struck many of the themes he repeated today. They shrugged off polls taken after the debate, some of which suggested that Mr. Bush's performance had still not won over wavering voters.
Saying he was glad to be "in the land of the free and the home of the Braves," Mr. Bush told about 7,000 people at the crossroads in the center of Norcross, Ga., an Atlanta suburb, with a few thousand others outside a roped-off security area. "Forget about all these polls.
On this two-day swing through three Southern states, Mr. Bush is going to 10 towns and granting six television interviews. His press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said he would campaign nonstop until Election Day, often speaking in three or four cities a day.
"You have seen the future," Mr. Fitzwater said as Mr. Bush spoke in Norcross, "and this is it."
 
Enthusiastic Crowds
 It was evident by the time his 20-car train reached Spartanburg late this evening that Mr. Bush was drawing some of the largest and most enthusiastic crowds of the campaign. There were almost 15,000 people here, waiting for him and for an elaborate fireworks display.
When Mr. Bush spoke of his own plans, it was only to contrast them with what he called Mr. Clinton's philosophy of "tax more and spend more." When he mentioned the economy, it was to remind people that the slowdown is not just in this country but global, and that other nations have it worse.
"Our data show this thing is coming down to taxes and trust," said the Bush campaign's political director, Mary Matalin. "The people are not down to that choice stage yet."
In his four stops in Georgia and South Carolina today, Mr. Bush focused repeatedly on what he called "a vast difference in experience," character, and philosophy between himself and Mr. Clinton. "Character is important, and you cannot in that Oval Office be all things to all people," Mr. Bush said to several thousand cheering supporters in Cornelia, Ga., northeast of Atlanta. "Governor Clinton tries to be on every side of every issue, and you cannot have that as President of the United States."
Earlier, in Norcross, Ga., Mr. Bush's charges about Mr. Clinton during the Vietnam War, while forceful, largely avoided the stridency of his earlier suggestions that the Arkansas Governor was unpatriotic in opposing the war, and focused instead on Mr. Clinton's varying explanations.
Campaign aides said later that they believed the issue of Mr. Clinton's credibility was beginning to register with voters after weeks of effort.
"Baseball is like politics," Mr. Bush said. "On Election Day we're going to show America that it ain't over until Cabrera swings." He referred to Francisco Cabrera, whose pinch-hit single in the ninth inning carried the Atlanta Braves to the World Series last week.
Ms. Matalin said Mr. Bush could still pull off a comparable feat by winning the sizable number of voters who still have reservations about Mr. Clinton. She assumes that Mr. Bush will capture 210 electoral votes in the normally Republican South and West, and pick up 60 more in contested states in the Midwest and border regions, for the 270 that are needed to win.
Republican strategists say an unusually large number of voters, perhaps a third, have still not committed themselves to a candidate. That raises hopes that a volatile electorate could swing to Mr. Bush as the safest choice in a year without compelling favorites.
More important, Mr. Bush campaign's chairman, Robert M. Teeter, said Mr. Clinton's support remained unusually soft. He said in an interview today that perhaps a fourth of Mr. Clinton's backers were wavering.
Aides also say Mr. Perot, whom Mr. Bush dubbed "the feisty little guy from Dallas" in one speech today, remains a wild card. With 15 to 20 percent in many polls, "we think that helps us and hurts Clinton," Mr. Teeter said.
But the depth of the President's plight is suggested by the itinerary of this railroad trip through Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina, the very core of support that Mr. Bush is supposed to have locked up. Like much of the South, these states have left the Republican fold in 30 years only for Jimmy Carter or Lyndon B. Johnson.
 
Assessment of the South
 Senator Strom Thurmond, the South Carolina Republican, who was aboard the Bush train today, predicted that the President would carry his state. But even he allowed that Mr. Bush was trailing Mr. Clinton in Georgia and even with him in North Carolina.
Ms. Matalin also acknowledged that the gap between the President and Mr. Clinton, even in the Bush campaign's own internal polls, had not yet narrowed much, but instead has only bounced up and down between about 8 and 15 percentage points.
As recently as this weekend, after Mr. Bush's slack performance last week in the second debate, the gap was in the double-digit range, she said. But she added that it had dropped since then and that she expected the margin to dwindle further.
Even as Mr. Bush rallied the faithful today, his aides worked the press corps seeking to repair damage done to the President's foreign-policy record last night by Ross Perot.
At Mr. Bush's first stop, his National Security Adviser, Brent Scowcroft, said Mr. Perot "had shot from the hip" when he accused Mr. Bush of hiding the White House instructions to coddle Iraq's leader, Saddam Hussein.
A State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, echoed Mr. Scowcroft's view and said the United States never suggested to Baghdad that Irag could seize part of Iraq.
The campaign will also begin using new television commercials on Wednesday, some offering upbeat messages about a second-term agenda and others with man-on-the-street interviews to hammer at Mr. Clinton.

HEADLINE: Women Advance in Politics By Evolution, Not Revolution

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD

 BODY:
In this acidic political season in which Anita Hill has become a shorthand for outrage and the "Year of the Woman" is a familiar refrain, it is easy to believe that revolution is at hand.
But come November, when the voting is over, there will be no storming of the gates.
Even a wave of victories by female candidates will not give women dominance on Capitol Hill. Should a female candidate win in every possible race, the 103d Congress would still be 80 percent male. 
 More likely, many women will lose, leaving the United States still well behind most European countries in female representation. Yet women have made steady gains in politics since the early 1970's, and this year they will make more. Already, half again as many women (108) have won Congressional primaries as ever before. (The previous record was 70 in 1990.)
Eleven women, a record by one, are running for the Senate. State legislatures will be changing, too. In California, women will run in 74 of 120 races. Every victory will bring another woman experience that may some day propel her toward a higher office.
 
Patience, Patience
 Those gains have been the stuff of sweat, not spontaneous combustion. Though women have clearly been beneficiaries of voters' enthusiasm for change, actual victories at the ballot box will be not so much a result of sputtering anger as of the long, little-noticed efforts of a band of well-spoken political guerrillas.
Undaunted by early defeats, scrounging money from mailings stamped "Urgent!," this loosely knit community has worked for well over a decade to recruit and elect female candidates. Its members have guided campaigns and gathered in hotel rooms to study everything from hairdos to handshakes and help women in a competitive world they tend to enter later and with less professional experience than men.
As long ago as the early 1970's, groups like the National Women's Political Caucus gathered candidates for seminars in the building blocks of fund-raising, stump speaking and other campaign fundamentals. Then, that group and others gave that most essential of campaign lubricants: money.
The groups' common goal is as difficult as it sounds simple: never to quit until women, who make up almost 52 percent of the population, have something like 52 percent of the clout.
"We've got the objective reality that women vote differently than men on important issues," said Patricia Ireland, the peripatetic president of the National Organization for Women. "It is women who experience sexual harassment on the job. It is women who experience violence in the home. It is women who are still the primary care givers. If we are going to have a representative government, we have to have women in office."
Studies of voting patterns conducted by the Rutgers Center for the American Woman in Politics show that women vote differently from men on many issues.
Ultimately, the advocates believe, having more women in office can make the difference between a bill's passage and its defeat. According to a NOW study on female legislators and social policy, 71 percent of women -- but only 52 percent of the men -- in Congress voted unsuccessfully to override a Presidential veto of the Family Medical Leave Act.
More recently, when Congress sought to override President Bush's veto of a bill that would have allowed federally financed family-planning clinics to provide information on abortion, women voted overwhelmingly to override but failed to carry the day.
 
'Tribes on the Hill'
 "It's not like we are taking over the country," said Harriett Woods, the president of the National Women's Political Caucus and a two-time losing senatorial candidate from Missouri. "But men left to themselves are like tribes on the Hill. We just want to try things our way."
The groups operate on a first-name basis in a loose yet complementary community. Still, disputes simmer. Some women believe that political contributions should be invested only in candidates with a good chance of winning. Others say that victory is impossible to predict, so the more the merrier. Some believe women should not run against each other and cite the bitter New York Senate primary in which Geraldine A. Ferraro and Elizabeth Holtzman were defeated. Others say that men do, so why shouldn't they?
This year, such questions have eased a bit. Despite the recession, the groups' bank accounts are brimming as never before. The stumbling economy and the resulting focus on domestic concerns have pushed issues like family and medical leave, health care and abortion rights to the fore. High-profile candidates like Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein in California, Carol Moseley Braun in Illinois and Lynn H. Yeakel in Pennsylvania have now made the goals seem more reasonable.
 
Democrats Benefit More
 The boon, however, has gone primarily to the Democrats. The Republican Party, split over a conservative platform that would outlaw abortion and perceived this year as almost hostile to women's rights, has alienated some Republican women and missed out on some of the energies generated by the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas controversy. President Bush may have compounded that problem Thursday during the debate in Richmond when, noting that most female candidates are Democrats, he said, "I hope a lot of them lose."
This year, 10 of the 11 women running for the Senate are Democrats who represent the mostly liberal ideals shared by the women's political groups. Democrats dominate races for the House of Representatives as well, 71 to 37.
There was no real beginning. Instead, the effort to move women center stage has been propelled by a series of losses, setbacks and moments of recognition so complex and varied that no one date suffices.
In 1973, when the Women's Political Caucus, a group devoted to furthering women's participation in government, held its first national convention in a hotel in Texas, the front desk refused to page one of the participants on the ground that only a prostitute would answer a hotel summons.
Year by year, more women were willing to face such invective and challenge the odds against them. Year by year, most of them lost.
 
New Surge of Energy
 Then 1982, the year that saw the equal rights amendment drift past its deadline and into virtual defeat, brought a new surge of energy. Activists with the women's movement suddenly turned their sights toward mainstream politics. While Ms. Woods's commitment was triggered by lessons learned through her own defeat, other figures such as Eleanor C. Smeal, then the president of the National Organization for Women, decided to move away from street protests to pull more traditional levers of power.
The E.R.A.'s demise and the election year itself had sent two powerful messages:
First, studies done after the E.R.A. deadline passed showed that female legislators had voted in favor of it more often than men, with a gap of up to 40 percentage points in some states.
Second, 1982, like 1992, was a post-census election year that had more open seats than usual because of redistricting. A study of the winners showed that women (like all challengers) made better gains in reconstructed or open districts than they did fighting against incumbents.
 
Finding and Financing
 The lessons and strategic refinements of the following years held the seeds of a conflict that still simmers.
Early political groups like the National Women's Political Caucus and the Women's Campaign Fund built their work around the notion that it was up to them to find and finance the best candidates they could. Working with limited resources and plenty of heart, they stormed the country looking for women who would run. Then, fearing that a woman's loss was actually a double loss -- once for the candidate herself, and again for those women who might follow -- they tried to determine who would win.
In 1985, Ellen R. Malcolm, a straight-speaking, independently wealthy Washingtonian who had watched Ms. Woods's second defeat with dismay, founded Emily's List to raise money and finance women's candidacies. Taking its name from the phrase "early money is like yeast," and contributions from a loose network of women sympathetic to the cause (10 percent of the group's members are men), Ms. Malcolm devised a novel fund-raising strategy. Convinced that every dollar must be fired like a rifle, Ms. Malcolm requires candidates to provide polling data and proof of a well-organized campaign.
The stakes are huge. Those candidates who win the group's backing gain a certain celebrity status along with bundles of checks. The fund-raising strategy this year is expected to raise $6 million in contributions, making that group by far the best financed.
"If we took money and gave it to 150 women equally instead of the 35 we thought could win," said Ms. Malcolm, "then some of those 35 wouldn't win."
But some feminists say this rifle-shot approach penalizes deserving candidates. "You can't predict winners," said Ms. Smeal, the former NOW president. "Politics isn't like that."
In 1987, she founded the Fund for the Feminist Majority, and began a nationwide drive called "the feminization of power" to encourage women to aspire to positions of power in everything from student councils to the White House. Though the fund does not contribute to candidates because of its tax status, this year it dispatched a team of fierce lieutenants through California, New York, Arizona, Oregon, Tennessee and South Carolina to identify potential candidates.
Using a slick campaign, huge mailings and a sizable staff, it spreads the message that a major surge in representation can be obtained only by "flooding" tickets with women on the ground that some will win, some will lose and everyone will learn something in the process.
In Georgia, Cynthia McKinney, a charismatic Democrat from a predominantly black district, said her campaign team had estimated that it would have cost about $50,000 to provide the data, information and structure that Ms. Malcolm's group required.
"We only had about $20,000 in the bank," Ms. McKinney said. Instead, Ms. McKinney's campaign received help from the National Organization for Women. "They had confidence in my candidacy when other groups didn't," she said. "NOW really came through for us." An endorsement soon followed from the Women's Campaign Fund, and now, having won the primary for an open seat, she is given a good chance at victory.
Groups teach everything from how to organize a campaign budget to how to make a stump speech.
At Emily's List, once a candidate is endorsed, she is coached. "Women candidates are very serious," said Ms. Malcolm. "They learn and learn. It's like they are trying to pass their S.A.T.'s."
Someday, perhaps, such remedial training will no longer be needed. Someday, too, in the far distant future when women fill the halls of Congress and the Senate has finally built a women's bathroom (female senators now use the wives' lounge) someone, sometime may sputter and declare that it is high time, really, for a "Year of the Man."
But that will be another generation's battle.


GRAPHIC: For two decades or more, women have helped women in politics. Today, some organizations are devoted to that goal full itime or have made it a central theme. Most of the organizations provide campaign training and most saw membership and contributions rise dramatically after Anita Hill'/s testimony in the Senate confirmation hearing of Justice Clarence Thomas.

HEADLINE: Tempers Flare as Pennsylvania Rivals Debate

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 20

 BODY:
The sparks flew today as Senator Arlen Specter and his Democratic opponent, Lynn H. Yeakel, met face to face for the last of two debates after bombarding each other with negative advertising for weeks.
The hourlong morning radio debate offered the candidates an open format to present their views and interrupt each other at will. And that is precisely what they did. 
 The two moderates discussed jobs, the economy and health care. But mostly they got bogged down in accusations about how each side was distorting the other's positions and maligning each other's character.
Mr. Specter, a former District Attorney, repeatedly tried to impugn Ms. Yeakel's character by reminding listeners that her family belonged to a country club with no black members, and that she was a member of a church whose pastor had once made unfavorable comments about the Israeli Government.
 
Accusation of Lying
 Ms. Yeakel dismissed Mr. Specter's accusations, saying at one point, "You just keep lying."
They repeatedly attacked each other's negative advertising campaign. Mr. Specter defended one of his television commercials as accurately reporting that Ms. Yeakel had waited 10 years before paying more than $17,000 in Philadelphia income taxes. Ms. Yeakel said the assertion was misleading because she voluntarily paid the taxes after her lawyer brought the situation to her attention last fall.
For his part, Mr. Specter said an advertisement referring to him as having a "slimy campaign style" and as being "the single most obnoxious man in the Senate" was simply mudslinging. A nonpartisan organization reached the same conclusion about Ms. Yeakel's advertisement on Monday.
But perhaps the crucial moment of the debate, broadcast by KYW, took place in the following exchange between the candidates, when their voices rose and choked with anger:
MS. YEAKEL You know, Arlen Specter is in the mud pile with George Bush. He has been attacking my character since the day after I won the primary.
MR. SPECTER That's not true.
MS. YEAKEL He has been diverting attention from the real issues of this campaign, and I want to tell you something. He is not running for prosecutor, he is running for the United States Senate. And he is not going to sit here and humiliate me the way he humiliated Anita Hill.
MR. SPECTER I've been waiting for that for a long time.
MS. YEAKEL I know you have.
MR. SPECTER Here we are back to the single issue.
Political professionals said the debate was a campaign milestone because it was the first time Mr. Specter had attacked his opponent so strongly.
Mr. Specter, whose popularity plummeted after the Senate confirmation hearings of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, has criticized Ms. Yeakel as a one-issue candidate and has questioned her character, but never so boldly as he did today. It was also the first time that Ms. Yeakel attacked Mr. Specter in person for his tough questioning of Prof. Anita F. Hill, who accused Judge Thomas of sexually harassing her when they were colleagues at two Federal agencies.
"The gloves are coming off now," said G. Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Millersville State University in Lancaster. "This debate may be the dramatic turning point in the race because it shows Specter now feels strong enough that he can sharply criticize Yeakel without Anita Hilling her, and without worrying about a backlash."
Similarly, Randall M. Miller, a professor of political science at St. Joseph's University, said Ms. Yeakel's forceful reference to Professor Hill during the debate indicated that she now felt strongly enough to rekindle voters' anger about the hearings in the final two weeks of the campaign.
Until today, Ms. Yeakel had hewn closely to the Clinton-Gore campaign themes of creating jobs, enacting universal health insurance and bringing change to Washington. But the Hill-Thomas hearings have motivated her entire campaign, which she began shortly after the hearings. "
Despite the highly emotional notes hit by Ms. Yeakel, public opinion polls reflect Mr. Specter's strength. A Pittsburgh Post-Gazette poll conducted Oct. 8 through Oct. 11 and made public last week showed Mr. Specter leading Ms. Yeakel by about 10 percentage points.
Professor Madonna said, "Specter, emboldened by the polls, believes he can go on the attack."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: On the Issues;
Debates Leave Some Holes, But Also Clear Impressions

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 20

 BODY:
For the relatively few Americans who listen to campaign speeches and read position papers, the Presidential debates left big gaps and plenty of unresolved arguments.
But for the tens of millions of others who watched, the 270 minutes of debate offered a first and rather solid look at where the candidates stood on important issues. 
 On some issues, like gun control, trade, term limits and automobile pollution standards, the lines separating the three candidates were clearly drawn.
On other matters, like how to pay for a new health care system, the distinctions remained fuzzy.
President Bush was forced into a discussion on Iran and Iraq that he would have preferred to avoid. Gov. Bill Clinton was unable to describe how he could do all he was promising and still get the deficit under control. Ross Perot kept saying there were plenty of plans on everything, but he never let on which ones he favored.
And a major issue -- abortion -- was never mentioned. Neither was the question of what qualifications the candidates would look for when they picked nominees for the Supreme Court.
 
'A Sense of Priorities'
 Still, said Charles O. Jones, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin and a student of the Presidency, the debates were of great value to voters. "You got a sense of priorities," he said. "You got a sense of their personal engagement in different issues. They're not all engaged in the same issues. You got a sense of the depth of their understanding of the issues. And you got a general sense of direction."
But people who have been closely following the candidates found that little new ground was broken.
One possible exception came Monday night, when Mr. Clinton suggested that some affluent people should pay higher taxes on Social Security benefits. The Arkansas Governor discussed the topic last spring before the Florida primary but has mentioned it little if at all since then.
Mr. Clinton's campaign staff said the comment about Social Security was a statement of philosophy rather than a specific proposal.
Mr. Perot has also suggested taxing a larger portion of the retirement payments of the more affluent beneficiaries. Mr. Bush opposes the higher taxes.
On issues where voters are likely to have fixed opinions, the three candidates took firm positions:
*Mr. Clinton supports a waiting period to allow police checks before handguns can be bought. Mr. Bush opposes the measure. Mr. Perot says it is not very important.
*Mr. Bush likes the free-trade agreement with Mexico. Mr. Perot opposes it. Mr. Clinton supports it with modifications.
*Mr. Perot wants a higher tax on gasoline. The other two oppose such a tax.
*Mr. Bush and Mr. Perot favor term limits for members of Congress. Mr. Clinton does not.
*Mr. Clinton wants stricter limits on auto emissions. Mr. Bush and Mr. Perot oppose such a measure on the ground that it would cost jobs.
But on more complicated issues, the candidates often bobbed and weaved. Perhaps it was because they did not want to let on that the public might have to pay a price. Perhaps it was an indication that the candidates themselves had not sorted out where to stand. The best illustration of this is the question of how to pay for medical care.
The three candidates agree that the health care system should be changed so that insurance is more widely available and affordable and medical costs do not rise so much. Outside experts say it could cost $20 billion a year or more to meet those goals, but neither party's candidate was able to say during the debates how they would meet the additional costs.
Mr. Clinton talked about taking on insurance companies and bureaucracies. Mr. Bush kept bringing up the high cost of malpractice lawsuits. Mr. Perot answered a question about this on Oct. 11 the way he answered questions on several other matters: "We've got plans lying all over the place in Washington. Nobody ever implements them. Now I'm back to square one. If you want to stop talking about it and do it, then I'll be glad to go up there, and we'll get it done."
His record on the economy aside, if Mr. Bush could have avoided one topic, it would doubtless have been the questions Mr. Perot raised Monday night about Mr. Bush's policy toward Iraq before the war in the Persian Gulf.
For his supporters, the President's highest cards have been his record of leadership during that war and his reputation for telling the truth. The questions about Iraq could have planted doubts in voters' minds on both matters.
The hardest question for Mr. Clinton was probably the first one Monday: how could the public possibly believe that as President he could create jobs, cut taxes for the middle class, reduce the deficit, change the medical care system, build big new public works projects and guarantee college educations for everyone who is qualified and pay for it all just with higher taxes on the very wealthy and foreign corporations?
Mr. Clinton said the middle class would "have their fair share of changing to do and many challenges to face."
But he did not say exactly what he meant and never answered the question directly.

HEADLINE: Study Could Be Prelude To Private Owner for OTB

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT

 BODY:
Faced with shrinking profits and renewed criticisms of mismanagement, New York City's Offtrack Betting Corporation is being studied by an outside company, a move that may bring the independent government agency closer to private ownership.
For much of this year, officials in state and city government have increasingly suggested the sale of the 22-year-old agency, which operates offtrack horse-race betting in the city, arguing that it could be more efficiently run in private hands. Even Mayor David N. Dinkins, who has been a strong supporter of the OTB president, Hazel N. Dukes, has indicated he favors selling the agency. 
 Ruby Ryles, an assistant press secretary for the Mayor's office, said yesterday that she expected the appraisal, which is being conducted by Morgan Stanley & Company, to be finished in the next several weeks. "Upon the completion of that study and its evaluation, the city will make a determination about the future of OTB," she said.
 
A Search for Options
 Mr. Dinkins, in his city budget proposal for the next fiscal year, suggests a transaction in which the agency would bring $55 million in revenue to the city, without specifying details. Mr. Dinkins can initiate an OTB sale with the approval of the Legislature, a city spokeswoman said.
But OTB officials cautioned against speculating that a sale of the agency was in the works. "We are not looking for a buyer," said Marjorie W. Longley, OTB's senior director. "We are simply having Morgan Stanley investigate what our worth is."
She said the study was intended to give OTB a detailed look at itself as it further streamlines its operation, which has been strained in recent years by a poor economy that has hurt gambling across the board, experts say. She also indicated that the study might be used to provide the agency with figures to help it refute claims that privatization would be good for OTB and the city. Proponents of private management contend it would enhance OTB's efficiency and its profit margins.
The news of the Morgan Stanley study was first reported in Crain's New York Business on Monday.
Since its creation by the State Legislature in 1970, OTB has handled $17.4 billion in wagers, Edward Lewis the OTB Chairman, said last week during a meeting of the Advisory Commission on Racing in the 21st Century. More than 75 percent of that amount was used to pay winning customers, he said.
From its profits during those years, OTB has distributed $937.4 million to the city, $362.2 million to the state and some $156 million to other local governments, he said. Another $918.1 million has gone to the New York racing industry.
But last year, OTB gave the city $600,000 in profits, the lowest in its history. The agency's highest single-year profits for the city was $40 million in 1977, the New York State Comptroller, Edward V. Regan, said in a report earlier this month, in which he called OTB "a prime candidate for privatization."
Meanwhile, Mr. Regan said OTB should close 21 of the least profitable of its 93 branches, which could save the agency up to $15 million a year.
Perhaps sensing an opportunity in OTB's loss of revenue last year, the New York Horse Racing Association, a private, nonprofit group, made a tentative offer to purchase the agency for $45 million to $55 million. But no deal was made.
Gerald Lawrence, executive vice-president of the horse-racing association, refused yesterday to say if his association would make a new offer.

"Background: 2 Decades of OTB"
 The New York City Offtrack Betting Corporation was created as a public-benefit corporation in 1970 by the State Legislature. The operation and management of OTB, including the selection of sites for betting branches and the types of branches that are built, are regulated by state legislation.
OTB operates 93 branches in the city's five boroughs.
Since it has been in operation, OTB has handled $17.4 billion in wagers, three quarters of which was paid back to winning customers.
The agency is governed by a five-member board of directors, which includes the OTB President, Hazel N. Dukes.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
Clinton and Bush Agree on Trimming Armed Forces, but Their Paths Vary

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 20

 BODY:
President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton agree that the United States military in the post-cold war era should be a smaller force prepared to respond quickly to regional contingencies with the most advanced weaponry.
But the two candidates offer slightly different paths to reach roughly similar goals. Mr. Bush would shrink the active-duty military from 1.9 million now to 1.6 million troops by 1995. Mr. Clinton would match that cut and reduce the force level by 200,000 more by 1997. Already, the military is shrinking by 100,000 troops a year. 
 Mr. Bush proposes military spending of $1.42 trillion between now and 1997. Mr. Clinton calls for spending $1.36 trillion in the same period, a difference of about 4 percent. Most of the difference would come from troop cuts and reductions in the "Star Wars" anti-missile defense system.
"Our forces must be more mobile, more precise and more flexible, and they must have the technologically advanced weapons they need to prevail and to prevail quickly," Mr. Clinton told the National Guard Association convention on Sept. 15.
 
Clinton Gives Few
 This line could have been borrowed from speeches by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney or Gen. Colin L. Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Mr. Clinton has deliberately hewed close to the Administration's position on military spending to defuse Republican accusations that Democrats are soft on national defense and to deflect questions about the Arkansas Governor's avoiding the draft during the Vietnam War.
Beyond those generalities, Mr. Clinton has given only skimpy details of what his proposed military of the future would look like, and campaign advisers say that was done deliberately to avoid committing to troop levels that may have to be changed later.
Because the candidates share relatively similar positions on military spending and the size of future armed forces, national security issues have not been a major part of the campaign debate.
Nor has Ross Perot focused closely on military reductions. In his book, "United We Stand: How We Can Take Back Our Country," Mr. Perot calls for $40 billion in cuts beyond those proposed by Mr. Bush (or about $20 billion less than Mr. Clinton's). Mr. Perot would have American allies, like Germany and Japan, pay a larger share of the cost to station American troops in those countries for their defense.
 
Visions on the Future
 Mr. Perot and Mr. Clinton favor lifting the ban on homosexuals in the military. Mr. Bush does not.
Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton do diverge in their vision of how to help former service members, and what role the Government should play in helping America's military industry adjust to smaller Pentagon budgets.
Mr. Bush would rely mainly on existing programs in several Government agencies to cushion the pain for military personnel leaving the armed services, displaced military factory workers and communities affected by base closings. By most estimates, though, these programs are inadequate to cope with hundreds of thousands of former service members flooding a weak economy.
Still, the Bush Administration has demonstrated a pronounced reluctance to interfere with the free-market forces that are buffeting military contractors and throwing thousands of people out of work. Mr. Cheney has said the Defense Department should not be a "social welfare agency."
 
Relying on Lawmakers
 But Mr. Clinton does not think the Government is doing enough. He favors transferring Pentagon spending to expanded job retraining and community assistance programs. He says he favors continued production of several major weapon systems, like attack submarines and fighter aircraft, to keep that technology readily available in times of crisis.
In crafting his strategy for military spending and national security, Mr. Clinton has relied heavily on three centrist Democrats in Congress: Representative Les Aspin of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee; Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee; and Representative Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.
A Clinton Administration would cut the number of aircraft carriers to 10 from the 12 called for under Mr. Bush's plan. Mr. Clinton has not described the number of Army divisions or Air Force fighter wings he would want, though he does favor building new aircraft like the F-22 fighter, C-17 transport plane and V-22 Osprey aircraft.
Mr. Bush, meantime, had spelled out a detailed "base force" he would keep -- 12 aircraft carriers, 12 active-duty Army divisions and 26 fighter wings. He, too, supports modernization of existing weapons systems, including the F-22 and the C-17.
Both candidates embrace a new buying strategy that focuses on developing prototypes and forestalling full production until an affordable system is built and a clear need can be demonstrated. The military industry complains that this approach is impractical, and neither candidate has given details on how to make this strategy profitable.
Under both candidates, the American military would be an increasingly United States-based force, less reliant on foreign bases and sea power, and -- particularly under Mr. Clinton's plan -- more dependent on improved sealift and airlift to send troops and equipment to a conflict quickly.
Mr. Bush would keep 150,000 American troops stationed in Europe after 1995. Mr. Clinton proposes reducing that force to 75,000 to 100,000 troops, a position Congress has endorsed. Both candidates would retain some American forces in Japan and South Korea.
 
Disagreeing on Jobs Lost
 Clinton campaign advisers say that the Administration's plan is just a smaller cold war force. President Bush responds that Mr. Clinton's plan cuts too deeply into "the muscle" of American forces.
Mr. Bush's assertion that under a Clinton Presidency one million additional jobs would be lost in the military industry misrepresents a University of New Mexico study on which the claim was based. The author of the study, Avi Shama, a professor of management, wrote in an article for The New York Times last month that one million defense industry jobs would be lost under Mr. Bush plan and nearly 1.6 million jobs would be lost under Mr. Clinton's cuts.
As with conventional forces, the candidates generally agree on how they should reduce America's nuclear arsenal, while still keeping about 3,000 warheads for strategic deterrence.
Mr. Bush supports missile defenses, from improved Patriot missiles to missile-killing rockets orbiting the Earth. Mr. Clinton endorses an improved Patriot but would cut $15 billion to $20 billion from the Bush Administration's proposed $37 billion "Star Wars" program, mainly from space-based weaponry. Mr. Clinton would also slow development of a ground-based missile-defense site until the need for such a system is clear.
Advisers from both campaigns concur that candidates have fundamentally different views on how, or whether, the Government should help the military industry adjust to shrinking Pentagon budgets or convert production to more commercial goods.
The Bush Administration "is letting major production lines go cold, for everything from tanks to planes to submarines, often ignoring the capacities they represent," Mr. Clinton said in a speech last August to the Foreign Affairs Council in Los Angeles.
Moreover, the two candidates differ on how to help former service members. Mr. Clinton says he would find jobs for displaced workers by devoting Federal money to communication, transportation, new environmental technology and other infrastructure projects. He supports using redirected Pentagon spending for this purpose.
This month, Congress approved a $274.3 billion military budget bill for the 1993 fiscal year that included $1.5 billion for these kinds of programs.
Mr. Cheney said the Administration had programs in place providing $7.1 billion to help people or regions affected by military cuts. Of that $7.1 billion, which is over two years, about $2.2 billion is in severance pay and $3.4 billion in unemployment benefits. The Administration is spending the remaining amount on a combination of job retraining, community assistance and improved G.I. Bill benefits. And in a separate program the Administration has also proposed spending an additional $1 billion over the next five years for similar programs.
But beyond that, the Administration has a questionable record when it comes to spending money earmarked in the Pentagon budget for conversion purposes. In October 1990, Congress ordered the Pentagon to transfer $150 million to the Labor Department for retraining programs, and $50 million to the Commerce Department for community assistance.
But the Labor Department did not receive the money until September 1991, and has spent only $30 million of the $150 million. The Commerce Department did not receive its money until February 1992 and has spent $1.9 million of the $50 million, according to Commerce Department officials.
On balance, though, campaign advisers and military analysts say the shape, size and mission of the armed forces in the future would not be radically different under Republican or Democratic administrations.
An assessment of Mr. Clinton's national security proposals by Georgetown University's National Security Studies Program concluded: "A Clinton Presidency would not fundamentally alter the current content of U.S. national security policies."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Candidates on the Issues: Differing Routes to Similar Military Goals"
 
The Themes
Mr. Bush says that as the leader of the international coalition that defeated Iraq, he should be trusted as an experienced commander-in-chief. He supports a smaller post-cold war military ready to respond to regional contingencies with the most advanced weaponry. Mr. Bush says his Administration has already taken steps to ease the transition for people and areas affected by military reductions.
Mr. Clinton acknowledges Mr. Bush's experience in national security issues, but holds that national security is now linked closely to domestic economic strength. He, too, supports a smaller post-cold war military with a size adequate to respond quickly to regional conflicts. But Mr. Clinton would use more Pentagon spending to cushion the effects of military reductions and assert a larger Government role in helping American military industries in the transition.
 
 The Proposals
Mr. Bush endorses the Pentagon's "base force" of 1.6 million active-duty troops by 1995. He would spend $1.42 trillion between now and 1997 on the military's budget. He supports modernizing American military technology and a an anti-missile program that includes defenses in space.
Mr. Clinton would cut an additional 200,000 troops by 1997 and proposes spending $1.36 trillion by 1997, about 4 percent less than Mr. Bush. Most of these reductions would come from troops cuts and reductions in the missile defense system, mainly those in space.
 
 The Scorecard
Mr. Bush faces a losing battle with a Democratically controlled Congress on maintaining his proposed spending levels for the military. An agreement between the White House and Congress that prevented the transfer of Pentagon spending to domestic programs expired this year, making deeper Defense Department reductions likely in 1993.
Mr. Clinton has deliberately stayed close to the Bush Administration's position on military spending and strategy, largely to avoid charges that Democrats are soft on national security. He has not described in detail the shape of his post-cold war military, but Congress is likely to support his more aggressive programs to assist workers and regions affected by base closings.

New York City Prices $844 Million in Bonds

 BODY:
New York City priced yesterday about $844 million in bonds for sale to the public.
The city's bond offering consisted of two parts: $759.2 million of general obligation bonds through a group of underwriters led by Lehman Brothers,, and a total of $85.12 million of tax-exempt and taxable capital appreciation bonds through Prudential Securities. 
 Earlier this week, the city received good news when the Standard & Poor's Corporation, the credit-rating concern, affirmed its A- rating on New York City debt. The agency said that while its ratings outlook for the city remained negative because of the recession, the city's budget was reasonably balanced. Despite this, yields have climbed above 7 percent on the city's tax-exempt bonds due in 15 years or more.
Traders and investors had been skeptical about how much the $759.2 million bond issue would save on interest costs, considering the weakness of the bond market and the size of the deal.
 
Sweetening the Deal>
 Although many investors want New York City bonds, which are exempt from Federal, state and city taxes for city residents, some traders quietly say investors may be unwilling to pay premium prices for them, since the city already has about $19 billion in publicly traded bonds outstanding. Indeed, to make the city's bonds more attractive, underwriters repriced and raised yields 5 basis points, or five-hundredths of a percentage point, on the long end.
Lehman Brothers is offering the general obligation bonds to yield a maximum 7.15 percent for bonds maturing in 2011 through 2018. For shorter maturities, the city is offering serial bonds at prices to yield from 3.9 percent in 1994 to 5.5 percent in 1997, 6.5 percent in 2002, 6.3 percent in 2007 and 7.1 percent in 2009 and 2010.
All the bonds are rated Baa-1 by Moody's Investors Service and A- by S.& P., except for the issues due in 2007 and 2008, which are insured by Financial Security Assurance and therefore rated triple-A by both rating companies.
The city's offering of $85.12 million in tax-exempt and taxable bonds represents the second sale of "NYC Bonds" aimed at smaller investors. These bonds can be purchased for as little as $1,400, with investors receiving $5,000 when the bonds mature in 15 years or more.
Of the total financing, $75.05 million is of tax-exempt zero-coupon bonds that if held to maturity will yield a maximum 7.25 percent for an issue due in 2011 and 2012, with the remaining bonds yielding from 5.6 percent in 1997 to 7.2 percent in 2009 and 2010.

HEADLINE: Better Earnings at Citicorp and Chemical

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Profits at Citicorp and the Chemical Banking Corporation improved considerably in the third quarter compared with a year ago while net income at Wells Fargo & Company dropped 72 percent. But the performance of the three was overshadowed by several other large banks across the country, which had earnings that were at or near record levels.
The Banc One Corporation of Columbus, Ohio, reported a 33 percent gain in profits, to $186.2 million, while PNC Financial, owner of Pittsburgh National Bank, earned $135.1 million, up 26 percent. The Norwest Corporation of Minneapolis earned $133.9 million, up 21 percent, and the Mellon Bank Corporation, Pittsburgh, earned $156 million, more than double the year-earlier quarter. 
 These four regional banking companies are regarded as among the best run in the industry in recent years. By focusing on consumers and small and medium-size businesses, they have avoided the worst of the loans to large real estate developers, which badly hurt many other banks.
Among banks that have lost heavily from real estate loans, Wells Fargo earned $24 million, down from $86 million a year ago, which in turn was far below its profits of preceding years.
Among large New York banks, Citicorp's profit of $116 million was slightly above the range it had estimated earlier this month, and much better than the $885 million loss it reported a year ago. Chemical's profits rose 35 percent, to $282 million. Both companies benefited from cost cutting and increases in revenue from foreign exchange trading.
"The overall earnings picture for the industry has been pretty good all year, and that has continued in the third quarter," said Ronald Mandle, a banking analyst at Sanford Bernstein & Sons. He added that the key forces behind the record profits for the best-run banks were a decline in nonperforming assets like badly delinquent loans and real estate acquired through foreclosure, and an exceptionally wide spread between the interest rates banks charge borrowers and the rates they pay on deposits.
Profits at Citicorp were helped by a sharp rise in revenue for foreign exchange trading to $364 million from $193 million in the second quarter.
As it forecast earlier this month, Citicorp said it was making progress in cutting expenses, so that it now has a profit before the cost of bad loans to businesses of $1.9 billion in the third quarter, up from only $1.38 billion in the first quarter of 1991.
As the profit margin has widened, Citicorp's losses from loan write-offs, reserves to cover expected losses and costs of holding real estate acquired through foreclosure has fallen to $521 million, from $705 million in the second quarter and a peak of $792 million in the fourth quarter of 1991. Write-offs of consumer loans rose to $860 million, from $838 million in the second quarter.
 
Federal Examination Under Way
 Although Citicorp's losses from commercial loans have fallen in recent quarters, analysts and investors say the company needs more reserves and capital to absorb future losses. The need for more capital may become more apparent after an examination by Federal officials that is now under way is completed, said Christoper Whalen, director of the Whalen Company, a Washington consulting firm.
Citcorp added $1 billion to its capital through the sale of a preferred stock issue earlier this month, but still has a relatively thin cushion of capital and reserves compared with other large banks. Its shares closed yesterday at $15.125, up 25 cents.
Chemical Banking's profit of $282 million was equal to 98 cents a share, up from $209 million, or 95 cents a share, a year ago. The gain in earnings per share was reduced because the company issued 57.5 million additional shares earlier this year.
Foreign exchange trading profits at Chemical rose to $176 million from $49 million in the second quarter and $73 million a year ago. The company also benefited from an increase in the margin between the rates it collects on loans and the rates it pays on deposits to 3.84 percent, up from 3.69 percent in the second quarter and 3.27 percent a year ago.
The company said it had cut expenses by $65 million in the quarter, excluding one-time charges and the costs of real estate owned as a result of foreclosure. Its shares closed unchanged yesterday at $33.50.
Wells Fargo & Company, whose reliance on lending to real estate developers produced big profits in the 1980's and big problems in recent quarters, reported yesterday that those problems were continuing. In the third quarter its $24 million profit was equal to 21 cents a share, down from $86 million, or $1.59 a share, a year ago.
At a time when real estate experts say that prices of California commercial real estate have not stopped declining, Wells appears to be preparing itself for heavy losses on those loans. It added $400 million to its loan loss reserve, even though it wrote off only $264 million of loans as a loss during the quarter. A year ago, when its real estate loan problems were just emerging, it added $200 million to the reserve and wrote off $123 million as a loss.
Wells could afford the heavy loan losses and still earn a profit because of the earnings from its California consumer business, which analysts say is one of the most efficiently run bank branch systems in the country. The net interest margin remained high at 5.69 percent, which was unchanged from the second quarter but well above the 5.22 percent of a year ago. Wells also benefited from an increase in noninterest revenues to $285 million, from $224 million a year ago, with $45 million of the gain coming from the sale of securities. Its shares closed yesterday at $64.125, down 87.5 cents.

HEADLINE: C.D. Yields Are Mixed For Week

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields offered on bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit turned mixed in the week that ends today, giving depositors some respite from the steady drop in bank rates since July, when the Federal Reserve cut the discount rate and most large banks subsequently cut their prime lending rates.
Analysts at The Bank Rate Monitor, a Florida-based interest rate publication, said money market accounts slipped again, but yields on certificates of deposit were up at commercial banks and just slightly off at savings banks. 
At the Treasury's weekly auction of three- and six-month bills on Monday, the average discount rates rose to their highest levels since the end of August. And since the auction is often regarded as a reliable barometer of how banks will eventually set deposit rates in the weeks ahead, it may be a signal that a bottom has been reached.
According to numbers released by the Treasury, the average rate at auction for a three-month bill this week rose 6 basis points, to 2.94 percent from 2.88 percent, while the longer six-month bill rose 15 basis points, to 3.10 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The combined New York area average for yields in the latest week showed a smaller decline in the average money market account, down a basis point, to 2.81 percent, while a three-month certificate of deposit was at 2.86 percent for the third consecutive week, and a six-month certificate gained a basis point, to 3.01 percent.
Yields at commercial banks were mixed for the second straight week, with the average money market account off a basis point to 2.63 percent, and a three-month certificate and a six-month certificate up 2 basis points each, to 2.76 percent and 2.89 percent respectively.
While the news was good for commercial bank depositors, savings bank yields were again lower.Each category was down a basis point, to 3 percent for a money market account, 2.97 percent for a three-month certificate and 3.12 percent for a six-month C.D.
Large adjustments were made this week at First Nationwide, which dropped its money market account by 20 basis points, to 2.70 percent, and at the Bank of Tokyo Trust, which raised both its three- and six-month C.D. by 25 basis points, to 2.68 percent each. It is the second straight week that the bank has raised its C.D. yields so aggressively.
Outside the New York market, yields at 20 large banks surveyed were also mixed, with the average money market account off 3 basis points, to 2.69 percent, and a six-month C.D. up a basis point, to 2.87 percent.
 
Bank Money Accounts
 Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday, Oct. 21, 1992. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yields are based on the method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimums vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

HEADLINE: Manager of Indian Tribe's Casino Quits

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., Oct. 20

 BODY:
The chief executive of Connecticut's only casino, opened earlier this year by an Indian tribe, has resigned, citing philosophical differences with the tribe's leadership.
No specifics were available from a spokesman for the tribe, the Mashantucket Pequots, or the executive, Alfred J. Luciani. 
 His departure comes on the heels of an unusual proposal he made last week to state lawmakers, who are considering proposals for casinos in Bridgeport and Hartford. If the state would block such projects, Mr. Luciani told a legislative hearing, the tribe might be willing to share some of its profits with the state, which at present receives no income from the operations of the Foxwoods High Stakes Bingo & Casino in Ledyard under the terms of a compact with the tribe.
 
New Opportunities Cited
 A tribal spokesman, Bruce Macdonald, denied any link betwen Mr. Luciani's remarks and his resignation. "It's strictly a coincidence," he said today. "I know the timing suggests otherwise." Mr. Luciani has agreed to stay on until a successor can be named, Mr. Macdonald said, adding, "He wants to go on to new management opportunities."
Mr. Luciani was hired by the 250-member tribe last year to oversee development of the casino on tribal property in eastern Connecticut.
A former New Jersey prosecutor, he left law enforcement for the gambling industry and worked for the Golden Nugget and other casinos in Atlantic City. At Foxwoods, he installed a management team largely from Atlantic City, as well.
In an interview in December, Mr. Luciani remarked on the differences between his management philosophy and that of the Mashantucket Pequots. "I think in terms of quarterly profits and annual results," he said, "and they really think in terms of the millennium."
The casino has been very successful since it opened in February, attracting an average of 10,000 people a day to its 24-hour operation, which features poker, craps, blackjack and other games in a "natural" setting of bubbling brook-like fountains and a tree-filled atrium.
 
$100 Million Expected
 The casino, which won the right to open only after a long legal battle that was decided by the United States Supreme Court, projects gross revenue of at least $100 million by its first anniversary. Construction has already begun on a $142 million expansion, including a hotel, parking garage, additional gaming parlors, a theater and a shopping concourse.
Mr. Luciani, who announced his resignation on Saturday, could not be reached for comment today. An assistant in his office said he would be out of town for several days.
His proposal to the state, however, presents an intriguing problem for Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., who opposes casinos. It would enable the governor to block the development of additional casinos, while obtaining much-needed revenue for the state. His spokeswoman, Avice Meehan, said he would have no comment on the proposal, adding, "He has much more ambitious goals for the people of this state, in terms of long-term economic development."
 
Separate-Nation Status
 William DiBella, a State Senator from Hartford who supports building new casinos in Connecticut, said he thought Mr. Luciani's proposal would be difficult to apply because of the tribe's separate-nation status. '
'They cannot be taxed under that status," Mr. DiBella said.
He also said that he considered casinos not only sources of revenue for cities like Hartford, but also "an economic development tool and catalyst."
The tribe has agreed to reimburse the state for the cost of regulatory services like conducting security checks on casino employees. In the current fiscal year, the state expects to receive $2.58 million in such payments, Ms. Meehan said.

HEADLINE: Dow Off 2.43 at Close of Seesaw Session

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average ended slightly lower yesterday in a busy, seesaw session that reflected worries about rising interest rates.
But the broader market was higher, largely on favorable third-quarter earnings reports. On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by about 5 to 4. 
 The Dow index of 30 big-company stocks fell 2.43, to 3,186.02. The decline was attributed largely to Merck, which sank after a medical journal editorial played down prospects for its new prostate drug.
Volume on the Big Board totaled 258.2 million shares, compared with 222.2 million in the previous session.
Broader indicators were higher. The New York Stock Exchange's composite index gained 0.34, to 228.58, while the Nasdaq over-the-counter market's composite index rose 2.03, to 592.70. At the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index rose 2.86, to 371.40.
"The overall market is giving a better performance than the Dow," said Tom Gallagher, head stock trader at Oppenheimer & Company.
But uneasiness about rising interest rates restrained stocks. Higher rates attract investors away from stocks and into the bond market.
Bond prices have been lower in recent days, sending interest rates higher, on the belief that the election of Gov. Bill Clinton as President would eventually result in higher public spending, which economists fear could increase inflation and the deficit. Mr. Clinton has also said he intends to reduce the deficit if elected.
The Government's 30-year bond sank more than $8 per $1,000 in face amount, lifting its yield above 7.60 percent for the first time since July.
"They're selling off because the bonds are getting hit so hard," said Dudley Eppel, a senior vice president at the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation.
The Dow rose as much as 25 points in early trading before falling. The early gains came after the Commerce Department said housing starts rose 1.4 percent in September to their highest level in six months. It was the second straight monthly advance. The news was viewed as a sign the economy may be showing signs of growth. Analysts had expected a slight decline after an August increase of 12.6 percent.
Traders also appeared buoyed by a round of strong corporate earnings, a European newspaper report that Germany planned to lower some interest rates and gains in overseas stock markets.
Among active issues, Chrysler rose 5/8, to 25 1/2. The nation's No. 3 auto maker said it made $202 million in the third quarter, higher than analysts' estimates. Ford gained 1 1/8, to 38 1/8 and General Motors rose 3/4, to 29 7/8.
I.B.M., which has been battered in recent days, fell another 1/4, to 68 1/4.
Merck dropped 2 1/4, to 42. An editorial in The New England Journal of Medicine played down the potential of the company's new prostate drug, Proscar, for which analysts have predicted multimillion-dollar sales.
Compaq fell 1 1/8, to 39 5/8, after reaching a high for the year of 42 3/8. The computer company said it had earned $49 million in the third quarter, in contrast to a $70 million loss a year ago.
Citicorp closed up 1/4, at 15 1/8, as third-quarter earnings were higher than the company had predicted.
On the Nasdaq market, Amgen rose 2 3/8, to 66 1/8, after reporting that its third-quarter profits had increased nearly 70 percent.

Presidential Debate Raises Students' Self-Esteem at Michigan State

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST LANSING, Mich., Oct.20

 BODY:
Students at Michigan State University live under a constant blue-and-maize shadow cast by their neighbors at the University of Michigan, often finding themselves obliged to explain that they attend that other
school in Michigan.
But the national spotlight fell, if only briefly, here on Monday when the Presidential race came storming into town. The campaigns, the Secret Service and hundreds of reporters all arrived to find a campus thrilled to be on the nation's mind for something other than the football team. 
 More than 1,000 student volunteers worked as ushers, drivers and escorts for the candidates' entourages and for several news organizations. Many others threw themselves into discussions, held parties, conducted surveys and got involved in other activities on campus related to the debate. Everywhere students cheered -- or booed -- the candidates. Others protested everything from United States policies toward Bosnia to abortion.
"To have a media event like this brings out the relevant issues to students," said Samir Singh, a senior from Livonia, Mich., who spent debate night organizing and distributing information on his group, Into the Streets, a community-service program.
Calling the debate a great success for Michigan State, Bradford L. Thaler, an international relations sophomore from Saginaw, Mich., said: "It drew a lot of positive attention to the campus. I woke up this morning and M.S.U. was still in the news."
When the debate was finally certain, the 41,000 students breathed a communal sigh of relief. For two months they were on a roller coaster of doubt, with the low point the cancellation of the initial debate schedule.
The ride officially began Aug. 14. The Commission on Presidential Debates named the university as one of three sites for the forums. The date was set for Sept. 22, at the university's Wharton Center for the Performing Arts.
But the first debate was quickly in doubt when President Bush declined to accept the terms of the commission and Gov. Bill Clinton refused to negotiate them. To add insult to injury, the university was told it would receive only 25 student tickets -- approximately one ticket for every 1,600 students on campus.
On Sept. 16, the ticket issue disappeared with the debate, which was officially canceled.
The consolation prize turned out to be Mr. Clinton, who vowed to be in East Lansing on Sept. 22 anyway. Mr. Clinton jogged through the area where thousands of students live off campus, shook hands and made a speech that many students viewed as one of the most lackluster of the campaign. For many on campus, the reaction was, "That's it?"
Behind the scenes, though, the university kept bargaining with the commission. On Oct. 2, the commission announced its new plan, and once again Michigan State made the cut, along with Washington University in St. Louis and the University of Richmond.
Disappointed once, the students felt apprehensive as well as excited this time. And the cost of the debate arose as an issue for many students, who had not long ago been handed a 12 percent tuition increase for the current school year. The university spent about $100,000 on the debate -- mostly for turning an athletic center into a giant press room. Although university officials said they hoped to recoup the costs through donations, less than half the figure has been made up, university officials said.
"The money's going to come back into the economy from all the visitors and participants," said Deirdre Brown, a junior in a pre-law program and the M.S.U. representative on the Michigan Collegiate Coalition, a statewide lobbying group. "Plus you can't beat the publicity it's bringing the school."
Tickets were again an issue, but the second round resulted in a minor victory. Slightly more than 200 tickets were set aside for students, after the university's interim president, Gordon Guyer, asked the commission for more student seats.
Ms. Brown said Mr. Guyer "really went to bat for the students," a risky maneuver when the commission could easily have found another location for the debates. Mr. Guyer said the debates were part of the students' educations.
"The students have gotten what's important in any good education -- good out-of-classroom experience," Mr. Guyer said. "That's exactly why we went to the mats for those young people. Through it all, we brought a historic event to Michigan State."

HEADLINE: Frank Curran, 79, A San Diego Mayor

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Oct. 20

 BODY:
Frank Curran, a former Mayor of San Diego who was voted out of office after being acquitted in a bribery scandal, died Sunday. He was 79 years old.
His death, which was reported today by a Mercy Hospital spokesman, came almost three months after he underwent surgery for a broken vertebra suffered in a fall. 
 Francis Earl Curran was mayor from 1963 to 1971. A longtime Democrat who got much of his support from Republican businessmen, he campaigned to fashion San Diego into a gateway city for trade from Latin America and the Pacific Rim.
He also promoted the idea of forming an economic development corporation to attract new industries to San Diego, an idea that is a legacy of his administration.
On Oct. 8, 1970, Mr. Curran was indicted and arrested on bribery and conspiracy charges in what became known as the Yellow Cab scandal.
Mr. Curran was found not guilty of all charges by a Superior Court jury on Jan. 6, 1971.

HEADLINE: Rate of Home Building Up 1.4% in September

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 20

 BODY:
Builders broke ground for new houses and apartments at an annual rate of 1,256,000 units in September, 1.4 percent faster than in the preceding month and the best performance since March, the Commerce Department reported today.
The rise, which was in the upper range of expectations, followed a 12.6 percent jump in August and was seen, as expected by the Bush Administration, and by some private analysts as well, as a sign of pickup for an economy managing only feeble growth. But others, including the chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, were less sanguine. 
 According to John M. Albertine, who heads a Washington forecasting firm, the figures on September starts, combined with a 3.7 percent rise in permits to build, represent "the first signal we've gotten in a long time that the beleagurered economy might poke its nose out of its recessionary hole." And Commerce Secretary Barbara Hackman Franklin said that starts in the third quarter had risen at a "solid" 4.8 percent pace.
 
Data Called Inconsistent
 But the housing trade group's economist, David F. Seiders, said that the figures did not square with other recent data on consumer home-buying intentions and construction spending and that a rise in interest rates since Labor Day already threatened the modest gains in housing.
He pointed to the rate of 8.57 percent quoted today for 30-year mortgages, up from 8.09 percent at the end of September and from a low of 7.91 percent on Sept. 9.
The report showed a wide disparity in September starts, , with the Northeast posting a 24.6 percent advance, to a 142,000-unit annual pace, the largest since January 1991, and the South a 7.1 percent rise, to 540,000.
But starts slumped 7.8 percent in the Midwest and 7.3 percent in the West, to rates of 284,000 and 290,000 units, respectively.
 
First Quarter Was Better
 Joan D. Schneider, senior domestic economist for Continental Bank, Chicago, noted that while third-quarter starts were better than those of the second quarter, they trailed those in the first three months of the year.
"We've seen most of the cyclical rebound that we're going to see," she predicted, noting among other things demographic trends that point to sluggish household formation and, thus, relatively weak housing demand.
She and other analysts, however, cheered what now appears could be the end of a long downward trend in construction of new multifamily dwellings.
In September, dwellings in buildings with five or more units were begun at a 154,000-unit pace after 150,000 in August. The average for June and July was 113,500.
 
One-Family Homes Up 1.2%
 For one-family homes, the September rate was 1,071,000, 1.2 percent above August's 1,058,000, the report showed.
The actual number of starts last month, without seasonal adjustment, was 110,000, down 500 from August.
The 3.7 percent rise in permits reflected gains in all four regions but those in the Northeast and West were less than 2 percent each while those in the Midwest and South were 6.1 percent and 4 percent, respectively.
Mr. Seiders said that permits were a poor predictor of future housing activity But that because permit data contained less statistical "noise," they might be a better gauge of current housing conditions.
In a lackluster market, many builders put up individual houses rather than speculative developments requiring many permits.
Hurrican Andrew, the Government said, had had "virtually no effect" on the September housing estimates despite an expanded definition of starts to include cases in which existing foundations are used.

HEADLINE: Perot in Debate: Too Hard on Airlines and Banks?

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Ross Perot, Presidential candidate, asserted in the Monday debate that the United States might, in effect, be dismantling its airline industry and raised the question of whether commercial banks are in worse shape than people generally realized.
The current situations in each industry suggests that though there are indeed problems, Mr. Perot has oversimplified the difficulties of the airlines and probably overstated current concern about the banks. 
 He is, however, certainly not alone in expressing the view that recent agreements by the airlines to form closer ties with foreign carriers may be "destructive," as he put it, to the airline industry.
But the validity of that concern depends on which airline you ask.
 
 
Foreign Links
 Northwest is seeking to strengthen its ties with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, and USAir wishes to do the same with British Airways. The two American companies contend that they need the ties to keep up in the competitive race with their bigger rivals -- American, United and Delta.
The big three, meanwhile, are cooperating in an intense effort to have the Department of Transportation turn down the two ventures unless American, United and Delta can get access to the fly to British cities and beyond to a similar degree that KLM and British Airways will have to the United States. They want Andrew Card, the Secretary of Transportation, to link the approval of the USAir and British Airways proposal to a willingness by the British Government to reopen its bilateral aviation agreement. Mr. Card, who left for London yesterday to try to get bilateral talks moving, said that there was a wide gulf between the two sides but that he would leave "no stone unturned" to get a more liberal agreement.
All major American carriers in recent years have sought to build large international route systems -- some by buying routes from failed carriers such as Pan American World Airways or struggling Trans World Airlines. Northwest and USAir have taken a different strategy. They see combinations with foreign airlines as a way to build global networks less expensively while also getting an infusion of money. USAir would get an injection of $750 million from British Airways, in addition to a new connection to a vast network of international air routes.
If the Department of Transportation approves the USAir deal without the liberalized bilateral agreement, there could well be a gradual erosion of traffic for the remaining large carriers. American, Delta, United and Federal Express have estimated that it could cost American carriers a minimum of $500 million a year in lost revenue and the loss of thousands of jobs. The four carriers employ about 350,000. USAir and Northwest employ about 94,000 workers.
If Mr. Card does get a liberalized agreement, the American industry will probably emerge strong. If not, and the USAir-British Airways deal is approved, there could, indeed, be serious damage.
Mr. Perot's questioning of the state of the commercial banking industry reflects suspicions many have expressed in recent months that a banking crisis is on the horizon but has been concealed until after the election. The idea has not gained credibility among those in the best position to known: bankers, analysts, investors or regulators.
On the other hand, the best case for such suspicions might be the undeniable fact that Federal and state regulators -- and Congress and others who should have known -- underestimated and, in fact, denied the problems of the savings-and-loan industry until after the 1988 elections.
 
Closer to the Mark
 Gov. Bill Clinton and President Bush both agreed that there are some weak banks, but said no banking crisis was looming. They seemed closer to the mark.
Unlike the savings-and-loan industry, which was insolvent in 1988, the banking industry has $250 billion of equity capital to absorb unexpected losses, plus $55 billion of reserves to absorb losses on loans already identified as troubled.
In addition, the commercial banks have regulators who have in the past few years forced the industry to recognize its problems by writing off bad loans and cutting dividends. Savings and loans, in contrast, had regulators in 1988 who overlooked weaknesses because they did not have to money to close the insolvent institutions.
Rather than continuing to weaken, as was the case with savings and loans, the banking industry appears to be growing stronger. Profits the first half of this year were a record $15.7 billion, and have remained at record levels this quarter. Moreover, banks are reporting modest declines in badly delinquent loans, which hurt them in 1990 and 1991.
The reports filed by banks do not indicate any significant retreat by bank examiners in their criticism of bad loans. To bankers' dismay, examiners continue to give very low grades to loans that are paying interest on schedule, but which the examiners say will never be paid in full.
Mr. Perot stopped short of predicting a crisis, but said he is concerned by a recent study reported on by The Washington Post. That study, however, makes several errors in calculating potential bank losses. It says real estate owned by banks, for example, is worth only 20 percent of the amount shown on their books, whereas many banks have been selling such real estate for prices about equal to book value.
George Salem, a banking analyst at Prudential Securities who accurately warned in 1990 and 1991 that banks' problems with commercial real estate loans would be very serious and costly, today says that the industry has turned the corner, and no crisis is looming. The level of badly delinquent loans remains high, and will cut into bank profits for several more years. But in most parts of the country, except for California, he says those problems are gradually declining.
 
Far From a Crisis
 A change in Federal law on Dec. 19 that requires closing banks that are not insolvent, but are very weak, will clearly cause a some additional closings. But the number and size of those banks are small compared with the bank failures of recent years and a far cry from a crisis.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation says that only 80 banks with about $30 billion of assets may be subject to early closing because of their financial problems. Assuming that the F.D.I.C.'s losses from those banks are heavier than normal at 20 percent of the banks' assets rather than the 17 percent historical average, the losses to the insurance fund of $6 billion would be easily covered by the reserves the F.D.I.C. established early this year.
But when the flurry of failures in the few months after Dec. 19 comes, analysts confidently predict that the closings will not be a shock to the economy or financial markets. The largest bank likely to be affected, First City National in Houston, has been in a well-publicized struggle to find a buyer or new investors for over a year, so its closing will hardly count as a surprise. With $8.8 billion to $9 billion of assets, First City is not among the nation's top 50 banking companies, and it is of a size that can be readily absorbed by another banking company.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Low U.S. Bond Prices Raise New York City's Cost of Debt

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Prices went from bad to worse in the Treasury market yesterday, but a important bond sale did not go badly for New York City.
On a day when the municipal bond market was driven lower once again by the sharp fall in the Treasury market, the city still managed to pull off an $844 million sale of bonds at the second-lowest cost for the Big Apple in 20 years. 
 Yet, the city might have done even better if it had not been for the spectacular fall in the credit markets in the last two weeks. So even with the city's success, there has been a real cost to the local taxpayer that can be attributed to a recent wave of selling in the credit markets. That selloff is seen as a response to the prospect that Gov. Bill Clinton will win the Presidential election.
Treasury prices fell so sharply yesterday -- the 30-year bond was off three-quarters of a point and the 10-year note a point and a quarter -- that the underwriters for the city had to reprice the issue to raise interest rates to a level that would make them more attractive to investors. Late in the day, Lehman Brothers raised the interest rate offered on most of the issue by 5 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point.
City officials would not discuss the exact cost of that repricing. But with approximately $500 million of bonds covered by the repricing, the annual cost is around $250,000 in extra interest.
The extra cost seems even higher if compared with the yields available in the municipal market as recently as last Thursday. Since then, the yield on the actively traded Florida Board of Education bonds due in 2025, for example, has jumped 11 basis points to 6.44 percent.
"It was a substantial issue in a tough market," said Stan Ciemniecki, managing director at Lehman Brothers said of the New York bond offering. "We did not expect the market to behave as poorly as it did today."
Darcy Bradbury, the deputy city comptroller, and Mark Page, the deputy director of the city's Office of Management and Budget, focused instead on the overall interest rate for the entire package, which was 6.8 percent, just above the 20-year low of 6.6 percent for the bond sale in August and still well below the 7 percent of last May.
"We're thrilled," said Ms. Bradbury. "This is not bad in this market that is a little unsettled by the election."
 
'The Market Is Paranoid'
 Traders and dealers would say that Ms. Bradbury was a master of understatement. The Treasury, municipal and corporate markets have been rocked by the prospect of a Clinton victory and the fear that as President he would propose an economic stimulus program that might raise the deficit and lead to a rise in inflation.
"This will continue for a while," said Sung Won Sohn, the chief economist at Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis. "The market is paranoid about a Clinton stimulus program."
Jay Goldinger, a bond trader at Capital Insight in Los Angeles, added: "The market has gone straight south, and the compass seems to be broken. We are not doing anything before the election."
But there is some good news, he suggested. "There will be a relief rally after the election," Mr. Goldinger said, "and the farther we go down the more we can come back."
 
30-Year Bond: 7.64%
 While the election factor has tended to hurt longer-term securities, shorter-term notes and Treasury bills have been undermined by the conclusion of many traders that the Federal Reserve might not reduce interest rates any more because of the possibility of the big Government spending package to stimulate the economy.
In trading in the secondary market, the price of the 30-year bond fell 26/32 , to 9512/32 , to yield 7.64 percent, up from 7.56 percent Monday. This is the highest yield since mid-July and well over the six-year low of 7.21 percent touched in September.
Notes and Treasury bills were also off sharply. The price of the 10-year note plunged one point and 11/32 , while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, jumped to 6.87 percent. That is up from 6.68 percent yesterday and 6.23 percent at the beginning of the month.
 
Yields Seen as Attractive
 Mr. Goldinger said that he was having a hard time believing that yields had jumped so much, but he said they were making the bond market very attractive. If yields on the two-year note, which jumped 21 basis points to 4.32 percent yesterday, stay at these levels he said he would "drive my truck up to the window" at the two-year Treasury auction next week and buy.
Yet, he acknowledged that the market is so skittish now that many investors are going to wait to see just how much farther prices can fall and yields can rise before they decide to become buyers again.
Both the municipal and corporate markets were also off yesterday and have fallen fast in the last several days. Traders said that the price of active issues in the municipal market dropped about three-quarters of a point.
Another sign of the weakness in the municipal market is that there were $148 million of California general-obligation bonds left unsold Monday when the syndicate, led by Merrill Lynch, that underwrote the $1.3 billion sale last week, broke up.

HEADLINE: Gasoline Mileage and Jobs

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
President Bush is seizing on the issue of gasoline mileage rules in his re-election campaign, running radio ads in Michigan and Ohio that predict huge job losses at local auto factories if a Democratic administration tightens the standards. And some industry groups agree with him.
But efficiency advocates say that raising the standard, now at 27.5 miles a gallon, would actually create jobs in the auto industry and elsewhere in the economy, and Gov. Bill Clinton says he does not favor a law that would raise the standard above what the industry can achieve. 
 The two clashed on fuel economy in the debate on Monday evening, one of the few times they have mentioned energy issues.
The Bush radio ads say that Governor Clinton's "radical environmental proposals require increasing car mileage standards to 40 miles per gallon in 8 years."
 
Dropped by Congress
 Earlier this year, when Congress considered new energy legislation, it debated raising the current auto mileage standard, which was set in 1975. But in a political package deal, it dropped that idea, along with a proposal to let oil companies drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
The Motor Vehicle Manufacturer's Association asserts that the domestic industry would lose 150,000 to 300,000 jobs if the United States moved to a standard of 40 miles a gallon. But proponents of stricter standards said that the manufacturers had simply counted the jobs in factories that today produce cars that would not meet the new standard, and that the proposal gave the companies time to adjust.
The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, a Washington-based study and lobbying group, recently predicted that stricter mileage rules would generate jobs by giving consumers extra money that would otherwise have been spent on fuel, and would even increase employment in the auto business.
"The industry will retool and add energy-efficiency features to vehicles, and thereby add value to their vehicles, which means more engineers, more assemblers, more parts suppliers, and more revenue and economic activity for auto producers," said Howard Geller, the executive director.
Mileage gives small price incentive; the American Automobile Association's "average" car costs $5,865 a year to run, and raising its fuel economy by 40 percent would save less than $250, or about 4 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Advances as Traders Note Clinton Spending Plan

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday against most foreign currencies amid continued expectations that if Gov. Bill Clinton is elected President, his administration would increase spending to stimulate the economy.
Gold prices also rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $343.80 an ounce, up $1.10 from Monday. Republic National Bank said gold added $1.20 an ounce to reach a late bid price of $343.60. 
 Mr. Clinton has promised to increase Government spending, and various markets have been reacting in recent days. Bond prices fell again Tuesday, which means interest rates go up and the dollar becomes more attractive.
"Pre-election markets seem to be dragging U.S. interest rates higher, which is benefiting the dollar across the board," said Ronald Holzer, chief dealer at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
Randolph Donney, director of research at Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J., agreed. "Even though monetary policy as directed by the central banks may be changing at a glacial pace, the markets themselves are anticipating events and creating higher interest rates in the U.S. and lower interest rates in Germany," Mr. Donney said. "This is causing the interest rate differential to narrow."
In New York, the dollar settled at 122.5 yen, up from 120.45 yen late Monday. Overnight in Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing of 121 yen, up from 120.05 yen at Monday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 121.92 yen.
In New York, a British pound cost $1.6245, up from $1.6225 late Monday. In London, the pound fell to $1.6225 from $1.6330 late Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.516 marks, up from 1.499; 1.356 Swiss francs, up from 1.3395; 5.1435 French francs, up from 5.0865; 1,333.5 Italian lire, up from 1,316.5, and 1.23975 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2456.
Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday: 1.5205 marks, up from 1.4835; 1.3605 Swiss francs, up from 1.3215; 5.155 French francs, up from 5.026; 1.711 Dutch guilders, up from 1.67; 1,336 Italian lire, up from 1,300.5; 1.2378 Canadian dollars, down from 1.247.
Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $343.85 an ounce, up from $342.85 late Monday. In Zurich, gold was up to a closing bid of $343.40, from $342.65 late Monday. Earlier, gold was unchanged in Hong Kong at $342.60.

HEADLINE: WORLD SERIES;
When Ailing Pastime Meets TV Recession, Baseball Gets the K

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
Even as CBS's broadcasts of the World Series provide a compelling video window on the best that major league baseball has to offer, executives of the sport are preparing to negotiate new television contracts that are expected to end the prosperity previously wrought by TV.
Next season will be the fourth and final year of the bonanza that will bring clubs $1.45 billion from CBS and ESPN -- double the amount produced by the previous six-year deal. But baseball says it has no way to prevent television from drastically reducing its financial commitment to the sport. 
 "Our only leverage is we have the national pastime," said Eddie Einhorn, co-owner of the Chicago White Sox and a member of baseball's television negotiating committee. "Maybe it doesn't have the same value as before, but we're not going begging."
 
Single-Network Error
 Although serious negotiations probably will not begin until early next year, club owners and network officials are about to start informal talks. Baseball would again prefer to be on two networks, having found that being on just one was a long-term error.
Baseball has benefited in the short term from TV, but TV has suffered by gambling on baseball. CBS's estimated pre-tax losses from baseball are believed to be $500 million over the life of the contract, or nearly half of its $1.06 billion investment. ESPN, the cable network, is expected to lose nearly half the value of its $390 million contract.
"It would be great to justify the money we're getting, but it's real hard knowing the losses," said Einhorn.
Among the ideas being discussed inside baseball to enhance the value of a new contract with the broadcast networks and cable are interleague play; reducing the regular season by one week, and breaking up the league's two divisions into three conferences. This would create a round of wild-card playoffs, similar to those in the National Football League.
 
Three Major Headaches
 But these possibilities would create problems:
*Any made-for-TV enhancements would require the approval of the players' union at a time of labor-management tension when a spring 1993 lockout is possible. A work stoppage would play havoc with any TV talks and would quite likely reduce the value of a future deal.
*An additional playoff series would create more advertising time to sell, a daunting prospect for any network. But the idea is fancied by Bill Giles, the owner of the Philadelphia Phillies and a member of the TV committee. "This September tells me we need to create more interest in more cities," Giles said, referring to the lack of stirring pennant races.
*Shortening the season would reduce both gate and local TV revenues, which would have to be more than offset by more national TV income. Einhorn knows that local baseball telecasts now provide a more stable stream of cash and are more avidly watched than network broadcasts.
 
Decline in Ratings
 CBS, the incumbent broadcast network, and NBC and ABC, the previous rights-holders, are well aware of the financial losses on baseball since 1990. They know they can live without the game if the price is wrong.
Baseball has been devalued as a broadcast commodity because the sport has declined in national popularity. Regular-season Nielsen ratings have gone down from a 5.1 in 1989 on NBC to a 3.4 this year on CBS. ESPN's ratings have fallen from a 2.1 in 1990 to a 1.5 this season. Each rating point equals 921,000 television homes for the over-the-air networks and 614,000 homes for ESPN.
The roots of baseball's current problems can be traced in part to the current deal.
The sport unleashed a cable-TV schedule of 175 games on ESPN, allowed games on regional channels to compete on Saturday afternoons with CBS games and gave teams no control over the hundreds of games entering their markets via superstations like WTBS and WGN. Under these circumstances, no national TV game could be trumpeted as a special attraction.
 
Graying of Audience
 In addition, baseball's viewership has aged. The fan watching is not as young as the one watching N.F.L. and National Basketball Assocation games. Since 1989, viewership among young men aged 12-17 fell 24 percent while the N.B.A. was up 31 percent and the N.F.L. was up 16 percent in that category.
The changing demographics and the recession have made advertisers jittery about baseball, except during the World Series.
"The advertiser is saying, 'I can put money in the N.F.L., in the Skins Game or in the hot-rodders,' " said Jon Mandel, a senior vice president of Grey Advertising, which buys time for several baseball advertisers.
Of most immediate concern to baseball is what will happen with ESPN, which has until Oct. 31 to exercise its contract option. It can choose a fifth and sixth year, at $120 million and $130 million annually, or it can pay baseball $13 million to escape those two years and negotiate anew. Einhorn isn't optimistic. "The package we sold ESPN isn't worth what it was," he said.
 
ESPN to Cut Back?
 ESPN, which is expected to be the only cable bidder, is said to have recently offered a cutback from six weekly games to four and an annual payment of $50 million to $60 million, according to TV and baseball sources.
There is, said Einhorn and Giles, no rush to wrap up a deal with the networks.
Network officials indicate that no matter what baseball does, the sport is in for a financial fall. Unless they can see a guaranteed profit, they can walk away, a scenario almost unimaginable in the N.F.L. One network official said, "If they can get 70 percent of what they're getting now, they ought to be sent straight to Cooperstown."
The possibility of a return to a game-of-the-week format -- there were only 16 Saturday telecasts this season -- is much discussed, but it does not seem realistic. Only 6 percent of CBS's estimated $290 million payment to baseball this year goes toward the regular season, while 58 percent goes to the World Series, 30 percent to the league championship series and another 6 percent to the All-Star Game.
"A weekly game is political," said Einhorn, who explained that the only reason to resurrect it would be to accommodate the nearly 40 percent of the country that cannot or does not receive cable.
One way of resuscitating a weekly game would be to return to splitting baseball between two networks. If baseball is to develop any negotiating leverage, it might well play the networks against one another.
But the factors that induced CBS to outbid NBC by $380 million to get the current deal are not at play anymore. CBS's losses mean that no network will enter the talks wishing to merely break even. Or, as CBS envisioned, to use baseball as a loss-leader platform, enabling it to gain exposure for prime-time programs in October.
"I would have preferred two networks last time," said Einhorn. "That would mean two networks who cared about baseball. Now NBC and ABC don't care like they did when they had it. It was there to be done last time."

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
The Politicizing of TV's Prime-Time Comedy

BYLINE: By JOHN J. O'CONNOR

 BODY:
Nan Buffum (Mary Gordon Murray) is executive deputy director of the Bush-Quayle campaign. Her husband Whit (Gerrit Graham) works in a similar capacity for Clinton-Gore. Caught up in a personal swirl of political sniping and dirty tricks, they both want out of a marriage made in hell. Finally going before a judge, she snaps, "I'm the Republican, your honor. He's the ass."
On ABC at 10, tonight's episode of "Civil Wars," titled "Below the Beltway," reflects a marked acceleration over the past year or so in television entertainment's willingness -- and technical ability -- to tackle political subjects. In many instances, a pro forma bow is made in the direction of even-handedness, but the dominant tone comes unmistakably from the left. The subject of Hollywood's liberal bias may be hoary, but as Dan Quayle has discovered, it is hardly dismissible. In any event, as prime time gives "reality" further twists, the phenomenon goes well beyond the straightforward political satire found on NBC's "Saturday Night Live" or Fox's "In Living Color" and "Edge." 
 One of the unusual aspects of this episode of "Civil Wars" is that party affiliation is specified. Clearly, the producers are speculating waspishly on what could happen if the current romance between two real campaign aides, Bush-Quayle's Mary Matalan and Clinton-Gore's James Carville, evolves into marriage.
For the most part, prime time prefers to avoid labels and stick to generalities. But these days there's no mistaking the underlying message: time for a change. ABC's "Roseanne," the nation's most popular show, struggles from week to week with the recession. And several series have incorporated the Los Angeles riots in their plot lines as a way to comment on current anxieties.
Tomorrow at 10 P.M., "L.A. Law" returns on NBC with an episode called "L.A. Lawless." When the not-guilty verdicts in the Rodney King case are announced, Jonathan Rollins (Blair Underwood), a black lawyer, has to re-examine why he is running as a candidate for City Council from South-Central, scene of the worst rioting. He doesn't even live in the neighborhood. His boss, Leland McKenzie (Richard Dysart), recalls how when he was an assistant district attorney 20 years earlier during the Watts riots, he witnessed racism at first hand. He thought he'd make a difference. "When will we learn?" he asks sadly.
"A Different World," on NBC, continues efforts to spike its broad antics with serious issues. Two recent episodes found the honeymooning Whitley (Jasmine Guy) and Dwayne (Kadeem Hardison) trapped in the Los Angeles riots. Certain that this wasn't Selma, Ala., in 1965 and that "I don't spend my life under a gloomy cloud of oppression," a chastened Whitley later finds herself telling a television reporter that "I was living under the delusion that things were getting better for black people in this country." Another character on the show announces that she is going to law school "to study this system so that I can change it."
Of course the award for this year's most celebrated reality-fiction mix goes to CBS's "Murphy Brown," which turned a broadside from Vice President Quayle into blockbuster ratings for the start of its new season. That confrontation over family values has lasted for months.
One of the more important developments in television entertainment's co-opting, or exploiting, of reality is how fast producers are able to get topical material on the air.
Last year, after the Senate's Clarence Thomas-Anita F. Hill debacle, CBS's "Designing Women" rushed into production and broadcast a special episode that used actual television tapes of the hearings to trigger a debate among the regular characters on the series. One or two remarks were made in defense of Judge Thomas, but there could be no doubt that Linda Bloodworth-Thomason's script furiously supported Professor Hill.
In another instance, when President Bush said that as far as families were concerned, he preferred "The Waltons" to "The Simpsons," it was only a matter of a week -- thanks to a quick edit on the audio track -- before bratty Bart was noticing how the Waltons and the Simpsons were indeed quite similar -- both were living through a depression.
A record was surely set by Fox's "Roc" a couple of Sundays ago, only one hour after the first Presidential debate. Now broadcast live each week, the show was able to open with the irascible father, played by Carl Gordon, watching the part of the debate in which a defensive President Bush, now supplemented with a convulsive laugh track, was insisting that "there's good news out there," asserting that there was a drop in drug use. The puzzled old man looked directly into the camera and said, "I don't know whether to vote for Manny, Moe or Jack."
Being outspoken about politics and politicians is not entirely the order of the day. Oddly enough, "Hearts Afire," Ms. Bloodworth-Thomason's new hit on CBS (Mondays at 8:30 P.M.), is set in Washington and features politician characters but is more interested in a fairly standard affair between its two principal characters, a liberal woman (Markie Post) and a conservative man (John Ritter). In the HBO movie "Running Mates," starring Diane Keaton and Ed Harris, care was obviously taken to fudge the party affiliation of the Presidential candidate.
But, perhaps encouraged by the "Murphy Brown" incident, television is getting decidedly more frisky and alert in going for material that might once have been considered too sensitive or controversial. Coming up on Showtime on Nov. 1: "Mastergate," the Larry Gelbart play skewering the almost insane debasement of language in political discourse. This Sunday on NBC, the movie "In the Line of Duty: Street Wars" uses a violent portrait of New York City police pursuing drug pushers to explore a contemporary urban landscape of empty crack vials and bullet shells. The implied indictment of political leaders is unrelenting.
It's definitely getting tougher in prime time for anyone in public life. In this evening's "Civil Wars," Denise (Debi Mazar) the sassy secretary, listens to the Republican wife and Democratic husband savaging each other and concludes, "Personally, I think they're all con men; you know what I mean?"

HEADLINE: How to Keep Business in New York

 BODY:
Mayor David Dinkins deserves credit for encouraging the Morgan Stanley Group, one of the nation's leading financial services firms, to keep its corporate headquarters in New York City for at least the next decade. Had Morgan Stanley moved to a parcel it had optioned in Stamford, Conn., it might have led other large financial firms to consider leaving -- and thus jeopardized the city's status as the world's financial services center.
Mr. Dinkins and his Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, Barry Sullivan, hammered out a reasonable package of tax credits and other incentives, worth $39.6 million over 10 years, that helped persuade the company to stay. In return, Morgan Stanley will keep its headquarters, and as many as 4,100 employees, in the city. Since the company is expected to pay nearly $1 billion in taxes over the next 10 years, the tax incentives appear relatively modest. And Morgan Stanley has a symbolic value that makes keeping it worth special effort. 
 The Morgan Stanley deal is only the latest retention coup for the Dinkins administration. In August, Prudential Securities promised to keep its headquarters in lower Manhattan for 20 years in exchange for at least $106.2 million in tax incentives and energy savings. Also in August, four of New York's five commodities exchanges reached final agreement on a plan that prevented their moving to Jersey City. Last month, on the other hand, First Chicago Corporation announced it would leave Manhattan next year after city officials decided it wasn't worth matching the rich terms offered by Jersey City.
The danger in granting such incentives is that they can whet the appetites of other companies for similar favors. But the Dinkins administration appears to be following a judicious case-by-case approach that need not lead to large-scale giveaways.
In another reassuring sign, Mr. Dinkins has pledged to freeze the city's general corporate tax for four years. The Mayor's financial plan covering the next three years already assumes no rise in corporate taxes. Still, if financial monitors approve, Mr. Dinkins thus expresses and extends a welcome commitment to economic stability.

HEADLINE: Clinton Pledge vs. Clinton Plan

 BODY:
I will not raise taxes on the middle class to pay for my programs.
With that ringing assertion, Gov. Bill Clinton gave Monday's Presidential debate what may be its most memorable moment. Asked to cite a specific income level below which he would not reach for more taxes, he made a ringing no-tax pledge.  
 And not just once. Provoked by President Bush's repeated accusations that his plan was little more than tax-and-spend, the Governor repeated his pledge four times in two minutes. This was no mere slip of the tongue.
The pledge raises worrisome questions. Suppose Mr. Clinton is elected and, as experts expect, his budget estimates go awry. What would he do? His Monday answer invites people to think that he would suspend programs to invest in infrastructure, worker training and education rather than raise taxes, even slightly, on the middle class. That would cut out the soul of the growth agenda that makes Mr. Clinton's candidacy so promising.
The beauty of Mr. Clinton's plan is that it emphasizes putting government firmly behind both private and public investment, the key to promoting productivity. Productivity growth is the surest way to raise living standards.
An economic plan, even one as detailed as Mr. Clinton's, is more metaphor than blueprint. The numbers are not offered with accountant's precision; they are useful most of all as a guide to a candidate's priorities. Ross Perot promises to eliminate the deficit no matter what the cost. Mr. Bush promises to cut taxes no matter what the cost.
But Mr. Clinton has promised a middle ground: Cut the deficit, but only by half over four years. That would leave room to pay for desperately needed public investment and even provide a small tax cut for middle-class families. The question now is whether Mr. Clinton is more committed to holding the line on taxes or, far more important, holding the line for growth.
Mr. Clinton left himself wiggle room. He didn't define middle class. He didn't define "my programs." And he didn't define the emergencies that would allow him to back away from his no-tax stance. But voters are not likely to be reassured by a candidate inclined to find refuge in loopholes.
No one asks Mr. Clinton to make a suicidal pledge, like that made by Walter Mondale in 1984, to raise taxes. But for Mr. Clinton to rule out tax hikes except under dire circumstances is to risk diving into the same policy straitjacket that has paralyzed Mr. Bush. The Governor told viewers Monday night not to read his lips. "Read my plan," he said. Fine, if only he sticks with it.

Prevailing Winds

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN

 BODY:
The beginning of the end came at a moment of great triumph. The sound is what I remember best about the State of the Union Message George Bush delivered to Congress on Jan. 29, 1991, just two weeks after the gulf war began -- the sound not of his voice but of the huzzahs, the cheers, the roars that interrupted him time after time. No matter that the speech was long on the self-congratulation of a country engaged in foreign conflict and very short on a domestic program. The room was stuffed to bursting with approval, like helium, threatening to levitate the man.
Did he remember that night when he looked into the unforgiving eye of the camera Monday and pleaded with the American people to vote for him, a little plaintive, a little perplexed? 
 There is an omnipresent argument in civics: Is an elected official meant to follow his own principles or is he meant to be a surrogate, to stand in always for the desires of those he represents? In his public life George Bush has epitomized the latter, the man who puts a wet forefinger up to the prevailing winds. His repeated accusation in the final debate that Bill Clinton does not stand firm on principle is disingenuous. Unlike Mr. Clinton, George Bush has never been canny enough to cast his pragmatism as a signal virtue. But he has always been an adaptable man.
When the prevailing winds blew against Saddam Hussein in favor of an America puffed up by a battle against a detestable foe, the President was in luck. His approval ratings soared. He believed his press, and so did we. Over my desk hangs a column I wrote in March 1991 that contains the sentence "George Bush will be re-elected President in 1992." It is there to remind me of the dangers of hubris. Unlike Mr. Bush, I will not lose my job because of the miscalculation.
But what is a man to do when there are no prevailing winds? It would be a simpler matter if the voters could tell Mr. Bush what they require. But they don't know exactly, particularly within the complicated confines of economic policy. If only it could be like the Persian Gulf war: quick, decisive, sure-handed. It was easy for the President to pick out his friends and revile his enemies. It must be hard to realize now that the electorate can be both friend and foe.
Mr. Bush talked over and over again during the last debate about a Clinton pattern of constantly shifting positions. But the Clinton pattern that has loomed largest in this campaign is one of indefatigability. The women, the draft, the anti-war activities, the trip to Russia -- Bill Clinton has come to resemble one of those inflatable children's toys with sand weighting the bottom. You knock him over and he pops back up. It is a compelling image for voters battered by the economy and eager to get back on their feet. The attacks everyone thought would bring him down may just help elect the man in the long run.
The debates are done. There was a great irony to the idea that they were George Bush's best chance for salvation; he has never been a person who does well off the cuff. That was clear when he almost offhandedly evoked the "Are you better off than you were four years ago?" question. It is a question Mr. Bush should never, ever ask.
For me, the beginning of the end was that speech nearly two years ago, when the internal needs of the nation were drowned out by cheering for the Commander in Chief, drowned out for too long. And the end was in this final debate, a small moment really, when Mr. Bush referred to the state of Arkansas as the "lowest of the low." We all knew what he meant, that it is a poor state, a state with problems, a state whose Governor is not the political prestidigitator he claims. But that's not how it came out.
Paired with his heated defense of the "national honor" when Ross Perot asked some very pressing questions about the diplomacy preceding the gulf war, Mr. Bush's low blow made Arkansas seem disposable. The prevailing winds blow cold for a President who so clearly prefers statecraft to states. "Three weeks from now," the President began his closing statement, then looked skyward and began again, groping for how much time he had left. "Two weeks from tomorrow." November 3, Mr. President. That is the deadline for the invasion of Washington by opposition forces, if that makes it easier to remember.

HEADLINE: In Long Run, Family Leave Will Be a Bargain;
Women's Burden

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I read your Oct. 7 installment of "The Good Mother" series, on family leave, with anger. I am sick and tired of the problems we face as women.
Economically, politically and socially we mothers are damned if we do and damned if we don't hold jobs outside the home. When I was a young mother in the 1970's, many of us could still stay home with the kids -- one paycheck could maintain the basics. Less than 20 years later most mothers must work outside the home. Yet we are made to feel selfish and inadequate by politicians and so-called "men of God." 
 What is wrong with a society and an economic system that punishes women and their children by forcing mothers to go into the workplace, work a 40-hour week, come home and then with minimal male assistance, conduct the work required at home? What kind of a society are we that we require most women to return to work six weeks after the birth of a child? What kind of family values do we really hold as a society?
It now generally takes two incomes to support a family. Why can't we give more support to families? If we value women and children, then it's time to pay for day care, enact a family leave bill and create skilled jobs that pay well.
I am sure that there are many men who empathize with the plight of women, but you're not likely to find prominent national focus devoted to the agonizing of men, as they go to the workplace each day, over whether or not they are neglecting their children.

HEADLINE: As More Earn Equivalency Diploma, Its Value Is Debated

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 20

 BODY:
Jonathan Ledlow dropped out of Trenton High School a dozen years ago but promptly got his high school equivalent certificate so he could join the Navy, which was all that he desired at the time.
Now Mr. Ledlow is nearly 30 years old and subsists on $140 a month from the Mercer County welfare board. Along with his honorable discharge from the Navy, he is proud of having earned his equivalency degree, the result of passing a 7 1/2-hour comprehension test. It proves he was able to complete something in his life, he said, but he is not sure what good it is doing him now. 
 Given today's economy, Mr. Ledlow might be unemployed now even if he had completed high school. Still, a new study says, Mr. Ledlow and others who passed the General Education Development test are no better off than high school dropouts who did not take the test. And as his educational experience grows more common -- the G.E.D. in 1991 accounted for 14 percent of all high school graduates compared with five percent in 1968 -- more questions are being raised about the long-term value of the test.
The study, by a University of Chicago economics professor, shows scant difference between the incomes of G.E.D. holders and of high school dropouts with no certificates. And the Army, which pioneered the forerunner of the G.E.D. for World War II veterans 50 years ago, last year quietly stopped accepting the certificate holders into the service on the same basis as high school graduates. The reason: G.E.D. earners flunk basic training at twice the rate of high school graduates.
The test, designed to measure whether the test taker has the same level of comprehension as an average high school senior, requires no classroom work and can be taken without any preparation at all, although most people do study for it in some way. About 70 percent of those who take it pass it. This year, some 480,000 people will earn a G.E.D; about three million students will graduate from high school.
The G.E.D. Testing Service, which administers the G.E.D. nationwide, has been stunned by the sudden swell of bad news about a program that has long been regarded as a kind of saving second chance for millions of high school dropouts. The study on earnings, by James J. Heckman of the University of Chicago, is misleading, the service says.
 
A Lot Better Than Nothing
 Besides, the G.E.D.'s defenders note that they have never suggested that their certificate is as valuable as four years of high school, only that it is a lot better than nothing.
"I don't think the G.E.D. has ever been intended to be everything you get from four years of high school study," said Janet Baldwin, director of policy research for the G.E.D. Testing Service in Washington, which is part of the non-profit American Council on Education. "It has been intended to measure the equivalence of what you learn in high school."
Indeed, many G.E.D. holders use their certificate to become eligible for further education: community colleges and Federal and state job-training programs accept the certificate for admission. According to the Council, 25 percent of G.E.D. recipients complete a two-year college degree.
 
Necessary Social Fiction?
 Beyond that, the defense of the G.E.D. often includes a more subtle argument for accepting the notion of parity between the G.E.D. certificate and a high school diploma. G.E.D. holders are poorer than average, their parents are more likely to have been dropouts themselves and they are more likely to be members of minority groups. According to this argument, for the country to view the G.E.D. as equivalent to a high school diploma is a kind of necessary social fiction: not strictly true, but helpful to people whom life has dealt a hard hand to play, and who need some encouragement to press on.
"People who have not completed high school feel there is something important in their lives that they have not finished, there is a lack of closure," said Ms. Baldwin. "For a lot of them, getting that G.E.D. diploma gives them the feeling that they can go on.
"That is one of the reasons the Heckman report is so disheartening. It seems to blame people who have chosen to come back and get their diploma by another way."
Using figures from the Census Bureau's National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, Dr. Heckman compared the earnings of male G.E.D. holders at age 25 and at age 28 with those of other dropouts and those of high school graduates. While the G.E.D. holders earned somewhat more than other dropouts, Dr. Heckman ascribed the difference to G.E.D. holders' having, on average, attended one more year of high school than the other dropouts.
For 25-year-olds, Dr. Heckman found dropouts without the G.E.D. had average annual earnings of $10,379 per year in 1988 dollars. For G.E.D. holders of that age, the figure was $11,777, while high school graduates, to whom the G.E.D. holders are expected to be equivalent, earned $15,213.
At age 28, the gap between G.E.D. holders and high school graduates had widened, according to the study. Dropouts made $12,411, G.E.D. holders made $13,921, and high school graduates $20,195.
"The person who takes the G.E.D. typically has 11 years of school," Dr. Heckman said, giving his explanation of the wage advantage G.E.D. holders appear to have over other dropouts. "Those who drop out and do not take the G.E.D. have 10 years of school. When you make an adjustment for what an additional year of high school will do for your earnings, you will see that having the G.E.D. makes essentially no difference."
In his study, Dr. Heckman concluded, "Both dropouts and exam-certified equivalents have comparably poor wages, earnings, hours of work, unemployment experiences and job tenure." He added, "There is no cheap substitute for schooling."
Dr. Heckman noted that some G.E.D. holders did very well in life, calling it "the Bill Cosby effect," after one of the country's most successful G.E.D. holders. Others include Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey, who took the G.E.D. in the Navy, and Waylon Jennings, the country singer. Nonetheless, he sees access to job training programs or to community college as the only economic benefit of the certificate.
Mr. Ledlow, the G.E.D. holder who is now on welfare and is seeking a job as a salesman, was dismayed to hear that the G.E.D. alone was no longer accepted by the armed services. "That's wrong," he said. "At least if you have the G.E.D., you can show somebody that you completed something in your life," he said.
But Col. John Meyers, director of advertising and public affairs for the United States Army Recruitment Command, said that G.E.D. holders were not longer welcome in the Army unless they first obtain 15 semester hours of college classroom time, or 540 "seat hours" in a vocational school. Each is equivalent to a half-year's schooling.
"We are looking for high school diploma graduates and there is no doubt about our intentions there," Colonel Meyers said, adding that for the past decade, about half of all G.E.D. recruits eventually flunk basic training and are kicked out of the service, as against about a quarter of high school graduates.
"We are not disputing the value of the G.E.D. process," Colonel Meyers said. "We are operating on our desire to be in the high school diploma market on hard experience with the difference in attrition rates between high school and G.E.D. holders once they access into the Army."
In fiscal year 1989, 10 percent of the new Army recruits were G.E.D. holders. This year, the number of G.E.D. holders admitted -- because they met the Army's new requirements for additional education -- amounted to less than half of one percent of the total number of recruits.
"This is the most controversial part of a credential assessment we did a few years ago," said a military personnel officer at the Pentagon who spoke on condition of anonymity. "You would look at a person who goes out and gets a G.E.D. and think that person would be able come into the military and be successful, but it has not worked out that way."
When disciplinary problems are removed as a cause for failure, the official said, G.E.D. holders flunk out of the military at about twice the rate of high school diploma holders, regardless of geographic origin, work experience or arrest record.
The G.E.D. Testing Service has been sensitive to charges that the availability of the G.E.D. may encourage some high school students to seek a short cut to a diploma by dropping out and sitting for the G.E.D. To prevent this, the G.E.D. Testing Service does not allow anyone to take the test before the date he or she would normally have graduated from high school, but about half the states allow exceptions for dropouts who receive a recommendation for the test from their former high school.
The lure of a quick G.E.D. instead of one or two more years of high school is clearly a temptation to disgruntled students, said Judy Myer, a guidance counselor at Jackson High School in Jackson, Mo., and the past vice president of the American School Counselors Association.
"For some students and for whatever reason -- poor grades or a chance for a full-time job quickly -- the G.E.D is an out," Mrs. Myer said. "Some say they have parents or friends who took the G.E.D. so it must be all right, and for others it's simply an escape. It's something they can say to the school office or to their parents: 'It doesn't matter if I drop out, because I can get the G.E.D. and it's just as good.' "
She hastened to add that some students drop out for reasons other than laziness or alienation, like pregnancy or the need to work to support a family. And once a student has dropped out, the G.E.D. is certainly a step in the right direction, Mrs. Myer said. But she emphasized her belief that obtaining a G.E.D. is simply not as good as staying in school.
"I just can't accept that the G.E.D. is equivalent to getting the full high school curriculum," she said.

Chart: "A Quick Look at the G.E.D." shows some sample questions from the General Educational Development test.
 The General Educational Development test is multiple choice, lasts 7 1/2 hours and was designed by the G.E.D. Testing Service to measure competence in high-school-level academic skills.
Its five sections cover writing skills, social studies, science, mathematics and reading comprehension. The G.E.D. does not test raw factual knowledge -- the dates, names and formulas that high school students study and memorize for tests. Judging by a practice test provided by the service, most necessary information, including mathematical formulas, is provided with the test. The G.E.D. Testing Service gives sample questions to high school seniors each year to determine that the academic level of the G.E.D. questions is equivalent to senior-year courses of study.
Taking the test does not require any classroom preparatory work. According to the testing service, about 40 percent of G.E.D. test-takers sit for the exam without any preparation; the rest brush up by either reading how-to books available in bookstores or enrolling in pre-G.E.D. classes held at many night schools and community colleges.
The writing skills segment includes a 200-word essay on a given topic.

How the Offshore Rigs Rode Out Gulf's Storm

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Oct. 20

 BODY:
It was two days after the most savage hurricane of the century ripped through the Louisiana gulf waters and Scott Sewell, the chief Federal regulator of offshore oil production, was touring the region by helicopter, dreading the worst. He was amazed by what he could not find.
"The massive oil slicks that we didn't want to see weren't there," Mr. Sewell recalled recently. "There was very little environmental damage and, frankly, the losses were minimal given the ferocity of the storm." 
 Twenty years ago, a hurricane with 160-mile-an-hour winds and 71-foot waves might have turned Louisiana's southern shores into a catastrophe not only for thousands of birds, fish and other wildlife poisoned by oil slicks but also for the oil industry, which could have faced a financial and public-relations disaster like the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska. But on Aug. 25, when Hurricane Andrew whipped up the water surrounding hundreds of offshore rigs, modern drilling-platform architecture stood up to nature's fury.
Although daily output of as much as 800 million cubic feet of natural gas and maybe 90,000 barrels of oil remain out of production while repairs continue on pipelines, older platforms and other storm-damaged gulf machinery, even some environmentalists are giving the oil industry credit for being technologically prepared.
 
Little Oil Is Spilled
 By the Government's count, 249 of 3,800 offshore platforms in Federal gulf waters were damaged by Hurricane Andrew, but spilled oil amounted to less than 500 barrels. Nearly half of that was skimmed up by recovery crews, and no slicks were found along the shoreline. By contrast, the Exxon Valdez wreck spilled 250,000 barrels into Prince William Sound, and the cleanup is still not finished.
A Texaco platform apparently caused the worst environmental damage after Hurricane Andrew ripped a rig called the Treasure 75 from its moorings. The wind and waves sent the platform sailing more than four and a half miles before one of its 30,000-pound anchors tore through a concrete-sheathed oil pipeline, spilling 300 barrels. The platform then ran aground in 35 feet of water.
Industry officials and structural engineers say that improvements in standards and techniques in platform design and construction over the last 20 years passed an important test by taking blows from Hurricane Andrew without fouling Louisiana's coastal waters or beaches.
The episode "should show that offshore drilling can be done safely, even when you have a 100-year hurricane," said William F. O'Keefe, executive vice president of the American Petroleum Institute, the Washington trade group financed by major oil companies. Oceanographers say storms with the winds and steep waves of Hurricane Andrew occur in gulf waters perhaps once a century.
 
Banned in Other Areas
 Offshore rigs are an entrenched part of the Louisiana and Texas economies. But Congress has banned drilling in areas off the Atlantic coast, the Florida gulf coast and the California coast -- areas that geologists say have large oil-and-gas reserves. The nation still faces a substantial risk from oil spills, however, because it imports so much of its oil in tankers, more than eight million barrels a day. Tankers have a far worse environmental record than offshore wells.
"The overwhelming evidence, just overwhelming, is that the industry takes all the precautions that are needed" for safe offshore drilling, Mr. O'Keefe said. "Future operations are bound to be safer as long as we keep investing in new technology."
Environmentalists concede that the industry's offshore drilling techniques have improved steadily since the disastrous 1969 spill off the coast of Santa Barbara, Calif., that was a flashpoint for the modern environmental movement.
"Whether it's been the industry pushing or environmentalists pushing from the outside is hard to say," said Thomas M. Miller, a spokesman for the Center for Marine Conservation in Washington. "Standards have been taking a gradual step up in the last couple of decades on offshore platforms. We applaud the industry, but it needs to keep improving the technology. Nothing is infallible."
The industry learned that lesson the hard way in 1965, when Hurricane Betsy washed away and destroyed 20 platforms in what then was a much smaller universe of Gulf of Mexico production; still, the storm produced no major spills.
At the time, most of the major oil companies had designed platforms with decks nearly 43 feet above the water level, or high enough so the decks would be missed by waves measuring 57 feet from trough to crest. A few companies built their decks lower, at about 35 feet above sea level.
By the late 1960's, most major companies had raised decks on new platforms in water depths of 300 feet or more to at least 50 feet above the water level. The Minerals Management Service, the Federal agency that governs offshore drilling, in 1972 adopted that level as the official standard.
In addition to putting more space between decks and gulf waters, engineers fortified the platforms with more and stronger steel legs known as piles -- as many as a dozen, instead of four. The steel footings for offshore platforms are thicker and longer, commonly driven 300 to 400 feet into the gulf's mud floor.
 
Little Amoco Damage
 Many platforms built before Hurricane Betsy also survived Hurricane Andrew unscathed because they had had been fortified with newer defenses over the years. The Amoco Corporation found damage to just one of its 80 platforms in the gulf, where waves surged above a deck about 50 feet above the water level. The few minor cracks in the steel template, or jacket, anchored to the ocean floor have already been repaired, said Dale Gilliam, an Amoco vice president in Houston.
Hurricane Andrew washed away three platforms belonging to the gulf's biggest oil-and-gas producer, the Chevron Corporation. Two others were crushed so badly that they were condemned. "The ones that were lost were installed before 1965, with the oldest in 1958," said Paul Versowsky, leader of Chevron's platform design group, in New Orleans.
Chevron switched to tougher platform construction standards the year after Hurricane Betsy. Most of its new decks are 60 feet or more above the sea level, and, as far as Chevron can tell, none of Hurricane Andrew's waves surged that high.
Mr. Versowsky said that virtually all offshore platforms in the North Sea, between Britain and Norway, where waves can reach 120 feet, were designed from technology developed in the Gulf of Mexico.
The flow of oil and gas from new wells is shut off manually when hurricane-force storms enter the gulf, which was the procedure followed before the August storm. Backup computer systems are designed to halt the flow automatically if necessary.
The industry now is working on platform designs that could have companies drilling at water depths of 6,000 feet or more in the next decade, as exploration moves farther offshore in the gulf. In a part of the gulf untouched by the hurricane, Conoco Inc. holds the current record, operating in 1,785 feet of water with a platform tethered to the gulf floor with flexible steel cables. Shell Oil, using similar technology, is installing a platform that will operate in 2,850 feet of water.
"If you stop and think of the major disasters we've had in oil spills, few have anything to do with offshore production," said Wayne Dunlap, associate director of the Offshore Technology Research Center, at Texas A & M University, in College Station, Tex., a center that receives financing from the industry and the Government.
"If I were transporting oil," he said, "I would want to do it through a pipeline, not a ship. I never thought there was an argument that the industry couldn't operate safely in other offshore areas. If you can put them in the North Sea, you can put them anyplace."

CORRECTION-DATE: October 23, 1992, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Wednesday about offshore oil and gas rigs that withstood Hurricane Andrew misidentified the owner of drilling equipment that caused a spill of 300 barrels of oil and described the equipment incorrectly. It was a rig, not a platform, and the owner was Wilrig of Lafayette, La., not Texaco Inc.

GRAPHIC: Photo: With its strengthened modern drilling platforms, the oil and gas industry is receiving credit for being technologically prepared for natural disasters like Hurricane Andrew. Some 249 of 3,800 offshore plagforms in federal gulf waters, like the one above, were damaged by the storm, but spilled oil amounted to less than 500 barrels. (Texaco) (pg. D7)
 
Diagram: "Standing Up to Heavy Weather"
 Design changes since the 1960's have made the typical offshore oil or gas rig more robust and more likely to survive a killer storm like Hurricane Andrew without sustaining serious damage. Diagram shows that the rig platforms built in the 1950's and 1960's were 42.5 feet above mean low water, and that their legs were 33 inches in diameter. In contrast, the rig platforms built in the 1970's and 1980's were constructed to be higher (50.5 feet above mean low water). They also were built with improved framing and joint design, better steel alloys, larger structural members (46-inch diamenter legs), and larger, deeper footings. Once in 100 years designers expect a storm that produces a 69-foot wave cresting 46 feet above mean low water. (Source: Chevron) (pg. D1)

HEADLINE: In Long Run, Family Leave Will Be a Bargain

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The Democrats are proposing a Band-Aid approach on family leave, while the Republicans oppose even a Band-Aid.
Psychiatric findings published about 45 years ago informed us that bonding of an infant with an affectionate mother is generally essential to establish healthy psychological growth in later years of childhood. Two years of bonding are ideal, but at least one year is tolerable. 
 Leading industrial nations in Europe subsidize paid (not unpaid) maternal leave, and they also provide heavily subsidized day care for infants and older children with carefully selected and trained personnel, who give children affection and the rudiments of social relationships.
The legislation prepared by the Democrats and vetoed by President Bush calls for short-term, unpaid maternal leave. Many working mothers could not afford to lose their wages during even this short term, and the time is far too short for bonding. President Bush will not approve any universal mandate for even unpaid leave and proposes only measures that evade reality.
The Democrats' proposal of a $1,000 tax break for day care expenses is another Band-Aid. It is impossible to buy a year's day care for a toddler with quality personnel for $1,000 in rural areas. The cost runs far higher for an infant, and in urban areas, the costs are still higher.
The divorce rate of more than 50 percent in our country and the malaise and psychological disorders we have among our schoolchildren do far more harm to our economy than what it would cost to prevent them with paid maternal leave and quality day care.

HEADLINE: Mob and Politics Intersect, Fueling Cynicism in Japan

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 20

 BODY:
In 1987 Noboru Takeshita and his faction in the ruling party wielded immense influence in Japan -- more, some said, than the Government. But he was powerless to remove the last obstacle to his becoming Prime Minister: the loud, mocking attacks from a rightist group's sound trucks.
 Winning the endorsement of party elders hinged on his silencing the trucks, a fixture of political life here. 
Then, after all else failed, Shin Kanemaru, a powerful ally, took a remarkable step: He reportedly sought the help of a major organized-crime boss, Susumu Ishii. After Mr. Ishii met with Torao Inamoto, the leader of the rightist group running the trucks, the blare stopped, and Mr. Takeshita became Prime Minister.
 This episode was not the end of the relationship: Mr. Kanemaru admitted recently that he later accepted an illegal $4 million contribution from a trucking company with close ties to Mr. Ishii.
 The kingmaker escaped with a token fine, but he was forced to resign his position in the governing Liberal Democratic Party and last week he gave up his seat in Parliament, setting off one of the most revealing and damaging scandals in post-war Japanese history.
 
Present at the Creation
 "The most serious factor in the current situation, the factor that I take most seriously, is that the boryokudan was involved at the birth of the Takeshita Cabinet," said Ryutaro Hashimoto, a onetime Takeshita ally and former Finance Minister, using an expression for organized crime families.
 He added that, though he did not know if the reports were true, the appearance of these contacts could seriously harm Japanese politicians internationally as well as at home.
 "A lucky thing for us right now is that people in your country are focused on the election and have no time for Japan," Mr. Hashimoto said in an interview. "If it was a quiet time in the United States, there would be lots of criticism of Japan by your politicians."
 With the latest disclosures, a tale that once appeared to be about the mob's spreading influence has been transformed into what even the leaders of the governing party admit is a deeply unsettling glimpse into the nature of Japanese democracy.
 
Cruising
 The scandals that have hit the business and political worlds in recent years have added to the cynicism most Japanese show toward the power elite, but none have triggered as much outrage about how the system works.
 Rightist sound trucks cruise daily down the boulevards of Tokyo, extolling the Emperor, demanding a larger role for the military and playing patriotic songs. And rightist groups are often affiliated with organized crime families, known as yakuza, and sometimes the trucks are used to extort cash.
 The Japanese, however, seem to have been unprepared to find the trucks, the rightist leaders and a yakuza chieftain so close to the pinnacle of power, and many Japanese are ardently demanding greater disclosure of just how deep the relation is.
 According to the police, there are about 90,000 members of organized crime in Japan, belonging to more than 3,000 groups dominated by three large syndicates. Organized crime takes in billions of dollars a year -- mainly from gambling, drugs, prostitution, labor rackets and extortion, but also increasingly from legitimate business.
 
Soul-Searching
 Although no details have come to light on how Mr. Kanemaru may have used Mr. Ishii to silence the attacks on Mr. Takeshita, prosecutors, in the face of intense criticism, plan to pursue the trail of money to its roots, raising the possibility that more public officials will be implicated.
 "Because of these events we are going to have to think hard about the meaning of freedom and democracy in Japan," said Shokei Arai, a young member of the Liberal Democratic Party who has formed a splinter group to demand reform. "We have to think about the freedom we're losing."
 Neither Mr. Kanemaru nor Mr. Takeshita have commented on the highly detailed reports of their involvement with the yakuza. Mr. Kanemaru's guilty plea, which he made under tremendous pressure, permitted him to avoid questioning by prosecutors.
 Mr. Takeshita has said he will comment by the end of the month, and some opposition politicians have threatened to call him and Mr. Kanemaru to testify before Parliament. Mr. Ishii died in September 1991; Mr. Inamoto, who led the right-wing group, known as the Nippon Kominto, died in April 1991.
 Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest daily newspaper, said in an editorial on Sunday, "We think Kanemaru's connection with a late leader of a major crime syndicate -- before the formation of the Takeshita cabinet -- indicates corruption in the very heart of Japan's power structure."
 
$2 Billion Carries Weight
 Several facts suggest the relationship to Mr. Ishii was not casual. The intermediary Mr. Kanemaru used to contact him was Hiroyasu Watanabe, the former president of Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, the trucking company that gave Mr. Kanemaru the illegal $4 million contribution. Mr. Watanabe reportedly provided Mr. Ishii and companies he controlled about $2 billion in loans and loan guarantees, a vast sum if Mr. Ishii did but a single favor.
 Mr. Watanabe is currently under indictment on charges that his loans to Mr. Ishii's companies, nearly all of which are now uncollectable, were made improperly.
 But Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin was not alone. A number of big financial institutions dealt openly with Mr. Ishii and his companies, in spite of his notoriety.
 Mr. Ishii was at the center of a different scandal last year when it was disclosed that he had received more than $200 million in loans from two of Japan's largest brokerage houses, Nomura Securities and Nikko Securities, which had helped carry out his vast stock investments. He had also begun to look to the United States for investments, hiring as a consultant Prescott S. Bush Jr., the brother of the President.
 One company he controlled is now suing Mr. Bush for reportedly not making good on a guarantee for an investment that became worthless. There are no indications that Mr. Bush knew he was dealing with organized crime.
 
Mobsters as Fixers
 Despite the growing expressions of outrage over the scandal, some political insiders dismiss the anger as misguided, or simply naive. Some maintain that the public is well aware of the role of yakuza members as fixers of particularly difficult problems, mediators in disputes and back channels to the far-right groups.
 "From Mr. Kanemaru's point of view, this was the only way to stop the trucks," insisted Shigezo Hayasaka, a political commentator who was a senior aide to a former Prime Minister, Kakuei Tanaka. "He is a pragmatic man and he did what he had to do.
 "The Japanese mass media is the essence of childishness," he added. "They don't understand that the real world is a mixture of good things and bad things. They don't exercise the logic of a mature adult when they criticize Mr. Kanemaru for his behavior."
 Even if Mr. Ishii did not enjoy a long-term relationship with top politicians, the ease with which he gained access to the top levels of the political and financial worlds provides a chilling subtext to the web of scandal.
 
Taking Care of Business
 His efforts reportedly began when he was released from prison eight years ago, after serving time for gambling and fraud convictions during his career in Japan's second-largest crime family. He surveyed the booming economy and moved to a new playing field: speculation in real estate, stocks and art.
 On Jan. 30, 1985, Mr. Ishii was reportedly introduced to Mr. Watanabe of Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, whom he asked for financial help to enter the real estate business. Mr. Watanabe was involved in a struggle with the chairman and founder of his corporate group, who had the support of a major gang in Kyoto, so he was happy to build a new alliance.
 In the spring of 1985 Mr. Ishii formed the "business activities bureau" of Inagawa-Kai, the yakuza family to which he belonged, and he soon opened the Hakusho Sangyo Company, a real estate concern that became his first corporate vehicle.
 In just a few years he amassed investments worth more than $1 billion. He had a mansion full of Chagalls and Picassos, owned a country club and bought a helicopter. His accounts at Nomura and Nikko were handled by senior executives.
 
They're All Connected
 The yakuza's connections with the police and politicians go back decades. Tokutaro Takayama, the head of the Aizu Kotetsu, a big Kyoto gang, proudly describes how the police had asked him to help quell left-wing protests in the chaos after World War II.
 In fact rightists with a reputation for strong underworld links were instrumental in the founding of the Liberal Democratic Party.
 Yoshio Kodama, who was imprisoned several times for his violent militarist activities in the 1930's, earned a fortune during World War II in Manchuria procuring materiel for the Imperial Navy's Air Force. After serving a sentence as a war criminal, he used some of that money to help establish the governing party in the 1950's, and for years exerted influence among its leaders.
 Today those connections raise political concerns that the yakuza gangs' generally intolerant and aggressive approach may be influencing senior Japanese politicians.
 
Some Lines Are Open
 Some, however, do not hide their affiliations.
 Koichi Hamada, a senior party member and former chairman of Parliament's powerful Budget Committee, has admitted he was a yakuza member until he became a protege of Mr. Kodama.
 Mr. Kodama was ultimately prosecuted in the 1970's with Mr. Tanaka, the former Prime Minister, for accepting bribes from the Lockheed Corporation. Mr. Tanaka was forced to resign in disgrace.
 And Mr. Takeshita eventually got his big political break when he grabbed the leadership of Mr. Tanaka's powerful faction after Mr. Tanaka suffered a stroke in early 1985.
 That, in fact, was how Mr. Takeshita became the target of the rightists' sound trucks in 1987: The rightists seemed to feel Mr. Takeshita had usurped Mr. Tanaka's position.
 At a meeting with Mr. Ishii on Oct. 2, 1987, Mr. Inamoto, the head of the Nippon Kominto, which apparently instigated the sound-truck attacks, reportedly said they would stop only if Mr. Takeshita visited Mr. Tanaka at his home and apologized. That visit reportedly took place on Oct. 6.
 Mr. Takeshita ruled as Prime Minister for almost two years, until he was forced to resign after being implicated in a separate bribery and influence-peddling scandal, and Mr. Kanemaru inherited his faction's leadership.

HEADLINE: Mighty Menopause

BYLINE: By Helen E. Fisher; Helen E. Fisher, an anthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History, is author of "Anatomy of Love: The Natural History of Monogamy, Adultery and Divorce." 

 BODY:
"Be useful as well as ornamental" was one of my father's favorite sayings when I was growing up. And it looks as if I wasn't the only girl who heard it.
As we all know by now, it's "the year of the woman." More women than ever are running for political office. Experts commonly attribute the rise in women's political participation to the confluence of several events and trends: the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas imbroglio, the chipping away of abortion rights, the growing presence of women in the work force. 
 But while these cultural phenomena are indeed sending women into politics, American demographics and natural biological forces are motivating them, too.
The demographic factor is well known: the age wave. Seventy-six million Americans were born between 1946 and 1964. Hail the baby boom, a mass production following World War II. These men and women have been moving through society like a pig through a python, changing social life since they were born. Their interests have been the country's issues.
Now, as boomer women enter midlife, menopause has become one of their concerns. Two generational spokeswomen, Gail Sheehy and Germaine Greer, have recently written books on the subject. Though the books broke new ground, another point needs to be made. In concert with the age wave, this change in female biology will certainly contribute to women's rise to political power.
As menopause proceeds, levels of the female hormone estrogen steadily decline -- unmasking natural levels of testosterone. Testosterone is one of nature's potent cocktails. The predominantly male hormone is linked with assertiveness in animals and people. Scientists have established that men (and male monkeys) of high rank often have elevated testosterone levels.
In many societies, middle-aged women (with relatively high levels of testosterone) gain influence in political, religious, economic and social life. As Margaret Mead once said, "There is no greater power in the world than the zest of a post-menopausal woman." So it is likely that boomer women will attain authoritative political positions as well.
Certainly, there are cultural reasons for women's midlife rise in status. Released from the constant chores of rearing children, menopausal women are freer to pursue activities outside the home. But biology, in this case, is working in their favor. How ironic, too, given the fact that science has historically been used to bar women from power. Menstrual cycles made us unreliable in combat, biology left us unfit to lead.
Will a rise in women's activism affect our home lives, too? While some things will be different, gender relations are unlikely to change as much as one might expect. Power in one segment of society does not necessarily translate into power across the board. For example, women who work outside the home still find themselves doing most of the housework. This is true around the world: even in cultures where women are politically and economically powerful, they still do most domestic chores.
Moreover, even if American women become much more powerful in politics, it's unlikely the sexes will be at each other's throats. Again, biology may play a role. As middle-aged women exhibit more assertiveness, middle-aged men display less of it. Men's testosterone levels peak when they're in their 20's; then the amount of the hormone steadily declines. This helps explain why men become more nurturing as they age.
Could the war between the sexes ebb as the genders mature? Given the cultural and biological forces that work together to build and break relationships, it's unlikely that a general rise in women's political power will dramatically alter women as wives and lovers.
Nevertheless, "the year of the woman" is here to stay. In fact, it may well be the decade of the woman. Society has positioned women to rise in political power. And the biological changes wrought by menopause will bolster their interest in power and increase their ability to use it. As usual, culture and nature go hand in hand.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans;
President, After 10 Cool Months, Is Catching Fire as a Campaigner

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RALEIGH, N.C., Oct. 21

 BODY:
As President Bush likes to say, this is a weird election year, and now comes the latest surprise: after 10 torpid months, Mr. Bush has suddenly reawakened as a fist-shaking, stem-winding Presidential candidate.
On a two-day train trip through the South this week, the President seems finally to have found a message he believes strikes a chord. Gov. Bill Clinton cannot be trusted with the White House, he says -- "a pattern of deception" is the refrain at each whistle stop -- and President Bill Clinton would raise taxes on working men and women. 
Today in Kannapolis, N.C., Mr. Bush struck the themes that aides say will dominate the remaining days of his campaign. He talked of "a vast difference in philosophy, in approach to this great country of ours," and compared his record to that of Mr. Clinton as Governor of Arkansas.
"I've got to put it in perspective," Mr. Bush said. "Arkansas rates 50th in the quality of environmental initiatives, 50th in the percentage of adults with college degrees, 50th in percentage -- per capita spending on criminal justice, 49th in per capita spending on police protection."
"And Governor Clinton said the other night, 'I want to do for the country what I've done for Arkansas.' We cannot let him do that," Mr. Bush added to the crowd's roar.
In a turn of phrase that has resonated in this region, a hotbed of Atlanta Braves baseball fans, Mr. Bush compared Mr. Clinton's aspirations for the White House to "sending some Little League guy to coach the Braves."
 
New Sense of Passion
 Mr. Bush has said this before, probably thousands of times, but maybe never with the passion and directness that enliven his oratory on this trip.
On swing after swing this year, he has seemed to be almost oblivious to his growing political peril. Barely a month ago, he gave a rambling version of his message to conservatives in Orange County, Calif., in such wan fashion that his sparse crowd drifted toward the exits even before he finished.
By comparison, Mr. Bush is campaigning this week, tortured syntax and all, with the abandon of a Republican Hubert H. Humphrey, slapping at the pollsters and press who have written him off with almost the same fervor in which he attacks Mr. Clinton.
 
'These Nutty Pollsters'
 "Let me give you a little advice," he told some 15,000 supporters at an outdoor rally Tuesday night in Spartanburg, S.C. "Don't listen to these pundits telling you how to think. And don't listen to these nutty pollsters. Remember: things are decided in the last couple of weeks in this campaign. And now people are going to decide: Who do I trust to be President of the United States?"
At times, there are shades of candidate Bush in happier days, so visibly wrapped up in his oratory that he gets carried away by it, tossing away his memorized text.
He calls the Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate, Al Gore, "the ozone man," a jab at his devotion to environmental causes, and warns that a Clinton Presidency would mean "no timber workers, only a bunch of owls," and "no farmers, only a great, big, wet hole out there somewhere if you listen to him."
And he constantly rails against the opposition, telling listeners that "we are not a nation in decline" and that they should "not listen to the pessimists -- these liberal Democrats posing as a friend of America."
Today the Bush campaign began broadcasting three new commercials, two using person-in-the-street interviews to attack Mr. Clinton on the draft, his honesty and his credentials as a commander in chief. It seeks to hammer home themes that Mr. Bush emphasized Monday night in the final debate. A third advertisement takes the high road, showing soft images of the President in the Oval Office and with his wife, Barbara, and their grandchildren. It seeks to portray Mr. Bush as a man who was an international leader and now could help "do the same at home."
Vice President Dan Quayle carried the attack on Mr. Clinton's trustworthiness to two swing states badly needed for a Republican victory. Taking his bus tour through the small towns of central and southeastern Michigan and into northwestern Ohio, Mr. Quayle turned again to the expression he coined for the Vice-Presidential debate: "Don't pull a Clinton. Vote Bush-Quayle." The Democrats, he told students at Spring Arbor College in Jackson, Mich., are "a recipe for disaster."
By midafternoon, with Mr. Quayle's voice failing, his stump speech had taken on a pleading tone even in front of heavily partisan Republican audiences. He told a crowd at Monroe Community College in Monroe, Mich.: "Help re-elect George Bush. Help us out. Vote for us. Your future depends on it. Your future will be better with George Bush. It will be worse with Bill Clinton. Help us out and let's have four more years."
 
Change in Bush's Style
 The extent of the new assurance in Mr. Bush's campaign style is subjective, but the crowds, his largest to date, clearly react to it.
"He looks confident," George Stacey, a North Carolina insurance-company worker, volunteered after a stop today in Kannapolis, a textile-industry center near Charlotte. "That's a change."
"He's strong as he's ever been," Berry Hill, manager of a carving-company plant, said in the North Carolina furniture capital of Thomasville. "I don't know what more anybody could ask for."
It would be wrong to make too much of Mr. Bush's transformation, which comes very late, could prove temporary and has an unmeasurable impact on voters anyway.
Party faithful always rally to the standard-bearer in the final days of a race. Michael S. Dukakis spoke well and drew huge crowds in the last month of the 1988 Presidential contest; then Mr. Bush soundly defeated him. Bill Clinton remains a much better attraction on the campaign trail most days this time than the President.
Still, Bush aides who have noticed the transformation are overjoyed by it, calling it a sign that their man has finally begun the political stretch run that they have long predicted.
The prospect that Mr. Clinton, his opposite on deeply felt issues of military service and economic policy, may actually take away his job has the President both alarmed and angry, some aides say.
"He finally looked into the abyss and said 'Whew!' ", one aide said on Tuesday.
Other aides say Mr. Bush is pumped up by his success in challenging Mr. Clinton at Monday's Presidential debate in Michigan. Many advisers claim to believe that their stalled campaign turned a corner at the last debate.
 
White House View
 "The focus of the election has finally shifted off of where it was -- 24 hours a day on the economy," said the White House political director, Ron Kaufman. "Now a third to a half of the debate is on the fundamental choice in the election" between Mr. Bush's low-tax proposals and Mr. Clinton's Federal spending plans, Mr. Kaufman said. Rightly or wrongly, Mr. Bush and his aides feel that they can win that choice hands-down, and it is that issue that the President is flogging in his latest stump speech.
Then there is the undefinable romance of politicking by train, a mode that Mr. Bush, no fan of the campaign trail, is said to relish.
On these 40-mile-per-hour cruises through the backwoods, between leisurely pauses at postcard-quality small towns, the President passes time on the back landing of the last car.
Microphone and loudspeaker in hand, he whistles to mongrel dogs, calls out to schoolchildren trooped out to railside and waves to the thousands of people, with no evident political motive, who materialize out of nowhere just for the thrill of seeing a President pass by their farm or house.
 
'Good for the Soul'
 At the stops on these trips, Mr. Bush sometimes waxes emotional about the majesty of the Presidency and how he wants to be re-elected for the sake of the children. The crowd responds, and he replies, as he did in Thomasville today: "I hate to leave you. This is good for the soul."
These are the reasons his aides give for Mr. Bush's reinvigorated campaign style.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats;
Clinton's Camp Says It Is Wary Of Perot Inroads

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PUEBLO, Colo., Oct. 21

 BODY:
Two weeks ago, Ross Perot was a footnote to the 1992 race. Now, Clinton campaign strategists say their private polls have raised concerns that he is cutting into the Democratic lead in states like this one.
"Certainly there's movement" in Mr. Perot's direction, said one senior campaign official, speaking on condition of anonymity. "I think it's because people don't know the facts about him." 
 The scope of any inroads Mr. Perot has made in specific states will not be known until the end of this week, when more polling will be finished. Another campaign official, also speaking on condition that he not be named, said the problem with Mr. Perot should be seen as real but limited to certain states, mostly the conservative Western states where Mr. Perot has always had his greatest strength, and where Mr. Clinton is campaigning today and Thursday.
 
Complacency Is Banished
 "Certainly, this has ended any sense of complacency," he said. "But it is not something that is viewed with alarm. It is something that is being studied, watched, thought about. We don't know enough about it yet."
It is perhaps a measure of the concern the Clinton campaign feels about Mr. Perot that campaign officials were privately telling reporters today that it was time that Mr. Perot faced a new round of examination by the press.
"As far as the debates were concerned, he got an uncritical look because he's entertaining and because of his seeming straightness," said one Clinton official.
It is in the best interests of the Clinton campaign to raise the specter of Mr. Perot as Election Day approaches to help ward off overconfidence. Many Democrats say they no longer perceive President Bush as a real threat to Mr. Clinton. That means the resurrection of Mr. Perot as a menace serves a tactical purpose.
 
Focus on the Independents
 But is is also true that, if Mr. Clinton is going to win by the margin his strategists hope for, he must also continue to fight for the independent voters who have made this election year so unpredictable, and there is some evidence that Mr. Perot is costing Mr. Clinton some of those voters.
Some national polls have shown Mr. Perot making slight gains in the last week. The polls show Mr. Clinton still the strong favorite, with 45 percent or more of those polled choosing him over Mr. Bush, whose support seems to have remained stuck at roughly 30 percent.
Despite the lack of movement by Mr. Bush, the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee today began broadcasting new advertisements critical of the President on network television. The committee's commercials, one of a young man, the other of a young woman, have the principals describing how the economy has left them hard-pressed to find decent jobs.
 
Focusing on the Young
 The 30-second ads, designed for programs that are popular with people younger than 30, are intended to draw young people into the party and to vote for Mr. Clinton.
The Clinton campaign also released a 15-second ad that features Mr. Bush uttering his "read my lips" pledge on taxes at the Republican National Convention four years ago.
While the fact that Mr. Bush is not moving and that Mr. Perot is still below 20 percent in the polls is on its face good news for Mr. Clinton, it also reveals the nature of the potential problem with Mr. Perot.
In the past, the Texas billionaire has drawn support more or less equally from Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton. But at a certain point, the poll figures show, Mr. Perot takes all he can from among voters leaning to Mr. Bush and begins to draw almost exclusively from among the ranks of those who would otherwise support Mr. Clinton.
The explanation of this phenomenon is simple enough, the Clinton campaign strategists figure. Many of those voters who are still undecided are people who strongly believe there needs to be a change in direction, particularly in the Government's handling of the economy and trade. Those people long ago rejected the idea of voting for Mr. Bush, so any votes they cast for Mr. Perot are at Mr. Clinton's expense.
 
Prospecting in the West
 Nowhere is the dynamic at work more clear than in the Western states of Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, Montana, and Nevada, which Mr. Clinton is currently touring.
In Colorado, for instance, Mr. Perot stands at 18 or 19 percent in the polls, up from single-digit figures during the time he was out of the race. At about the same pace that Mr. Perot's support has grown, Mr. Clinton's has diminished, going from a high of a 14-point lead over Mr. Bush, to a lead of only 6 or 7 points, Gov. Roy Romer, a Democrat, said.
"Perot was very strong in Colorado when he was first in," Mr. Romer said. "When he dropped out, he plummeted, and when he got back in, he began to go up again. At a certain level, he began to start pulling votes completely from Clinton. These are people who want a change from Bush, and for whom the only question is what are the options for change. Every one of those votes comes off of Clinton."
Mr. Romer does not think there is any chance Mr. Perot could go much beyond his current level of support to come anywhere close to actually winning in Colorado, but he said he did think that in a state like his, usually Republican-voting but this year in play, too much support for Mr. Perot could mean the difference between a slim victory and defeat for Mr. Clinton.
"This race is going to be close here," he said. "And it's going to be close because of Perot, not Bush. Bush is not gaining. Perot is gaining, and his gain is Clinton's shrinkage."
 
The Task for Clinton
 To attract and keep these voters in normally solid Republican states like Colorado and Wyoming, one campaign official said, Mr. Clinton must drive home the message that he, like Mr. Perot, "has an economic plan, that he is a different kind of Democrat, and that he is the only one of the three candidates who has actually done the things that the others are promising to do, such as balance a budget."
Mr. Clinton addressed exactly those points in his speeches here, and later at the airport in Cheyenne, Wyo.
"Here in the West, where people are hard-headed and practical and open, we know the difference between talking and doing," he said in Cheyenne. "Of all the people running for President this year, only one has ever passed a balanced budget, and only one has ever taken on the lobbyists."
Mr. Clinton then went on to promise the audience, as he had in Colorado, that he was the sort of Democrat they could vote for, pressing his position on capital punishment, welfare reform and stronger penalities for first-time juvenile offenders.
"I know a lot of people out here in the West consider themselves Republicans the way a lot of people in my part of the country consider themselves yellow-dog Democrats," he said. "What I want you to do is tell all the people around you that may have never voted for a Democrat before, that there's a new Democratic Party and a new Democratic candidate."

HEADLINE: U.S. HOPE DASHED ON GLOBAL TRADE

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 21

 BODY:
The Bush Administration's lingering hopes for a pre-election breakthrough in world trade talks collapsed today as negotiations in Brussels broke down, leaving American and European officials much farther apart than before on trimming farm subsidies.
The failure of the meetings will certainly prolong and could conceivably doom six-year-old negotiations to lower trade barriers around the world. European officials have expressed growing reluctance to make a deal with a President who may soon be forced from office. 
 The American law that bars Congress from amending trade agreements struck by Presidents applies only to deals reached before next March 2, and Democratic and Republican trade experts alike say it is unlikely that Gov. Bill Clinton would be able to come to terms with the Europeans so quickly if he is elected.
Many economists say that a global trade agreement will expand world economic output by $100 billion a year or more because it would encourage each country to produce whatever it makes most efficiently and import the rest. Without the agreement, they say, the world economy will grow more slowly.
Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, has said that it would be "virtually impossible" for the Bush Administration to win the re-authorization of the 18-year-old fast-track legislation, under which the recently initialed North American Free Trade Agreement will also be considered. It is not clear whether a Clinton Administration working with a Democratic Congress would be more successful.
The collapse of the meetings in Brussels today will at least postpone the date when an agreement can go into force. Some experts also say that the lack of an agreement may foster trade wars, restricting international commerce and world economic growth.
But labor-intensive industries in industrialized nations, including American textile and steel producers, dispute the benefits of an agreement. They worry that a deal would drown them in a flood of imports from more efficient and sometimes subsidized foreign producers. Labor unions and a few economists contend that the United States will receive few gains from a global trade pact.
Despite speeches by French officials this week against any European concessions, some Administration officials were still optimistic this morning that a deal might be possible. "If agriculture breaks this week, we could finish the round by Christmas," an American official said.
But by this afternoon, senior Administration officials were gloomy about the prospects for any pact in the near future and quickly blamed the European Community.
 
No 'Breakthrough'
 "Whereas last week in the meetings," a senior official said, "it appeared that both sides had come closer to proposals that would have allowed a political breakthrough on agriculture, which would have allowed us to wrap up the other issues, it now appears that the community has substantial difficulties even with some of the proposals they were willing to explore last week. It doesn't appear we have the basis for breakthrough in the near future."
A European Community official said the community was prepared to continue talking. But a senior Administration trade official said no further meetings were planned.
This week's negotiations in Brussels turned out to be vital not because of who was attending but because of the positions the sides took.
The Agriculture Department staff and European Community farm experts now in Brussels are far less senior than the agriculture and trade ministers who met 10 days ago in Brussels or the ever-optimistic trade ministers who met last weekend in Toronto. But this meeting dealt in great detail with the highly technical disputes that are actually blocking a global trade pact.
The outcome was a complete impasse. C. Joseph O'Mara, the United States Agriculture Department's chief trade negotiator, flew home today while leaving several aides behind to work on minor issues.
 
Details of Disputes
 A person involved in the negotiations gave a detailed list today of the disagreements on condition of anonymity. The disputes center on how deeply the community should cut its crop subsidies and how extensively the United States will be able to challenge the farmer income support programs that the community is beginning to introduce.
The United States has been seeking a 24 percent reduction in the community's tonnage of subsidized exports, while the community has been calling for no more than an 18 percent reduction. Last week, European officials expressed a willingness to split the difference between the two figures.
But they said today that any increase from 18 percent would have to be coupled with new European taxes on imports of American corn gluten and the cancellation of the so-called Andriessen Understanding, under which the European Community has pledged not to subsidize meat exports to Japan and other East Asian markets now dominated by Australia and the United States.
Higher taxes on American corn gluten would limit United States exports and protect European farmers from competition. Repeal of the Andriessen Understanding -- which is named for Frans Andriessen, the European Community's External Relations Commissioner and chief trade negotiator -- would allow the Community to unload some of its huge meat surplus in east Asia at the expense of American ranchers.
Another shift in the European Community's position this week involved its introduction of direct payments to farmers, replacing crop subsidies, which encourage inefficient overproduction that has flooded world markets. The European Community now wants the United States to guarantee that most of these payments will not be challenged as illegal subsidies.
The European Community also refused to accept any change in its subsidies for the production of oil from seeds. The United States has threatened to impose punitive tariffs on $1 billion worth of fine French wines and other European exports but has delayed any action pending the current world trade talks.
The senior Administration trade official said that no decision had been made on whether to proceed with the tariffs now, which would upset the community even more.
The latest impasse over farm trade is particularly frustrating to negotiators because of recent progress in other areas of the world trade talks to expand the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which is actually a series of pacts laying out free trade rules for global commerce. American and European trade officials agreed in Brussels 10 days ago to broaden the GATT to include banking, insurance and other financial services, but small differences remain on free-trade rules for telephone service and shipping.

HEADLINE: Attack on Bus in Egypt Kills a Briton

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Oct. 21

 BODY:
Gunmen believed to be Islamic militants killed one British tourist, the first foreigner to die in the current round of attacks, and wounded two others today after firing on a bus in southern Egypt.
The attack, which occurred some 170 miles south of Cairo, is the second on foreign tourists in Egypt in less than a month. It follows a statement by the underground Islamic Group warning foreign visitors not to travel to the pharaonic monuments in Luxor. 
 One tourist, Sharon Hill, 28 years old, died of her wounds, Government officials said. David Wilson, 24, and Mike Smith, 24, have been hospitalized in Dairut, where the shooting occurred. There were nine foreign tourists -- six Britons, two Australians and a Portuguese -- in the open, safari-type vehicle when it was attacked.
"At approximately 1 o'clock in the afternoon today as a South Sinai Company Tour bus was traveling on the circular road outside Dairut on its way to Asyut," said an official from the Ministry of Interior, "two extremists emerged from the fields opposite and fired on the bus."
 
Scene of Frequent Clashes
 The official said a search had begun for the two suspects.
The attack is part of a campaign by Islamic militants to cripple the tourism industry, which is Egypt's largest foreign-exchange earner, with some $3 billion a year, Government officials said.
One tour operator described the assault as "very destructive" to the future of the industry, which had predicted revenues of $4 billion this year.
As of late tonight, neither the Egyptian Government nor the United States nor British Embassies said they had any plans to issue a travel advisory, although embassy officials said no decision could be made until they had investigated the incident. There is already a general State Department warning to Americans traveling to the Middle East, because of increased tension in the Persian Gulf.
The Islamic Group is fighting to create an Islamic state in Egypt. The group has found many converts in the slums and rural villages, where there is high unemployment.
Southern Egypt has been the scene of frequent clashes between security forces and well armed Islamic militants.
 
Attack on Cruise Ship
 More than 60 militants, security officials, Coptic Christians, a prominent anti-fundamentalist writer and innocent bystanders have been killed in shootings this year.
Several thousand security troops were deployed in the south after a series of bloody encounters this spring, including one on May 14 that left 13 Coptic Christians and 1 Muslim bystander dead. The attack was the worst religious violence in Egypt in more than a decade.
There have been signs that attacks against foreign tourists might become more frequent.
 
'Campaign to Close Mosques'
 On Oct. 1, masked gunmen, suspected of being Islamic militants, fired automatic weapons at a Nile cruise ship carrying 140 German tourists. Three of the Egyptian staff members on the ship were wounded in the attack. The attack, which lasted about three minutes, occurred as the vessel left a jetty at Deir Mawas in Minya Province, 150 miles south of Cairo.
In August a gasoline bomb was tossed at a tourist bus, and in June two home-made bombs exploded in a pharaonic temple. No one was wounded in either incident.
The Islamic Group issued a statement at the end of August to foreign embassies, which several diplomats discounted as genuine at the time, warning officials "not to send their people to Luxor and Qena."
Qena Province is one of the most popular with foreign tourists. It encompasses the Valley of the Kings and Queens and the temples in Luxor, including the sprawling monuments and buildings at Karnak.
Egyptian officials say that the Islamic Government in the Sudan is behind a recent influx of weapons shipped across the porous border between the two countries to militant bands in southern Egypt.
One senior Egyptian official contends that some 2,500 Egyptian militants are currently undergoing military training in the Sudan, something the Government in Khartoum denies.
The attacks by the militants, most carrying automatic rifles, are well organized.

HEADLINE: Bush May Gain Little by Fuel Stance

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FLINT, Mich. Oct. 20

 BODY:
During the last two decades, 23,000 people lost their jobs in General Motors' car, truck and parts manufacturing plants in Flint, and evidence of hard times is easy to see in crumbling roads, boarded up homes and a downtown blighted by empty buildings.
The Bush-Quayle campaign hopes to find fertile ground here for a campaign message spotlighting Gov. Bill Clinton's proposal for substantially higher gasoline mileage standards and warning that thousands more pink slips would be the price paid by Flint and other Michigan cities if it becomes law. 
 "Those fuel-efficiency standards of 40 miles per gallon," Mr. Bush said during the Monday night's Presidential debate, echoing months of newspaper and radio advertisements in Michigan, "that would break the auto industry and throw a lot of people out of work."
But just as Mr. Bush still lags in the polls in the Pacific Northwest, despite promising to rewrite the Endangered Species Act and open virgin forests to logging, the President appears to have gained little ground here by pushing an issue that he portrays as a choice between jobs and the environment.
Voters interviewed here this week say they no longer see environmental goals as an automatic threat to workers. Democratic campaign officials say that is part of the reason that a poll of Michigan voters taken by The Detroit Free Press just before the Presidential debates showed Mr. Clinton leading Mr. Bush by double-digit percentages. No Democratic Presidential candidate has taken the state since 1968.
Janice Karcher, the program manager at the Genesee Economic Area Revitalization, an economic development group here, said: "It's seen as a competitiveness issue. More fuel efficiency means better cars and could mean more jobs."
For months, the Bush-Quayle campaign has cited an automobile industry study predicting that raising average fuel economy standards to 40 miles per gallon from 27.5 today would cost up to 40,000 jobs in Michigan and 300,000 jobs nationwide. Auto workers here called the estimate wildly wrong, noting that it assumed that the only response by Ford, Chrysler and General Motors would be to stop manufacturing all large cars.
Far from fearing higher mileage standards, some union officials here said they welcomed them as a means of competing with foreign auto makers, who would be held to the same standards.
"Stricter mileage standards will produce a whole new industry for new methods, new equipment, new techniques and technologies," said Dave Yettaw, the president of the United Automobile Workers Local 599 here and a supporter of Governor Clinton. "Too often we think about the immediate problems and not the long term. And that's what's got us in our predicament in the auto industry. I think Clinton is right on this. He says we can have higher mileage cars and more jobs."
When told that Mr. Bush's contention was being rejected by many voters in Flint, the birthplace of General Motors and a center of manufacturing for some of the company's largest Buick and Oldsmobile models, Republican officials expressed surprise. "Listen, those are the same people who will be standing in unemployment lines if the Clinton-Gore proposals are put into effect," said John T. Truscott, the press secretary to Gov. John Engler, a Republican who is running the President's campaign in Michigan.
The clash between Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton focuses on corporate average fuel economy standards, or Cafe standards. Enacted by Congress in 1975, they first took effect in 1978. The law sets out a formula for measuring the average fuel economy of a manufacturers' products and essentially means that for every large low-mileage car like the Lincoln Town Car, Ford must build two high-mileage Escorts.
Manufacturers' fleets are now required to average 27.5 miles per gallon, though there are waivers in the rules to allow slightly lower average fuel economies. David L. Greene, a researcher at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, said the standards had saved consumers $250 billion in fuel bills. The Energy Department says average gasoline consumption is now 7.3 million gallons a day, 100,000 gallons a day less than in 1978, even though there are 50 million more cars and trucks on the road.
Even though auto companies fought the law's passage, asserting that it would lead only to small and uncomfortable vehicles, some executives grudgingly acknowledge that it helped the industry. New materials that reduced the weight of vehicles, innovations in aerodynamic design, developing front-wheel drive, manufacturing better radial tires, changing engine designs and a host of other inventions prompted by the law have helped American cars compete with Japanese cars in quality and fuel-efficiency.
"To some degree, Cafe standards helped us get a headstart on recognizing problems with our cars that we weren't paying attention to," David L. Kulp, the manager of fuel economy and planning at Ford, said in an interview in the company's headquarters in Dearborn. "It made us start to think about fuel economy and quality issues."
Still, Mr. Kulp said , he is worried about Mr. Clinton's idea about raising average mileage standards to 40 or 45 miles a gallon, a level he said was well beyond the technical abilities of American or foreign manufacturers. An exclusive group of top executives of Ford, Chrysler and General Motors expressed similar misgivings to Mr. Clinton in a private meeting in Detroit last August, and he has apparently taken their concerns to heart.
When he first proposed raising mileage standards during an Earth Day speech last April at Drexel University in Philadelphia, Mr. Clinton proposed to "accelerate our progress toward more fuel-efficient cars and seek to raise the average goal for auto makers to 45 miles per gallon."
Since meeting with the executives, Mr. Clinton has said he would be "flexible." Mr. Clinton's aides say he was also influenced by conclusions reached by a National Research Council panel of experts who published a study in April that said it might only be technically possible to raise the average fuel economy of American cars to 37 miles per gallon by 2006.
During the debate on Monday, Mr. Clinton further clarified his position."I said we ought to have a goal of raising fuel-efficiency standards to 40 miles a gallon, " he said. "I think that should be a goal. I've never said we should write it into law if there is evidence that that goal cannot be achieved."

HEADLINE: In Debate, Dodd Presses His Foe on Failing to Vote in Many Elections

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FARMINGTON, Conn., Oct. 21

 BODY:
Senator Christopher J. Dodd sharply questioned his Republican opponent, Brook Johnson, on his failure to vote in Connecticut elections in a debate here today. Mr. Dodd, citing town records, said Mr. Johnson had voted only twice in the last 10 elections in his hometown of Greenwich.
Mr. Johnson, a textile executive who came out of political obscurity five months ago, has acknowledged that he has not voted regularly, saying that the demands of his business kept him out of town for many votes. 
 The exchange came during the second of two debates this week, and was the first opportunity for residents who have seen the two candidates again and again in television commercials to compare how fast they are on their feet and how they take barbed questions.
The debate was sponsored by the Connecticut Broadcasters Association and shown on television throughout the state.
Mr. Johnson, who has peppered the state with commercials that trumpet his business achievement and plans for cutting the Federal deficit, sidestepped Mr. Dodd's charges on his voting record, asserting the issue of who could get results in Congress was the most important question.
Mr. Johnson's voting record has been reported by the news media in Connecticut, but he had never been confronted with it by his opponent. The debate format was the first to allow the candidates to question each other directly, and Mr. Johnson struck out at Mr. Dodd as well. He challenged the Senator's campaign contributions from special-interest groups and his record in voting to raise taxes.
But it was Mr. Dodd, looking more the challenger with points to prove than a two-term incumbent with a commanding lead in the polls, who kept up the pressure and the energy in the hourlong exchange.
"Where were you during the critical times when we faced difficulties?" Mr. Dodd asked at one point, after he had introduced the document that showed Mr. Johnson's voting record in Greenwich, and another document, which he said showed that Mr. Johnson had changed his primary residence to Florida last year. "Why did you not participate in the electoral process?" Mr. Dodd pressed.
Mr. Johnson said he had always been a resident of Connecticut, although he has had a home in Florida for 10 years, but he mostly brushed aside Mr. Dodd's attacks, often changing the subject to his favorite themes of campaign-finance reform, term limits for elected officials and a balanced-budget amendment.
"I came into this race as a businessman, 20 years in the American manufacturing industry," he said, responding to the question about his voting. "Commitment means a lot, commitment is important," he said at another point. "But a bigger issue is results -- what do you get done?"
 
Favorite Themes
 Throughout the hour, each man returned to what he presented as his strengths: Mr. Johnson, seeking to portray himself as a can-do business executive who would address the Federal deficit and change the Senate by helping impose term limits for Congress, against Mr. Dodd, who said he believed he had the experience and the record of achievement that Connecticut cannot do without.
The first debate, on Tuesday, sponsored by the Connecticut Daily Newspaper Association, was far more sedate. It was muted both by the format, which precluded any give and take by the candidates, and by the questions, which tended toward the ponderous. And the candidates were also asked about issues on which they more or less agreed.
The problem of poverty? Job creation must be a priority to get the economy going again, both men said on Tuesday. The rapid growth over the last decade in the size of Congressional staffs? It must be reined in, they both agreed.
Mr. Dodd and Mr. Johnson clashed at the first meeting only on questions they raised themselves, like the propriety of taking campaign money from special-interest groups. Mr. Johnson attacked Mr. Dodd as an incumbent beholden to political action committee contributors, and Mr. Dodd fired back, calling the Republican stance "disingenuous," because only a few years ago Mr. Johnson helped steer and finance a political action committee for the textile industry. Mr. Johnson's campaign is partly financed by the Republican Senatorial Committee, which is financed by political action committee donations.
 
Economy Cited
 And Mr. Johnson today also continued to focus on the Federal deficit and its implications. When the two men were asked whether the United States should intervene militarily in Bosnia and Herzegovina to help stop the fighting there, Mr. Johnson referred to economics while Mr. Dodd answered on a foreign-policy basis.
The European Community, Mr. Dodd said, must bear the burden of stopping the fighting, although the United States could perhaps assist in a limited role.
"We can no longer become globo-cop," Mr. Dodd said.
Mr. Johnson agreed that unilateral intervention by the United States would be a mistake, but he then immediately took the question as another opportunity to argue for deficit reduction.
"We can't afford to project might when our own industrial might and economic might is falling apart in our own country," Mr. Johnson said. "There is no superpower in the history of the world that lasted while it was broke."
One point of contrast in today's debate occurred when the moderator, Bill Hennessey, asked each man what he would push for as his first piece of legislation in the next Congress. Mr. Dodd replied that he would seek an economic-stimulus package to create jobs, including a targeted investment-tax credit to help businesses. Mr. Johnson said a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution would be his first effort.
"The main thing we have to do is stop the spending," Mr. Johnson said.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Senate Race;
REPUBLICAN GAINS IN WISCONSIN RACE

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MADISON, Wis., Oct. 20

 BODY:
A month ago Senator Bob Kasten appeared to face an impossible battle against an upstart state lawmaker who broadcast folksy television advertisements complete with an endorsement from Elvis Presley.
But now Senator Kasten, a two-term Republican, is fighting back with a slashing television campaign that has pushed him from about 20 points behind in the public opinion polls to within striking distance of his Democratic challenger, Russell D. Feingold Jr. 
 National Democratic strategists had counted on the race to help guarantee a gain of three Senate seats and a filibuster-proof 60-40 Democratic majority next year. Instead, the race has become a photo-finish competition between a witty appeal punctuated by "Roger and Me" style commercials and old-fashioned, take-no-prisoner negative campaigning.
The 50-year-old Mr. Kasten, who has championed supply-side economics, is on the attack with a bus tour and television advertisements accusing Mr. Feingold of promoting radical plans to tax the middle class and coddle criminals.
 
Many Grains of Salt
 In a televised debate last Friday night, Mr. Kasten associated Mr. Feingold's vote in the State Senate against a no-parole bill, which was enacted, with last week's early release of Gerald M. Turner, a local convict who killed a 9-year-old girl 19 years ago. Then, over the weekend, Kasten volunteers called voters to suggest that Mr. Feingold had voted against preventing serial killers like Jeffrey L. Dahmer from receiving parole releases.
"If we allow him to be the fresh telegenic face for change without any ideology," Mr. Kasten said in an interview, "he could sneak through."
Mr. Feingold says the Senator is knowingly distorting his positions. He says that he voted for a different version of the no-parole bill, and that he supports higher taxes only on the wealthy.
In a new advertisement, Mr. Feingold picks up a garden shovel to clean up a mountain of salt, and says, "The truth is, the Senator has made up something so big that a few grains of salt won't be enough."
 
Quips and Studied Bemusement
 Clever commercials, a vast repertoire of quips and an air of studied bemusement enabled Mr. Feingold to emerge from a crowded Democratic primary in which two other major candidates buried each other in mud. Discounted as an underdog, Mr. Feingold was attacked by no one until it was too late.
"I will not use negative campaigning even if I lose," he told a group of voters in Brookfield last Thursday.
But the dynamics of a two-way race are different, and there will be increasing pressure on Mr. Feingold to supplement his shield of humor with counterattacks.
The 39-year-old challenger -- a Rhodes scholar and Harvard law school graduate -- has portrayed himself as a humble outsider, granting interviews to reporters in a campaign van that has a leaky roof and curtains that hang from a single thread.
"This campaign is about seeing if a person not tied in with the power structure can win a seat in the Senate," he said. "The United States Senate is now more like the House of Lords than a representative body."
Mr. Feingold has issued detailed position papers on how he would cut the budget deficit and provide universal health insurance. But the Feingold message that most voters see on television is more glib than thoughtful.
A poll published in The Milwaukee Journal on Sunday reported that Mr. Feingold's lead had narrowed to only three points; with the poll's five-point margin of sampling error, that is statistically a dead heat. One indication that Senator Kasten's attacks are beginning to stick is Mr. Feingold's negative rating among voters: it increased to 32 percent from 10 percent in just five weeks, while his positive rating dropped from 58 percent to 48 percent.
But other polls show the difference between the two candidates ranging from 7 to 10 points, down from 20 points in recent weeks.
 
Thrusting and Parrying
 In the debate last week, in Green Bay, Mr. Kasten accused Mr. Feingold of staking out positions "out there in left field." Mr. Feingold fired back arrows dipped in wit. When the Senator accused him of opposing product liability reform because he was "in bed with the trial lawyers," Mr. Feingold parried, "I have no personal recollection of being in bed with a trial lawyer."
When he was called soft on crime, Mr. Feingold responded: "Senator, it's 10 days to Halloween. It's a little too early to be scaring the people."
After the debate, a local television reporter took Mr. Feingold aside to interview him while they watched a series of his commercials on a television monitor.
"They are fun ads, but where's the meat?" challenged the reporter. "Do you think people will vote for you because they laugh at your commercials?"
Mr. Feingold responded, somewhat uneasily: "The humor side is to make people remember the message. You tell me how to put my 82-point plan in a 30-second spot."

HEADLINE: Prague Journal;
Kafka and the Jews in a Web He Would Recognize

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRAGUE

 BODY:
Like K., the central figure of "The Castle," the Franz Kafka Society in the writer's native city is striving unceasingly to attain its destination. But, as in the book, this quest is proving vain.
The society's goal is the splendid Kinsky Palace on Old Town Square, whose use the Czech government granted to the group a year ago. 
 "We keep walking around it, but we can't enter," said Vladimir Zelezny, who seized the chance offered by the "velvet revolution" of 1989 to restore Kafka to honor in his native land.
 
Pride in Diversity
 The failure to honor the Jews' contribution to Czech culture is matched by a similar lack of success by Jews in reclaiming religious properties seized by the Germans during their occupation from 1939 to 1945.
The issue of a blend of traditions is an important one for the Kafka Society, which was formed by Mr. Zelezny. He is its vice president and principal promoter; one member is Vaclav Havel, ex-President, playwright and essayist.
"We want to recall the tolerant and pluralistic tradition of Prague that Kafka represents, the symbiosis that flourished of Czech, German and Jewish culture," said Mr. Zelezny, who was spokesman for Civic Forum, which Mr. Havel led, and for Premier Petr Pithart of the Czech republic, until he lost his post in elections in June.
Kafka's works were suppressed by the Communists as "subjective and pessimistic." This official rejection was enhanced by an atmosphere in which the authorities defamed Jewish intellectuals as alien and rootless. Most Jewish writers in Prague wrote not in Czech but in German, their preferred language since the days of the Austrian Empire.
The Kinsky Palace is a large, pink-and-white rococo confection that played an important role in Kafka's life: He lived nearby, attended school in the palace and often visited his father's dry-goods store on the ground floor.
What keeps the organization from occupying the palace is the resistance of the Czechoslovak National Gallery, which administers the building. The museum says its charter prohibits use of the palace by an unofficial organization. "We can't overcome the opposition of this typical, overgrown Communist institution," Mr. Zelezny said in an interview.
 
Tortuous Negotiations
 After a Kafkaesque year of more than 30 negotiating sessions with Milan Uhde, then the Culture Minister and now president of the Czech parliament, and with directors of the National Gallery to turn the Czech government's decree into reality, Mr. Zelezny said he felt like the Kafka character who never reached the mountaintop castle.
He said he had raised more than $7 million in pledges from foreign foundations for the society's program, but cannot put the money to use.
The facade of the palace was refurbished in the final years of Communist rule, when Prague was prettied up for tourists. But the building, from whose balcony the Communist leader Klement Gottwald proclaimed the party's takeover in 1948, is largely empty and in need of extensive restoration.
The Kafka Society intends to use it as a meeting place for scholars of Central European culture, for seminars and congresses, and as a museum devoted to contemporary Czech works. To help students who find that in a market economy books are often beyond their means, the organization plans to subsidize a bookstore.
 
Trying to Regain Property
 Prague's Jews have also been frustrated in their attempt to regain property. Nearly three years after the overthrow of the Communists, the state still owns the historic synagogues and cemetery of the Jewish Quarter, a collection of more than 30,000 religious and artistic objects and a library of 100,000 volumes, most of which were stolen by Germans in World War II from synagogues and from the homes of the 92,000 Jews who were deported to concentration camps, where 77,297 died.
This trove still belongs to the State Jewish Museum, which took over the Nazis' Central Jewish Museum. Reinhard Heydrich and Adolf Eichmann, the SS leaders in command of the genocide against Europe's Jews, planned to turn the Jewish Quarter into a museum of an "extinct tribe."
At the end of the war, 8 buildings in the Jewish Quarter and 50 warehouses throughout Prague were packed with Torah scrolls, ritual objects, musical instruments, paintings, furniture and other stolen items. In the brief postwar interlude of democracy, which was ended by the Communist takeover, the 13th-century synagogue was reclaimed by survivors.
In 1949 the Communists turned the synagogues and the cemetery into the State Jewish Museum. Although services were allowed in the old synagogue, it was regarded as part of the museum and male visitors were told they did not need to cover their heads to enter. Head coverings are now required.
Prominent Jews contrast the Czech government's slow response with the prompt return of buildings and other property to the Roman Catholic orders, which the Communists had outlawed.
The Federation of Jewish Communities and other organizations have requested the return of 106 properties -- synagogues, cemeteries and the collections of the State Jewish Museum. After initial resistance, the Czech government earlier this year agreed.
But the last parliament failed to act, and the government chosen in June has not followed up. Prof. Bedrich Nosek, former head of the museum's collections, said at least two speakers in Parliament accused "the Jews" of wanting to "steal" state property and sell it to Israel.
Professor Nosek, a Jew, now teaches Hebrew and Jewish studies at Charles University and the Hussite Theological Faculty.
He said he resigned from the museum because those who direct it have no interest, sympathy or qualifications for Jewish studies and hindered academic cooperation with Israeli scholars. The current museum director is an expert on textile art and the director of Judaica collections is an anthropologist specializing in Native Americans. Neither is Jewish.
Emphasizing that the Jewish community intends to maintain the museum, Professor Nosek said the items in storage should be returned to use. "It is absolutely immoral to pile up these things in storage," he said. "It is because at the museum there is no sense of the history and spirituality of Jews."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Media;
Bush and Clinton Customize Their TV and Radio Ads in the Swing States

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CINCINNATI, Oct. 21

 BODY:
George Bush "gave us the second biggest tax increase in American history," the announcer in a new Clinton campaign television ad intones. "Family income in Ohio, down $2,100. George Bush -- broken promises, forgotten Ohio."
Next door, the Bush campaign is delivering a special message to Michigan. "This year the issue is jobs," the announcer in the Bush campaign radio commercial says. "Let's see what Clinton's plan would do to jobs in Michigan. His radical environmental proposals require increasing car mileage standards to 40 miles per gallon in eight years. This would be a disaster for Michigan jobs." 
 This is the campaign you will not be hearing in New York. On the theory that one state's turn-the-channel issue is another state's hot button, President Bush and Governor Bill Clinton have begun sending out specially tailored appeals to voters in swing states like Ohio, Michigan, Illinois and Georgia.
Ahead in the polls, the Clinton campaign has the luxury of targeting some of its television ads. The Bush campaign, in contrast, has been doing its targeting in the less expensive -- and most experts would say less effective -- medium of radio. (Ross Perot, it should be noted, is still putting out the same message to everyone.)
Traditionally, radio has been a haven for inflammatory and even misleading ads, and this year would appear to be no different. The Bush campaign's targeted radio ads are among the most incendiary -- and the Clinton campaign would say deceptive -- commercials of the Presidential campaign season. A different one is airing in each of about a dozen states, all with a similar theme: the region will suffer dire consequences if Mr. Clinton is elected.
"The Motor Vehicle Manufacturing Association says Clinton's new-car mileage law would cost over 4,000 Kentucky auto workers their jobs," a Bush ad on the radio in Kentucky says.
"Bill Clinton, he says he's for change, but take a good look at the change he's really talking about," a Bush ad airing in Illinois says. "An independent analysis says that Clinton-Gore radical environmental taxes will drive up our annual utility bills $343. That would threaten 200,000 jobs in Illinois. It could cost you your job."
Aides to Governor Clinton say the radio ads have no basis in fact, that they extrapolate from proposals, like a carbon tax, that Mr. Clinton has not embraced, and that they rely on figures from biased sources like manufacturing groups. "This stuff is so half-cocked, they've chosen to put it on the radio, because on television they wouldn't get away with it," said Mark Longabaugh, the Clinton campaign's Ohio director.
 
Clinton Campaign Counters
 Nevertheless, following its unofficial credo of "don't get mad, get even," the Clinton campaign has responded to each of the Bush radio ads with an aggressive counterattack.
"When this campaign began, George Bush said he would do anything to win," a new Clinton radio spot airing in Michigan says. "Now he's proving it. Why is Bush attacking Clinton? Because he can't defend his own record. Let's look at what George Bush has done to the auto industry. According to the Department of Labor, the American auto industry has lost 89,000 jobs under George Bush, nearly 30,000 auto jobs right here in Michigan alone."
Aides to the President deny that the targeted ads are appearing on radio rather than television because the campaign did not want them to attract too much media attention. But they acknowledge something almost as damaging -- that the race simply isn't close enough in most states to warrant the extra expense of targeted television ads.
"When you've got a big, big mission," one Bush campaign aide said, "I don't know that it's cost-effective to be doing a lot of targeting."
 
Maintaining Secrecy
 In keeping with the Pentagon-like secrecy the campaigns maintain about their advertising plans, the Bush campaign in Washington refused to release transcripts of its radio ads, even though state Bush-Quayle campaign offices and the Clinton campaign were making them available. Similarly, the Clinton campaign declined to say where it was airing targeted television commercials.
Like many other Clinton campaign ads, the targeted commercial aimed at Ohio voters uses President Bush's own words as his undoing. Mr. Bush is shown in Columbus, Ohio, just before the 1988 election. "The Bush savings plan will keep this economic recovery going while making our future more secure," he says.
"Can we afford four more years?" the announcer asks.

HEADLINE: Bundesbank: Sound Money Bastion

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Oct. 21

 BODY:
Should European monetary union some day become a reality, one of the world's most powerful and influential institutions -- the Bundesbank -- will be consigned to the dustbin of history.
Profound skepticism that this will ever happen steeps the sleek and quiet corridors of power at the Bundesbank's 13-story headquarters here these days. But in a way, the future of the central bank is partly what the recent turbulence on European money markets has been about. 
 France and Italy, German bankers say, want a European currency to replace the German mark and thereby gain a say in a new European central bank and free themselves a bit from the rigors of German economic and monetary domination.
 
Rates Fall Slightly
 Only after indications began to pile up that Germany was about to join the world recession did the Bundesbank begin to relax its monetary stringency, allowing interest rates to decline slightly on the money markets but leaving its discount rate unchanged. Its vice president, Hans Tietmeyer, said on Tuesday that the danger of inflation stemming from heavy borrowing to finance the costs of reunification was still not past, but that the bank was not "dogmatically" concerned solely about growth in the money supply.
"German monetary policy was certainly not the true cause for the development and turbulences of the past weeks," he insisted.
But if other European nations would like to be free of the German monetary discipline, there still exists in Germany a powerful consensus that a sound currency is the basis not only for sound economic growth but also for sound politics. Debasement of the money supply leads to debased politics, they believe; the Nazis came to power after a catastrophic bout of inflation destroyed the German currency in 1923. Ever since they began rebuilding the country after World War II, German leaders have been determined to prevent a repetition of this disastrous sequence.
 
Campus-Like Setting
 The Bundesbank is the vehicle for accomplishing this. The bank was established in 1957, by unifying the independent German state banks that had been established under Allied occupation. And it has had only one goal, set out in its charter: "the aim of safeguarding the currency." Today, its 18,237 employees -- scheduled to be reduced by a few thousand over the next several months -- work for an institution that singlemindedly serves that goal.
The atmosphere at the bank, a gray glass-and-concrete building set far away from the hurly-burly of the money exchanges in a campus-like preserve at the northern edge of Frankfurt, seems as solid, stable and unperturbed as the mark itself.
Despite the bank's many clashes over monetary policy with both German and foreign governments over the years, broad political support for the goal of German monetary soundness has never wavered. Germans who think of themselves as good Europeans also believe that they are doing the rest of Europe a favor, however much pain it causes at times. Inflation was a double-digit and widespread European ailment in the 1970's, and the Bundesbank has been administering strong doses of medicine ever since.
The bank's charter has one political nod, not to Brussels but to Bonn. "Without prejudice to the performance of its functions, the Deutsche Bundesbank is required to support the general economic policy of the federal Government," it says, but "it is independent of instructions from the federal Government."
But the bank is seldom really free from political pressure. Its head, Helmut Schlesinger, came under such heavy pressure to reduce interest rates at a meeting of European finance ministers and central bankers in Bath, England, last month that he wanted to walk out in anger, according to his aides. Past conflicts with governments in Bonn have usually come when the bank has tightened the monetary screws and kept interest rates high long enough to bring on a recession, something that many German economists believe may be about to happen again.
 
The Bank's Makeup
 The decision on whether to reduce them is entirely up to the Bundesbank's council, which is composed of Dr. Schlesinger, Dr. Tietmeyer and five other members of the directorate, plus the presidents of the nine German state banks.
Members of the directorate normally serve up to eight years, and are appointed by the German Federal President in Bonn after being nominated by the government of the day. Most of them come from within the bank itself. They are not removable by the Government or anybody else and are largely not answerable to it.
The Government in Bonn can press them to lower interest rates, but it cannot force them to do so -- unlike in Britain, where the Chancellor of the Exchequer makes the decision and the Governor of the Bank of England carries it out. French central bankers have somewhat more autonomy, but no other central bank in the Western world, besides the Federal Reserve in the United States, has as much as the Bundesbank.
And recently, as the financial world knows, the Bundesbank has kept nominal rates at their highest levels in postwar history, for fear of a wave of inflation caused by the huge Government and private borrowing to finance the unification of the country two years ago.
The bank's persistent refusal to give in to demands from Britain and the United States for lower rates was one of the reasons speculators began selling other currencies and buying marks this fall, gambling that the German currency would gain value. On the whole, the Bundesbank came under little pressure from Bonn to reduce rates, and after the spectacular collapse of the British pound on the currency markets, the mark did gain, just as the speculators predicted.
 
Technicians in Charge
 The bank has left its Lombard rate, which serves as a ceiling on short-term borrowing rates, at 9.5 percent, where it has been since September. But it allowed banks to bid down the rate the Bundesbank charges on short-term securities repurchase agreements from 8.9 to 8.75 percent, a step that will have the effect of continuing a downward trend on the money markets.
The Bundesbank is run, for the most part, not by cosmopolitan international bankers or politicians who might listen more closely to what their neighbors in other countries want, but by technicians whose main experience is limited to the German context.
But even within that German context, there is room for dissension. Dr. Schlesinger, for example, became president of the bank in August 1991 after the resignation of Karl Otto Pohl. Mr. Pohl resigned after Chancellor Helmut Kohl disregarded his warnings that monetary union with East Germany on the wrong terms would be a "disaster" -- a word Mr. Pohl used publicly to describe the results a few months after unification, prompting his resignation.
Mr. Kohl gave most East Germans marks at the rate of one for one, though Mr. Pohl, a plain-speaking former journalist who was appointed by the Chancellor's predecessor, protested that the Communist currency was practically worthless.
Dr. Schlesinger, who comes from a small Bavarian coal-mining town, has spent almost his entire career inside the bank, where he was in charge of its economic analysis section for years before Mr. Pohl groomed him as his successor. Dr. Schlesinger is not known for having a fine political hand, but he does have a professorial reputation for correcting people when they are wrong.
 
Britons Outraged
 The two qualities combined with explosive results last month in a defensive explanation by Dr. Schlesinger of the Bundesbank's efforts to defend the pound on the money markets in mid-September, an explanation that British Government officials found pedantically outrageous when it found its way into the newspapers. The controversy after the publication was followed by a further decline in the value of the pound, which has lost about a sixth of its value against the mark over the last month.
Dr. Schlesinger, a mountain climber who walks up the 12 flights of stairs to his office to keep fit, will be 69 years old next September and plans to retire then.
His successor will most likely be Dr. Tietmeyer, an economist who came to the bank in 1990 from the Finance Ministry in Bonn, where he advised Mr. Kohl on international economic policy. Dr. Tietmeyer's formative political years were spent under the tutelage of Ludwig Erhard, the author of the postwar West German "economic miracle," in the economics ministry in Bonn.
Dr. Tietmeyer, who is 61, has the reputation of being stiff and humorless, although politically adept. But he is seen as being no more likely than Mr. Schlesinger to allow open political considerations, such as what Germany's neighbors would like, to affect what the Bundesbank does on German monetary policy.
Otmar Issing, who held the chair of economics, monetary affairs and international economic relations at the University of Wurzburg until he came to the bank in 1990, is now the Bundesbank's chief economist, who also sits on the board.
 
Strict Monetary Targets
 Well-informed German bankers believe that he is the board member most insistent on setting the bank's strict monetary targets. Like other members of the directorate, he has shrunk from interviews since the acrimony of last month after the interviews given by Dr. Schlesinger. This year the bank set a growth target for the money supply of 3.5 to 5.5 percent, a target that has been exceeded by about 3 percentage points this year, fueling the fears of inflation.
Johann W. Gaddum, a former political associate of Mr. Kohl's in the Rhineland, and Gunter Storch, a former journalist, were joined on the Bundesbank board this year by two career bank staff members, Helmut Schieber and Wendelin Hartmann.
If Mr. Kohl names Dr. Tietmeyer president, he will be appointed to a term of eight years and paid a salary of more than 600,000 marks ($400,000.) The only thing that could lead to his removal earlier would be if the Bundesbank were replaced by a European central bank and a single currency.
Few within the bank, or anywhere else here in the German financial capital, expect that to happen, since the economic conditions necessary for having a single currency are nowhere near being met -- even if the treaty on European monetary and political union, which spells out a way to achieve a single currency by 1997, is ratified by all 12 European Community nations.
"It's a dead letter," one banker said, echoing similar thoughts heard along the carpeted corridors of the Bundesbank itself.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Al Gore;
Environment and Industry Can Flourish, Gore Says

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNION, N.J., Oct. 21

 BODY:
A day after President Bush attacked his positions on the environment, Senator Al Gore called today for a "new industrial revolution" in which stricter environmental standards would oblige businesses to adopt more efficient technologies.
Campaigning in Northern New Jersey this afternoon, Mr. Gore spoke in greater detail of his philosophy on the environment than he has in recent weeks. Although he did not deal with specific matters of policy, he said his stands on the environment and those of the Bush Administration present "as clear a difference as on any issue we face in this campaign." 
 "Bill Clinton and I believe that the economy and the environment are linked," he told a group of workers.
Mr. Bush labeled Mr. Gore's environmental stands as "strange" on Tuesday during a campaign stop in Georgia in which he mockingly referred to the Tennessee Senator as "Mr. Ozone."
 
What of Industrial States?
 Earlier today, Mr. Gore appeared on an MTV candidates' forum and was sharply questioned over whether he was softening his positions on the environment to avoid alienating voters in industrial states. He insisted that he was not.
During the MTV appearance, which Mr. Gore said was part of a Democratic drive to capture the youth vote, he also faced sometimes hostile questions about the campaign during the 1980's by his wife, Tipper, to get warning labels on record albums that contain profane or pornographic materials.
Mr. Gore traveled to New Jersey today at the beginning of a campaign swing that will take him to several states that have voted Republican in recent elections but that are now battlegrounds, including Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama and Florida.
As the setting for his speech on the environment today, Mr. Gore chose the New Jersey laboratories of the Englehard Corporation, a company that did early work in catalytic converters, now a standard anti-pollution device on American cars.
Addressing a small group of employees, Mr. Gore went beyond his frequently stated argument that the development of environmental-control devices will create new jobs.
 
Attacking Assumptions
 Instead, he attacked "comfortable and mistaken assumptions" that market factors alone will lead to improvements in the environment. Mr. Gore said that in a "new industrial revolution that focuses on environmental efficiency," businesses will find that as they eliminate causes of pollution they will increase their productivity and profits.
Mr. Gore has delivered pieces of his environmental message, but although he has promised to do so, he has yet to deliver a major address on the subject.
This morning MTV news reporter Tabitha Soren specifically asked him why he had not given such a speech, and after the candidate replied that he had talked about the environment many times, she suggested that he was holding back for fear of alienating industrial workers.
Later Ms. Soren said in an interview that in his best-selling book "Earth in the Balance" Mr. Gore took "a very apocalyptic tone" that he had not repeated since joining the ticket.
During a hour-long appearance on MTV's "Choose or Loose" program, Mr. Gore took questions from MTV reporters as well as from almost 200 youths assembled in the network's Manhattan studios.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Off the Trail -- Visits With Americans;
Campaign Is in Its Autumn, but a Season of Struggle Wends On

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Oct. 16

 BODY:
The pumpkins have a pundit's leer and the goblins lean like tired attack advertisements here on the porches of some of the humblest clapboard houses in America. The political season is winding down as Bill Belkner walks by on his way from the unemployment office.
"They got nothing in there for me," says Mr. Belkner, who has not had a job since July 1991, when the Presidential aspirants were many and their promises fresh. 
 There is a valedictory tang to the political autumn. Mr. Belkner admits he is in rough shape, living in a halfway house from which he must forage the streets of commerce, required as a condition of room and board to search every business day for a job he cannot find. Beyond such depressing rounds, he says, there is personal optimism for him in getting to vote for a President, in the idea of having any choice at all lately.
"This is Shelly and this is Ashley," he says, pointing to a lapel-pin photograph of his two young daughters that he wears on his overcoat like a campaign button. "This is a reminder that they need me and I can't let them down."
The button is a fleck of smiles and tawny color on the gray figure of the 41-year-old man. He walks down Lincoln Street from the unemployment office in a modest city of the sort that always seem misconjured in the campaign advertisements, plundered as a backdrop for simplistic tableaux of hope.
"So I had a drinking problem and fell down a bit," Mr. Belkner confides, but he has endured in New Hampshire, a state where the grand public optimism of the politicians is played out earliest in red, white and blue every four years. "I have to pick myself up and come back again," he says, taking heart in the parallel needs of himself and the nation for sober dedication to stop running away from the most obvious problems.
"I'm kinda hopeful, hearing the debates. The talk of taking chances and turning things around. Sure," he says, his daughters' smiles fixed below his edgy glance.
This troubled man makes the city seem thoughtful as the political season dies. The compromises with reality, more cautious than the politicians' own, are richly engaging in Manchester. The Tripoli brothers, Richard and Mark, run the Manchester Pawn Shop across from the unemployment office, and while they are teased by the promising antics of Ross Perot, they know better the cycle of borrowing and procrastination that keeps real people, hard-luck people, coming and going down Lincoln Street as the candidates are off talking of the future.
"These are people living on the edge," says Richard Tripoli, who is friendly and polite and not at all surprised as local craftsmen hock their tools on a Friday for a few weekend dollars. They will be back for the tools at the next odd-job opportunity, he says, just as musicians conversely redeem their instruments on a Friday for a weekend's work at entertaining.
"More of them are living in their cars, trying to pawn their junk," Mr. Tripoli says, measuring the descent of his customers and getting disgusted at what he says politicians don't know. "My customers pawned their best stuff two years ago."
Between the pawn shop and the unemployment office are some encouraging moments. A little girl jumps about happily in the back seat of a car as her father returns from Mr. Tripoli with the family VCR redeemed, some of life's promising fun restored.
Across at the unemployment office, Lucien Beauley patiently awaits another interview about his situation, his resume of his life tucked tight as a tourniquet under his arm. "A lot of people never see themselves in hard times," he says, including himself as one such amazed person, a 52-year-old computer consultant who lost his career job seven years ago when his company began laying workers off. He has since scrambled to survive as a self-employed businessman and then as an at-home consultant, but with no real paycheck to cash for more than a year now.
 
It's Something
 "It can get scary," says Mr. Beauley, nodding and impressed by what he has experienced. "It can get where you're barely making it." But he smiles slightly when contending that the political season does offer him something real, even if it is tiny and only glinting off to the side as he tries to marshal himself to go further into a long chain of days that consistently resist him.
"Confidence," he says, touching the word softly at the unemployment office. Not a mote of cynicism emerges as he subscribes to this priceless human commodity that candidates are promising to supply ever more insistently as the political autumn dwindles. "Everybody has some daily let-downs, setbacks, what have you," he said. "You have to motivate yourself to pick up something new each day to search for, some new endeavor."
At the pawn shop, Mr. Tripoli insists that the politicians, before they make big promises, should see people, voters, coming into his shop and leaving their frailest possessions hostage to some vague hope of an upturn. "The candidates are not even on the same planet," he complains.
Mr. Beauley says they are. "I saw the campaign planes coming in last winter," he says, admitting they gave him a touch of personal fervor that is with him now as the foliage spins down onto Lincoln Street in tandem with the last of the politics.

HEADLINE: Federal Work Force Declines as Military Cuts Back Spending

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 21

 BODY:
The Federal work force shrank in 1991 for the second straight year, in part because of cuts in civilian jobs in the military, a Census Bureau study shows.
The study, issued Tuesday, also found that state and local governments continued to add jobs but that their rate of employment growth slowed as the economy struggled to emerge from the recession. 
 "While state and local government employment grew only 1.2 percent between October 1990 and October 1991, compared with a 3 percent increase the year before, Federal civilian government job rolls actually dipped a bit," said the report, "Public Employment: 1991."
Civilian employment in Federal, state and local governments in October 1991 was estimated at 18.6 million, up 1 percent from 18.4 million a year earlier. These payrolls had risen 2.7 percent from October 1989 to October 1990.
Federal employees totaled 3.1 million in October 1991, down 0.1 percent from a year earlier, when the number of workers fell 0.3 percent, the study showed.
 
Cuts in Military Spending
 The biggest decline in Federal employment was in a broad category of "national defense and international relations," down 1.8 percent or 19,000 positions. The military budget was sharply cut with the end of the cold war.
John A. Medina, who helped prepare the report, said Federal payrolls also fell 0.1 percent in both 1986 and 1982 and 1.4 percent in 1981, the first year of the previous recession.
While Federal employment was shrinking last year, the number of state and local government jobs grew 1.2 percent, to 15.5 million. State and local employment has grown every year since the previous recession, when it dropped 1.2 percent in 1981 and 0.5 percent in 1982.
The latest recession began in July 1990 and is widely believed to have ended in the spring of 1991, although the recovery is weak.
State employment grew by 0.4 percent last year, to 4.5 million, while local government payrolls expanded by 1.6 percent, to 10.9 million.
Total salary and wage costs outpaced the 1 percent increase in jobs, rising 5.1 percent, to $41.2 billion. They also grew faster than the 3.1 percent inflation rate for 1991.
Federal employees' salaries and wages rose 7.6 percent, to $9.7 billion. That compared with a 3.9 percent gain for state employees, to $9.4 billion, and a 4.6 percent rise for local government workers, to $22.1 billion.

HEADLINE: Drugs Cost Less in Canada Than in U.S., Study Finds

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
The General Accounting Office released a study yesterday showing that the prices charged by Canadian subsidiaries of American drug companies were 32 percent lower than the same companies charged American customers.
The study, for the health subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, compared 121 drugs. It found that although the prices of 23 drugs were lower in the United States, 98 were higher here, most often by 50 percent or more. 
 Pharmaceutical industry spokesmen agreed that drug prices were lower in Canada, but they insisted that the study had exaggerated the gap by comparing "apples and oranges" in the two countries.
The subcommittee chairman, Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, said the disparity between American and Canadian prices was "another reason why we need a national health insurance system to get some control over the cost of health care."
He added: "Once again, the U.S. is behind the rest of the world in providing affordable health care to our people. Canada has found ways to control prescription drug prices. So have most countries." American consumers "are subsidizing the lower prices that Canadians and Europeans pay for pharmaceuticals," Mr. Waxman said.
 
Price to U.S. Consumers
 The American price of 27 drugs was at least double the Canadian price, the General Accounting Office said. The American price of the Upjohn Company's Xanax, a frequently prescribed anti-anxiety treatment, for example, was 183 percent higher than the Canadian price. The office, an investigative arm of Congress, compared American wholesale prices in May 1991 with those paid by the government of Ontario Province, which provides free drugs to elderly and low-income people.
Glaxo P.L.C.'s Zantac anti-ulcer drug was priced 30 percent higher in the United States. The American Home Products Corporation's Premarin, an estrogen drug for post-menopausal symptoms, was 162 percent higher.
By July 1992 the price gaps were even wider, said Stephen W. Schondelmeyer, who studies pharmaceutical economics at the University of Minnesota: 225 percent for Xanax, 40 percent for Zantac and 190 percent for Premarin.
The General Accounting Office said the biggest differential was in Isordil, an angina treatment made by American Home Products. The agency said Americans paid $17.41 for 100 10-milligram tablets, while Canadians paid only $1.63, or less than one-tenth as much.
John L. Skule, a spokesman for American Home Products, said a fairer comparison would be with the $4.33 Canadian wholesale list price. He added that Americans most often bought Premarin in 5,000-tablet bottles, which are "significantly lower" in price. Canadian prices vary across the country, he said. "They found the lowest prices" in Ontario, which is the largest Canadian market, he said.
Gerald J. Mossinghoff, president of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, a trade group in Washington, said the comparisons were distorted because they were based on "our sticker prices," omitting discounts demanded by large American buyers like health maintenance organizations, and price rebates to Medicaid programs, which Congress requires.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Is Clinton Driving Bond Market?

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Has the sharp fall of the bond market in October been a Clinton rout? And if so, was yesterday's sharp jump in Treasury prices -- with the 30-year bond up more than half a point -- a Clinton rally?
Or is citing Bill Clinton just an easy way for traders and journalists to explain what is going on in a $1.3 trillion market that can be buffeted every day by changing winds of fortune? 
 It is, in fact, a little of both. But there is no doubt that Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who is far ahead of President Bush in the polls, is getting more than his share of the blame -- or credit.
"I don't think it is all Clinton at all," said Joel Kazis, managing director for government trading and sales at UBS Securities in New York.
 
 
'Blame Somebody'
 "Traders have to blame somebody and the easiest thing to blame is uncertainty," he said, adding that Mr. Clinton had become synonymous with uncertainty.
Theresa Havell, the director of fixed-income securities at Neuberger & Berman in New York, agreed. "You have to focus on something, so you say it's Clinton," she said. "It might be that the market just had a big rally, and maybe this is just a correction. That would not be an atypical reaction. And markets usually assign a reason for it after the profit taking gets under way."
But John Costas, managing director of government trading and sales at the First Boston Corporation, disagreed. He blamed the Clinton program. And he said that one of the reasons the market had reacted so negatively is that most of the traders and dealers have worked only under the Republican Administrations of the last 12 years.
"People are having a hard time assigning values to the political changes that will occur," he said. "I have to attribute this whole downtrade to his program."
 One might say that if the last three weeks were the Clinton rout, then yesterday was a little Clinton rally. After falling sharply in trading in Tokyo, bonds, notes and bills rallied strongly in New York trading. The price of the 30-year bond rose in secondary trading by 19/32 point, to 9530/32 , to yield 7.6 percent, down from 7.64 percent Tuesday. Prices and yields move in opposite directions.
Prices on Treasury notes were also up sharply and the discount interest rates on Treasury bills fell steeply. The price of the 10-year note jumped 31/32 , to yield 6.73 percent. It fell 111/32 points Tuesday, to yield 6.87 percent.
Mr. Costas said one reason for the rally was a report in The Chicago Tribune quoting a Clinton economic adviser, Robert Shaprio, who said that Mr. Clinton had not prepared an economic stimulus plan that would result in big increases in the Federal budget deficit.
It has been the fear of such a program, which would enlarge the budget deficit, increase Government borrowing and risk higher interest rates and inflation, that traders have said is the bogyman that has frightened the market.
But yesterday's rally was also just a natural rebound after such a sharp fall. "When things get cheap, people buy," one bond trader said.
If it was not all Mr. Clinton's fault, what did happen? One major factor in the rout has been the overreaction to the hope that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates another notch, reducing the Federal funds rate from 3 percent to 2.75 percent.
This expectation reached a fever pitch after the weak employment data for September was reported Oct. 2 and investors bought Treasury bills and short term notes, driving the prices up and the yields down.
When the Fed did not act, the disappointment was pronounced and the selling swift. By Tuesday, the discount rate on three-month bills had jumped to 3.02 percent from 2.73 percent on Oct. 1.
Another factor has been the approach of what traders call new supply -- the regular monthly auction of two-year and five-year notes next week and the much bigger quarterly auction of three-year and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds in November after the election.
While the amount auctioned has not changed that much recently, dealers who bid in Treasury auctions still have to sell the old stock of Treasury securities on their shelves to make room for the new ones. And in a market that is already vulnerable, this selling can have a strong downward force. (Yesterday the Treasury announced it would sell $10.75 billion of five-year notes and $15 billion of two-year notes, slightly more than last month.)
Some traders also noted that if there was so much fear of Mr. Clinton's programs the spread or differential between the yield on the 30-year bond and shorter maturities would have increased, which often is a good measure of unsettling political or economic worries.
But in October, those spreads have narrowed. The 30-year bond to 10-year note differential fell to 87 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, yesterday, down from 108 basis points Oct. 1.

HEADLINE: 'Baby Bell' To Offer TV Service

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 21

 BODY:
The Bell Atlantic Corporation announced plans today to develop what amounts to an electronic video-rental store, which would enable shoppers at home to dial up movies or television programs over ordinary telephone lines.
Technology developed by Bellcore, the research consortium owned by the seven regional Bell companies, makes possible a telephone system that may compete with cable television systems much more rapidly than experts had previously predicted. 
 Until recently, most experts assumed that telephone companies needed to replace their old-fashioned copper wires with optical fibers -- a job expected to cost between $100 billion and $400 billion nationwide -- before they could transmit television to customers at home. But Bellcore has developed a technology for transmitting a single channel of high-quality video over ordinary copper telephone lines.
 
Video on Demand
 The new technology represents a narrower approach than cable television companies currently use in offering video selections to the customer. Bell officials say that instead of sending dozens of channels to every subscriber, as cable companies do, the technology will make it possible for them to offer movies or programs one at a time, at the customer's request.
Viewers will not be able to flip casually around the dial between cooking shows, horror movies and reruns of "Kojak." Nor will they be able to watch live television, like the Cable News Network or a World Series game, because the system needs time to convert video images into digital form and store them in a giant "server" computer.
But Bell Atlantic officials say the technology will allow them to introduce a "video on demand" service that allows customers to browse from a potentially huge library of offerings and pick precisely when they want to watch their selections.
From an economic standpoint, the technology allows the telephone company to offer television service without having to rip up its existing wires. Bell Atlantic, whose phone companies provide service in New Jersey and other Middle Atlantic states, as well as Washington, said it would start a test system next summer involving 400 employees.
The company said it hoped to begin commercial introduction of the service in 1994. In the test system, viewers will be able to pick from a menu of about 100 programs and choose precisely when they want to watch them.
The new service marks the latest in a frenzy of new experiments to provide video-on-demand over telephone or cable networks. In New York City, the Nynex Corporation recently teamed up with Liberty Cable Television on a plan to deliver video-on-demand by running fiber-optic lines directly to a handful of apartments.
In Denver, U S West has joined forces with A.T.& T. and Tele-Communications Inc. to test such services over Tele-Communications' coaxial cables. And Bell Atlantic, in a previously announced experiment for Loudon County, Va., is working with the local cable company to test a "fiber to the curb" system.
But the system that Bell Atlantic announced today could speed up the race considerably, if it is successful, because it would allow telephone companies to jump into the fray without replacing thousands of miles of copper wire.
Yet many questions remain unanswered. No one knows who will make the huge computer jukeboxes that store and provide all the programming, and no one knows how costly they will be.
 
Demand, and Costs, Uncertain
 The market prospects are also unclear. Cable television systems are using fiber-optic technology to greatly increase the number of channels they can offer, allowing them to approximate video-on-demand by simply repeating programs many times a day. And satellite direct-broadcast services are also on the horizon, further increasing the competition for entertainment dollars.
Bell Atlantic officials refused to disclose how much money they plan to invest or how quickly they hope to deploy the new technology. Nor have they said which companies they hope will build the equipment or supply the programming. The Federal Communications Commission recently allowed telephone companies to provide what it called "video dial tone" service, but F.C.C. regulations still bar them from owning more than 5 percent of a programmer.
Such uncertainties notwithstanding, Bell Atlantic officials said they were committed to entering the market.
"This is the future of our business," said Arthur Bushkin, president of the company's Bell Atlantic Information Services unit. "The level of corporate commitment is complete and total."
As envisioned, video programs would be transformed into digital code using the same mathematical techniques used to store music on compact disks. The material would then be stored on a huge computer, which would in turn be linked by high-speed lines to central office switches operated by the local telephone company.
Company officials said the key innovation, developed at Bellcore, is a method of sharply increasing the capacity of ordinary copper phone lines for the last leg of the trip, from neighborhood switching stations to individual homes. New communication devices, akin to very high-speed computer modems, would be installed at both the switching stations and in each customer's home.
But industry analysts remained cautious. "This is a long process," said Daniel P. Reingold, a telephone analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company. "It's not going to happen overnight."
"It is very much a black box," added Gary Arlen, a consultant in Bethesda, Md., who specializes in so-called interactive television technologies. "It could be very expensive to develop. We just don't know yet."

HEADLINE: Uncovered Short Sales Reach High on Big Board

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
The New York Stock Exchange reported yesterday that the number of shares sold short and not covered had reached an all-time high between mid-September and mid-October, continuing a run-up that so far has lasted seven straight months.
At the end of the period, on Oct. 15, the short positions stood at 948.3 million shares, up 4.5 percent from the 907.5 million shares reported in the previous month. With that increase, short interest has jumped an astounding 34 percent since the monthly increases began in mid-March. 
 The short interest figures are widely watched on Wall Street because they act as a gauge of investor sentiment, reflecting a growing pessimism among some investors about the condition of the markets and the economy.
Professional short-sellers make their money scouting out companies whose shares they consider overvalued. They borrow these shares and sell them, essentially making a bet that the stock will fall and they will be able to buy back the shares at a lower price.
The growth in uncovered short sales did not spread to the American Stock Exchange, where short interest continued a decline that began the month before. The number of shares sold short dropped by 2.1 percent in the month that ended on Oct. 15, ending with 69.1 million shares, compared with 70.6 million in the previous month.
Despite the abandon with which short-sellers dived into the Big Board listings during the month, most of these traders were said to have been hurt badly by poorly timed bets.
"A lot of shorts are suffering a lot of pain right now,," said Steve Kibbey, a vice president of Centurion Capital in La Jolla, Calif. "If this market were to really jump, that high short interest could really turn into fuel that pushes it even more" as short-sellers rush to buy stocks to cover their positions.
A large part of the problem for short-sellers in the period was the recognition of how well such investors did last month. In that period, which also set a record, many short- sellers made a lot of money because of falling prices. That success enticed more investors to sell short this month -- when fewer of the heavily shorted stocks moved down.
"A lot of guys came in after early October," Mr. Kibbey said. "And the guys who came to the party late are, at least at this point in time, suffering the most."
Even some of the recent favorites among short-sellers proved to be traps during the month. For example, the U.S. Surgical Corporation, a maker of surgical equipment that has been a profitable short for months, got its revenge in the most recent period. The stock, which was trading as low as $57 a share earlier in October, closed yesterday at $69.875, down 50 cents. But the short interest in the stock climbed during the month, to 5.5 million, from 4.9 million in the previous period.

Prices of Energy Decline On Weak Demand Outlook

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Energy prices sank yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid perceptions that demand is too weak to make a dent in the current abundant supply of oil and natural gas.
Philip Verleger, a visiting fellow at the Institute for International Economics, said the oil market was slumping because of widespread economic weakness coupled with projections for higher production. 
 On Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute reported that United States crude oil stocks rose a sharp 3.65 million barrels in the latest week, while heating oil stocks declined. Also pressuring prices were persistent rumors that Iraq would resume export sales embargoed since the Gulf War and that OPEC production would increase in the fourth quarter.
"Over all, there is a background factor of rising OPEC production," said Andrew Lebow of E.D.& F. Man.
December crude oil lost 44 cents to close at $21.61 a barrel on the Nymex; November unleaded gasoline fell 0.63 cent, to 58.72 cents a gallon, and November heating oil dipped 1.56 cents, to 62.65 cents a gallon.
Oil experts said the depth of the price retreat would hinge on how cold the weather turns as winter nears in the Northern Hemisphere.
The 10-month bull market in natural gas, in which prices more than doubled, shows signs of exhaustion. November natural gas lost 8.3 cents, to close at $2.488 per million British thermal units. December closed off 6.1 cents, at $2.378.
December coffee reacted to the slowdown in exports from Brazil to settle up 0.35 cent, at 65.20 cents a pound. The Brazilian Government has cut coffee sales abroad due to internal price incentives.
At the Chicago Board of Trade, December soft red wheat led a decline, dropping 4 cents to close at $3.50 a bushel against a dismal export scene.
Speculation that the United States Department of Agriculture will reject another Russian bid for 1.6 million metric tons of wheat and that China will delay its long-awaited wheat tender until after the United States elections put pressure on wheat prices.
December corn closed off 2 1/2 cents, to $2.07 3/4 a bushel, and November soybeans ended down 2 1/2 cents, to $5.43 3/4 in the middle of the harvest season, which is pointing to record crop yields.

HEADLINE: I.R.S. Details Withholding On Retirement Withdrawals

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 21

 BODY:
Workers who take early withdrawals from employer-sponsored retirement plans will be subject to tax withholding even if the money is needed for an emergency, the Internal Revenue Service has ruled.
The I.R.S. said Congress had given it no authority to allow a hardship exclusion, even though many pre-retirement withdrawals are made to pay medical costs and meet other emergencies. Other workers take an early withdrawal when they change jobs. 
 The announcement was made on Tuesday as the I.R.S. proposed regulations spelling out how a new law imposing 20 percent withholding on lump-sum pension distributions from 401(k), profit-sharing and other retirement plans would be administered.
The law was passed in July to help finance an extension of jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed. The regulations will take effect on Jan. 1, but they could be amended after an I.R.S. hearing scheduled for Jan. 15.
 
20% to Be Withheld
 The new law requires employers to withhold for taxes 20 percent of lump-sum distributions unless the money is shifted directly into a new pension or an individual retirement account.
Under the old law, a person could take a lump-sum distribution once a year and incur no immediate tax liability or penalty so long as the money was rolled over into another I.R.A. or pension account within 60 days. Any money not rolled over is subject to immediate taxation, plus a 10 percent penalty if the withdrawal is by a person under 59 1/2 years of age.
Some tax experts expressed surprise that the I.R.S. did not allow special treatment of hardship withdrawals. But Andy Zuckerman of the accounting firm Grant Thornton in Washington said the real problem is the new law, not the I.R.S. regulation.
"If you withdraw, have 20 percent withheld and later decide to put the money into an I.R.A. or into a plan of another employer, you'd only have 80 percent to roll over and you'd have to write a check for the remainder," Mr. Zuckerman said today.
On the other hand, he said, "it probably will cause people to leave the money in their retirement plan longer."
"If you consider taking the money to buy that Corvette or take that vacation," he said, "this will force you to realize you are losing 20 percent right off the bat unless you roll it over."

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Tax-Exempt Funds Off; Taxable Yields Are Up

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields were mixed in the latest seven-day period ended yesterday, as IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report surveyed more than 862 tax-exempt and taxable money market funds. Tax-exempt funds had lower yields, while taxable funds posted slight gains.
The decline in tax-exempt yields came from strong investor demand for short-term municipal debt, which drove prices higher and yields lower. But the pattern is likely to reverse itself as investor appetite diminishes, forcing prices down and yields higher, and the supply of new issues begins to outpace demand. 
 Assets of tax-exempt money funds increased by $149 million for the week, to a total $96.9 billion, with the average number of days left to maturity of securities in fund portfolios down one, to 66, IBC/Donoghue's analysts said.
The seven-day average compounded yield fell to 2.15 percent from 2.33 percent last week and simple yield fell to 2.13 percent, from 2.31 percent.
The 30-day average, which reflects any rise or decline over a much longer period of time, is still showing the drop in yields from cash pouring into the money funds. But analysts expect yields to rebound some and move up in the next couple of weeks as the cash influx is absorbed.
For the 30-day period, the compounded yield is down to 2.47 percent, from 2.56 percent in the previous week. The simple yield is down to 2.44 percent, compared with 2.53 percent.
Not assuming state taxes, this means that the taxable equivalent of the seven-day compounded yield is about 3.23 percent for investors in the 28 percent tax bracket and 3.38 percent for investors in the 31 percent tax bracket.
In its survey of tax-exempt funds with assets greater than $100 million, IBC/Donoghue's said the Strong Municipal Money Market Fund, distributed by Strong/Corneliuson Capital Management Inc. in Milwaukee, was the best-performing fund, with a yield of 2.81 percent.
Assets of taxable money market funds grew by $6.4 billion, to $493.7 billion. Institutional money funds accounted for much of the growth, as their assets rose by $4.7 billion, to a total $174.1 billion and retail assets grew by $1.7 billion, to $319.6 billion.
Walter S. Frank, chief economist for IBC/Donoghue, says there was still a chance for another easing by the Federal Reserve. But he does not expect it to happen until after the Presidential election, when the next employment report is due. "How well the markets receive the next rate cut, if it comes, will depend on who was elected into the Oval Office," Mr. Frank said.
 
Taxable Yield: 2.83%
 The average seven-day compounded yield for a taxable money market fund was 2.83 percent, up from 2.81 percent last week, and the simple yield was 2.79 percent, up from 2.77 percent.
Over a 30-day period the average compounded yield is 2.86 percent, down from 2.88 percent a week ago; the simple yield is 2.82 percent, down from 2.84 percent.
Analysts said the average days left to maturity of securities in taxable portfolios fell by one, to 64. The Standby Reserve Fund, distributed by Cowen & Company in New York, was the top returner among general purpose funds with a yield of 3.80 percent. For government-only funds with assets under $100 million, the United Services Government Securities Savings fund, distributed by United Services in San Antonio, was tops at 3.99 percent.
The average yield on bank money market accounts fell to 2.80 percent this week, from 2.82 percent last week.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Mixed on Questions About German Rate Moves

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mixed yesterday on world currency markets, buffeted by speculation over whether Germany will cut its interest rates.
Gold prices posted slight gains worldwide. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $344.10 an ounce, up 30 cents from Tuesday. Republic National Bank said gold rose 15 cents an ounce to a late bid of $343.75. 
 The dollar initially fell after comments by a Bundesbank official, who warned against excessive expectations that the German central bank would cut interest rates. Lower German rates would help the dollar by making dollar-denominated securities more attractive to investors.
Those comments sent the dollar lower in Europe. But when trading shifted to the United States, the scene turned around. Word that the Austrian central bank had cut its interest rates, a move that typically precedes a cut in German rates, helped lure traders back to the dollar.
The dollar ended the United States session near its highs for the day in relatively active trading.
Andrew Busch, a trader with Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago, warned, however, that the dollar would remain volatile until a clear trend in the direction of European interest rates is firmly established.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 122.38 Japanese yen, from 121.00 yen at Tuesday's close. Later, in London, it fell to 121.75 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 122.60 yen, up from 122.50 yen on Tuesday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.6140 from $1.6225 late Tuesday. In New York it cost $1.6067 to buy one pound, down from $1.6245 on Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.5195 German marks, up from 1.5160; 1.3575 Swiss francs, up from 1.3570; 5.1575 French francs, up from 5.1435; 1,335.00 Italian lire, up from 1,333.50, and 1.2399, up from 1.2398.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's rates included: 1.5075 German marks, down from 1.5205; 1.3480 Swiss francs, down from 1.3605; 5.1186 French francs, down from 5.1550; 1.6975 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7110; 1,329.75 Italian lire, down from 1,335.00; 1.2378 Canadian dollars, unchanged.
Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $344.35 an ounce, up from $343.85 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, the metal rose to a closing bid of $343.70 from $343.40. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.08 to $343.68.

Profits for Times Mirror and Knight-Ridder

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The Times Mirror Company said yesterday that its earnings increased 6.8 percent in the third quarter, although a drop in advertising revenues at The Los Angeles Times was a drag on the company's results.
Meanwhile, Knight-Ridder Inc. said its third-quarter profits rose 11 percent, in large part a result of increased advertising at The Miami Herald after Hurricane Andrew. 
 Following are details of the two companies' results:
 
Times Mirror
 Times Mirror said its net income for the latest quarter increased to $43.8 million, or 34 cents a share, compared with $41 million, or 32 cents a share, in the 1991 third quarter. Revenues rose 2.8 percent, to $914.4 million, from $889.5 million a year earlier.
"The strong financial performance in the third quarter of all business segments, except newspaper publishing, was sufficient to offset the earnings declines in our newspaper operations," said Robert Erburu, chairman and chief executive.
He said the Los Angeles-based company was concerned about the weak economy in Southern California and its effect on advertising volume for The Los Angeles Times.
The newspaper publishing unit posted a decline of 2 percent in third-quarter revenues, as a result of the drop in advertising at The Times.
Broadcast television revenues jumped 20 percent, while cable television revenues grew 10 percent, and revenues at the book and magazine unit rose 7 percent.
Times Mirror also publishes Newsday and New York Newsday, The Baltimore Sun and other newspapers.
Times Mirror's shares gained 62.5 cents yesterday, to close at $30.625, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Knight-Ridder
 Knight-Ridder said its third-quarter earnings increased to $31.4 million, or 57 cents a share, compared with $28.3 million, or 54 cents a share, a year earlier. The Miami-based company said revenues at its newspaper unit edged up 2.5 percent, to $469.2 million. It reported total revenues of $564.9 million, up 3.9 percent from $544.4 million a year earlier.
 "This was the best year-to-year newspaper advertising revenue performance we have seen since 1990," said Robert Singleton, chief financial officer. "However, we have not seen any clear signal that the end of the recession is at hand."
He said that when the hurricane hit Florida, The Miami Herald became the main "community bulletin board" and the primary means for insurance, electric and telephone companies to communicate with stricken people in south Dade County.
Knight-Ridder's shares fell $1 yesterday, to close at $57, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Refereeing The Blame Game

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
"THE economy, dummy," reads the now-famous sign in Clinton headquarters, an unsubtle reminder of where the candidate's main chance lies. Even President Bush seems to agree that he has hopelessly botched the recession thing: If re-elected, he has promised to pack his senior economic advisers onto the first Learjet leaving town.
But reality is more elusive. While independent analysts might not give Mr. Bush high marks for bravery, few claim that his decisions seemed foolish at the time, or that the recession on his watch has been more debilitating than those of the 1970's and 80's. Nor, for that matter, do many think that the long-term economic prognosis is really worse today than in the what-me-worry 1980's. 
 A more plausible explanation for the public's wrath is that the recession has served as an overdue catalyst, diminishing expectations long after the events that foretold stagnating living standards. Plainly, whoever is elected on Nov. 3 is going to have a tough time coping with the disillusionment.
Could George Bush have spared Americans 7.5 percent unemployment -- and spared himself the unusual role of incumbent Republican underdog? Perhaps, if he had boldly negotiated a credible deficit reduction deal with Congress in the first months of his Presidency, and then persuaded the Federal Reserve to turbocharge the money supply. Perhaps, if he had gone against the advice of traditional conservatives early this year by jumping at Congressional feelers for a bipartisan, budget-busting fiscal stimulus.
But hindsight is a test that Americans in a more forgiving mood would not apply. And in any case, the employment hole that Mr. Bush was an accomplice to digging was not very deep -- at least not by the standards of the 1974-75 and 1981-82 recessions. Why, then, is the President in such serious danger of receiving a pink slip with his next pay check?
John Taylor, a Stanford University economist who worked in the Bush White House, believes that voters have simply lost perspective. He points out that "the last recession was so long ago, few people remember it was far worse."
Alan Blinder of Princeton, rumored to be in line for an economics post in a Clinton White House, is less charitable. He notes that this recession started, and seems to be ending, with a whimper. Thus, while it was no deeper than the average recession, the periods of high unemployment on each end have been longer and more demoralizing -- indeed, the end of what Mr. Blinder dubs "the growth depression" is not yet in clear sight.
Both the Taylor and Blinder arguments complement a broader theory, one that traces today's voter malaise to a long-delayed recognition of the slowdown in productivity growth in the mid-1970's.
Certainly the Ford and Carter one-term Presidencies were victims of what proved to be a halving of productivity growth from the postwar norm of 3 percent a year. But Paul Krugman of M.I.T., another Clintonaut-in-waiting, notes that the downward shift in the long-term trend in those years was obscured by two nasty recessions.
And if anyone was trying to sell the idea of a chronic drag on productivity, hardly anyone outside the ivory tower was listening. Indeed, President Reagan's supporters were peddling just the opposite view, successfully attributing everything bad that happened before the trough of the recession in 1982 to Jimmy Carter, and everything good that happened after to a Reagan-induced supply-side miracle.
And therein, paradoxically, may lie the origins of George Bush's undoing. Measured from 1982 to the peak of the economic cycle in 1989, median family income grew by about 12 percent -- in sharp contrast to the slight decline in the Bush years. But measured from peak to peak (1979 to 1989), as most economists would recommend, median family incomes rose a scant 4 percent. And if Mr. Bush, heir to the Reagan political coalition, were in a position to tarnish the halo of The Big Guy, his own record could have been cast in far more sympathetic light.
David Hale of Kemper Financial Services suggests that the ironies run even deeper. President Bush's ability to fight the recession has been hamstrung by chronic budget deficits, which made fiscal stimulus problematic, and the savings and loan debacle, which has led to an implosion of bank credit. But while both evil flowers blossomed during the Reagan years, Mr. Reagan paid no political price for either. To the contrary: Both the tax cuts that led to the $4 trillion debt and the real estate boom that was fed by deregulated, run-amuck lenders, generated windfalls in personal income that postponed the day of reckoning on productivity.
Where does that leave the next President? With a giant productivity problem no one really knows how to solve, and an even bigger political problem. The best hope, perhaps, is that the productivity gods who laughed with Ronald Reagan and laughed at George Bush will roll up their sleeves and get back to work.

HEADLINE: POOL-HOPPING WITH: Kelly Klein;
Reflecting A Lovely World

BYLINE: By ALEX WITCHEL

 BODY:
WAITING, in the back of a limousine half a block long, is Kelly Klein. She sits behind the blackout windows, hands folded, thoroughly composed. Escape? No. Obsession? Never. Her signature fragrance could only be Serenity.
Mrs. Klein, who has been married to the designer Calvin Klein for five years, is showroom perfect in a dark brown sweater, dark olive jacket, dark taupe pants and dark brown suede shoes -- which would make most women look like an algae-covered mudslide. But the earth tones pick up on her tawny hair, which complements her moderate tan, which highlights her mind-boggling ring. Part of her collection of the Duchess of Windsor's jewels (Mrs. Klein was pictured last year in Vogue wearing the Duchess's pearls with jeans), the double-banded gold ring surrounding emerald-cut diamonds was given the name "Eternity" by Prince Edward when he presented it to Wallis Simpson. Which is how Mr. Klein's Eternity fragrance got its name. 
 The only item that matches her eyes, a remarkable sky blue, is lying on the seat opposite. It is "Pools," her new $100 coffee-table book of vintage and contemporary pool photographs (Alfred A. Knopf), which will be in stores next month. It takes up the whole seat.
Mrs. Klein, who is 35 years old, is a novice at solo publicity, which is hard enough for those with more practice. But over all, she just doesn't seem used to talking to strangers. Her conversation shows her world to be a small and safe place that operates on an almost childlike premise that everything will be all right. She's something like the good family china -- expensive, beautiful and only out on special occasions.
Born in Michigan, raised in Westport, Conn., until she was 10, Mrs. Klein then moved to Manhattan, where she attended the Dwight School. "At one point, when I was very young, my family had a lot of money," she once told Vanity Fair. "Then, I don't know, it just seemed to disappear." To the extent that she worked part time after school to help pay for her horse's upkeep. Her parents divorced when she was 10. Her father, a former director of television commercials, lives in Middleburg, Va., where he is also an avid rider. The day after graduating from the Fashion Institute of Technology, in 1977, she began work as a design assistant to Ralph Lauren, where she stayed for five years before going to Calvin Klein, in the same position.
The small amount of personal information published about her says she collects glass on the beach, her maiden name is Rector, she owns two horses and a $50,000 Hermes saddle and her mother is part American Indian. Mrs. Klein, who will turn 36 on Nov. 2, decided to assemble "Pools" three years ago, after discovering there were no books to refer to when she and Mr. Klein were considering a pool for their home in East Hampton.
Today, she is revisiting two of the pools that are in the book. The first is at the West Side Y.M.C.A., on West 63d Street, the second at the home of a friend in Greenwich, Conn.
"The pool at the Y. is quite beautiful, though I don't think I would swim in it," she says. "Uhm," she adds uncertainly, "you don't have to say I wouldn't. I just don't swim in public places. Since I was a child I only swam at someone's house." She sighs. "It's not about swimming, anyway. It's about design."
She tries again: "Actually, my most favorite pool in New York, which I would die to swim in, is at the New York Athletic Club, with that chic 1920's great style. Women have just been allowed there, but they wouldn't let us photograph it. They're so uptight."
Alighting from the limo -- and truly, she alights -- Mrs. Klein heads into the lobby of the Y.M.C.A., which reeks of chlorine. The harried receptionist, sporting smeared makeup and three inches of roots, looks up. "Are you interested in joining?" she asks while a handsome young man in roller skates, who knows exactly who Mrs. Klein is, laughs out loud.
She remains calm, striding up the stairs toward the office of the marketing director, who shows the way to the adult pool, decorated with tiles that were a gift from the King of Spain in 1930. Then on to the children's pool, which is even more dazzling, in an elaborate scheme of blue, yellow and white. "Can you imagine children walking in here?" Mrs. Klein asks. "All this blue." Her eyes open unnaturally wide, as if trying to feel the color.
The marketing director, buoyed by the interest, points out the original stained glass in the windows. "Oh, yes?" Mrs. Klein says, already through the door. "Very festive.""
Back in the limo, Greenwich bound, Mrs. Klein says: "When I started, it was strictly a beautiful book on pools. But my vision was broadened by old archival photos from the 1920's and 30's and I thought how fabulous to mix them in with contemporary pool pictures."
She leafs through the book, past her five-page introduction and the foreword by Esther Williams, caressing each spectacular photograph with a hypnotic circular motion. "They're replacing chlorine now in pools," she says, "using an ozone process where water recycles through copper coils and cleanses itself and filters back. I don't really know how it works, but a lot of people in L.A. are doing it."
Mrs. Klein says she contacted between 300 and 400 photographers for the book. "Then I added fashion, which is my background, and it sort of all fell into place," she continues. "I did the book as if I were creating a collection of clothing, where you buy fabric, put it into different silhouettes, make 100 outfits, send the girls down the runway to take a look and edit out what's not that interesting. This book started with 3,000 photos, which I edited to the best 200 in a sequence that flowed from beginning to end."
But $100 in a recession, for pictures of pools, no matter how beautiful? Even Madonna's new coffee table book, "Sex," is only $49.95. "I want people to buy 'Pools' because they need help," Mrs. Klein says. "It is for architects, for the woman who lives in the country who wants to know about color, shape, materials. When I thought about a pool, my architect said there were no books, even though everyone always asks for one. Everyone needs one."
"I also wanted to do what I could for AIDS, so I'm donating all my profits," she says. "I wanted this book to have a lot of style. I wanted it to be expensive, printed on beautiful paper. And Knopf came through for me. I had no complaints. I'm proud of this book." Her tone is plaintive. "It's not a $39.95 coffee-table book," she adds. "It's better printed. It has a lot of color, and black and white. I wasn't interested in doing a book that was $39."
The car has arrived at the gate of the Greenwich home of Vince and Kristen Camuto. Mrs. Klein rides horses with Mrs. Camuto. The house resembles a European chateau and Mrs. Klein says that the pool, which is cut into rock, forming a partial cave set off by columns, was inspired by a villa in Florence. Mrs. Camuto comes onto the terrace, briefly, in her riding garb with her three-year-old towheaded son. It's like falling into a page of Town and Country.
Mrs. Klein takes off her jacket and lies on an evergreen chaise longue near the pool. She is very at home here. You might guess that anyone sitting in direct sunlight wearing a cashmere sweater would sweat. Mrs. Klein does not.
Two uniformed maids appear with trays of tea, turkey sandwiches and huge raspberry-filled cookies. Mrs. Klein picks the turkey off the bread with her fingertips and eats it, then pinches crumbs off her cookie.
Now that the book presentation is over, she is supremely relaxed. She's good at girl talk, loose and confident. There's something compelling and finally attractive about someone so genuinely sheltered, because it feeds the universal longing for a happy ending. Remote, yet possible.
Her clothes alone are every woman's fantasy. "I have amazing clothes," she agrees. "I have an amazing closet. It's a bedroom, actually. Though sometimes I wish I was married to a plumber so I would have beautiful sinks and tubs. I've always been interested in clothes. I always loved to get dressed, to put colors together." Given how competitive the fashion world is, does she wear only Calvin Klein? "Well, I have some antique clothes," she says. "But I don't wear other designers."
"I am Calvin's muse," she continues. "He designs everything for me. I happen to be very American, look very American. That helps, to fit right into his sense of design and style. I love him. I love everything he does. He's just the best guy in the world. I never felt threatened by his success and fame. I've only learned from it. It's made me independent, stronger. So, I'm happy I can wear his clothes and look as beautiful in them as I do. I'm flattered by that, really."
Mrs. Klein keeps an office at Calvin Klein, though she no longer works there full time. "I did this book because I felt that it was time for me to do something on my own and step away," she says. "We're together 24 hours a day, living and working, and we do it well. But it is important to be passionate about other things that are your own. The book became my passion."
Has she ever considered the possibility that the book might not be well received, that it might be reviewed poorly, or not at all, or that it just might not sell?
"I don't think that way," she says. "I love this book and believe in it. I hope other people feel that way, and if not, O.K. I had the courage to do this. I can't have fears. I'm not a writer, I'm a visual person. I'm not about words. I just never worried this book wasn't going to work."
Has she ever had disappointment in her life? Sitting here now, contentedly licking cookie crumbs from her fingers, the prospect seems absurd.
She thinks. "When I don't win in the horse show," she says. "I like to win, but if the animal is not having a good day, or I'm off, it's hard to make it work. It's a very hard sport. It's about appearance and performance, so you have to be as beautiful and perfect as possible. I love the way the horse and the people look all dressed up. I forget about everything else in my life, the tensions of New York."
Mrs. Klein says she wakes up at 5:30 A.M. five days a week, meditates, then skims the papers. She runs to her gym and works out with her personal trainer. Then she runs home. Depending on how crowded her work schedule is, she either goes to the office or rides her horses, Gratis and Navajo, in northern Westchester. Mr. Klein often works until 8 P.M., she says, and in the evenings they either attend black-tie benefits, eat out, or order in sushi.
As for children, Mrs. Klein says: "I don't wake up thinking about them. I like my job, riding horses and traveling with Calvin. I don't want to give that up. I'll be 36 soon, so I'll have to take my chances. There's nothing wrong with adopting, either." She is already a stepmother to Marci Klein, Mr. Klein's 26-year-old daughter, who is a talent coordinator for "Saturday Night Live."
Though she does not yet have another idea for a book, Mrs. Klein says she would like to do another soon. As for her own reading, she says she likes anything by Dominick Dunne, loved Josephine Hart's "Damage" and is drawn to biographies.
"I like reading about people with interesting lives," she says. "Like Princess Di. I loved that book, the one with the white cover where she's wearing the white dress. I felt so sorry for her. The poor thing is completely miserable. I mean, as long as it was all true. I hate people's speculation."

HEADLINE: WORLD SERIES;
A Rocky Off Season Lies Ahead for the A's

BYLINE: By MICHAEL MARTINEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif.

 BODY:
Their season ended a week ago, but it was not the kind of exit that the Oakland Athletics expected, not for a team that was as close as it gets to a dynasty in baseball these days. They were hooted in Toronto, beaten back by the Blue Jays and ushered out of a return to the World Series with a resounding shove.
Now, they are likely to be dismantled by the bottom line. 
 It is still too soon to know what the winter will bring, but the directive sent by the A's ownership to Sandy Alderson, the general manager, is unmistakable: reduce a $42 million payroll by as much as $12 million.
Because the A's will have as many as 15 possible free agents on the market once the season ends, they do not view the end of the World Series with much anticipation. And if the off season becomes another feeding frenzy for big names and bigger salaries, the Oakland Coliseum could become a wasteland next season.
The A's stand to lose such longtime notables as Dave Stewart, Mark McGwire and Terry Steinbach. Jose Canseco was traded in August. Carney Lansford announced his retirement after the team lost to the Blue Jays in the American League Championship Series. Others, such as Ruben Sierra, Mike Moore and Harold Baines, might also leave.
 
Back to Mediocre?
 Without them, the A's could drift back to a mediocrity they haven't known since before Tony La Russa became manager. In the last five seasons, they have won four division titles, three pennants and one World Series. They haven't drawn fewer than two million fans since 1987.
"We've lost significant amounts of money the last few years," Alderson said from Toronto. "Just look at the way our payroll has gone up, from $20 million two years ago to $39 million last year. This year, it will be in the $42 million range. Your payroll can't keep going up while, at the same time, your attendance is going down."
The A's have been so determined to keep salaries in check that they did not negotiate with anyone during the season except relief pitcher Dennis Eckersley, who signed a two-year extension for $7.8 million, far less than he would have attracted elsewhere. With the others, the A's chose to wait, gambling that the offers from other teams will not be as high as in previous winters.
 
Boils Down to Economics
 "It will all be dictated by economics," said Walt Jocketty, the team's director of baseball administration, "but I think some of them will be back. We're not going to strip the team down completely."
Alderson said that he, Jocketty and La Russa have not yet identified their top priorities, preferring to see what kinds of proposals other teams will place on the negotiating table. But the A's, who aren't expected to give more than three-year contracts, will clearly not be the first to make offers to anyone.
"How can I achieve our primary goal of getting the payroll down by jumping in right away?" Alderson asked. "What am I going to be pre-emptive with? If what we're reading is right about what certain players might earn, it might be difficult to bring them back."
The task is not a simple one for Alderson, who is regarded as one of the game's most astute executives. But as outfielder Dave Henderson said after the A's season concluded: "I figure we're going to see how good Sandy really is. Now he's got a chance to prove it. Our season is over. Sandy's is just beginning."
When he sorts out the mess, Alderson is very likely to pursue Steinbach, McGwire and Sierra, who came in the Canseco deal, in earnest. Those three, however, could cost as much as $14 million for one year. Stewart has expressed a desire to return, but the team may not offer him more than a one-season deal.
Lansford could be enticed to put off his retirement for one more summer if the offer is right. The A's can keep pitcher Mike Moore by offering arbitration, although he could win more from an arbitrator than he could on the free-agent market.
 
Cards Anyone?
 "There are so many variables," Alderson said. "This is a card game. We can't dictate what's going to happen."
In one way, though, the A's may have played some cards correctly. With the expansion draft scheduled next month, they will be able to keep some of the organization's younger players from being exposed. Free agents cannot be protected.
But youth is not necessarily the direction the A's will go if they lose on free agency this winter.
Alderson said that he may attempt to sign other free agents who would cost less than his own. "I wouldn't say there's an overabundance of talent ready to play in the major leagues," he said of his team's prospects, "but it doesn't mean we can't find other players out there."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
Democrats: Courting the Younger Generation

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

 BODY:
The Democratic National Committee on Tuesday began a $1 million advertising campaign aimed at younger voters. The 30-second spots, one feature a young man and the other a young woman, are appearing on the networks, geared to shows with younger audiences like "Beverly Hills 90210" and "Roseanne."
 
ON THE SCREEN White letters on black background: "A reality check. Jonathan."
Various images of young man named Jonathan, talking to camera, in the kitchen, looking through the newspaper classifieds, of his mother in the kitchen as he talks about living at home, snapshots of Jonathan with friends at graduation.
These words appear on screen: "The Democratic Plan: create new jobs, invest in people, develop new technologies."
Ends with these words on screen: "The Democratic Party. A plan that works for a change." 

PRODUCER Frank Greer/Mandy Grunwald
 
TELEVISION SCRIPT Jonathan: "Since I graduated I've done telemarketing, I was a bicycle messenger . . .
"I hope in the future to get a job in my field and from there start my own life, but there are no jobs. I feel trapped, having to live at home. The Republicans really do not know what the average American is going through.
"The Democratic plan is the plan that makes the most sense. I really believe that the Democrats would bring a lot of hope and enthusiasm to this country."
 
ACCURACY Nothing inherently inaccurate.
 
SCORECARD This so-called "generic" ad is paid for by the Democratic Party so it cannot directly mention Mr. Clinton or Mr. Bush. But it clearly repeated Mr. Clinton's central message: that he is the candidate of change. It seeks to lend authenticity to the message by using a young man who says he has been a direct casualty of the nation's economic woes. This is all part of a Democratic effort to win first-time voters and get them to the polls.

HEADLINE: D'Amato Serves as a Magnet for Funds

BYLINE: By JANE FRITSCH

 BODY:
It was an obscure provision buried deep in the arcane language of a 1,000-page trade bill, but Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato was on the case. A handful of sugar refiners, including one with a plant in Brooklyn, stood to gain $365 million in tariff rebates and Mr. D'Amato was all for it.
With his help, the provision squeaked through the Senate in the summer of 1987. That fall, five years before his next race, Mr. D'Amato received $8,500 in campaign contributions from the sugar refiners. 
 It is from such incidents that Mr. D'Amato, who has cultivated an image as a zealous guardian of constituents' interests, has also gained a reputation as one of the Senate's most aggressive and prolific fund-raisers.
 
Several Inquiries
 Over the last decade, he has collected more than $21 million, much of it from people or businesses with matters pending before one of the Senate committees on which he has served. His practices have gained such notoriety that they have led to several well-publicized investigations and have damaged his popularity.
But as Mr. D'Amato, a Republican, seeks a third term, his continued ability to amass a huge political fund has enabled him to run a fiercely competitive campaign against Attorney General Robert Abrams, a Democrat who is one of the state's all-time vote-getters. And Mr. D'Amato's fund has made it possible for Mr. D'Amato to wage a bold and expensive television campaign suggesting that Mr. Abrams has improperly accepted campaign contributions from people with business pending before his office. Mr. D'Amato has himself faced such criticism throughout his career.
With more than $9.4 million collected since his last election, Mr. D'Amato will vastly outspend Mr. Abrams, who has raised $5.4 million but was forced to spend much of it in the bitterly contested Democratic primary. Last Friday Mr. Abrams had $545,000 on hand, while Mr. D'Amato had about $2 million.
 
Television Ad Campaign
 Mr. D'Amato plans to spend every dollar of that money and thousands more expected from two fund-raising events next week, said Kieran Mahoney, his campaign manager. Nearly all the money will be used to pay for the television ad campaign, he said.
Some of the commercials echo the criticisms of a state commission that faulted Mr. Abrams three years ago for accepting donations from lawyers and real-estate investors who had business before his office. While Mr. Abrams was not accused of doing favors in return for contributions, the panel described such solicitation as "implicitly coercive." The commission focused only on state officials, so it did not review Mr. D'Amato's fund-raising.
Mr. Mahoney acknowledged that the D'Amato campaign has no general policy barring donations from people who are seeking help or legislation from the Senator. In fact, a review of Mr. D'Amato's campaign records shows a strong pattern of donations from businesses and people for whom Mr. D'Amato can provide critical assistance, whether on matters of parochial interest or broad public policy.
 
'Insultingly Preposterous'
 "The Senator fights hard for New York, and a lot of New Yorkers appreciate what he does," Mr. Mahoney said. He rejected as "insultingly preposterous" any suggestion that there is a relationship between campaign contributions and Mr. D'Amato's official actions. "We've helped hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers, some of whom we have never met," Mr. Mahoney said.
Over the years, the financial industry has provided the most money to Mr. D'Amato's campaigns, the records show. He has been a member of the Senate Banking Committee, where he has been a strong advocate for measures backed by the securities industry.
In 1985, when he was chairman of the securities subcommittee, Mr. D'Amato excluded from legislation he introduced a proposal that would have limited the purchase of junk bonds by federally regulated savings and loans. That same year, Drexel Burnham Lambert, then the top marketer of the high-risk securities, held a fund-raising reception for Mr. D'Amato at Chasen's restaurant in Beverly Hills. Drexel, now defunct, had opposed the junk-bond proposal.
Since his last election, Mr. D'Amato has accepted more than $300,000 from individuals who work for brokerages and investment banks, the records show.
A study by Public Citizen, a government watchdog group founded by Ralph Nader, showed that Mr. D'Amato has accepted $627,402 since he went to the Senate in 1981 from political action committees organized by securities and banking groups.
 
One of 8 Senators
 Mr. D'Amato was one of eight members of Congress made a target for defeat yesterday by Public Citizen, which asserted that Mr. D'Amato is improperly influenced by special-interest money. Mr. D'Amato "too often represents the lobbyists who pay for his campaigns, not the voters who sent him to Washington," said Craig McDonald, a spokesman for the group.
Mr. Mahoney, the D'Amato campaign manager, defended the Senator's championing of the securities firms, calling their health vital to the economy of New York because they provide thousands of jobs.
The Senator's relationship with Wall Street became a subject of an investigation by the Senate's Select Committee on Ethics after a complaint was filed by Mark Green, the New York City Consumer Affairs Commissioner, whom Mr. D'Amato defeated in the 1986 Senate election.
In a report released last year, the committee found that Mr. D'Amato violated neither Federal laws nor Senate rules in his handling of the junk bond legislation after he accepted the donations from Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1985. In regard to most of the 15 other allegations made by Mr. Green, the committee found "no credible evidence" that Mr. D'Amato had acted improperly.
But the committee did criticize him for "conducting the business of his office in an improper and inappropriate manner" by allowing his brother Armand to use it for lobbying activities. Armand D'Amato was indicted for mail fraud this year, accused of accepting $200,000 in unreported payments to lobby his brother on behalf of the Sperry Corporation and its successor, Unysis. He pleaded not guilty, and the Senator has said he was unaware of his brother's activities.
On one fund-raising issue involved whether Mr. D'Amato had helped win roughly $60 million in Federal housing authorizations for Eduardo Lopez Ballori, a developer in Puerto Rico who was indicted on a technical Federal charge involving $30,000 in illegal contributions to the Senator's campaign. At a trial last June, which ended in a hung jury, Mr. Lopez Ballori contended that he was unaware of regulations restricting his contributions.
The Senator, who said he was unaware of the improper contributions, donated the money to charity.
Mr. Lopez Ballori is to be retried shortly in San Juan.
The matter is one of several involving Mr. D'Amato, some of his contributors and fund-raisers, and the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, whose New York regional office was run for much of the 1980's by one of his proteges and contributors, Joseph Monticiollo.
 
Sugar in Brooklyn
 Employees of the office have testified before a Congressional committee or told reporters that Mr. Monticiollo and others in the H.U.D. office seemed to be pressing for favorable treatment for housing grants that would benefit such D'Amato supporters as a Great Neck, L.I., construction company called Jobco. Owners and employees of the company have contributed more than $5,000 to Mr. D'Amato and have held fund-raisers for him as well.
Mr. D'Amato has denied exerting pressure on behalf of contributors. Jobco officials have denied benefiting as well, citing H.U.D. work received before Mr. D'Amato's election.
In the 1987 debate over the proposal to benefit the sugar companies, Mr. D'Amato said the key issue was jobs for New York. He warned that the Domino Sugar refinery near the Williamsburg Bridge in Brooklyn would be shut down -- and 800 jobs would be lost -- if the provision was not enacted. Domino stood to gain $135 million in rebates of sugar import tariff, more than any other company.
Senator John H. Chafee, a Republican from Rhode Island, complained that the tax break was a "government handout of the most outrageous kind," but Mr. D'Amato, with assistance from the other New York Senator, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat, pushed the measure through the Senate.
Months later, the provision died in a conference committee because of opposition from the White House. Domino never got the rebate, but the Brooklyn plant remains open. No jobs were lost.
Mr. D'Amato has continued to champion the sugar industry, which has given him $12,800 more in campaign contributions since 1988.
 
Reviving the Specter of Mussolini

The most dramatic television commercial of Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato's campaign came in two versions last week: tough and tougher.
Ten days ago, the Republican Senator's campaign began running advertisements attacking his Democratic opponent, State Attorney General Robert Abrams, for calling him "a fascist." The ad shown to the press, and broadcast initially, used a narrator speaking over pictures of news clippings about Mr. Abrams's remark.
But the campaign acknowledged yesterday that, without notice, it had also used another, visually harsher version of the same script, over silent sepia-toned footage of Benito Mussolini exhorting a crowd. The Senator's spokeswoman, Zenia Mucha, said the first ad was made so quickly that the D'Amato team could not get the archival film it wanted, switched the commercials within 48 hours and simply forgot to alert reporters.
But a tape provided by the D'Amato camp shows the same production date stamped on both versions.
Ms. Mucha defended both yesterday, saying, "The only thing the ad was trying to say was where the word fascist originated from." Neither ad is on the air any longer; they have been replaced by a new ad whose tagline is: "Al D'Amato. Always fighting for us."

HEADLINE: If Clinton Wants a Democratic Foreign Policy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Few would quarrel with "The Clinton Doctrine" by A. M. Rosenthal (column, Oct. 6), which welcomes Gov. Bill Clinton's commitment to a more democratic foreign policy. More troubling is the unholy mix of sanctimony and cynicism with which Mr. Rosenthal -- and Governor Clinton -- reduce an important principle to a self-serving slogan.
Stung by past charges that they were dovish on defense, Democrats are looking for a way to criticize President Bush from the right. So they accuse him of coddling Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Saddam Hussein. 
 In fact, Mr. Bush continued Ronald Reagan's policy, which they too now advocate. A little history will make clear what that is. Up to Vietnam, the United States response to third world revolutions had been largely defensive: to support regimes with our money, arms and sometimes our troops. After that debacle -- and other unfavorable developments across the third world -- we decided it would be cheaper and more effective to support counterrevolutions.
Leftist third world governments made their share of mistakes. But they also faced armed rebels that we collected in an assortment of beleaguered democrats, ardent nationalists, ethnic separatists, former Communists, religious fundamentalists and former colonialist collaborators. We sponsored wars in Afghanistan, Angola, Nicaragua, to name a few.
Presidents Reagan and Bush are hardly guilty of having propped up Mr. Gorbachev. Our massive arms buildup did much to push the Soviet Union into terminal economic crisis. When our European allies wanted to meet Soviet reform with economic aid, we blocked this. Meanwhile, through Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty, the National Endowment for Democracy, the American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations and no doubt the Central Intelligence Agency, we supported the Soviet Union's breakup. Mr. Bush's facade of caution allowed him to strike lopsided arms agreements with a declining government.
The Reagan-Bush policy deserves credit for victory and the chaos it has brought. Mr. Rosenthal supports both Russian and Baltic nationalism. He seems not to notice that they are in conflict, with the Baltics disenfranchising Russians, and the Russians threatening the Baltics. Eastern and Western Europe are now the breeding ground of ethnic strife and a growing fascist movement.
The Clinton doctrine would intensify this crusade with Radio Free Asia and Radio Free China. It isn't clear how India or China can break up peacefully or what will happen to the mosaic of minorities across that continent and the world. In greater tolerance lies the beginning of wisdom. Meanwhile we show little regard for democratic movements that challenge our financial interests -- for example, in Mexico and Brazil.
If Mr. Clinton really wants a democratic foreign policy, it will have to be more than a self-serving crusade. He will have to open American policy to true reform of the United Nations Security Council, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank so that these reflect a diversity of interests and needs, rather than a projection of United States power.
He will have to address the twin problems of the environment and development, not only for the world's rich but also for its poor. Only when we demonstrate our commitment to freedom from hunger, disease and despair will our campaign for democracy be a reality that is worthy of the name.

HEADLINE: Trade Pact Can Aid Mexico, but Not Us

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Free Trade but With Time Bombs" (editorial, Oct. 6) discusses how some of Bill Clinton's proposed modifications of the North American Free Trade Agreement may scuttle it. You say the agreement "would simultaneously propel Mexico's pro-market reforms forward and raise living standards for U.S. consumers." I think most Americans understand the benefits the agreement would bring Mexico. But it is hard to see how it would benefit us.
Cheap Mexican labor and lower manufacturing costs make it sensible for American manufacturers to move plants to Mexico. But will the Americans who thus lose their jobs be able to buy the cheaper articles produced in Mexico or even articles produced in the United States? Lower-priced Mexican-manufactured goods don't help the unemployed. 
 It would take a long time for masses of Mexicans to become sufficiently affluent to buy more United States-manufactured goods. A dozen countries have already penetrated our markets; why couldn't they do the same in Mexico and Canada? Finally, affluent Mexicans will most likely buy Mexican goods, which their good times will let them produce themselves.

HEADLINE: Jobs Bond Proposal Will Assist New York

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Others have been telling us how they will improve our economy and quality of life, but New Yorkers can do it themselves with a yes vote Nov. 3 for Proposal 1, the jobs bond.
Proposal 1 will create jobs and lay the foundation for economic growth -- 24,000 immediate jobs, it is estimated, as infrastructure improvement projects proposed by local governments are undertaken under fast track procedures. Many projects could begin by the spring construction season. This work will also stimulate private development and expansion, resulting in 80,000 to 100,000 permanent private-sector jobs, adding about $10 billion to our economy. 
 At an annual cost of about $65 million, Proposal 1 will generate more than $120 million in new revenues annually for the state and localities, easing the strain on the state's budget and helping local governments meet community needs. These revenues will be used to revitalize urban areas and waterfronts, improve water quality and clean up polluted industrial sites.

HEADLINE: A Congressional Race Turns Into a Grudge Match

 BODY:
There may be no Congressional race anywhere this year that presents sharper political choices than the contest between Nita M. Lowey, a liberal incumbent Democratic Representative, and Joseph J. DioGuardi, a conservative Republican who represented the same district from 1985-88. After redistricting, the new 18th Congressional District that they both want to serve includes much of southern Westchester and a sliver of the Bronx and Queens.
The two last faced each other in 1988, when Mrs. Lowey unseated Mr. DioGuardi. That year, Mr. DioGuardi, who had defeated the liberal stalwart Bella S. Abzug in 1986, called Mrs. Lowey "Bella without a hat." Mrs. Lowey said Mr. DioGuardi was "just Dan Quayle without the good looks." The 1992 race took off from there. 
 The following are excerpts from interviews with both candidates this week by William Glaberson, a reporter for The New York Times.
 
Nita M. Lowey
 Q. Describe your opponent.
A. A far-right, radical, former failed member of Congress. Part of the Reagan-Bush failed policies.
Q. And you, he says, are among the 25 most liberal members of Congress.
A. If it means full funding of Head Start, if it means gun control, if it means criticizing China because of their atrocious human rights abuses, I'm proud of that progressive record.
Q. In 1988 you beat Mr. DioGuardi and he's here again. Some call it a grudge match. Is it?
A. It certainly is. People have rejected him. People don't want to go back to the past.
Q. Is abortion a critical issue in this race?
A. It is a defining issue because he is of the far right, most extreme position. I don't believe government should have a role in that very personal decision. I respect the rights of women to make their own choice.
Q. What is the single most important thing that needs to be done to get the economy moving again?
A.The most important thing we can do is invest in rebuilding our infrastructure. This will create jobs which will trigger economic activity in other areas. At the same time we have to continue to make tough choices to cut wasteful expenditures as I have. You have to cut and invest.
Q. Mr. DioGuardi says that in 1988 you pledged you wouldn't raise taxes. He says you voted to raise taxes at least nine, maybe 16 times. Is that your version of "Read my lips"?
A. First of all, I have never made foolish pledges of any kind because I'm dealing with reality. And we have important problems in this country that we need to address. And what we need is fairness, tax fairness, Mr. DioGuardi's record shows that he voted to raise 10 times, so again he's just talking.
Q. You're against the death penalty, but you voted for a Federal bill that includes the death penalty.
A. I voted for the crime bill, which is one of the toughest crime bills ever to come out and that did include the death penalty. I voted for it because I think it's so important that we take a strong position on getting crime off our streets.
Q. You voted against support of the Gulf war. Was that a mistake?
A. At the time I voted against the Gulf war I took the advice of seven former Secretaries of Defense. After the decison was made I supported the President, I supported the troops and I feel sad that the President didn't complete the job and remove Saddam Hussein from power. Hindsight is very easy. But at the time it was a very difficult decision and it was a vote of conscience.
Q. There is a mood in the country against negative campaigning, but this race has been marked by attacks by each side against the other. Are you proud of the way the race has been run?
A. I have presented my positive accomplishments on the economy and education and health care and crime and I'm proud of that. Mr. DioGuardi spews forth venom and rage and only wants to focus on the negative and, therefore, toward the end of the campaign I may have to refute the lies that he is giving the public.
 
Joseph J. DioGuardi
 Q. How would you describe the choices facing people in this district?
A. Joe DioGuardi is a certified public accountant, the only one ever elected in 215 years, a fiscal conservative who wants to get government off your backs and out of your pockets. Nita Lowey is a 100 percent certified public liberal.
Q. She says she is for the middle class. What is your view of what her record shows?
A. You have to see the way she comports herself. Number one, I believe she represents herself. She's a person who's got a big ego, a big pocketbook, who decided it was time to become a Congresswoman.
Q. What do you think is the major action that needs to be taken to spur the economy?
A. The Joe DioGuardi business-oriented, three-point plan: Number one: Reduce the capital gains tax to 10 percent. Next point: Not even think of raising taxes. Third: Control spending by a balanced budget amendment and a line-item veto.
Q. But Mrs. Lowey says you voted to raise taxes 10 times. Did you and would you vote to raise taxes again?
A. I would never even think of raising taxes. It's possible someone may have slipped in something. I doubt it.
Q. Do you think Mrs. Lowey made a mistake when she voted against support of the Gulf war?
A. It was a slap in the face of Israel. My record on Israel is unblemished.
Q. Mrs. Lowey says her first day of campaigning was marred by people tied to your campaign following her around and shouting on bullhorns. Her supporters call these "the DioGuardi goon squads." Are you proud of the way you have run the campaign?
A. Absolutely. But she grossly exaggerated what happened. No one put a bullhorn anywhere near her. Listen, when people want to express their First Amendment rights -- she's so proud to say that it's important to express your First Amendment rights she says you can burn the flag; she never spoke out when the Act Up group came into the Cathedral in front of the Cardinal and threw condoms on the floor along with the host. What's wrong with 30 people, constituents, joined with two of my people to show them where the district is, expressing their First Amendment rights?
Q. She said you spew forth venom and rage and that that you have presented lies to the public.
A. What is a negative campaign? Is perpetuating a lie a negative campaign or is telling the truth? I am telling the truth.
Q. You have the Right to Life line, as well as the Republican and Conservative ones. Do you think it's constructive to have the endorsement of a one-issue party?
A. While I don't believe one issue should determine a campaign, if you have constituents that feel so strongly about an issue -- as many do about this issue on both sides in this district-- then I think you want to send the signal. I believe that the word 'choice' has no place when you're talking about two lives in being. Would you use the word 'choice' for 'ethnic cleansing'?
Q. You support President Bush.
A. We can trust George Bush.

HEADLINE: LAW FAILS TO STEM ABUSE OF MIGRANTS, U.S. PANEL REPORTS

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 21

 BODY:
The law Congress enacted six years ago to combat illegal immigration has done nothing to stop exploitation of migrant farm workers, one of its principal objectives, a Government-appointed, bipartisan commission has found.
The panel, charged with assessing the law's impact on agriculture, confirms earlier reports that illegal immigration continues largely unchecked. The commission attributes the problem to lax enforcement, widespread fraud and the tenacity of people, mostly Mexicans, in fleeing severe unemployment at home for jobs in the United States.
 
Little Incentive to Improve
 Congress was both tough and benign in adopting the Immigration Reform and Control Act. To stop illegal immigration, the law established sanctions against employers who hire unauthorized workers, and it granted amnesty to three million workers who could show they had worked at least 90 days in agriculture in the United States in the year ending May 1, 1986. But inadvertently, the law also gave birth to a bustling market in counterfeit documents that has undermined the objectives of the law. 
 The resulting tide of new illegal immigrants who possess phony documents and who accept substandard working conditions leaves employers with little incentive to improve those conditions. Unless a document is obviously bogus, it is evidence enough to protect an employer from the law's sanctions, ranging from a $100 fine for sloppy bookkeeping to six months in prison. Indeed, if an employer is overly cautious and demands additional proof from a worker who turns out to be legal, the employer risks being charged with discrimination.
 
Less and Less Effective
 The law's failings are most apparent in agriculture, the focus of the commission's scrutiny. The migrant and seasonal farm labor force is the easiest place for illegal immigrants to find work, and agriculture, especially labor-intensive fruit and vegetable farming, is the industry most dependent on them.
The commission's study, the most comprehensive look at the impact of the immigration law, will be submitted to Congress early next year.
The final draft of the study says that with fraud increasing the law is becoming less and less effective. Beefing up enforcement and making changes in the law can help slow the immigration.
The study proposes development of a "fraud-proof work authorization document for all persons legally authorized to work in the United States," some-
thing that civil libertarians persuaded Congress to leave out of the law on the ground that it smacked of an identity card.
To control illegal immigration, the commission urges Congress to sweep away prerogatives that exempt many farmers from providing their workers with overtime pay, housing with toilets, unemployment insurance, workers' compensation for injuries on the job and the right to form unions. Farms with less than 10 employees, the majority of all farms, also do not have to comply with Federal health and safety laws. Farmers have thus become dependent on people who will accept those conditions, primarily Central Americans.
If the exemptions were phased out, the commission says, legal workers who shun most farm jobs today would vie for the jobs and crowd out illegal immigrants.
 
Created as Concession
 Congress created the panel, the Commission on Agricultural Workers, to review the impact of the law as a concession to farming interests who feared that the immigrants granted amnesty would flock to better-paying jobs off the farm and leave them with no one to harvest crops. After five years of research, the commission has completed its work and will meet Nov. 6 for the final review of its findings.
The chairman, Henry J. Voss, who is a peach grower in California and the director of the state's Department of Food and Agriculture, said he expected little more than fine-tuning because he and the 10 other commissioners worked through their differences during the drafting process. "Our findings around the country were generally the same," Mr. Voss said. "There is a continuous stream of illegal immigrants entering the agricultural work force."
The draft, a copy of which was obtained from people close to the commission, says the law has produced none of the major benefits that lawmakers expected, especially improvements in agricultural wages and working conditions. Nor did it bring about the shortage of workers feared by fruit and vegetable growers. "Rather than stabilizing," says the draft, "the national farm labor supply is registering a pronounced surplus."
The commission's proposals will probably face wide opposition from farmers' organizations, and it is surprising in a majority of the 11 members, like Mr. Voss, are current or former farmers or leaders of farm organizations who could have something to lose from expanding Federal regulations to farm labor.
"We will be violently interested in that," said Elizabeth Whitley, assistant director for national affairs at the American Farm Bureau.
The commission found that bigger problems await the nation without vast changes in agricultural policy. Mr. Voss said illegal immigration, in creating hundreds of thousands of jobless or underemployed workers, many with families, affects all taxpayers, including farmers. "The social problems are an issue that have to be addressed," he said.
Without changes in the law, the report warns that "farm worker households of the 1990's will likely experience increasing levels of poverty and economic stress" and that "if present trends continue, by the turn of the century, a very substantial portion of the overall U.S. farm labor force is likely to again be unauthorized."
No one really knows how many illegal immigrants are working in the country. The commission estimates that 2.5 million laborers, most of them immigrants, work on the nation's farms. Under the amnesty program, three million people were granted residency permits, and uncounted others who never sought or received amnesty continue to work in the fields. How many more have come into the country illegally since then, or where they have gone to work, is incalculable.
One gauge of the law's failings is the number of apprehensions of people trying to cross the 2,000-mile Mexican-American border. Duke Austin, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said apprehensions of illegal immigrants plunged to 853,000 in 1989 from 1.6 million in the 1986 fiscal year, just before the law was enacted. But he said they had been rising since then, to an estimated 1.2 million in the 1992 fiscal year. The number of border agents has changed little in that time, he said.
Congress established the amnesty program largely to placate agricultural employers who feared losing their pool of immigrant labor. It also established a program to permit farmers to recruit more foreign workers if the newly legalized workers fled farms to better jobs. The farm labor pool is bigger than ever, however, and no farmer has had to resort to the recruiting program, the report says.
The commission says few workers granted amnesty have left agriculture because of a lack of skills, language difficulties and the recession in the United States. And the workers are no better off. "Since the mid-1980's," it says, "hired farm workers' living and working conditions have generally not improved."
With increases in the Federal minimum wage to the current $4.25 from $3.35 an hour, when the law was enacted, the average farm worker's wage reached $5.57 an hour last year. But after taking account of inflation, it declined 2 percent from 1986 to 1991.
A consequence of the surplus of labor is that immigrants, legal and illegal, get less work than they want. "In most areas," the report says, "an increasing number of newly arriving, unauthorized workers compete for available jobs, reducing the number of hours available to and contributing to lower annual earnings for all workers."
Said Daniel Stein, executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which wants to limit all immigration to the rate of growth of the American population, or to about 300,000 people a year. "Illegal immigration has destroyed the incentive to provide decent wages, housing and working conditions."
At the root of the failure of the law is the fraudulent-document industry, people who make birth certificates, resident alien cards, Social Security cards, driver's licenses and other documents to show employers that the immigrants are authorized to work in the United States.
"Supplying fraudulent work-authorizing documents has now become a thriving business," the commission's draft says.
Senator Alan K. Simpson, the Wyoming Republican who was one of the law's principal authors, said he had been skeptical about whether the law could work because of the concessions it made to farmers, like the amnesty program and the decision not to require a fraud-proof driver's license or other identification document because they would threaten workers' privacy.
Mr. Simpson said he had not seen the commission's draft report. But he said: "Employer sanctions really don't function correctly unless you do something about fraudulent documents."
President Reagan appointed six commission members members, including Mr. Voss. The Speaker of the House appointed three, and the President pro tem of the Senate appointed three. In addition to Mr. Voss the commissioners are Richard B. Abell, an Assistant Attorney General in the Reagan Administration; Lloyd W. Aubry Jr., director of the California Department of Industrial Relations; Michael V. Durando, president of the California Grape and Fruit League; Ben M. Gramling 2d, a South Carolina peach grower; Delores Huerta, co-founder and first vice president of the United Farm Workers.
Also, Roger M. Mahony, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Los Angeles; Phillip L. Martin, agricultural economist at the University of California at Davis; Russell Pitzer, a West Virginia fruit grower; George Sorn, executive vice president of the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association, and Russell L. Williams, president of Agricultural Producers of California. A 12th member, Othal E. Brand, the Republican Mayor of McAllen, Tex., resigned.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 26, 1992, Monday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about the effectiveness of the 1986 immigration law misstated a provision in some copies. Farmers with fewer than 10 employees do not have to comply with Federal health and safety laws.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "What the Commission Proposes" -- The Commission on Agricultural Workers proposes many changes in labor regulations governing farm workers. These are among its recommendations.
 
* To curb illegal immigration, improve border controls, internal apprehension mechanisms and enforcement of employer sanctions. Develop a fraud-proof work authorization document.
 
* In the face of a surplus of farmworkers, discontinue the Replenishment Agricultural Worker (RAW) program that lets farmers recruit new immigrants.
 
* Require the Department of Labor's job-placement service to aid in placing farm workers in jobs to help them remain employed longer during the year.
 
* Tighten regulation of farm labor contractors, or crew leaders, who recruit and manage many farmworkers pay them less than other farm workers. Make farmers liable for claims against the farm labor contractors they use.
 
* To improve appeal of agricultural jobs, grant farm workers the same rights as other workers rights to unemployment insurance, workers' compensation insurance, overtime pay, union organizing and collective bargaining.
 
* Assure farmworkers' children the same opportunities for health care, education and day care provided children of other workers. (pg. B10)

Jenny Craig Plans Buyback of Its Stock

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 21

 BODY:
The diet-center operator Jenny Craig Inc., whose stock price has been trimmed because of a decline in sales and profits, said today that its directors had agreed to repurchase up to three million shares, or 11 percent of its stock outstanding.
The company also reported that its profits fell 7.2 percent, to $9.72 million, or 35 cents a share, in the quarter that ended on Sept. 30., from $10.5 million, or 44 cents a share a year earlier. Revenue declined 5 percent, to $114 million, from $120 million. It was the first decline in revenue in the company's history. 
 Trading in Jenny Craig's shares were delayed this morning because of an imbalance in orders. The stock closed at $13.375, down $1.625. Last October, the company went public and sold five million shares at $21 each. The stock's high was $33.875 in January, and it reached a low of $11.75 this month.
"People were more disappointed in earnings than in the stock buyback," said Michael Tennenbaum, a vice chairman of Bear Stearns Inc., who is a Jenny Craig director and investor. He said Jenny Craig was not a buyer of its stock today but intended to buy shares in the next few days.
Mr. Tennenbaum said directors had decided to disclose the buyback before the company's annual meeting, which is to be held Thursday in Del Mar, Calif. Four disgruntled shareholders, who cumulatively own 200 shares, in June filed a class-action suit contending that Jenny Craig had misled investors about its future growth.
Ronald E. Gerevas, Jenny Craig's president, said the stock buyback was unrelated to the lawsuit. "We think it's an attractive buy," he said. Insiders control 61 percent of the company's 27.5 million shares outstanding.
Jenny Craig has sufficient cash reserves to pay for much of the buyback and still finance planned expansion next year, Mr. Gerevas said. Even so, he said, "it's not been a pleasant period."
Jenny Craig has continued to grow, opening 30 new outlets since June. With 728 weight-loss centers, itis the No. 3 company in the $2 billion commercial diet-center industry, after Weight Watchers International Inc. and Nutri/System Inc.
"The company is doing better than most of the other chains," said John La Rosa, publisher of Diet Business Bulletin of Valley Stream, L.I. A survey of telephone-book ads conducted by the trade paper found a 9.7 percent decline in diet-center clinics since April. "We're in a recession and there's a growing anti-diet movement out there," he said.
Sid Craig and his wife, Jenny, co-founded the company in 1983.

HEADLINE: Save the Taiga

BYLINE: By Tom Brokaw; Tom Brokaw is anchor and managing editor of "NBC Nightly News."

 BODY:
A new word is about to enter the environmental mainstream. The word is taiga, the Russians' name for their network of forests carpeting more than two million square miles of the Russian Far East and Siberia. The taiga is larger than Brazil's rain forests, and many scientists believe it is even more critical to the control of global warming.
Since the Russian Government, desperate for investment, is inviting outside timber companies to log the taiga extensively, scientists and environmentalists met in Sweden this month and formed a taiga rescue network. In addition to coordinating research, lobbying and publicity efforts, they're developing plans to protect the rights of the indigenous people, the Udegei and other tribes. 
 As Brazilian rubber tappers were an important early-warning system about the reckless cutting of their forest, the Udegei hunters, fishermen and trappers are aroused about a foreign harvest of the many riches of their expanse of forests and rivers.
I learned first-hand of their concerns during a kayaking trip with five friends through the Sikhote-Alin, the Russian peninsula hard by the Sea of Japan. A Russian wildlife biologist insisted we explore the Bikin River watershed to have a full appreciation of the pristine quality of the forest. We found conifers, poplars and hardwoods stretching over an area the size of America's lower 48 states.
The taiga is the northernmost home of the elusive Siberian tiger. A Russian-American study of the territorial range and mating habits of this rare species was recently geographically expanded because of the threat of logging in its habitat. The tiger shares the woods with giant brown bears, moose, elk, sable and tiny roe deer.
The few people we encountered, Russian and Udegei, live a simple, hard life in one-room log cabins scattered along hunting and trapping trails or huddled in small collectives along the edge of a river.
Any development of the region would not be easy. The absence of roads, power and political stability adds up to a costly investment. However, a combination of Russia's need for hard currency and the global competition for those resources, including gold and other mineral riches, will likely overrun investor caution.
Hyundai, the South Korean conglomerate, is logging a half-million acres and was recently awarded 600,000 more acres. Udegei leaders protested that they were not consulted and that requirements for environmental impact studies were set aside. Other timber giants -- Weyerhaeuser of the U.S. and Japanese companies -- are exploring taiga prospects.
The possibilities for haphazard, reckless and rapacious exploitation are boundless. There are few safeguards. The Pacific Institute of Geography, a branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Vladivostok, has prepared a plan for more local control and prudent development, but the institute is out of money. The director is tempted to sell its services to developers -- an opportunity for developers to use the institute's scholarly research as a road map to the treasures.
A nonprofit California environmental think tank, the Pacific Energy and Resources Center, has created the Siberian Forests Project, a joint U.S.-Russian effort to mobilize environmentalists in a campaign against an assault on the taiga.
Even if global warming were not a threat, what happens to the taiga is a monumental environmental, economic and political issue for global consideration.
If the new world order has any meaning, what happens to this last great temperate forest must be at or near the top of the international environmental agenda.
Since there is virtually no pressure from the local population to develop the area, millions of acres could be set aside for the first true international wilderness park, financed by contributions from the industrial powers that for now are on a course only to harvest this paradise. High-end, carefully regulated international tourism could bring in additional hard currency.
Given the speed of developments in the new Russia, the need for a thoughtful, comprehensive approach to the taiga is urgent. If there is no plan for long-range stewardship based on ecological research, the wilds of the Russian Far East and beyond will be lost to the high-pitched whine of a chain-saw invasion.

HEADLINE: Russia's Elixir -- A special report.;
Vodka, Scourge and Balm At Center of Russian Life

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 16

 BODY:
"Daddy, now that vodka is so expensive, will you drink less?"
"No, my son. You'll eat less." -- Russian joke
According to the Kievan Chronicles, Vladimir I, who converted Russia to Greek Orthodoxy at the end of the 10th century, rejected Islam on the grounds that he would never get Russians to stop drinking alcohol. 
 Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in his infamous campaign against alcohol, had no better luck. Today, according to Lieut. Col. Vitaly N. Gunenkov, chief of the Interior Ministry's department for drink-related crimes, the problems associated with too much vodka-drinking -- crime, absenteeism, lost production, sickness -- are worse than they were before Mr. Gorbachev's campaign of 1985 to 1988.
"It's like a pendulum that is swinging hard in the other direction," Colonel Gunenkov said. "Now it is worse than it was in 1984, and this year shows the trend is also worsening."
 
Crimes Are Up
 He said crimes committed by drunken people in Moscow were up 15.9 percent in the first seven months of this year over the same period last year. Drunken people are now committing 35.6 percent of all crimes in Moscow, he said, and nearly 80 percent of crimes against individuals: murder, rape, robbery. Figures are similar nationwide.
Experts say comparisons between Russia and other countries with alcohol problems are difficult because of varying definitions of what constitutes an alcoholic. But Russia's problem is widely acknowledged to be among the worst in the world, ranking only with Poland's in terms of social costs that result from drunkenness.
In addition, the United States and other countries have enormous problems of lost work, sickness and absenteeism because of drugs as well as alcohol.
But vodka -- so typically Russian and so endemic -- also provides a window into the new economy, into both its opportunities and social costs. As with every other aspect of Russian life, the business of vodka is swarming with inconsistencies and corruption in this great transition from a socialized command economy to a free market.
The production of vodka remains, as it was under the czars, a state monopoly that still accounts for more than 10 percent of Government revenues, exceeding the amount received from individual income tax.
The sale of vodka, however, is no longer a state monopoly. Individuals can import and export, secure their own supplies, whether legally or illegally, and profit as they can. And while the Government still tries to license who can sell vodka when, and at what markup, it can now be bought legally 24 hours a day, and its price, in reality, has been freed.
Russians are drinking less alcohol per capita now than in 1984. But they are drinking just as much vodka, even though its price has gone up considerably. And more of the vodka consumed is samogon, home brew of dubious quality, while unknown numbers of people continue to get their alcohol, and their early deaths, from dangerous or poisonous substances like window-cleaner, anti-roach chemicals, cheap perfumes, glue and gasoline.
"Today the patterns of drinking are also more dangerous than before the reform," said Vladimir G. Treml of Duke University, an economist and expert on Russian drinking.
Citizens of some wine-drinking countries like France, Italy, Spain and Portugal actually consume more alcohol per capita than Russians, but the pattern of drinking in these countries is safer because the alcohol is consumed with food and in the presence of family and friends, he and others say. On the list of per capita alcohol consumption, in 1990 the former Soviet Union ranked only 36th, with France first and the United States, a heavy beer-drinking country, 24th.
"Drinking large quantities of distilled liquor in a short period, which is typical of Russia, is the most dangerous," Dr. Treml said.
Russia, after all, is the land of the endless toast, of male bonding through the bottle, and of a rigorous social etiquette requiring that once a vodka bottle is open it must be emptied. "Samogon left in the bottom of the glass is bitterness thrown in the face of a friend," as the saying goes, and there is still significant social sympathy for the heavy drinker who finds that the pain and tragedy of life is best resolved through alcoholic oblivion.
 
A Natural Part of Life
 Vodka is also cherished, almost akin to patriotism, and the poorest family will break out a bottle for guests. The word vodka is a diminutive of the word voda, meaning water, and vodka is regarded as just as natural a part of life.
Around it, as around wine in the West, much romance has grown, and aficionados argue passionately about which vodka from which distillery is the most flavorful, smooth, pure. And there are many different brands and flavors of vodka: lemon, pepper, fruit, buffalo grass and a special "hunter's vodka," deep brown with herbs and spices.
The love of "little water" has had horrifying consequences. According to the newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets, as many as 30 million people in the former Soviet Union are alcoholics or alcohol abusers -- about 10 percent of the population. The evidence in Russian cities and towns is overwhelming: the drunkards huddling in doorways and subway stations reeking of vodka and urine; the men prostrate in hallways and on sidewalks or weaving in and out of the street; the long lines at state liquor stores during work hours; the sharp smell of vodka on the breath of office workers in the morning as they crush into an elevator.
In Moscow alone, about 1,000 seriously drunk people are picked up off the streets each day because they are judged to be a danger to themselves or others. About half of them are employed; one percent are women. Colonel Gunenkov acknowledges that even the figure of 1,000 is a bit arbitrary: the 28 drunk tanks in Moscow, including one for women, have about 1,000 beds.
Everyone agrees that Mr. Gorbachev's campaign -- which included a ban on sales of drink, and eau de cologne, in stores and restaurants before 2 P.M., an increase in the drinking age from 18 to 21, higher prices and cuts in liquor supplies -- had a perceptible impact in lowering the crime rate and at least stabilizing male life expectancy.
 
Life Expectancy Falling
 There were 266,000 registered crimes by drunken people in 1984 in Russia. In 1990, they were up to 335,000, made worse, the police say, by price rises, instability and the general breakdown of social discipline. And Russian experts agree with Dr. Treml that renewed heavy drinking of vodka is the prime reason that male life expectancy is falling again in Russia, as it has for the last three years.
"The problem with the 1985 campaign," Colonel Gunenkov said, "is that it was not a struggle against alcoholism, but against alcoholic drinks." Grand plans for more counseling and health care, youth clubs and entertainment centers and especially more and more attractive bars, where people could drink in a social setting with food and monitored by bar workers, all collapsed for lack of funds. Government revenues dropped, the Central Bank started printing rubles to cover the deficit, setting off inflation, and so much samogon was being made that sugar had to be rationed.
The whole campaign against drink -- sometimes known here as zelyony zmei, the green serpent, both for the coils of pipes in home distilleries and the visions produced when drunk -- was abandoned in 1988.
"Unfortunately we still have very few decent outlets for drinking in Moscow and Russia, and most are disgusting," said Anatoly V. Petrovsky, buying vodka from a sidewalk kiosk. "A normal person is afraid to go into a beer hall."
It is these thousands of private kiosks -- selling cigarettes, clothes, cosmetics and vodka, domestic and imported -- that represent the sharpest change from the past. They serve as the real retail sector of the urban economy, while the state stores, very few of them privatized, have essentially become wholesalers. How the vodka gets to the kiosks, and who profits from it, provides an instructive primer on the new economy.
 
The Distillery
Even Bottles Are in Short Supply
 The Kristall distillery in the Lefortovo district of Moscow, built in 1895, has Doric pillars, ornate ceilings and some of the few clean windows in any Russian enterprise, complete with house plants.
Moscow's only distillery, it remains wholly owned by the state, which continues to take nearly 90 percent of its profits in one kind of tax or another. Kristall now produces 100 million liters a year of eight brands of vodka, still down from its pre-Gorbachev peak of 120 million liters, but generating 20 billion rubles a year (about $59 million) in revenue. It also exports about 4 percent of production, including the well-known Stolichnaya and Moskovskaya brands, which are made with better grades of grain alcohol and purer water.
Kristall's manager, Vladimir A. Yamnikov, would be familiar to any Westerner. Compact, efficient, a bit brusque, he has risen through the ranks and knows his business. He speaks bluntly about the difficulties and absurdities of state control, which deny him enough revenue and hard currency to update and expand, which would allow the state to make still more money.
"We need more hard currency to modernize and replace our equipment," Mr. Yamnikov said. "But export taxes are too high, and we must sell our hard currency to the state. And given the rising costs of equipment and raw materials, our profits aren't enough to expand."
Mr. Yamnikov works under thousands of restrictions, but the biggest drag on his production right now is the acute shortage of bottles. Part of the problem was the Gorbachev reform, when many millions of vodka and wine bottles were ground into dust by bulldozers. But the few big bottle factories in Russia -- the closest one to Moscow is in Kaluga, 250 miles away -- are themselves having trouble getting material from their suppliers.
Mr. Yamnikov says his costs represent a little more than half his Government-fixed wholesale price of between 106 and 125 rubles, about 35 cents, a liter bottle.
When Kristall had excess production for a while this summer because of cheap imports, it was allowed to sell to private dealers directly. But since vodka is once again regarded as in shortage with imposition of an export tax -- Vasily N. Doroshin, deputy minister of Moscow's Department of Industry and Trade, says Kristall now produces only 83 percent of Moscow's needs -- the factory may once again sell only to state stores and warehouses.
Mr. Yamnikov throws up his hands. "Of course the criminals steal from trucks and buy vodka cheap from state stores with bribes. They try anything. But we sell at our fixed price, and we don't know where the vodka goes. It's not ours any more."
 
The Private Market
Lawbreaking Is Widespread
 By law in the Moscow region, stores may sell vodka only at a markup of 10 percent over their purchase price. Mr. Doroshin says the restrictions are supposed to prevent price gouging on a commodity that is in short supply but vital to social and political stability.
But he acknowledges that he does not have enough people to enforce the restrictions, and that many state stores are selling vodka in bulk to private distributors, who then deliver the vodka to the kiosks they control. There, a liter of Kristall's Pshenichnaya, or grain vodka, which should be about 140 rubles at a state store, sells for 220 rubles or more, far exceeding the legal price ceilings.
If asked, kiosk managers say that their cost was 200 rubles and they merely took their legal 10 percent markup.
The manager of a commercial store on Chekhov Street, who asked for anonymity, said lawbreaking was widespread. In his store, he sold four Kristall factory brands: Pshenichnaya, for 220 rubles, and export-quality Moskovskaya and Limonnaya for 250 rubles. Export-quality Stolichnaya was 400 rubles a liter. He also sold two imported vodkas. One, called Rasputin, cost 600 rubles. American Smirnoff vodka, which is very chic here, was 2,000 rubles (about $5.90).
"If we get vodka outside the state distribution system, it's a legal violation, so I can't discuss it with you," the manager said. When pressed, he said individuals and his "regular suppliers" come by with trucks and cars and offer some cases. "We don't ask how they get it and don't want to know. We just take some at the price they offer and sell it for a 25 percent markup." That itself is a violation.
And where do these distributors get it?
"People make deals with directors of the state liquor stores," he said. "If the store sells vodka for 100 rubles, say, you can get large quantities paying 120 rubles. Then you sell it for 250 rubles. That's why there's so little vodka in the state stores. But it's a huge violation."
Vodka comes to state stores normally once a week, and immediately long lines of customers form to buy it at the state price. Often policemen stand at the entrances to prevent fighting and regulate the numbers of customers allowed in the store at any one time. Meanwhile, much of the vodka is going illegally out the back door.
Mr. Doroshin, the Moscow trade official, says his job is nearly impossible. "I'm trying to regulate the market," he said, "but the market has its own laws. Real competition would be much better, with many factories competing and no shortages in the shops."
One of his few real sanctions against the illegal trade from state shops is, ironically, privatization. Although only 270 of Moscow's 7,000 retail establishments are "fully privatized," Mr. Doroshin said, the others will be, transferred to the control of their current managers and employees. If he discovers violations of the markup limit, which also applies to private stores, he can fine a store 10,000 rubles ($30). But for a second or third violation, he said, "we can take the store away from the workers and sell it" at auction. "So the privatization process is crucial," he said.
 
The Drunk Tank
Beds Are Close To the Ground
 There are few more depressing places than the Sobering Station of the Sixth Regional Militia Department on Big Storchinovsky Lane in the Moskvoretsky district here.
There are four wards containing 31 beds, all close to the ground so no one who falls to the floor will be hurt. On an average day, 29 men, most of them too drunk to stand, are brought here by the police.
They are examined by Tamara G. Donskaya, 40 years old, a feldsher -- more than a nurse but less than a doctor -- who works a 24-hour shift, three days a week. She takes their blood pressure and examines their eyes, skin color and behavior, but does no blood test. If they are really sick, she phones an ambulance.
Usually, however, they are like the old man in ragged clothing who needs help getting his trousers off. "Don't I have the right to drink?" he shouts.
"Did you fall?" Mrs. Donskaya asks.
"I've never fallen!" But he almost does as the police lead him, stripped to his underwear, to one of the wards. As they unlock the door, the smell of drink and stale sweat is overwhelming. Mrs. Donskaya keeps intermittent watch through a latched panel, and when her clients are sober, usually after four to six hours, she lets them go.
 
'It Saves Lives'
 "Actually, I hate this work," she said. "But it must be done, and in winter, especially, it saves lives."
Drink is the Russian curse, says the acting director of the station, Lieut. Nikolai A. Vzhakin, 39. "Now that vodka is sold all the time, we get more clients. But at least we get fewer people drinking chemicals."
The station charges its clients 150 rubles for its services, which can be deducted from salary if they work, plus fines ranging from 20 rubles for a first offense to 100 rubles. In the end, the Government gets paid by all but 23 percent of its drunken clients. Courts sometimes sentence repeat offenders to two months' labor at 20 percent of normal salary or put them in jail for 15 days. And the station must inform a client's workplace or family of his visit there.
But everyone in this station knows that they are only bandaging a problem.
Colonel Gunenkov of the Interior Ministry, who is in charge of the drunk tanks and almost everything else dealing with drunkenness, says, smiling, that the 150-ruble fee "is one of the cheapest services available now in Moscow, but somehow our clients aren't satisfied."
He says that his budget has not gone up to match the increase in drunkenness and alcohol-related crime, but that the answer is not policing, but a change of mentality and attitude.
It would help if this new democracy and freer market bring stability to people's lives instead of instability, he said. "I hope that capitalism will also bring more nice restaurants and bars, where people can drink socially and eat at the same time."

Profits at A.T.&T. and Southwestern Bell

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The American Telephone and Telegraph Company, the world's largest telecommunications company, said yesterday that it had a third-quarter profit of $963 million, or 72 cents a share, compared with a loss of $1.8 billion in the corresponding period a year ago.
The Southwestern Bell Corporation, a regional Bell company spun off from A.T.& T. in 1984, reported yesterday that its third-quarter earnings rose 6.2 percent from a year ago. 
 A.T.& T.'s results last year were distorted by a one-time restructuring charge of $4.2 billion for the acquisition of NCR, the computer company.If special charges are stripped away, A.T.& T.'s profits rose 16.1 percent, to $963 million, from $829 million a year ago.
Analysts said the results were within their expectations. "A lot of companies have a tough time making the numbers so I was pleasantly surprised," said Robert B. Morris, a telecommunications analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Company.
Here are the details of the companies' earnings:
 
A.T.& T.
 A.T.& T.'s quarterly revenue grew 3.5 percent, to $16.18 billion, from $15.63 billion a year ago.
About 63 percent of the revenue came from telecommunications services, mostly business and residential long-distance service. This revenue grew 3.2 percent to $10.13 billion from $9.82 billion a year earlier.
A.T.& T.'s gains in long-distance traffic were slightly ahead of most analysts' expectations, reporting that minutes of use had risen 6 percent from the year-ago period and 2.5 percent from the second quarter.
Sales of network products and systems, the second-largest part of A.T.& T.'s revenue, rose 1.7 percent to $3.87 billion from the year-earlier $3.81 billion. Nearly half of this figure came from telecommunications network products, the huge switching computers and other gear made for large telephone companies.
NCR, which now has A.T.& T.'s old computer operations, reported earnings and revenue that were not comparable to year-ago periods. But NCR's third-quarter operating income dropped 50 percent from the $98 million reported in the second quarter. A.T.& T. cited the persistent recession both in the national economy and the computer business.
On the New York Stock Exchange, A.T.& T.'s shares, the most widely held in the country, closed at $42 a share, up $1.
Southwestern Bell
 
 
Southwestern Bell, which serves Texas and some Midwestern states, said third-quarter earnings totaled $385.6 million, or $1.28 a share, compared with $363.1 million, or $1.21 a share a year ago.
Third-quarter earnings were reduced by $25 million, or 8 cents a share, to account for relocating the company's headquarters from St. Louis to San Antonio.
Operating expenses grew 10.5 percent to $1.98 billion from the year-ago $1.79 billion. Revenue rose 8 percent to $2.62 billion from $2.42 billion.
On the New York Stock exchange, Southwestern Bell fell $1.50 a share, to $62.625.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: James Baker;
Off-Again, On-Again Speech Is Off, Again

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 23

 BODY:
White House officials said today that they had scrapped plans for James A. Baker 3d, the White House chief of staff, to give a speech outlining the future domestic policies of the Bush Administration. They said they feared that if Mr. Baker gave such a speech, it would only raise questions why Mr. Bush was not doing it himself.
The proposed Baker speech has had more ups and downs than the Arab-Israeli peace talks that Mr. Baker helped to organize as Secretary of State. In a period of two weeks the speech has been announced, postponed, canceled, revived and now canceled again, making it certainly one of the most talked-about speeches never delivered in recent memory. 
 Officials now say that if any speech on domestic policy in a second Bush term is given in the closing days of the campaign, it will be delivered by the President.
 
President's Sudden Shift
 The story of the missing speech began to unfold on Oct. 11 during the first Presidential debate in St. Louis, when President Bush tried to persuade voters that he was so serious about his domestic agenda that he would assign his most trusted aide, Mr. Baker, to carry it out.
That announcement came only a week after Mr. Bush had said on CNN's "Larry King Live" that he wanted Mr. Baker to return to being Secretary of State in a second Administration.
The reason that Mr. Bush suddenly shifted Mr. Baker from his future Secretary of State to his future domestic policy czar was a realization within the Bush campaign that most Americans did not know the President had packaged his economic proposals into a single plan.
By saying Mr. Baker would carry out the economic program, Mr. Bush hoped it would be taken more seriously. Mr. Baker, hoping to show voters that he would be serious, too, declared in an interview with CNN that he would give a speech detailing how he would go about it.
By Oct. 15, when Mr. Baker still had not given the speech, the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, told reporters "he may not even give the speech." White House officials say Mr. Fitzwater was "winging it" when he suggested the speech was off, and when word got back to Mr. Baker's office Mr. Fitzwater was instructed to reverse his remarks.
In the meantime, though, White House officials began to see the stream of editorials and cartoons lampooning Mr. Bush for having to use Mr. Baker to persuade voters that the President had a domestic policy program. The theme was that if Mr. Baker was needed to persuade voters that Mr. Bush was serious, why not dispense with the middleman and just make Mr. Baker the candidate?

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Memo;
Vulnerable, Bush Makes A Last Effort to Connect

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RALEIGH, N.C., Oct. 22

 BODY:
A Presidential candidate's stump speech in the final days of the campaign is a freeze frame of the man, the party and the times, and so it was for President Bush as he rolled through the South this week.
Amidst the one-liners, the sound bites and the applause lines was the portrait of a party in transition, trying to retrofit itself for life after the cold war, for a nation obsessed with the problems at home. Behind the attack lines and the digs at his opponent was a President making one last attempt to connect with a restless electorate, a President who is offering, as much as any big idea or philosophy, himself. 
 "We Trust Bush," read the banners along this carefully advanced whistle-stop tour through Georgia and the Carolinas; this was the hopeful concept at the heart of Mr. Bush's appeal, in a region that has not seen such a competitive Presidential election since Jimmy Carter.
There were echoes in Mr. Bush's speeches this week of the Republican glory days, when Ronald Reagan seemed to own the South, scoffing at the Democrats as gloom-and-doomers who refused to see America's special place in the world.
"To get elected," Mr. Bush told a huge rally in Spartanburg, S.C., on Tuesday night, "they've got to convince the American people that the United States is a nation in decline, and we are not. We are No. 1 -- in the economy, in security, in standing up for freedom and democracy." The audience responded with the chant that punctuated the politics of the 1980's: "We're No. 1!"
But Mr. Reagan had the benefit of a strong economy in 1984, when he ran on the triumphant vision of "Morning in America" and carried the votes of 72 percent of Southern white men, nearly 8 in 10 of them in North Carolina. Mr. Bush had to keep acknowledging that he did not. He talked about mending the economy by increasing exports, by incentives for small businesses, by holding down Federal spending and "giving the overtaxed taxpayer some relief."
But the most impassioned part of his economic prescriptions was his warning of what would happen under the Democrats: "He's going to go after your wallet," he said, in one small town after another.
There were plenty of red-meat lines in Mr. Bush's speeches, lots of exuberant railing at "the nutty pollsters," "the soft-thinking United States Congress," the "trickle-down government" crowd.
And he campaigned closely and warmly this week with two venerable warriors of the conservative South, Senators Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Strom Thurmond of South Carolina. (Mr. Thurmond, elected to the Senate in 1954, seemed somewhat of a counterpoint to Mr. Bush's fiery call this week for term limits.)
But this was not a full-blown appeal to the old conservative flash points; Mr. Bush was not talking about school prayer or racial quotas or even his staunch opposition to abortion as he rolled through the Carolinas. He mentioned "family values" only in passing, and his chiding of Mr. Clinton on crime was remarkably muted compared with the treatment afforded Michael S. Dukakis in 1988.
Merle Black, an expert on Southern politics at Emory University, offers one explanation: "It's hard to do pure ideology this year" against the Democrats. Mr. Black noted that Gov. Bill Clinton was now running a commercial that presents him as a "different" kind of Democrat and highlights his support for welfare reform and the death penalty. "It's like a Reagan ad from 1980," Mr. Black said. "When they're positioning themselves that way, it's just more difficult to sell Bill Clinton as a liberal."
Jim Martin, the Republican Governor of North Carolina, acknowledged as much, with some frustration. "They talk the talk; they don't walk the walk," he said.
 
Strains Within Party
 But Mr. Bush is also reflecting the ideological strains in his own party, which is struggling to hold together its coalition without the glue of anti-Communism or a strong economy, and with the abortion issue increasingly divisive. The party's attempt to use "family values" backfired badly after the convention in August.
Instead of a rollicking ideological assault, Mr. Bush has focused on character. He talked about Mr. Clinton as a waffler, a man engaged in "a pattern of deception," a man who wanted to have it both ways even on something as clear cut as the use of force in the Persian Gulf war. At every stop, he read Mr. Clinton's now famous statement on the war: how he would have voted with the majority, but understood the concerns of the minority. And he talked of his own hard decision to send "your sons and daughters" into war.
Mr. Bush also spoke with evident pride "that these high school kids here go to bed at night without the same fear of nuclear war that their older brothers and their sisters had." But the President's speeches are testimony to the electorate's focus on domestic issues this year; a man who revels in foreign policy clearly feels he can speak of it only in passing.
With foreign policy marginalized, and with ideology muddied, Mr. Bush's appeal in the end is almost starkly personal: "Character counts," he said in Thomasville, N.C. "Character matters." He added, "I want to win this election not because I need this job, but I want to continue to serve the American people and lift up the hopes of these kids."
For all the attack lines, there is something strikingly vulnerable about Mr. Bush's closing appeal to the voters.

HEADLINE: Dispute Threatens U.S. Plan on Violence

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 22

 BODY:
The Department of Health and Human Services is planning a five-year effort to combat violence in America the way it would fight an epidemic of smallpox, using public health techniques to supplement the criminal justice system.
But the Government's plans, known loosely as the violence initiative, have come under sharp attack by a crusading Maryland psychiatrist and some prominent blacks who say the effort is racist and genocidal. 
 The dispute has put the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, who is black, in an uncomfortable position and threatens financing for some research and community-based demonstration projects that specialists say show promise in reducing violence.
 
'I Will Not Apologize'
 In a strongly worded speech to a group of child psychiatrists today, Dr. Sullivan denounced the attacks on his plan as "false and inflammatory accusations" by extremists who have "grossly and irresponsibly mischaracterized" the work of his department.
"I will not apologize for doing what I can to reduce the number of young lives that are being tragically destroyed by violence," Dr. Sullivan said.
Dr. Peter Breggin, a Bethesda, Md., psychiatrist who has led much of the opposition to the plan, said in a telephone interview that looking for biological or genetic markers, as some critics have suggested was part of the plan, was "very racist" and "without scientific foundation."
"The violence initiative is denying racism, poverty and how tough it is for children living in the inner city," he said.
Responding to such criticism in a talk to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry today, Dr. Sullivan said none of the research done by his department supported the idea that there is a "crime gene" or a genetic basis for crime.
But Dr. Sullivan said that to build support among blacks for the Government's work, he would appoint a "special blue-ribbon panel" to oversee the research, headed by Franlyn G. Jenifer, the president of Howard University.
The fight over the plan reflects a sensitive statistical fact: a disproportionate percentage of homicides are committed by blacks, about seven times the rate, per capita, committed by whites, according to the Public Health Service. Similarly, blacks are more often victims of murder.
Homicide is the leading cause of death for black men between the ages of 15 and 34, the Public Health Service figures show. A young minority male has a greater probability of being killed on the streets of a city than a soldier had on a tour of duty in Vietnam.
Dr. Sullivan said it was concern over such statistics, and a realization that the United States as a whole has become "the most violent country in the industrialized world," that led him to push for greater involvement by the Department of Health and Human Services. "This problem is too great to be left to the criminal justice system," he said in an interview today.
Instead, following the recommendation of a growing number of doctors, psychiatrists, criminologists and law-enforcement experts, Dr. Sullivan has suggested using the public-health approach. It relies on analyzing the causes of an epidemic, then acting to prevent those likely to be at risk from becoming infected.
While the experts agree that no single cure is ever likely to be found to eradicate violence, they say a number of steps can be taken to reduce it gradually, just as intensive efforts have lowered the rate of automobile accident deaths and decreased the number of Americans who smoke.
But one problem in treating violence like a disease, critics say, is that suggesting that some people are natural carriers may stigmatize blacks.
Most of the research and programs would be sponsored by the Federal Centers for Disease Control and the National Institute of Mental Health. Many of the projects would be expansions of work already under way. In the 1991 fiscal year, the institute spent $42.7 million on violence-related research; less than 5 percent was devoted to biological causes of violence, the kind of work that has drawn the most criticism.
One of the strongest critics of the new research plan, Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan and chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said today: "My worst fear is that they will unscientifically correlate race or social class with violent behavior. That would lead to discriminatory policies."
Ronald Walters, chairman of the political science department at Howard University and a member of a group called The Committee to Stop the Federal Violence Initiative, said, "We perceive this as being a particular threat to the black community because of its focus on inner-city youths."
Professor Walters said he objected to treating violence as a disease, as called for by using the public-health approach. "If there is a reason for this kind of research, the aim is to find a drug," he said. "And if you begin using drugs to pacify young black males, as is often done with ritalin for hyperactivity, you're creating a regime of social control."
The Department of Health and Human Services' plan, Professor Walters said, has come about because the Bush Administration has no interest in allocating resources to overcome the economic and social problems of the inner cities.
 
Whole Program Threatened
 Such accusations have put Dr. Sullivan on the defensive and led some specialists in the agencies that comprise the Department of Health and Human Services to worry that the whole program may be canceled.
Dr. Sullivan himself today insisted there was "no violence initiative with a capital V and a capital I." Instead, he called the document a "planning process for a possible future initiative."
The plan would have a proposed budget of about $400 million spread out over the next five years. Most of the research and programs would be sponsored by the Federal Centers for Disease Control and the National Institute of Mental Health. Many of the projects would be expansions of work already under way.
Since 1983, for instance, the disease centers have financed research examining whether there is a statistical link between the presence of guns in society and the frequency of violent death. One study compared Seattle and Vancouver, British Columbia, two cities with similar histories, climate and social and economic characteristics but with different gun-control policies.
The study found that they had nearly the same rates of burglary, robbery and assault, or similar levels of aggressiveness. But homicide was 60 percent higher in Seattle than in Vancouver, and murder by firearms was 500 percent higher, apparently because handguns are much easier to obtain on the United States side of the border.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans;
BUSH, CAMPAIGNING IN JERSEY, ASSAILS CLINTON AND PEROT

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIDGEWOOD, N.J., Oct. 22

 BODY:
President Bush worked New Jersey bottom to top today, straining to erase Bill Clinton's lead in a vital state with more roundhouse attacks on the Governor's record and tax proposals. But the President aimed equally harsh invective at the rival he had treated, until now, almost gently: Ross Perot.
In a television interview in Raleigh, N.C., before flying north, Mr. Bush said Mr. Perot had "some nutty ideas" about the economy and had made "crazy statements" about supposed White House dealings with President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. 
 "I don't want people to waste their vote, and that's undoubtedly what it will be" if voters support Mr. Perot in November, he said on the CBS News program "This Morning."
 
Slip of the Tongue
 In his trek through four New Jersey cities today, Mr. Bush painted Mr. Clinton as heir to the economic travails of Gov. Jim Florio and former President Jimmy Carter.
He accused Mr. Clinton of "threatening 4.5 million jobs," 225,000 of them in the state, by proposing to raise taxes on foreign companies with American-based plants.
He warned repeatedly that Mr. Clinton was "going right after your wallet, man" with proposals for $150 billion in new Federal taxes and $220 billion in additional Federal spending. Mr. Clinton says the taxes would fall only on Americans earning more than $200,000 in gross income and that he would cut taxes for the middle class.
 
Fitzwater's Perspective
 But the President inadvertently stepped on his anti-Clinton message -- and perhaps betrayed his own concerns -- at an afternoon stop in Ridgewood. He told a crowd of 15,000 that he appreciated their "lovely recession," rather than "reception."
White House aides later played down the President's comments about Mr. Perot, who has been gaining support in opinion polls. "All he said was that he didn't think Perot could win, and that he was reckless," said the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater. "That's pretty standard fare."
Mr. Perot indirectly responded to the President's comments in a paid 30- minute television appearance that will be broadcast Friday. "You are being told that if you vote for me you are throwing your vote away," Mr. Perot says in the program, excerpts of which were released today. "You are throwing your vote away unless you vote your conscience. Don't waste your vote on traditional politicians who promise you everything to get elected, but never deliver."
 
Clinton Maintains Lead
 Three national polls, each taken on Tuesday and Wednesday, found Mr. Clinton maintaining a clear lead over President Bush, while Mr. Perot's support had reached a level just under 20 percent.
A NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll of 1,008 registered voters put Mr. Clinton at 47 percent, Mr. Bush at 28 percent and Mr. Perot at 19 percent.
A CNN/USA Today poll, conducted by the Gallup Organization with 1,035 registered voters, showed Mr. Clinton supported by 44 percent, Mr. Bush by 32 percent and Mr. Perot by 17 percent.
An ABC News poll of 909 likely voters measured Mr. Clinton's strength at 43 percent, Mr. Bush's at 32 percent and Mr. Perot's at 17 percent.
Each of the polls had a margin of sampling error of three to four percentage points.
 
'Short on the Answers'
 Mr. Bush appeared to be speaking today out of anger over Mr. Perot's remarks at the last Presidential debate in East Lansing, Mich. There, he accused Mr. Bush -- falsely, the White House insists -- of hiding proof that the President tried to coddle Mr. Hussein before the 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
"There are some very good people for Ross Perot," Mr. Bush said in the interview. "But he's long on the problems, and very short on the answers."
Later, he added: "It's a little more difficult in the real world. And he has some good ideas, and he has some nutty ideas. And he makes some crazy statements, like he did the other night."
The President also criticized Mr. Perot for accusing the Republican Party of engaging in unnamed "dirty tricks," saying:, "If you're going to make a charge like that, where's the evidence? Let's see it."
" You can't make reckless statements as President.," Mr. Bush said.
 
Trying to Narrow Gap
 The President seemed unusually vinegary throughout the long campaign day, which took him in the morning to Vineland, near New Jersey's southern tip, and ended this evening at Secaucus, just west of Manhattan.
One poll, released on Oct. 6 by The Asbury Park Press, showed Mr. Bush trailing Mr. Clinton in New Jersey by 16 percentage points. White House aides say the gap is closer to seven points, and Mr. Bush has come here frequently in the last two months.
Today's forays took Mr. Bush through safely Republican territory in the south, to Democratic Trenton, where he lost to Gov. Michael S. Dukakis in 1988, and to affluent, suburban Ridgewood, which political aides said was moderate Republican country that had defected to the Democratic side in some recent elections.
In Secaucus, Mr. Bush appeared on WWOR-TV in a live broadcast of questions and answers with an audience.
 
The Truth Thing
 Earlier, standing in sycamore-lined Landis Avenue in Vineland, a crowd of 10,000 before him, Mr. Bush simultaneously boasted of his own record and invoked what Mr. Clinton's detractors say is the Governor's tendency to skirt the truth.
"If I'd have stood here in Vineland four years ago and said that Soviet Communism would be dead, and said that Eastern Europe would be democratic, and said that ancient enemies were talking peace around the world, and said to these kids four years ago we are going to reduce, if not all but eliminate the threat of nuclear war -- you would have said, 'Not only is he smoking, but he's inhaling,' " Mr. Bush said.
"And all that has happened, all that has happened."
At a smaller rally at the Trenton-Robbinsville airport, where fewer than a thousand backers showed up, Mr. Bush noted that new claims for unemployment benefits had just fallen to a two-year low. "We've still got big problems, but this is a good sign," he said.
 
Thousands in Ridgewood
 That promise -- that recovery is just around the corner, and that Mr. Clinton's tax increases will strangle it -- is a staple of every Bush speech. But at his rowdiest stop of the day, before a crowd Bush aides estimated at more than 15,000 in Ridgewood, the President tripped on his message.
Mr. Bush typically warns his crowds, with mock sorrow, that he is about to spoil their festivities by talking about Mr. Clinton's record in Arkansas.
"So today," he said, "I want to run the risk of ruining what is a lovely recession -- a lovely reception."
The crowd roared. "Wait till you hear this," he shot back, plunging on into Mr. Clinton's record. "You'll know what I'm talking about."

HEADLINE: Akihito Visit Stirring Bitterness Among Chinese

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 22

 BODY:
The visit of Emperor Akihito of Japan beginning on Friday is meant to symbolize friendship between China and Japan, but already it is stirring bitter memories of Japanese war atrocities as well as a measure of resentment against the Chinese Government itself.
As the visit approaches, some Chinese are saying that their leaders are so eager for international recognition that they are neglecting to demand apologies and compensation from Tokyo. In a country where nationalism has long been a potent force, there are few worse things that can be said about a government than that it does not stand up to Japan.
 
Trade Is Growing
 Balancing these feelings, China is becoming increasingly aware of its need for Japanese friendship right now. The Government is concerned about its prospects for international support, particularly if President Bush, who has encouraged cooperation with China, loses the election in November. 
If Gov. Bill Clinton wins, then the Chinese believe American policy will be tougher toward China.
"Western countries are more hostile to China, so the Government is anxious to be friendly with Japan," said a Chinese intellectual. "It wants to suppress any demonstrations out of strategic considerations."
Another reason why the Chinese Government is unwilling to press Tokyo too hard is that Japanese trade and investment with China are growing steadily. Unlike the United States and some other countries, Japan has not sought to punish China for alleged human rights violations by withdrawing from economic cooperation.
Last year, trade reached $20.2 billion and Chinese press reports quote projections of $23 billion for this year.
In the first six months of this year, moreover, Japanese companies signed agreements to invest $830 million in China, twice as much as in the same period of last year. And in July, when negotiations over the Emperor's visit were still occurring, Japan announced it would go ahead with $1.1 billion in loans as part of a $6.7 billion package.
Nevertheless, mixed feelings toward Japan among the Chinese people are clear. Without any support from the Chinese leadership, a growing number of Chinese have taken it upon themselves to demand apologies and compensation for the suffering inflicted by Japanese soldiers when they occupied parts of China in the 1930's and 1940's.
Emotions about Japan run deep, and they are partly fanned by press reports, films and television programs that play up Japanese aggression during the war. The "Rape of Nanjing," in which Chinese say more than 300,000 people were killed, has become a symbol of suffering in the years between 1931 and 1945, and many Chinese hold Emperor Hirohito, Akihito's father, partly responsible.
China estimates that about 21 million of its citizens were killed or wounded in the war.
When the Beijing Review sponsored an opinion poll that discovered that 80 percent to 90 percent of respondents believed that the Emperor should visit China but should also apologize and offer compensation, China's top propaganda group banned publication of the figures.
To avoid any incidents during the Emperor's visit, the Government has also reportedly issued a circular banning any protests or demands for Japanese apologies or compensation.
Reports say that the police detained the leader of an anti-Japan group in the city of Shijiazhuang, while putting his followers under house arrest, to prevent outbursts.

HEADLINE: Top Republican Fights to Retain His Albany Seat

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OYSTER BAY, L.I., Oct. 20

 BODY:
It could be a muckraking Thomas Nast cartoon come to life. An extravagant millionaire, obviously a scion of old-line Republican wealth, sends his trusted butler off with bags of money to do whatever it takes to buy his favorite candidate and win the election.
But wait, stop the frame. What's wrong with this picture? 
 The television advertisement was not paid for by some insurgent Democrat, but by a pillar of the Republican establishment, Ralph J. Marino, the majority leader of the State Senate, the most powerful Republican official in the state.
"Ralph Marino can't be bought," an announcer declares.
After 24 years in the Senate, Mr. Marino, whose budget wrangling unraveled Mario M. Cuomo's Presidential ambition, according to the Governor, is fighting for political survival in his affluent Long Island district against an unlikely combination of wealthy conservative Republicans and a youthful and popular Democratic county legislator, James F. Gaughran, calling for change in Albany.
In what both candidates say is likely to be the most expensive State Senate campaign in New York history, Mr. Marino is the target of a conservative Republican group -- the Political Action Committee to Kick Out Unproductive Politicians (Pack-Up) -- that has spent tens of thousands to praise his opponent and excoriate him for not doing enough to resist the big-spending policies of Governor Cuomo.
At the same time, Mr. Gaughran (pronounced Goren), a popular three-term Suffolk County legislator, is running what he calls a "grass-roots campaign" against "clubhouse politics" in Albany. Much of his financing, though, is coming from the State Democratic Committee, run by the Governor's hand-picked allies.
The 'millionaire' commercial is Mr. Marino's attempt to portray himself as a victim of a unfair campaign by wealthy Republicans to bring him down and elect a Democrat in the district. Mr. Gaughran has denied any links to the Pack-Up campaign, but has signed a conservative pledge never to vote to raise taxes.
Both are seeking to hold Mr. Marino accountable for all the sins of entrenched big goverment in New York that have worked their way through the Democratic Assembly, the Republican Senate and the Governor's office.
In turn, Mr. Marino, who in Albany has long been vilified by Democrats for his tenacious emphasis on local issues, like school aid, at the expense of statewide interests, is now trying to turn that to his advantage, as he works his district harder than he has in years.
For in this year of voter discontent and economic uncertainty, the big themes of American politics -- age against youth, incumbency against change, tax cutter versus service provider -- can be seen on this small stage of a Senate district that straddles the north shores of Nassau and Suffolk Counties, as this quintessential incumbent struggles to hang on.
In Albany, he is known, sometimes affectionately, as Mumbles for his low-key consensus-building style. But in the district, at the age of 64, a silvered-haired Mr. Marino has found his voice, and a relaxed style, as he portrays his incumbency as the very reason to return him to office.
"Mr. Gaughran is going to do nothing for you should he be elected; he would be a freshman with very little power," Mr. Marino said at a candidates' night at the Harborfields library in Greenlawn the other night. "When the Governor wanted to cut school aid for Long Island, it wasn't the Assembly that stopped him; I said no way, and that cut dropped from the table."
 
Debate Over Owning House
 Mr. Gaughran, 35, who has held public office since he was 26, shifted uncomfortably in his velveteen folding chair a few rows back as Mr. Marino attacked him for voting to increase taxes on homeowners without ever owning a home of his own.
Mr. Gaughran responded: "He is spending more than a million dollars in P.A.C. money and money from special interests to attack me for not owning a house. We, like many other people, are saving to buy our first home, but because of high taxes and because of people like Senator Marino, it is hard for us to do."
He said that Mr. Marino, as majority leader, had voted for every state tax increase and every mandate on localities passed by the Legislature, and had used his power to block important environmental legislation, including a state environmental trust fund that Mr. Marino derided as fundamentally flawed.
"He is selling Long Island out on the enviroment," Mr. Gaughran said.
 
Did Non't Protect Himself
 The district has a Republican majority, but became slightly more Democratic during reapportionment. Mr. Marino, though, thinking he would not face a serious challenge, parceled out some choice Republican districts to other incumbents, according to Republican aides.
Mr. Gaughran said he was taking his case to the people with an army of 1,300 volunteers and had gone door to door to introduce himself to voters in critical sections of the district. A campaign finance filing at the end of September showed that he had raised $74,000, including $40,000 in campaign services by the State Democratic Committee.
Gifts to Senate campaigns by the committee were rare in the past, and Norman Adler, a campaign consultant who has worked for candidates from both parties, said it was assumed in the business that Mr. Cuomo was backing Mr. Gaughran's campaign, something the Governor and the candidate both deny.
Darren Dopp, a spokesman for the State Democratic Committee, said that it was playing a greater role in Senate campaigns this year, and that by Election Day several other Democratic Senate candidates might also receive significant contributions.
For his part, Mr. Gaughran complains that Senate Democrats, perhaps cowed by Mr. Marino's campaign, have refused to contribute to his campaign. Officials of the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, which often aids endangered incumbents or promising challengers, say they just don't have enough money.
During the same period Mr. Marino reported raising $403,000, and has already spent much of it on direct mail, extravagant campaign paraphernalia including sponges ("Dip in water, see what happens"), potato chip bag sealers and an intensive radio and televison advertising campaign.
Mr. Marino says he is only struggling to defend himself from the Republican right-wingers in New York State, whom he angered when he made a deficit-reduction budget deal that postponed a scheduled tax cut and imposed more than $1 billion in additional taxes.
"There comes a time when all sides have to reach agreement on a budget; they don't want to acknowledge that," said Mr. Marino. He said that a few wealthy businessmen were spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to defeat him in order to increase their influence in selecting a Republican candidate for Governor in two years.
"Ralph Marino has the power to stop any tax and spending increase," said Scott Armstrong, who has been running the Pack-Up campaign against him.
 
Gaughran Takes Tax Pledge
 In their advertising, they denounce Mr. Marino for raising taxes, and praise Mr. Gaughran for signing a pledge never to vote for a tax increase again. They have done mailings in the district with the headline Marino=Taxes, and some radio ads, and say they may start a television campaign before Election Day.
This led Mr. Marino to file a complaint last week with the Board of Elections, charging that the two groups were covertly working together in violation of state election law. In turn Mr. Gaughran charged Mr. Marino with improperly using state-financed mailings for his campaign.
By the end of September Pack-Up reported raising $329,300, of which $42,400 was allocated to "educational effort on Ralph Marino." Both candidates predicted that by the end of the campaign, spending would exceed the $910,000 spent in a Senate race in Rockland in 1990, the most expensive Senate campaign on record.
Finally, Mr. Marino put the millionaire and butler on the air.
In a press release titled "Ralph Marino can't be bought?" the Gaughran campaign listed $130,000 donated by industries that benefited from the State Senate's decision to block pending legislation affecting them.
But it is far from clear that any of this is making a difference to voters in the Fifth District. Many said that what with the economy, and the Presidential race, and the mud-slinging Senate campaigns, they had been too preoccupied to read the mounds of campaign literature.
"People are just inundated," said Bridget O'Driscoll of Centerport, who has assembled a stack of unopened mailings six inches high. "They are looking for change, but they are not interested in local politics."

HEADLINE: More Doubts on Stempel at G.M.

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 22

 BODY:
John G. Smale, the leader of a group of General Motors Corporation directors pushing for rapid change, fueled speculation today that the chairman of G.M. is about to lose his job.
Mr. Smale issued a brief statement that said the board "has taken no action regarding any management changes at G.M," but he offered no support for Robert C. Stempel, the chairman and chief executive officer. 
 The statement only added to speculation that Mr. Stempel may be asked to step aside, which investors seemed to applaud. For the second day, shares of G.M. on the New York Stock Exchange climbed in active trading, closing up $1.875 a share at $32.875. On Wednesday, G.M. shares closed at $31, up $1.25.
It was not clear if G.M. directors were close to a consensus on precisely how to change management and who would replace Mr. Stempel, the 59-year-old automotive engineer who won the top job in August 1990, just as America was sliding into a prolonged economic recession.
One widely rumored prospect is that Mr. Smale, 65, a former Procter & Gamble chairman and chief executive who is credited with reinvigorating the once-stodgy consumer products company, would assume all or most of Mr. Stempel's duties for a term before turning them over to Jack Smith, the hard-charging G.M. president who turned around the auto maker's fortunes in Europe before the board fired G.M.'s last president and asked Mr. Smith to focus on the troubled North American operations last spring.
If the board decides to brush Mr. Stempel aside, analysts speculated that it must act before its next regular meeting on Nov. 2, given the whirlwind of speculation engulfing the nation's No. 1 auto maker.
On top of the rumors about Mr. Stempel's precarious tenure, G.M. said it would detail soon some specific decisions to close additional plants, eliminate versions of its cars and trucks and consolidate management functions. G.M. has warned investors for months that another round of cuts would be coming. Since last December, when it said it would eliminate more than 70,000 jobs and close 21 plants, it had only identified 14 sites it intends to padlock by 1995. The unusual crisis atmosphere at G.M., a company known for its quiet, management-by-committee style, was reflected in a hastily called news conference today to shoot down another set of rumors that the company is on the verge of wiping away its Oldsmobile division, the company's oldest marque.
Afterward, in an interview, John Rock, Oldsmobile's general manager, could not resist using the occasion to accuse Mr. Smale of a "cheap shot" by permitting rumors of Mr. Stempel's possible firing to go unchallenged. "A rumor is one thing," Mr. Rock said. "But when it gets attributed to a board member that's quite another," he said. "It's a little like kicking a tar baby. Now you don't know what to do."
Mr. Rock went on to say that Oldsmobile's investment plans are set through the year 2000, but he described a modest plan to "affiliate" Olds with G.M.'s Saturn division in order to study and copy the fledgling division's sales, marketing, retailing and service techniques.
But Mr. Rock said the two divisions would remain separate as would their dealers, stylists and marketing teams. "We're going to study the best of Saturn and incorporate that into what we do," he said. For example, Olds may sell models with a set array of equipment, rather than offer various options.
Olds, which has 3,100 dealers and 667 G.M. employees assigned to sales, marketing and promotion, has suffered from plunging sales for the past few years, and generally is acknowledged as the weakest G.M. brand. Last month the division announced it was putting its advertising account up for review; the division has been represented by Leo Burnett U.S.A. for 25 years.
If the board replaces Mr. Stempel, perhaps with Mr. Smale, other top executive changes are also likely as the board attempts to send a powerful message to investors, suppliers and employees that the company must accelerate cost-cutting and quality improvements to reverse G.M.'s weak financial condition.
Mr. Stempel -- he succeeded Roger B. Smith, who retired -- has encountered weak automotive demand and stiff competition since taking office, a time in which G.M. lost a cumulative $6.44 billion. He has also presided over a slew of new models that have failed to stop G.M.'s erosion of market share.
"He's a fine fellow, but he isn't tough, he isn't a decision maker," a former G.M. executive who spoke on condition of anonymity, said. An executive of a rival auto maker, who served with him on industry groups, described him similarly: "indecisive."
 
 
Short of Time
 But Mr. Stempel's supporters contend he simply is deliberate and methodical, taking more time to ensure he decides correctly. Time, however, may be one commodity G.M. doesn't have a lot of. For the first time in decades G.M. is pinched financially and losing customers to domestic and foreign competition.
Part of Mr. Stempel's mission as chairman, say analysts, has been to convey the gravity of G.M.'s problems and shake the organization out of its institutional torpor. But he counted on a cyclical recovery of automotive demand -- rather than swift organizational reform -- to lift sales and profits.
"Bob's got the old playbook that says you ride through the troughs, keeping things steady until business gets better," James Womack, a manufacturing consultant based in Cambridge, Mass., said. "It's worked at times but it won't work now, so you have this sense of paralysis."
David Cole, head of transportation studies at the University of Michigan, said he thought directors would be mistaken to remove Mr. Stempel. "It might push people in G.M. from urgency to panic." He add: "I'm not sure the board understands the business well enough to convert G.M."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Media;
Satellite Technology Allows Campaigns to Deliver Their Messages Unfiltered

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 22

 BODY:
They may call it the year of talk-show politics, but more accurately, 1992 is the year of satellite dish politics.
Consider this Jetsonian scene, live, from East Lansing, Mich., on Monday night: Samuel K. Skinner, an adviser to President Bush, sits before a Bush campaign television camera, contending that his candidate fared best in that night's Presidential debate. James Carville, an adviser to Gov. Bill Clinton, sits before a Clinton campaign television camera, contending that his candidate fared best. 
 Although Mr. Skinner and Mr. Carville were back to back, perched on stools 15 feet apart, they were actually debating, via separate satellites, on the 6:30 P.M. newscast of KCRA-TV in Sacramento, Calif.
Four years ago local stations would not have dreamed that they could put together such a confrontation, let alone have the campaigns pick up the tab. But now, stations like KCRA, which cannot afford to send even one reporter to the debate, can broadcast their own versions of "Nightline."
 
Perot Trails in High Tech
 While the independent candidate Ross Perot has drawn the most attention for using satellites as a substitute for conventional stumping this year, the Democrats and Republicans are running far more high-tech campaigns than Mr. Perot.
Finding that networks and local stations have scarcer resources to devote to political coverage, the campaigns are using satellite technology to get their messages out unfiltered.
Nearly half of all local television stations have used satellite technologies to get live, exclusive interviews with Presidential candidates this year, a figure that has more than doubled since the 1988 campaign, according to a survey of news directors by the Freedom Forum Media Studies Center at Columbia University.
This marks a major shift in how candidates deliver their message, and has dramatically affected how local stations cover politics. It gives the campaigns more control over the news, enabling them to bypass the networks for markets where they think they will win more favorable treatment.
 
Role for Campaign Surrogates
 The Bush and Clinton campaigns send their own crews to many events, putting them on satellite, free, for any station to use. Hardest to resist is when the White House offers local newscasters interviews from the Oval Office, via satellite, with Mr. Bush.
But most satellite time is used by surrogates, major figures from the campaigns or political parties, who spend countless hours sitting before a campaign's own cameras, spouting the same lines in back-to-back interviews to local stations around the country. (The campaigns write the name of the newscaster and the city on blackboards below the cameras so that those being interviewed do not forget who they are talking to.)
The campaigns go all out at big events like the debates, where they set up production trailers filled with cameras and editing rooms. The stations are told that the interviews are "satellite tours," but inside the campaign they are known as "cattle calls."
 
'Trying to Manipulate Us'
 "They're always pitching me somebody: Charles Black, Lynn Martin, Ron Brown, Mario Cuomo," said Ed Chapius, managing editor of KCRA, the Sacramento station, which is an affiliate of NBC and CNN. "Realistically, they are trying to manipulate us. Our job is to manipulate what they're offering us to our best advantage."
Mr. Chapius said it was his idea to have Mr. Carville and Mr. Skinner face off rather than give separate interviews, and he said the campaigns quickly agreed.
In the confrontation, Mr. Carville played to the audience, saying at one point of Mr. Bush, "He told the American people they were a lot better off today than they were four years ago, and I don't think the people of America or the people of Sacramento, Calif., or anywhere else buy that."
Mr. Skinner, echoing the President's own lines, said the campaign boiled down to one thing: "The issue of character -- who do you trust?"
 
'Dangerous' and 'Insidious'
 Gary Griffith, the Washington bureau chief for Hearst Broadcasting, questioned Mr. Chapius's decision to stage the debate. "By making it free the stations are trying to get some part of your newscast," he said. "The broadcaster doesn't control the camera itself or the means of production. It's dangerous and it's insidious, but in this economy it's hard to tell a newscaster to turn it down."
Sometimes local stations run what are essentially campaign advertisements on their news programs. After the East Lansing debate, for example, the President and his wife, Barbara, left the hall at Michigan State University to go to an upstairs holding room, where they taped separate interviews that were available free to stations across the country to use in their broadcasts. The interviewer was not a journalist but Russ Hodge, who heads the campaign's satellite operation.
Mr. Hodge's questions for Mr. Bush were hardly hard hitting. An example: "You were captain of your college baseball team. In baseball terms, how do you think you did this evening?"
Mr. Bush's reply: "With the World Series on, I think we brought a lot of people in that were on base. And maybe I ended up on third or second."
 
'Helping Public Education'
 Mr. Hodge says that what he does is a service to the local stations. "The whole idea is we act like a local crew for stations that aren't there," he said. "You could make a real argument that this is helping public education."
Jeff Eller, who runs the satellite operation for Mr. Clinton, said he would never do pretaped interviews, which he called "a video press release." But there is little doubt that Mr. Eller, a former journalist, values politics as much as production values.
On the wall of his office in Little Rock, Ark., right next to the television he uses to monitor campaign events, is a map of "persuadable markets," including Detroit, Chicago, Cleveland, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.
The idea is to make sure the campaign has a presence in these important markets, particularly if Mr. Clinton cannot get there himself. "These are markets that we need to be seen in in order to move votes," Mr. Eller said.
 
Strategy Isn't Secret
 During an audio check before a satellite interview with KOMO-TV in Seattle after the debate Monday night, Mary Matalin, the Bush deputy campaign manager, made no secret of the strategy. After popping a Certs into her mouth she waved at the camera and said: "Hi Seattle. You're not a target state. I don't know why I'm doing this."
In the past Republicans have outpaced Democrats in using technology, but this year the Democrats have been unusually aggressive, at times surpassing the Republicans in arranging satellite linkups.
The importance of these satellite interviews for the campaigns was driven home last week to Bill Wheatley, the political director for NBC News, after the debate in Richmond.
Mr. Wheatley said Clinton aides in New York wanted Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to finish a nationally broadcast interview with Tom Brokaw so that he could get to another studio and be interviewed on the 11 o'clock news at stations in the pivotal markets of Pittsburgh and St. Louis.
"We had 20 million people watching," Mr. Wheatley said. "But the most important thing to the campaign was that Cuomo be seen in Pittsburgh and St. Louis."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: House Race;
Colorado's Test for the Religious Right

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ARVADA, Colo., Oct. 20

 BODY:
The political power of the religious right, demonstrated this summer in its control of the Republican Party platform, will be tested soon in an otherwise obscure Congressional race here.
Without help, Bryan Day, an inexperienced and underfinanced Republican challenger, would hardly stand a chance against Representative David E. Skaggs, a three-term Democrat, even though Mr. Skaggs had 57 overdrafts at the House bank. 
 Mr. Skaggs, known in the House as a hard worker on matters like supporting abortion rights and opposing the space station, also has a record of involvement in issues important locally, like the Rocky Flats nuclear plant and a new airport in Denver. He expects to spend $500,000 on his campaign, while Mr. Day estimates his spending will reach only $150,000.
 
Little for Congress to Do
 But Mr. Day, a 34-year-old Baptist minister here, whose campaign emphasizes reducing the deficit, Constitutional amendments requiring a balanced budget, allowing a line item veto and limiting Congressional terms, can count on help because of the abortion issue he rarely brings up.
He said in an interview that he will vote "pro life" when he can, but contends that Congress will have little to do on the subject since he expects the Supreme Court to reverse Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court that legalized a woman's right to abortion, and leave the issue up to the states.
He hardly has to mention the issue. The Rev. Pat Robertson's group, the Christian Coalition, plans to mail out thousands of voter's guides showing Mr. Day as preferable to Mr. Skaggs, whom the organization has labeled "a foe of the family." More copies will be distributed through local churches.
Possibly more important will be the efforts of at least one group from Colorado's burgeoning list of "family values" organizations, Citizens for Responsible Government, an ally of the Christian Coalition but with more freedom because it does not enjoy tax-exempt status. "We'll be doing a flyer distribution at the churches" two days before Election Day, said Leslie Hanks, the group's executive director. The flyer will show a 10-week-old fetus and urge support for Mr. Day.
Since the Houston convention, many Republicans have worried about being tied too closely to the politics of Pat Robertson and other evangelical crusaders for family values. But here in Colorado, the embrace is welcomed.
 
Praise for Religious Right
 "As far as I am concerned, they can say what they want to about the religious right," said Bruce Benson, the state's Republican chairman. "The religious right works harder than anybody in the world. They will turn out."
Mr. Day can also count on from $30,000 to $50,000 from the National Republican Congressional Committee, enabling him to broadcast his commercials on the major television stations as well as the less-expensive cable channels, where they now appear. Mr. Skaggs has already invested heavily in local television commercials.
Mr. Skaggs raised the issue of Mr. Day's backers late last month at a news conference on the steps of the State Capitol. He accused Mr. Robertson and Mr. Day of wanting to "impose their own religious views on everybody else." Mr. Skaggs cited documents prepared by Robertson aides to their followers to conduct "stealth" campaigns that cloak extremist views on issues like abortion behind mainstream concerns like the deficit, and said that was the kind of campaign Mr. Day was running.
Mr. Day says no one recruited him to run, but that he just decided it was time that someone took on the liberal incumbent. Moreover, Mr. Day, the pastor of the very informal Foothills Community Church here, accuses Mr. Skaggs of "attacking my religion." He said that with the news conference at the State Capitol, Mr. Skaggs "has taken the first step down the road that Hitler took."
 
Talking About Fiscal Messes
 In calmer moments, the Third District's candidates talk about the economy. Mr. Day says he wants to do something about the "financial mess we're in," noting that Constitutional amendments on the balanced budget and the line-item veto are essential because "Congress has proved to the American people it cannot reduce the deficit."
The 49-year-old Mr. Skaggs described his approach as "fundamentally the Clinton message," emphasizing education, private investment and rebuilding the nation's roads and bridges.His television ads portray him as a friend of tax cuts for the middle class. The Marine veteran talks about his votes, including his opposition to a Constitutional amendment prohibiting flag-burning, proposed by President Bush and defeated in the House.
In the end, what may prove decisive for him is the chief issue that motivated organizations to oppose him: abortion. He insists that the district strongly favors abortion rights, and this week he broadcast two television ads that say "women should be given freedom of choice," while Mr. Day "wants to outlaw abortions even in cases of rape and incest."

Democrats File Complaint
 WASHINGTON, Oct. 21 (AP) -- The Democratic Party filed a complaint today, accusing a group founded by the religious broadcaster Pat Robertson of engaging in illegal political activity.
The complaint to the Federal Election Commission said the Christian Coalition was raising money as a tax-exempt group but spending it on pro-Republican activities.
The coalition insisted it does not need to register, because it does not endorse parties or candidates but merely educates its members.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Issues -- Education;
Rivals Agree on Need for National School Standards but Differ on U.S. Role

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA

 BODY:
In a campaign in which education continues to get lost someplace between the economy and character, the real question is not so much how candidates differ on the issues but how much education will matter in their Presidencies.
Broad philosophical differences do divide the candidates and shape their education policies. But it is striking just how much President Bush, Gov. Bill Clinton and Ross Perot agree about what ails American schools and how to fix them. 
 All three candidates endorse the idea, untried in American education, of formal national curriculum standards outlining what American students should be expected to know. All want some national testing system to check whether students know these things and how well their schools are teaching them.
They all say they would pay more for preschool programs like Head Start. They all believe that hiring and keeping better-qualified teachers means opening teaching to people without standard teaching degrees and paying more money to better teachers or those being lured from higher-salaried fields like science or mathematics. All three candidates want to give more power to principals and teachers and less to central bureaucracies. President Bush and Governor Clinton have both proposed linking high school and work through an apprenticeship program for students not planning to go to college.
 
Philosophy
How Big a Role For Washington?
 Yet important differences remain among the candidates. "Clinton is more of a believer in proactive government than Bush, who believes in privatism and market forces," said Michael D. Usdan, president of the Institute for Educational Leadership, a Washington-based group. "Clinton is much more supportive of investing in preventive strategies."
As befits a Republican, President Bush minimizes the role that the Federal Government can play in transforming American schools and turns instead to the free market. His education strategy relies not on money or Federal programs but primarily on an appeal to local communities, parents and businesses. These "consumers" of education must force changes that insiders like teachers and bureaucrats have stymied, the President's advisers argue.
This conviction that only competition will improve schools is the reason the President is pushing so hard for vouchers that would allow parents to take the tax money they otherwise would have paid for public schools and spend it on private or parochial school tuition instead. There is little evidence so far that such private school choice would improve schools, because only one small-scale experiment is under way, in Milwaukee.
As befits a Democrat, Governor Clinton sees a much larger education role for the Federal Government, with Washington providing more money, programs and leadership. His wife, Hillary, has worked extensively with children's advocacy organizations, and both Clintons place much more emphasis on the links between education and poverty, prenatal care, children's health and preschool programs. Governor Clinton argues that alienating the very education insiders who would implement changes would doom real reform.
And he dismisses the free-market model, saying that using vouchers would amount to using public money for private schools. He and other critics fear that vouchers would skim off the best students with the savviest parents for private schools, leaving the public schools with handicapped, disruptive or neglected students.
 
The Eclectic Perot
 Mr. Perot is, as usual, eclectic, guardedly endorsing at least a pilot version of a voucher plan beloved to conservatives but also promising to give even more money to preschools than Governor Clinton.
Educators have traditionally judged politicians by how much money they give to schools. All three candidates say money alone will not solve problems.
But of the three, Governor Clinton has pledged to spend the most money on education -- $63 billion in new money over the next four years, primarily for a new college loan program, full financing of Head Start and an apprenticeship program that would link high school students to jobs.
Although Mr. Perot has provided sketchy figures, his plan calls for $12 billion in new spending over the next four years. Most of the money would pay for a vastly expanded Head Start program.
Mr. Bush has repeatedly said that more money will not fix schools, and his education strategy does not offer much -- $690 million last year and $768 million this year. But education spending increased by 22 percent after inflation during his term. Head Start received the largest increases in its 25-year history, in part because Congress in most cases appropriated even more money than the President had asked for.
 
Proposals
Loans for College Draw Attention
 Of all the proposals, the one that has most caught the public imagination has been Governor Clinton's college loan plan. He would offer loans to students regardless of their income and let them repay them either as a percentage of their income or through national service. But details have been scarce, and the plan is more restricted than Mr. Clinton's brief descriptions suggest.
Many middle-class families earn too much to qualify for government-subsidized loans, but still cannot afford tuition. Although a new bill Congress passed this summer expanded size and availability of loans for middle-class families, Mr. Clinton's plan goes further. Loans would be collected by the Internal Revenue Service, cutting back on defaults. Because students could pay back loans as a percentage of their income, they would be freer to choose lower-paying jobs and might be less likely to default. Or students could choose national service jobs like teaching or policing, with small stipends paid by the Government.
Mr. Clinton estimates this plan would cost about $8 billion a year. Although he does not say so on the campaign trail, his policy advisers say he would limit the number of national service jobs available to keep costs down. But tuition experts say the costs might well be far higher.
Mr. Bush has also proposed expanding college loans, but White House estimates suggest his plan would increase loans by only about 2 percent a year.
The array of proposals leaves some important issues unaddressed. None of the candidates has proposed any measures to combat the huge gaps in education spending between rich and poor school districts. No one has discussed school desegregation, traditionally a responsibility of the Federal Government. No one has raised the question of why good programs seem to exist in individual schools but seldom spread throughout entire school systems.
 
Achievements
What the Rivals Can Point To
 More than offering any one proposal, however, each candidate needs to convince voters that he will actually do something to make schools better.
As with domestic policy over all, President Bush has been on the defensive about his record in education. Second only to the quips about "read my lips: no new taxes" come those twitting him about his 1988 promise to be "the education President."
Yet Mr. Bush claims education as his proudest domestic accomplishment. Even his critics praise several moves: an "education summit" in 1989 in which he and the nation's governors established six national goals for education; the appointment as Education Secretary of Lamar Alexander, a former Governor of Tennessee active in the drive to improve schools; several planks of an education strategy announced in April 1991.
Many educators endorsed Mr. Bush's call for national curriculum standards, national tests, parental responsibility and local community action to change schools. And while many educators dismissed the idea of creating entirely different "New American Schools," many now say a competition to design some has produced valuable ideas.
So far, Mr. Bush's plan has produced few tangible results. His defenders say that the most important accomplishment -- the creation of 1,700 communities across the country that have pledged to change their local schools and are supposed to be working on plans to do so -- is taking place outside Washington, invisible to pundits and education lobbyists.
But even those who endorse the President's conservative agenda say he has not done enough to push his plans through Congress or take his case to the public.
Of the three candidates, Governor Clinton has the deepest and most sustained involvement in education, both in Arkansas, where he has worked to improve schools, and on a national level, where he led the National Governors' Association's education efforts in the late 1980's.
Governor Clinton helped to bring about many sweeping changes in Arkansas's schools, including expanding preschool for poor children, raising academic standards, lowering dropout rates, requiring competency testing for teachers and encouraging greater college attendance. Arkansas now spends more of its budget on education than all but two other states. But like many other education policies undertaken in the 1980's, including Mr. Perot's drive as head of a state select committee to improve Texas's schools, Governor Clinton's policies have wrought modest, not dramatic, improvements in student achievement.
President Bush's surrogates charge that Governor Clinton, who has been endorsed by the two leading teachers' unions, is so beholden to education insiders that he would not make the necessary radical changes. Mr. Clinton's defenders point out that his endorsement of competency testing for teachers in Arkansas infuriated teachers' unions.
For Mr. Perot, education is one of the few areas where he can actually point to a record. With a skillful mix of money, lobbying and sound bites, he led a drive that in 1984 resulted in one of the most sweeping education laws in Texas history, paid for by its first state tax increase in 13 years.

THE RECORDS
President Bush has won praise for his appointment of Lamar Alexander as Secretary of Education and several parts of his education strategy, including calls for parental responsibility and local community action. But he can point to few tangible results that have actually improved schools. Critics say he has not spent enough money for education and has failed to push his plans hard enough.
Gov. Bill Clinton pushed through sweeping changes in Arkansas's schools, including spending more money, expanding preschool, raising academic standards and slowing dropout rates. Despite these improvements, student results have showed only modest gains, and Arkansas's schools still lag behind those of many other states.
Ross Perot led a tough fight to improve schools and redistribute education spending in Texas, enacting measures similar to Mr. Clinton's, but Texas schools also show only incremental progress.
 
THE PROPOSALS
The three candidates agree on many proposals, including national curriculum standards, national tests and giving teachers more freedom. Mr. Clinton sees a stronger role for the Federal Government and emphasizes the links between education, preschool and women's and children's health. Mr. Bush says schools would improve through competition and endorses vouchers allowing parents to spend public money on private schools.
 
THE SCORECARD
Mr. Clinton has the most hands-on knowledge about education. But none of the candidates' programs have produced enormous leaps in student performance to date. Much of the argument remains theoretical -- whether a stronger Federal role, more money, or competition are the keys to improving education.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
A Turbulent Session Ends Lower

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices ended marginally lower yesterday in a turbulent session influenced by stronger-than-expected economic statistics and some questionable trades in the Chicago futures market.
"It's been a volatile day, what with the data and the ruckus in Chicago," said Steve Ricchiuto, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Government Securities. 
 The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond ended down 7/32 point, or $2.19 per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, was 7.61 percent, up from 7.60 percent late Wednesday.
Bonds fell early in the day after the Labor Department reported that the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell to 368,000 in early October, the lowest level in more than two years. The decline of 15,000 claims in the week that ended on Oct. 10 was the third straight drop, and some experts believe the unemployment rate should decline if claims remain below 400,000.
 
Surprise to Market
 The report surprised the credit markets, which expected an increase of 15,000 in applications for unemployment insurance. Higher unemployment increases the chances the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates to stimulate the economy, a move that increases bond prices.
The market was also whipsawed by what traders called possibly improper transactions in the Chicago futures pits and an unusual intervention in the market by the Chicago Board of Trade to correct them.
Traders and analysts said someone who might not have had proper trading credentials made a series of large trades in Treasury bond futures that sent the market sharply lower. The transactions caused bond prices to plunge about a point.
Traders said the Board of Trade intervened, helping bond prices retrace their losses in the early afternoon.
Bond prices resumed falling late in the day, after the Government reported a much larger-than-expected growth in money supply, signaling that the economy might be more robust than bond traders believed.
Traders and analysts said the market was facing two big problems right now. One is a fear that Bill Clinton will be elected President and stimulate the economy through higher spending, which the market considers inflationary.
The other is the prospect of oversupply. The Treasury is auctioning 2-year and 5-year securities next week. It is expected to issue about $37 billion of 3-year, 10-year and 30-year securities next month.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, short-term maturities fell between 3/32 and 1/8 point and intermediate maturities fell between 5/32 and 1/4 point, the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported. The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures price movements on all Treasury issues outstanding with maturities of a year or longer, fell 1.83 to 1254.69.
Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 2.98 percent as the discount rose 2 basis points, to 2.93 percent. Yields on six-month bills rose to 3.26 percent as the discount rose 3 basis points, to 3.17 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 3.48 percent as the discount rose 4 basis points, to 3.35 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The Federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, rose to 3 percent, up from 215/16 percent late Wednesday.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 9415/16 , down 7/32 point. The average yield to maturity was 6.58 percent, up from 6.56 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Dow Chemical Net Plunges

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: MIDLAND, Mich., Oct. 22

 BODY:
The Dow Chemical Company said today that third-quarter net income plunged 35 percent because of higher interest expenses and taxes and a sluggish economy.
Net income dropped to $145 million, or 53 cents a share, from $223 million, or 82 cents, a year earlier. Earnings were eroded by a $46 million rise in interest expenses and currency-exchange charges. Sales rose 6 percent, to $4.8 billion from $4.5 billion. 
 Analysts pointed to prices depressed by a sluggish economy and a worldwide overcapacity of ethylene, which is used to make everything from antifreeze to plastics.
"This combination of a sluggish recovery in the U.S. economy, a severe slowdown in Europe and weak industry fundamentals globally have denied us the pricing flexibility to restore profit margins in basic chemicals and plastics," Enrique C. Falla, executive vice president, said.
Dow shares rose 50 cents today, closing at $54.75.
Operating income, or earnings before interest, taxes and extraordinary gains or losses, rose 9 percent, to $446 million from $410 million.
Third-quarter pharmaceutical sales increased 17 percent, while chemicals rose 5 percent, led by chlorine-based products.
Plastics sales edged up 4 percent, consumer specialty chemical sales gained 10 percent and consumer product sales rose 1 percent. Sales of agricultural products were flat, the company said.

3 Oil Companies Post Mixed Results

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

 BODY:
Three oil companies reported mixed quarterly results yesterday.
The Occidental Petroleum Corporation said earnings declined 64.3 percent and Ashland Oil Inc. posted a $103 million loss. But the Amerada Hess Corporation said it earned $8.7 million, in contrast to a loss of $7.5 million in the 1991 quarter. 
 The companies in many ways are atypical of the oil industry, which analysts generally expect to report higher earnings for the third quarter. On Wednesday, Texaco Inc., citing costs related to Hurricane Andrew, said its profit slipped 5.9 percent, while Amoco's income rose 61 percent.
Occidental is dominated by its chemicals unit, which suffered from weak demand. Ashland Oil and Amerada Hess are large refiners in the East, where prices and demand have been weak, but Amerada improved because of higher profits in oil-and-gas production.
Paul Mlotok, an oil industry analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company, said rising prices for natural gas and crude oil during the quarter hurt profit margins in chemicals and refining because both fuels are used as feedstocks in chemical and petroleum refining. "That was an industrywide problem," he said.
Following are details from the companies' earnings reports:
Occidental
 
 
 Net third-quarter income was $61 million, or 20 cents a share, compared with $171 million, or 56 cents a share, in the 1991 quarter. Sales were flat, at $2.3 billion.
Excluding special items, income for the Los Angeles-based company declined 55.3 percent.
"Chemical earnings continue to be adversely affected by worldwide economic conditions," said Ray R. Irani, chairman and chief executive.
Earnings for the chemicals unit fell to $31 million, from $79 million in the year-earlier period before a restructuring charge of $260 million and an $80 million charge for costs to meet environmental standards. Sales for the unit, at $1.08 billion, amounted to 47 percent of the company's total sales.
Occidental's natural-gas pipeline unit posted profits of $97 million, up from $56 million. The gain included the reduction of a legal reserve amounting to $55 million before taxes. Profit in oil-and-gas operations rose to $81 million, from $57 million, excluding a special charge a year earlier.
Occidental's share price fell 12.5 cents yesterday, to $16.875, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Ashland Oil
 
 
 The fiscal fourth-quarter loss of $103 million was in contrast to a profit of $63 million, or $1.07 a share, in the quarter last year. Sales rose 3.7 percent, to $2.8 billion from $2.7 billion.
The loss for Ashland Oil, one of the nation's largest independent refiners, was mainly related to the adoption of a change in accounting for the cost ofretiree health-care benefits. Ashland restated its results for the four quarters of its 1992 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, to reflect equal amounts of the special $291 million charge.
For the year, the company lost $336 million, in contrast to a profit of $145 million, or $2.66 a share, in the 1991 fiscal year. Revenues rose to $10.2 billion, from $9.9 billion.
"Fiscal 1992 was a difficult year," said John R. Hall, chairman and chief executive. "We believe a refining industry shakeout is inevitable."
Ashland Oil's share price fell 50 cents, to $25.50.
Amerada Hess
 
 
 Net income was $8.7 million, or 11 cents a share, compared with a loss of $7.5 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 6.8 percent, to $1.42 billion from $1.33 billion.
Profits from exploration and production carried the New York-based company in the quarter. The unit earned $32.2 million, compared with $20.8 million a year earlier. Refining and marketing lost $7.8 million, or more than double the loss of $3.8 million in the period last year.
Capital spending declined to $400 million in the quarter, from $481.5 million in the period a year earlier.
Amerada Hess's share price was unchanged, at $50.25.

An Essay Contest On the Peace Dividend

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
Peace contractors might never earn as much as military contractors, but a group of economists hopes to spread the rewards a bit more evenly. Economists Allied for Arms Reduction, an international group based in New York, is pledging $25,000 for the best essay on how to convert from a military economy to a peacetime economy.
The organization hopes to prompt more thought about how Pentagon cutbacks can actually further economic growth, countering those who marshal economic arguments against a leaner military. Considering the context, the prize money may not seem much of a motivator. That $25,000 might not buy more than a few wrenches or toilet seats. 
 Still, the economists are hoping that the word processor proves mightier than the Washington lobbyist. To publicize the awards at a Washington news conference today, they plan to deploy Oscar Arias Sanchez, the former President of Costa Rica; John Kenneth Galbraith, a Harvard professor emeritus, and Robert Solow, a Nobel-prize-winning economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Prof. Galbraith said he hoped to change what he said was the conventional wisdom the news media report about military spending. "It's well recognized that Government expenditures for the poor, for the South Bronx, are a heavy burden," he said, in characterizing these media reports. "When you get to the military, it ceases to be a burden."
In fact, he said, a dollar spent on civilian production creates more jobs than a dollar spent on the military.
Second prize will be $5,000, with 10 runners-up receiving $1,000 each. The deadline is March 1.

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims Drop For 3d Time

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 22

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to 368,000 in early October, the lowest level in more than two years, the Government reported today.
The Labor Department said the decline of 15,000 during the week that ended on Oct. 10 was the third straight drop. Many analysts had predicted a 15,000 increase in applications for unemployment insurance. 
 The previous low was 367,000 during the week ended Aug. 11, 1990.
Some analysts believe the unemployment rate should decline if claims remain below 400,000. The rate was 7.5 percent in September.
 
Enthusiastic Response
 A report by economists at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities in New York called the decline "a potential sign that the labor markets may finally be improving."
"Even though there is a very loose relationship between these data and the monthly employment statistics, the data are clearly pointing in the direction of improvement," the report said.
Secretary of Labor Lynn Martin said the report "indicates a much improved labor market."
After rising to 424,000 during the week ended Sept. 19, claims fell to 399,000 the following week and to 383,000 a week later.
But the Labor Department cautioned that recent claims numbers were being held down by some claimants using a special emergency unemployment program that is not counted in the weekly release.
 
4-Week Average
 Because of the volatility of the weekly claims, many analysts prefer to track a four-week moving average that smooths out the erratic changes and is considered a more reliable indicator of the labor situation.
The average was 393,500 during the period ended Oct. 10, down from 405,000 a week earlier and the lowest since 390,500 during the period that ended on Sept. 5.
Despite the overall decline, 44 states and territories registered increases in claims, while 9 posted declines. The national figures are adjusted for seasonal variations, but the individual state figures are not.
States reporting the largest increases in new claims were Pennsylvania, with 3,439; New Jersey, with 2,286; New York, with 2,271; Texas, with 2,250, and Washington, with 2,074.
States recording the largest decreases in claims were California, with 3,584; Kentucky, with 2,943; North Carolina, with 2,508, and Hawaii, with 1,290.

HEADLINE: Profits Posted At Caterpillar

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PEORIA, Ill., Oct. 23

 BODY:
Caterpillar Inc. reported today that it earned $23 million in the third quarter, breaking a series of six losing quarters.
The manufacturer of tractors and other heavy construction equipment cited improved sales and higher prices for the turnaround. 
 The profit of 23 cents a share was in contrast to a loss of $37 million in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 14 percent, to $2.68 billion from $2.36 billion.
"It's an improved quarter but we aren't celebrating," a spokesman said. "Certainly, $23 million is not much to write home about."
The spokesman said the quarter included sales deferred from earlier in the year as customers waited out a 163-day strike by the United Auto Workers union. He added that the company expected the fourth quarter to be "marginally profitable."
The company said its 1993 outlook depends on the strength of the economic recovery in North America and the timing of the recovery in Europe. During the six unprofitable quarters, Caterpillar's losses totaled $589 million.
Caterpillar's shares gained 62.5 cents today on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $53.50.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls as Early Bounce From Jobless Report Fizzles

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday against most leading currencies after receiving a short-lived bounce on news of a drop in the number of new claims for jobless benefits.
Gold prices fell. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $343.10 an ounce, down $1 from Wednesday. The Republic National Bank said gold fell $1.35 an ounce, to a late bid price of $342.40. 
 The dollar moved in a very narrow range with little news to push it significantly in either direction, said Curtis Perkins, a currency trader at Chemical Bank in New York.
The currency rose after the release of a Labor Department report saying the number of new claims for jobless benefits shrank in early October for the third straight week, retreating to the lowest level in more than two years. But since the statistic is considered a volatile one, economists were wary about whether the report showed any real improvement in the job market.
 
Awaiting Election
 "The jobless numbers did not have much of an effect besides a little movment to the upside from the knee-jerk explanations of what the figures mean," Mr. Perkins said. "As we waited for more information, it faded from our thoughts and the dollar went down."
Traders and investors are also waiting for the outcome of the Presidential election before making any bold moves in the currency markets, Mr. Perkins said.
In New York, the dollar settled at 120.73 Japanese yen, down from 122.60 late Wednesday. Earlier in London, the dollar fell to 120.55 yen. In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 122.36 yen from 122.38 yen at Wednesday's close.
At the close in New York, the pound fetched $1.6260, up from $1.6067 late Wednesday. In London, the British pound rose to $1.6230 from $1.6140 late Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's rates included: 1.5080 German marks, down from 1.5195; 1.3460 Swiss francs, down from 1.3575; 5.1170 French francs, down from 5.1575; 1,325.50 Italian lire, down from 1,335.00; and 1.24175 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2398.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday: 1.5080 German marks, up from 1.5075; 1.3475 Swiss francs, down from 1.3480; 5.1150 French francs, down from 5.1186; 1.6965 Dutch guilders, down from 1.6975; 1,323.50 Italian lire, down from 1,329.75; 1.2423 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2378.

HEADLINE: Dun Net Rose 11% in Quarter

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation's third-quarter profit rose 11 percent, led by double-digit revenue growth in its financial and marketing information divisions.
The company, which produces the Nielsen television audience ratings and Moody's debt ratings, said Wednesday that it earned $150 million, or 84 cents a share, compared with $135.3 million, or 76 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue for the quarter rose 8.1 percent, to $1.19 billion from $1.1 billion. 
 Operating earnings rose 4 percent, reflecting the impact of weak economic conditions on its directory information services business.
Operating revenue fell 12 percent in that division, while it rose 34 percent in the financial information services unit that includes Moody's and 12 percent in marketing information services, which includes Nielsen.
Dun & Bradstreet shares fell 25 cents, to $57.75, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Wednesday, and they were unchanged yesterday.

A Scaled-Back Visit From the Old World

BYLINE: By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN

 BODY:
Expectations were high in Carnegie Hall on Wednesday night. The La Scala Orchestra and Chorus was in town for the first time since 1976. This visit, meant to commemorate Columbus's exploratory voyage, was to have been part of a full-scale national tour by the Milanese opera company, including four fully staged opera productions here in New York. It was meant to be an offering for the New World from the Old, by an institution at the center of the Italian operatic tradition.
But economic problems and changes in the Italian Government (which picked up the tab for the tour), threw the plans into disarray. The proposed tour of a half-dozen cities shrank to one, and the stagings were jettisoned. What was left when the checks cleared were two performances of Verdi's Requiem (the second will be tonight at Carnegie Hall), conducted by the company's music director, Riccardo Muti. Though Mr. Muti has been heard quite often here in recent years, he left his post as music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra last season; this was the first time he was heard in New York leading the La Scala company. 
 There were aspects of this performance that repaid expectations. The 256 musicians onstage had a warm affection for this extraordinary composition. The Verdi Requiem, an operatic portrait of the soul facing the terrors of imminent death, has an unambiguous sincerity; its lyricism is not a matter of display or artifice. And the players treated the work with fervent dedication. There was a sort of golden hue to the tone of the orchestra and chorus coming from the familiarity of long acquaintance. On occasion, as when Mr. Muti pulled out the stops for Verdian triple fortes, the effect could be thrilling. There was no strain; the volume seemed to derive from a natural expression of passion.
This was achieved despite the fact that in exposed sections the orchestra's playing was not up to the best quality of international ensembles, and the chorus did not always articulate the Latin as crisply as it might have.
As for Mr. Muti, he tended to come to life primarily when the music was dynamically explosive. The Tuba Mirum was exuberantly loud; the offstage trumpets were in the third balcony and spread "wondrous sound" (as the text has it) through the hall. Other moments tended to get lost; the pianissimo passages had little sense of portent. The hints of mystery that began the piece never returned. The music was generally static, almost immovable. It was as if the conductor wanted a monumental performance rather than a touching one.
There were also times when the almost elemental quality of the music was taken for granted. Any interpretation of Verdi's Requiem must make dramatic sense of sudden shifts from fortissimo to pianissimo in a single bar, of blocks of a cappella singing alternating with outbursts of orchestral energy, of fury and fear shifting to melodic compassion. I didn't hear that on Wednesday: Mr. Muti tended to move from moment to moment, as if each could care for itself.
The performance might have also been helped by more compelling soloists. Among the Old World soloists, the soprano Maria Dragoni has an attractive instrument, but it was undercut at times by her swoops into phrases and her attempts to give lines emotional power by making them throb. The mezzo, Luciana D'Intino was less demonstrative, but lacked sufficient personality to give her solos urgency. The New World soloists, too, were less than satisfying. The tenor Richard Leech phrased well and produced his B flats with ease, but his emphasis was more on projection than introspection. Even the usually commanding Samuel Ramey tended toward the stentorian.
Wednesday's concert was greeted with audience acclaim, but at least for this listener, the strong relationship between the company and its native repertory was evident only on the surface. It suggested that another tour might be more satisfactory: a pilgrimage to hear La Scala at La Scala.

I Shall Not Return, the Giants' Moore Declares

BYLINE: By JENNIFER FREY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., Oct. 22

 BODY:
This should not come as a surprise. Another Giant is unhappy. Another Giant has harsh words about the coaching staff. And this Giant -- right guard Eric Moore -- has decided that he wants out.
Today, Moore, a five-year veteran lineman, told reporters that he will not be wearing a Giants uniform next season. He doesn't care if he has another year remaining on his contract. He's not coming back. 
 "No matter what, at the end of the season, I'm leaving," Moore said. "I will not return to the Giants. I will not."
"In my eyes, I feel that Wellington Mara and the Maras and George Young and Harry Hulmes -- I think they've been very fair to me," Moore added later, speaking of part of the Giant ownership and of upper-level management. "I just feel that after you drop below that level, I've always been kicked in the rear end around here and I'm just tired of it. I feel like it's time to go somewhere else."
The 27-year-old Moore, who signed a two-year contract worth $1.45 million on Sept. 7, said he informed both Coach Ray Handley and General Manager George Young of his unhappiness last summer and had requested a trade before the deadline passed on Oct. 13.
If the Giants do not trade him after this season, Moore will be forced to sit out the final year of his Giants' contract -- unpaid -- before he can look elsewhere for a job. Young indicated today that his respect for Moore as a player would lead him to try to trade Moore after the season, but the possibility of being unemployed next season didn't seem to upset Moore that much.
"When you're employed, if you're not happy with your employer, basically, you want to find another job," Moore said. "That's just the situation I find myself in. I have to find another job. If I have to sit for a year and then my contract expires, so be it, and I'll just look for employment after that."
Moore's announcement came one day after the Giants released veteran defensive back Everson Walls, who had often expressed unhappiness with his situation this season, and a few weeks following Lawrence Taylor's decision to call this season his final one.
Moore said that he had been miserable for his entire five years with the Giants, and that he did not want to be "in this atmosphere" any longer.
"Not everybody's going to be happy with his role," Handley said in response to Moore's statements. "I can't do anything about that."
Handley said today that he still planned to start Moore this Sunday and that Moore "had better be" as effective as he would have been had he not made the decision to leave. Moore promised that he would play to the best of his ability for the remainder of the year.
"I think he's been like a lot of the other linemen," Handley said. "He hasn't been as consistent as I'd like him to be. He's one of that group."
Moore took a great deal of grief from both reporters and the Giants organization for his failure to enter the game during a goal-line play against the Raiders three weeks ago, forcing the Giants to call a timeout in what eventually turned into a partially botched drive. The Giants kicked a field goal instead of getting a touchdown and went on to lose the game by 3 points.
Last Sunday, in Los Angeles, Moore was seen having a heated argument with offensive line coach Fred Hoaglin on the sideline after he was pulled from the game in the fourth quarter for missing a block on his man on a play.
"I don't like talking negative about my teammates because I think we have a good situation around here," Moore said. "But I just gave up one big play, a big hit on the quarterback, and I felt I shouldn't have been pulled from the game being that he had probably four or five big hits on him that day."
"But that's not what made me mad at Fred Hoaglin," Moore continued. "It was his sarcasm, that he kept saying things after the decision was made to pull me out of the game."
Hoaglin refused to comment on his discussion with Moore.
 
EXTRA POINTS
 The players hustled out of practice Thursday to avoid traffic tie-ups caused by the arrival of PRESIDENT BUSH, via helicopter, in the Meadowlands parking lot late in the afternoon. . . . The former Giants coach BILL PARCELLS made his first visit to Giants Stadium as a television commentator Thursday, meeting with Coach RAY HANDLEY after practice regarding NBC's coverage of this Sunday's Giants-Seahawks game. Handley, who also spoke with Parcells in the morning, has this to say of the man he succeeded as coach: "Bill and I are good friends now. We have been friends for a long time. We are friends now, and we'll be good friends long after this is over."

 It's too soon to guess which one-liners will become part of our national memory after the 1992 Presidential campaign. Meantime, the newly revised 16th edition of Bartlett's Familiar Quotations is filled with enough political wisdom to please even the most professional speech writer and spin meister. Justin Kaplan, the biographer of Walt Whitman and Mark Twain, has performed a service for students of language and literature by bringing Bartlett's up to date for almost the rest of the 20th century.
As general editor, he has shaken up good old Bartlett's (the first edition came out in 1855) and let its "self-evident propositions, ceremonial boilerplate, gassy platitudes and fortune-cookie sentiments" fall out. While retaining material essential to our culture -- Shakespeare leads with 1,960 quotations and the Bible follows with 1,591 -- he has added hundreds of items from the movies, books, theater, television (which turned out to be a slim source of originality), public affairs and politics. 
 Take politics and politicians. Former President Ronald Reagan -- who was caught delivering a fake Lincoln quotation at this year's Republican convention -- helped to make famous such movie lines as "Win one for the Gipper" (spoken by Mr. Reagan as George Gipp in the 1940 film "Knute Rockne -- All American," written by Robert Buckner), "Go ahead, make my day" (spoken by Clint Eastwood, written by Joseph C. Stinson for the 1983 film, "Sudden Impact") and "evil empire" (written by George Lucas for his 1977 screenplay of "Star Wars," not to describe the Soviet Union). These are more memorable than a puzzling sentence of Mr. Reagan's own: "It's difficult to believe that people are starving in this country because food isn't available."
President Bush makes Bartlett's with "Voodoo economics," "I want a kinder, gentler nation" and one he would probably like to forget: "Read my lips -- no new taxes." Neither Bill Clinton nor Ross Perot is in Bartlett's. There's a bright, if less lasting, quote by Barbara Bush at Wellesley College: "Somewhere out in this audience may even be someone who will one day follow in my footsteps, and preside over the White House as the President's spouse. I wish him well!"
Since the last edition 12 years ago, Mr. Kaplan has found fresh literary voices, who make the new Bartlett's a reference book that's actually readable. These are among the 340 authors included for the first time:
Toni Morrison: "At no point in my life have I ever felt as though I were an American."
Annie Dillard: "I had been my whole life a bell, and never knew it until at that moment I was lifted and struck."
August Wilson: "As long as the colored man look to white folks to put the crown on what he say . . . as long as he looks to white folks for approval . . . then he ain't never gonna find out who he is and what he's about."
Russell Baker: "The only thing I was fit for was to be a writer, and this notion rested solely on my suspicion that I would never be fit for real work, and that writing didn't require any."
Susan Sontag: "Illness is the night-side of life, a more onerous citizenship. Everyone who is born holds dual citizenship, in the kingdom of the well and in the kingdom of the sick."
Unless you need to go to the original source for context, it's helpful to look up something in Bartlett's because writings and sayings are often misquoted, misattributed and mistranslated. Consider the phrase "You could look it up." Don't bet your last sou or subway token that Casey Stengel said it first; he only popularized it. Thanks to the new Bartlett's, you can look it up and find that "You Could Look It Up" was the title of a 1941 story by James Thurber.
Two newly issued quotation books, which include modern as well as traditional sources, also deserve consideration because of their special qualities.
Although originating in England, the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations doesn't overlook American authors. Even some Americans not in Bartlett's are included here; for example, the playwright Robert Anderson: "All you're supposed to do is every once in a while give the boys a little tea and sympathy."
What makes this book unusual is its tilt toward British and foreign literature, as well as its insightful feminist quotations. Jane Austen, previously represented by her witticisms, is revealed as a greater chronicler of women in society: "Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story. Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has been in their hands."
As its title indicates, the New York Public Library Book of 20th-Century American Quotations is limited but lively. Its arrangement into 40 major topics makes it a challenge to track down a phrase, but it's useful if you're pursuing a subject by category.
The Public Library book is right up to the moment; it includes several pages of quotes on the gulf war alone. For example, here is Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf: "Once we had taken out his eyes, we did what could best be described as the Hail Mary play in football."
Inevitably, some quotations are repeated in all three books; or, as Yogi Berra said, "It's deja vu all over again."

From Clubs To Town Hall For a Gala

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
The economically fragile world of cabaret has always needed all the help it can get. And in the Mabel Mercer Foundation, an organization devoted to nurturing and showcasing cabaret talent, it has found an invaluable supporter. For the last three years, the foundation, established by Donald F. Smith, a cabaret promoter and friend of Mabel Mercer, has sponsored an annual fall convention that brings together performers and club owners from around the country. The focus of the convention is a series of low-priced gala concerts at Town Hall whose goal is to attract a young urban audience.
This year's events began at Town Hall on Wednesday with a tribute to Sylvia Syms, and continued yesterday evening with a songwriters' showcase. This evening's concert is a tribute to Mae Barnes, a cabaret legend who will give a rare performance. Miss Barnes, who is now 85 years old, became a fixture in the New York nightclub scene in the late 1930's, and during the 50's appeared regularly at the Bon Soir in Greenwich Village. She is known for her robust voice, her mischievous patter and her signature song, "I Ain't Gonna Be No Topsy," a playful affirmation of black pride that was ahead of its time. 
 Along with Miss Barnes, some of the performers scheduled to appear are Ann Hampton Callaway, Susannah McCorkle, Larry Woodard, Billy Stritch, the Wise Guys, Elisabeth Welch, Barbara Lea, and Blossom Dearie. Anne Francine is the show's host.
Tomorrow evening, another remarkably vital and engaging cabaret legend, Hildegarde, will preside over a gala concert that will feature more than 20 rising younger cabaret acts. The lineup includes Phillip Officer, Nora York, Sara Zahn, Baby Jane Dexter, the Manhattan Rhythm Kings, and Bill Wright, among others.
Show time for both performances is at 6 P.M. at Town Hall, 123 West 43d Street, and all tickets are $10. Information: (212) 840-2824 or (212) 980-3026.

Baseball as Politics: Chasing Wild Pitches

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE

 BODY:
In the boonies this week, eating breakfast on drugstore countertops, I kept making errors while fielding that second cuppa question: "Who you think's gonna win?"
I'd start to say, "It's all pitching," and stop as eyes rolled up and down the counter. Someone would clear a throat and say, "For president." 
 I'd mutter something about momentum and poke my nose into the home fries. What's wrong with the fools on the stools? To understand America, you first have to understand baseball. No wonder more people watched the debates than the so-called World Series (still really the North American Hardball Championship for Men). When will Americans realize that everything they love about politics is also available in baseball, without the risk of war or depression?
Baseball has "talking points," too. For example:
MEDIA INFLUENCE Don't you think Deion Sanders would have torn the Blue Jays apart if he hadn't been hampered and diverted by a biased media rooting for Toronto? Sanders threw cold water on Tim McCarver to express justified rage at those pencil-necked geeks who live in glass boxes and dare to interpret the bold and the beautiful who actually compete in the arena. (The fact that McCarver's baseball-playing credentials are still better than Deion's is irrelevant, maybe.)
FAT-CAT INTERESTS The so-called World Series is being played with "The Ball With No Name" because the statesman Fay Vincent was dumped by those avaricious, greedy, fat-cat, kill-the-golden-goose owners who couldn't stand him playing a romanticized version of Kenesaw Mountain Landis (a racist, second-rate jurist, by the way). This was an old role for Fay, who was a $47,500 Securities and Exchange Commission functionary in 1978 when the fat-cat owners of Columbia Pictures, bruised by scandal, made him the $250,000-plus president as "a healer, a Judge Landis." Four years later, when Coca-Cola bought the studio, Fay became a fat cat, too.
THE ECONOMY Because avaricious, greedy, fat-cat, kill-the-golden goose players are making too much money, the game is in serious trouble. Typical is the current situation in which American jobs and American workers were exported to enrich a foreign country. This is so difficult to explain that I probably couldn't do it even if I understood it. But suffice to say, the balance of trade has to do with three Canadian workers, Mark Messier, Adam Graves and Tie Domi, whose efforts for an American company could turn everything around if they only increased productivity in the critical final quarter.
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS Why were members of the American armed forces carrying the flag of another country, first on American soil, then, in apology for carrying it upside down, on foreign soil? (Could that well-known internationalist Ted Turner, the Goodwill Gamer himself, have asked his Braves to tank the Series to boost the self-esteem of our closest ally? Is it relevant that his team got to the so-called World Series on the base hit of a Dominican on a work visa who is earning $148,000 a year, baseball's equivalent of a minimum wage?)
THE NATIVE QUESTION The Tomahawk Chop, insult and embarrassment, is still with us; the fact that such sensitive political operators as Turner, Jane Fonda (who may have found God, or at least prayer, at the Series) and former President Jimmy Carter have done so little to placate the anti-Choppers leads us to ask the spin-pitchers why. They are of two minds; some sneer that Turner et al., have written the Indians off, figuring there are too few of them to matter, while others opine that keeping the chop wound raw will have impact on Monday's Canadian referendum. A yes/ oui vote on Canada's proposed redefinition will have positive implications for its long oppressed native populations.
THE CHARACTER QUESTION Now that David Winfield is an elder statesman and David Cone is a free-agent-to-be, it has become somehow declasse to remember that each left New York under a cloud. Winfield was involved with two of the most interesting characters on the sports scene, the Olympic statesman George Steinbrenner and the former heavyweight champion's former mother-in-law, Ruth Roper. In both cases, there were charges and countercharges, lawyers and settlements. Cone was a seminal figure in the Mets' apparently successful attempt to chill the media's interest in their lust for life. Cone was also named in a suit from which we can infer that he should have been exiled to the Montreal Expos.
AVOIDING THE ISSUE If President Bush hadn't characterized a Clinton presidency as equivalent to "sending some Little League guy to coach the Braves," we might never have known how important mere games can be.

HEADLINE: In 'Signal of Hope,' Sarajevo Utilities Are Restored;
Yugoslav in Appeal

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, Oct. 22

 BODY:
The Yugoslav Prime Minister reiterated his call for an end to the United Nations trade embargo against his country today, saying it weakened him in his political struggle against the forces of reactionary Serbian nationalism.
The Prime Minister, Milan Panic, also warned that continuing the blockade would cost the West a lot of money because it would be obliged to begin an expensive new humanitarian relief operation to help his people this winter as supplies run low. 
 But Mr. Panic's appeal, made in an interview aboard his plane while flying back from talks in Geneva, came a day after the United States and the 12 European Community countries said sanctions must remain so long as Slobodan Milosevic, the President of the Serbian Republic and Mr. Panic's archrival, refused to denounce violence by Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The statement said the trade embargo would remain until all human rights abuses in Bosnia and Herzegovina ceased, naming the Bosnian Serbs as "the principal offenders."
 
A Mixed Blessing
 For Mr. Panic, who describes himself as a man of peace opposed to "ethnic cleansing," such Western attacks on his main political rival are a distinctly mixed blessing.
He said elections scheduled here for Dec. 13 were "crucial to strengthening the forces of democracy and peace" and could lead to Mr. Milosevic's downfall. But with the sanctions, the Prime Minister contended, his efforts to promote peace and racial justice in the Balkans had yielded only "insults and suffering" for his country and its people and this played into Mr. Milosevic's hands.
The difficulty with Mr. Panic's stand is that he has not been able to stop the "ethnic cleansing" carried out by Bosnian Serbs supplied by the Yugoslav Army.

State Aid for Keeping Businesses

 BODY:
In the Letters column today, Vincent Tese, New York State's Director of Economic Development, points with justifiable pride to the state's contributions toward keeping critical businesses in New York City. State officials have participated in the delicate negotiations with companies that are considering leaving the city. And they have offered substantial financial incentives to complement those granted by the city. 
 In the recent successful effort to retain Morgan Stanley's corporate headquarters, for example, the state provided almost a quarter of the $40 million package of public incentives. In earlier successful retentions, the state's contribution ranged as high as $71 million. State and city negotiators deserve applause for their judicious use of incentives to maintain New York as a world financial services center.

HEADLINE: How New York State Helps Keep Business in New York City

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"How to Keep Business in New York," your Oct. 21 editorial about Morgan Stanley's decision to retain 4,100 jobs in New York City, fails to note New York State's critical role in maintaining the city's status as a world capital of financial services. 
 While justifiably applauding New York City's job retention efforts, you inadvertently help to perpetuate the myth that New York City and New York State act alone on matters of economic survival. In fact, the partnership between the city and the state has never been stronger.
You omit telling readers of the essential involvement of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and other state officials, who brought to bear both the personal commitment and the financial resources to make the Morgan Stanley retention coup possible. This personal and financial support also contributed to each of the other financial services success stories you cite.
Here's what you left out: In addition to our personal involvement, New York State provided a $9.1 million tax reduction to keep Morgan Stanley in New York City. The state provided $48.7 million in low-cost energy savings and $16.7 million in tax relief to keep 5,000 Prudential Securities jobs here for the next 20 years.
New York State also committed more than $27 million to prevent more than 8,000 commodities exchange jobs from moving to New Jersey. And although you don't mention it, some $71 million in state tax and energy assistance helped secure 4,500 Chase Financial Services jobs here as well.
The state's business retention efforts are part of a comprehensive, intelligent economic development plan. Our office maintains continuous contact with business and civic leaders throughout the city and state. We repeatedly and judiciously extend technical and financial assistance to businesses, both large and small, throughout New York City: from Wall Street to Far Rockaway, from Brooklyn Heights to the South Bronx.
We coordinate our efforts with local governments and offer joint assistance where appropriate. While this city continues to face tough competitive challenges, the record shows that New York State has helped save tens of thousands of financial services jobs here. Our investment earns a handsome return, in employment, in tax revenues, in ancillary business growth and in reduced public assistance costs.
Under Governor Cuomo's leadership, New York State has forged a solid partnership with the city and made a profound commitment to the economic future of all New Yorkers. Readers deserve to know how we are living up to this commitment through our investments.

HEADLINE: Among the Earth Baby Set, Disposable Diapers Are Back

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER

 BODY:
The war over how to cover American baby bottoms has ended in a rout.
Exhausted by their failure to convince parents that the nation's landfills have turned into reeking mountains of disposable diapers, many of the most zealous environmentalists have simply stopped trying. 
 The signs of surrender are everywhere. Three years ago 22 states considered taxing or banning disposables. None have succeeded. In 1990, New York nearly passed a law requiring hospitals to distribute pamphlets about cotton diapers to all new parents. This year a similar effort died in a day. Even the Environmental Protection Agency seems to have run up the (reusable) white flag. In its major new guide to reducing waste, the word diaper never even appears.
 
Environmentalists' Quandary
 "You know Freud was right about us," said Allen Hershkowitz, a solid waste expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, and a man who has long been plagued by his own ambivalence over the diaper debate. "Civilization has its costs."
Clearly one of those costs is disposable diapers. There has never been a more potent symbol of the national conflict between convenience and conservation. More than 17 billion disposable diapers were sold in the United States last year, and every child who uses them goes through about 4,500 during infancy. Cotton diapers, by comparison, which have swaddled babies at least since Alexander ruled Macedonia, can be used hundreds of times -- then recycled.
For years environmentalists fumed about the waste caused by disposables -- arguing that each diaper tossed onto the rubbish heap furnished fresh evidence that Americans would rather plunder nature than spend the effort necessary to preserve it.
"Let's deal with the big-ticket items before we ask millions of mothers to torture themselves," said William Rathje, an archeologist and director of the Garbage Project at the University of Arizona. "There are so many ways we are wasteful in this country that are not at the absolute core of modern American behavior. Let's start there. After all, convenience is something we should consider."
At first, the debate seemed one of stark contrasts: disposable diapers waste trees, often include plastics that can't be broken down, and account for a numbing amount of unnecessary garbage each year. Cloth diapers, on the other hand, which now account for less than 15 percent of the American market, seemed environmentally benign.
But closer scrutiny suggests the facts are less one-sided. Many of the trees used for disposables are planted just for that purpose. Excavations of representative landfills -- including Fresh Kills on Staten Island, the world's largest dump -- have revealed that discarded diapers take up from 0.5 to 1.8 percent of landfill space. Compared with old newspapers (which can account for as much as 40 percent of space at landfills), construction debris or food waste, diapers are about as big a problem as used sheets and towels.
Reusable diapers have their problems, too. They can require large amounts of water and detergent to clean. Diaper-service delivery trucks burn gas-wasting energy and cause pollution. In some Western states, like California and Washington, where droughts have presented major problems in recent years and landfill space is relatively easy to find, disposable diapers not only seem to many people more convenient but better for the environment as well.
"This is not a simple issue," said a senior E.P.A. official who insisted on anonymity due to the "sensitive nature" of the debate. "There are environmental consequences, health considerations, and issues of life style that all matter. And the right answer is not always the same for everyone. But it certainly is not something one should resolve based on ideology alone."
 
Freedom at a Cost
 It takes only a few brief conversations with harried parents to appreciate the overwhelming freedom that disposable diapers can offer. Even the most aggressively "green" parents seem to have ways to rationalize their use of such an obvious symbol of the throwaway society. Stricken by fear, guilt and conscience, some have even been caught hiding their Pampers when friends come to visit.
"I hate to admit what a chicken I was," writes a confessional Patricia Poore, editor of the quintessentially environmentally correct publication, Garbage magazine. Ms. Poore came out of the closet as a user of disposables in the current issue.
"I let myself be bullied by image," she wrote, explaining her initial view that cloth diapers were the only permissible route for someone in her position. "How else to explain that the disposables bought for travel days were locked in the glove compartment or hidden in my luggage?"
Yet, eventually, convenience had its way with her, as it has with millions of other parents. Disposable diapers are easy to find, easy to use and easy to get rid of. They almost always cost more -- about 25 cents each compared with as little as 7 cents each for cloth diapers washed at home -- but the washing takes time that many people are not willing to spend.
 
The Diapers of Tomorrow
 Of course there are some die-hard devotees of cotton. Services that provide cotton diapers have scrambled to make their product competitive. Cotton diapers have come a long way since the days when their rigid edges and flat pins brought tears to the eyes of mothers and babies alike.
"In the next year you are going to see a revolution in the diaper industry," said Anne Beaudry, an environmental consultant who frequently works for the National Association of Diaper Services. "You'll see the soft inner lining, the outer plastics, the snap closures and plenty of Velcro. The only thing that will be different is that you can you use them again."
Ms. Beaudry concedes that disposable diaper fans have overwhelmed the cloth contingent, and that legislation to limit the use of disposables has become a waste of time. But she and others say that millions of dollars worth of advertising from companies like Procter & Gamble -- which dominates the industry with Pampers and Luvs -- has had far more to do with the shift than any fair discussion of environmental priorities.
They also contend that ignoring the waste caused by disposable diapers because it represents "only" 1 percent of municipal refuse is foolish and shortsighted.
 
A Big 1 Percent
 "Because there is no overwhelming conclusion to draw from most of the studies that have been done on this issue, people think they can ignore it," said Richard Dennison, a senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, which, like most similar organizations, takes no official position on whether disposable diapers are acceptable baby wear. "One percent of billions of tons is worth worrying about. And if we don't think about how to address that one percent, which one percent will we address? "
Mr. Dennison argues that nobody can make proper assessments of waste by looking only at what fills garbage dumps -- or in what quantity. "These are renewable resources that are used once. And we can do better than that, even with disposable diapers."
Many advocates for cotton diapers now say the only way to limit disposables is to begin charging more for all garbage. Led by Seattle, many cities are now doing just that -- the more a family tosses out each week the bigger the bill they must pay for sanitation. If garbage costs increased sharply -- and many economists argue they should -- people might begin to take another look at the issue.
Until that happens, however, the diaper wars appear to be over.
"It's funny," said Judy Enck, a senior environmental associate at the New York Public Interest Research Group, who is an opponent of cloth diapers and proud of it. "I've seen backlashes before, but I never saw one this powerful."

CORRECTION-DATE: October 24, 1992, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about the environmental battle against disposable diapers misstated the position of Judy Enck, a senior environmental associate at the New York Public Interest Research Group. She and the organization strongly support the use of cotton diapers.

HEADLINE: The Art Market;
Antiques For Royalty And Others

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
WHEN the first International Antique Dealers Show opened four years ago, New York City had never seen anything like it. Rivaling the extravagant European shows, like the Biennale Internationale des Antiquaires in Paris or the Grosvenor House Antiques Fair in London, this was an exhibition that epitomized glamour and quality. It was also the first truly international antiques show ever to come to New York.
The timing was right: in 1989 the art market was still strong. Sophisticated collectors who thought nothing of hopping a plane to Paris or London to search for the best antiques now needed to go only as far as the Seventh Regiment Armory on Park Avenue to see offerings from the top European and American dealers. 
 But as times have changed, so has the show, although the adjustments are subtle. For starters, the British-based directors, Brian and Anna Houghton, lengthened the name this year, from the International Antique Dealers Show to the International Fine Art and Antique Dealers Show. While the show, which opens to the public tomorrow, still tips heavily toward the decorative arts, it also includes several dealers who specialize in paintings. "We added the words fine art because the paintings dealers felt they weren't being properly represented," Mrs. Houghton said on Wednesday while the show was being installed.
When the doors open tonight for the preview party, a benefit for the Society of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 78 dealers from such art capitals as New York City, Paris, London, Zurich and Frankfurt will be giving the market its first test of the fall season. The recession is on everyone's mind. Indeed, in this turbulent economic climate, dealers are struggling to strike the right balance between showmanship and saleability. More than in years past, booths will display a wide variety of objects, not just works to appeal to rich collectors or museums, but some that could be considered affordable, relatively speaking.
Despite the widening price range (there are objects that can be purchased for several hundred dollars and some that are many millions), the show has maintained its strict quality controls. Yesterday each booth was vetted by a group of dealers, scholars and experts, who reviewed every object for authenticity. Anything questionable was removed. Vetting is a practice common in the major European shows, but relatively new in the United States.
While this means the show still maintains its high standards, seasoned collectors who follow the major antiques shows worldwide will no doubt recognize some familiar pieces here. Indeed, in this year's catalogue for the New York show three dealers actually advertised the same objects they had advertised in the Grosvenor House catalogue only four months ago.
"Obviously, when business isn't good, it's inevitable there are going to be repeats," said Christopher Jussel, who runs Vernay & Jussel, a Madison Avenue gallery specializing in 18th-century English furniture and clocks.
A London furniture dealer, Jean-Claude Ciancimino, said: "We're all very worried about the recession. In England things are a disaster, but here we're feeling more optimistic. There are signs the market is picking up."
Mr. Ciancimino said that for this year's show he had purposely brought more commercial objects than he has in the past -- objects he described as "the kind of things that appeal to decorators." In the center of his booth, for example, is a round William IV table, eight feet in diameter. He also has an intricate Regency desk and three large chandeliers.
Some dealers freely admit that the show has mellowed with age. "At first everyone only brought superstar pieces here," said Mark Jacoby, president of the National Antique and Art Dealers Association and a director of Philip Colleck, the Manhattan antiques shop. "We were all out to prove something. This year we're striving for a better mix."
Mr. Jacoby pointed to a 1780 English sideboard. "I wouldn't have brought this in years past," he said. "It's utilitarian, and not particularly sexy. But buyers these days are trying to be practical."
Like all the other dealers, Mr. Jacoby is also displaying some prized possessions, including six black lacquer Regency chairs with different Chinoiserie decorations on each and a pair of chairs by John Gee, the cabinetmaker to King George III. Mr. Jacoby said he found the Gee chairs in a house in New Jersey.
"I don't have a crystal ball, but hopefully the doldrums are over," said Allan S. Chait, president of Ralph M. Chait Galleries in Manhattan, which specializes in Chinese art and Chinese export silver. "The show is settling down, but it still has glamour and show stoppers. That's what separates us from the other shows and keeps the challenge and the juices flowing."
In selecting items for his booth, Mr. Chait said, he tried to broaden his range. He has everything from Chinese export silver beginning at $1,000 to a rare Yuan celadon vase for $95,000.
 
Necessity Counts
 James Robinson, the 80-year-old gallery on 57th Street known for its antique jewelry and silver, also took a new approach to the show this year. "Everything we have is top quality; it's not a question of good, it's how to catch someone's eye," said Edward Munves Jr., the gallery's president. "This season we're concentrating on things that might be more necessary. If it's silver, it's usable; if it's jewelry, it's wearable."
So instead of tiaras or flashy necklaces at James Robinson's booth, there are quieter pieces: small ribbon brooches or rings or simple gold bracelets. Brooches start at $1,200, but Joan Munves Boening, who is in charge of jewelry, said, "The sky's the limit." A pair of diamond ear clips, for example, is $122,000.
Michael Ward, a New York antiquities dealer, is also providing diversity. The centerpiece of his booth is a mosaic dating from the fifth century A.D., priced at $500,000. He also has small bird brooches, for $350. "I like to have something for the younger collector," Mr. Ward said.
Inevitably in a show this large and important, blockbusters dominate several booths. By far the most exciting painting is the Bellotto "Fortress of Konigstein," which belongs to Bruno Meissner, the Zurich dealer, who bought the painting with Konrad Bernheimer, a Munich dealer.
Painted between 1756 and 1758, it is one of a series of five commissioned by the Elector of Saxony, Friedrich Augustus II, for the royal collection in Dresden. The painting is large (52 1/2 by 92 3/4 inches) and expensive ($14 million).
The two dealers bought the picture at Sotheby's in London in December, the same week Christie's in London was offering Titian's "Venus and Adonis." "At the time all eyes were on the Titian," said Mr. Meissner, who paid about $6 million for the Bellotto (which he called a "very cheap price"). Since the dealers bought the painting, it has been cleaned by the Alte Pinakothek Museum in Munich. "The Pinakothek is trying to raise the money to buy it," said Mr. Meissner. "And it's on a temporary export license because the National Gallery in London is trying to raise the money to buy it, too."
Mr. Meissner said the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif., was also interested in the Bellotto. The Getty now owns the "Venus and Adonis," bought by the London dealer Hazlitt Gooden & Fox and the New York dealer Herman Shickman at Sotheby's in London last December for $13.4 million.
Another museum-quality work wraps around A la Vieille Russie's booth: a 25-foot-long panorama depicting Nevsky Prospekt in St. Petersburg. The colored lithograph is by I. Ivanov. "We knew it existed from black-and-white photographs of works in Russian museums," said Peter Schaffer, an owner of the Manhattan gallery. "This came to us from a collector in Paris."
Right across from A la Vieille Russie, at the Chinese Porcelain Company, there is a monster of sorts, a five-foot-high Yamantaka, or Slayer of Death. It is a wood sculpture of a Tibetan god, dating from the Ming Dynasty. "The piece was taken out of Tibet in the early part of this century," said Khalil Rizk, president of the Chinese Porcelain Company, based in Manhattan. "It belonged to George Grey Barnard, an American collector who lent the piece to the Museum of Natural History for several decades." Mr. Rizk recently purchased the work from a New York collector.
Another unusual object in the booth is an 18th-century Chinese wine vessel in the shape of a goose, made of bronze and inlaid with gold.
"The recession has given me opportunities to buy major objects privately that I never had before," Mr. Rizk said. "Still, it's a difficult task to decide whether you're here to sell or simply show your best things."

HEADLINE: HANOI SAID TO VOW TO GIVE M.I.A. DATA

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 23

 BODY:
President Bush said today that Hanoi had agreed to turn over to the United States all documents, pictures and personal effects relating to American servicemen during the Vietnam War. Administration officials said the pledge was likely to lead to a review of American policy toward Vietnam.
The move is the most decisive and far-reaching Vietnam has made in nearly two decades to meet American demands for the fullest possible accounting of the missing. For years, Vietnam denied that there was any more to show or tell, and Washington refused to establish diplomatic relations with the Hanoi Government and blocked international aid to one of Asia's poorest countries. 
 "Today, finally, I am convinced that we can begin writing the last chapter of the Vietnam War," Mr. Bush said in the White House Rose Garden. "It was a bitter conflict, but Hanoi knows today that we seek only answers without the threat of retribution for the past."
He said the United States would increase assistance to Vietnam -- initially about $25,000 more for flood relief, according to reports from Hanoi -- and would begin helping the Vietnamese find and identify their own combatants missing in action.
Vietnamese leaders are no longer asking for the $4.2 billion in reparations they long insisted President Nixon promised in 1973, an Administration official said today.
President Bush did not mention the possibility of diplomatic recognition of Vietnam or a lifting of an American-led international embargo, but there is strong speculation that he might move to normalize relations with Vietnam before his term ends in January.
The President's announcement was welcomed by aid organizations, scholars and business leaders who have advocated an end to the isolation of Hanoi.
John McAuliff, executive director of United States-Indochina Reconciliation Project and coordinator of private and religious efforts to assist Vietnam, said today that it was the hope of many that the next Administration would take steps "as dramatic as the unprecedented willingness of the Vietnamese to open their military archives and their countryside to foreign investigators."
 
Skepticism and Suspicion
 Some members of the families of the missing were skeptical of Hanoi's intentions or said they suspected political motives on the part of President Bush, whose campaign appears to need all the boosts it can get.
"If the Vietnamese have given us 5,000 photographs, what else have they been keeping from us?" said Dolores Apodaca Alfond, head of the National Alliance of Families and sister of a missing pilot.
She was referring to a trove of photographs now being analyzed by the Defense Intelligence Agency. Pentagon officials said today that the photos had been collected by the Government over the last several months and were not a direct result of Hanoi's new pledge.
As he spoke this morning, the President was flanked by his special envoy to Hanoi, John W. Vessey Jr., a retired Army general and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and by Democratic and Republican senators who have been investigating the cases of missing Americans through a Senate committee.
 
Researchers Bound for Hanoi
At the Pentagon today, officials were cautiously optimistic that they had reached a turning point in nearly 20 years of investigations. The United States still lists 2,265 Americans unaccounted for in Indochina. More than half are known to be dead, but their bodies have not been recovered. The others are listed as missing, but officials assume that virtually all are dead.
Pentagon officials said the material turned over to Washington so far was just the beginning. The United States and Vietnam have agreed that American archivists and Pentagon experts will begin research on the missing in Hanoi at the end of this month.
Pentagon officials said today that some of the 4,800 photographs were given to the Pentagon by individual Vietnamese, but that most were funneled through an American researcher working in Hanoi, ostensibly on a book about the Vietnamese Army.
Officials said that the researcher, Theodore Schweitzer, had come to them offering to share information that he could not get published elsewhere. The Pentagon agreed to pay his expenses and provide him with a computer and other assistance.
Mr. Schweitzer began work in February or March. But it was not until the summer that the Pentagon became aware of the importance of the material being collected, and the role of Vietnamese officials, who were apparently placing pictures, documents and artifacts at the American's disposal.
Pentagon officials stress that the photograph cache poses countless new questions and suggests many new leads for further research. They are eager to test Vietnamese promises of more archival material. Among the pictures are hundreds of copied identification cards and newspaper clippings, demonstrating how meticulously Hanoi kept files on the Americans.
 
No Evidence of Living Prisoners
 So far, officials said, there have been no indications in the new material that living Americans remained in captivity after prisoner exchanges in 1973. Of 135 "discrepancy cases" presented to Vietnam over the last several years as the easiest to resolve, 2 have been effectively closed through photographic evidence, and the families of a fighter crew shot down in 1968 -- Maj. Joseph C. Morrison and Capt. San D. Francisco -- have been notified. A third family has also been shown pictures, but officials would not identify the case.
Major Morrison's daughter, Cindy, said tonight in an interview with ABC News that the Pentagon showed her family the pictures last month.
"We know for sure that he is dead, and that is a relief," she said.
American officials say Hanoi's decision to give up archival material was motivated by economic and strategic concerns. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and a former prisoner of war, who accompanied General Vessey to Hanoi, told reporters that the Vietnamese "are desperate for economic assistance."
The United States now blocks aid to Vietnam from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. An Administration official said that this kind of assistance -- allowing large and badly needed public projects like roads, airports, power plants or ports to be constructed -- is needed if Hanoi is to be able to complete its ambitious plans for economic development.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Overview;
PEROT TO EXPAND EFFORTS AS RACE SEEMS TO TIGHTEN

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Oct. 23

 BODY:
With signs that the Presidential race is tightening, at least partly because of his influence, Ross Perot announced today that he was intensifying his efforts with new purchases of television time and his first conventional campaign foray.
Mr. Perot, whose only public appearances during his 23-day campaign have been at the three Presidential debates, said today that he would attend rallies on Sunday in Flemington, N.J., and Pittsburgh. 
 Meanwhile, the Bush and Clinton campaigns backed away from their public predictions that Mr. Perot could not win, which only seemed to hand ammunition to Mr. Perot in his campaign against the political establishment. President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton retrained their sights on each other, with Mr. Bush warning voters in Kentucky and Florida that Mr. Clinton was a "tax and spend" Democrat, while Mr. Clinton urged voters in traditionally Republican Nevada to "go beyond the bounds of party."
 
Gore Is Cautious
 Mr. Clinton's running mate, Senator Al Gore, spoke gingerly when asked about Mr. Perot today. "There are some ideas that Ross Perot has advanced that we have also advanced," he said, speaking to high school students in Pensacola, Fla. "I have respect for him personally. I just think his plan is wrong for the country."
Vice President Dan Quayle spent the day in Delaware and Pennsylvania, announcing to aerospace workers at a Boeing Helicopters plant in Philadelphia that the Bush Administration was committing $1.4 billion to the troubled V-22 Osprey aircraft and promising bank workers in Newark, Del., that sticking with the Republican ticket would insure better times.
The announcement of Mr. Perot's travel plans thrilled his supporters in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. "It's going to be like seeing a Virgin Mary or an apparition or something," said Jay Goodwin, the manager of the Perot campaign office in Edison, N.J.
 
Three Deep Breaths
 Dr. Timothy Holloway, a Ligonier, Pa., dentist who is the Perot campaign's coordinator in southwestern Pennsylvania, said he had to "hit myself in the chest to prove that this was really happening" when Mr. Perot's national political director called him with the news this morning.
"I had a patient in the chair when the call came in and the patient said, 'Please take three deep breaths before you start working on me again,' " Dr. Holloway said. "Fortunately it was a procedure that was relatively easy, replacing a crown, and I was already halfway through it."
The Perot campaign also said it would spend $940,000 to buy an hour of time on ABC on Monday night, just before Monday Night Football, for Mr. Perot's latest television presentation. Between Thursday and Monday, Mr. Perot is placing 150 minutes of programming on network television, most of it gauzy reminiscences about his life and testimonials from his family.
That figure does not include the 60-second Perot advertisements that are flooding the networks and cable television. Federal financial disclosure reports filed this week show that Mr. Perot spent $23.6 million on advertising in the first two weeks of October, virtually double the amount spent by either Mr. Bush or Mr. Clinton on their entire campaigns in the same period.
Mr. Perot's trip comes when both the Republican and Democratic campaigns have expressed concern over the sudden improvement in Mr. Perot's approval ratings after the Presidential debates. But officials with both campaigns said they do not believe Mr. Perot is surging and that he may be near the peak of his support.
"There was a bump off the debates as if he had a convention, but it has been flat since," said Stan Greenberg, Mr. Clinton's poll taker. "If this is where it's going to end up it would be fine."
And yet, for the first time since before the debates, some public tracking polls have shown Mr. Clinton's lead over Mr. Bush dropping into the single digits, with Mr. Perot's support approaching 20 percent. Other polls give Mr. Clinton a more comfortable lead of between 13 and 19 percentage points.
A poll by the Gallup Organization for CNN and USA Today and conducted Wednesday and Thursday nights showed combined results of 43 percent for Mr. Clinton, 31 percent for Mr. Bush and 18 percent for Mr. Perot.
But each day's results taken separately showed Mr. Perot jumping from 16 percent on Wednesday to 21 percent on Thursday. Mr. Clinton dropped from 45 percent to 40 percent, while Mr. Bush remained steady at 31 percent. Each day's sampling of 501 registered voters had a margin of sampling error of between four and five percentage points.
"We are seeing a definite tightening, and some of it is Mr. Perot gaining," said Frederic V. Malek, a Bush campaign director.
Whether or not that poll has identified a significant trend, and tracking polls often take wild daily swings, Mr. Perot is clearly a factor again in the 1992 race, perhaps not to win, but at least to help determine who does.
G. Terry Madonna, a political analyst and poll taker at Millersville University in Pennsylvania, said he had stopped discounting the Perot phenomenon. "Here's a man who in a very unconventional year continues to defy conventional wisdom," he said. "As he becomes more viable, he becomes more attractive to an electorate that is very change oriented at the moment."
Mr. Perot's press secretary, Sharon Holman, said there was "no strategy" involved in selecting New Jersey and Pennsylvania as the sites of Mr. Perot's first campaign visits. Rallies without the candidate had been planned in both places by local Perot volunteers.
Officials with the Bush and Clinton campaigns said they did not see obvious reasons for Mr. Perot to campaign in those two states. Their polling indicates that Mr. Perot is stronger in states like Colorado, Texas, Montana, Wisconsin and the industrial Midwest.
 
Perot Responds to Bush
 Mr. Greenberg noted that anti-incumbent sentiment is strong in New Jersey and that the race between the major party candidates is competitive there. Mr. Clinton has a sizeable lead in Pennsylvania.
Mr. Perot remained closeted in Dallas today, as he has all week, but he used a Thursday telephone interview with The Los Angeles Times to respond to criticisms of his economic proposals by Mr. Bush. After Mr. Bush said in a CBS television interview on Thursday that Mr. Perot had some "nutty ideas" and that he was "kind of coming in from the fringe," Mr. Perot told The Times that people who stay in Washington too long "lose touch with reality and reality looks like the fringe to them."
"One of my nutty ideas," Mr. Perot was quoted as saying, "is everybody needs a job to make a living. If that's a nutty idea, put me away."
Ms. Holman did not disclose how Mr. Perot would use his hour of television time on Monday night. A 30-minute presentation that was shown tonight was devoted to warm anecdotes about his family.

HEADLINE: Washington Furloughs City Workers

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 23

 BODY:
The District of Columbia shut down most of its local government today, seeking to balance its budget by embarking on one of the largest government-employee furloughs in the country.
The one-day furlough -- the first of 12 that will be imposed over the next 12 months -- put 43,000 people out of work and shut down schools, day-care centers, garbage collection and other services considered nonessential to the public's health and safety. 
 The city workers, including the Mayor and her top aides, will in effect take 5 percent pay cuts as they give up one day's pay each month for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
The city's police and fire departments remained at full force, and the bus and subway systems, which are run by an authority serving the city and the suburbs, operated normally.
 
Federal Offices Stay Open
 Private employers and the Federal Government carried on as usual, and most of the city seemed tranquil on the sunny, warm Friday. For those who could afford the payless day, it would have been hard to pick a better time to play hooky.
The District is hardly the first jurisdiction to resort to furloughs. The state of Rhode Island furloughed almost all its 19,000 employees for two days last year. On Long Island, Suffolk County furloughed county employees for 10 Fridays in 1991. And this March, 1,400 park employees in New York City accepted a one-week furlough to avoid layoffs.
But the drastic steps taken by the nation's capital are a highly visible reminder of what a tight financial squeeze many state and city governments are in, with the recession sharply cutting tax revenues while spending continued to grow, in part because of the hard times.
The much-debated plan was thrown into last-minute confusion on Thursday by the courts. A District Superior Court blocked the plan early in the day, but the District Court of Appeals stayed that order later, allowing the furlough to take place.
 
Result of Political Standoff
 The furlough program was adopted seven months ago in March as a result of a standoff between Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly and the City Council over the District's $3.3 billion budget. Supporters of the furlough, led by City Council Chairman John A. Wilson, contended that the move would cut spending by $36 million and would represent the best alternative to Draconian program cuts or higher taxes.
For her part, Mayor Kelly had pressed for $27 million in spending cuts and $50 million in tax increases, including a tax on professionals who work in the city but live in the suburbs and new fees on private universities. But the City Council turned down the plan, which she hoped would have avoided the furloughs.
Critics of the furlough plan, led by the Mayor, say it is only a one-time solution that does not address the district's underlying problem.
Even with the furloughs, the city still faces an $111 million budget deficit for the new fiscal year. Adding to the city's woes in this year, Congress cut an additional $26 million from its annual Federal payment to the city just before it adjourned two weeks ago.
"It may be the least politically painful way," Mayor Kelly said of the furloughs in an interview, "but if you have to do away with quality services, everyone suffers and you don't solve the long-term problem."
And while the city saved money, residents paid a price for the three-day weekend.
Thousands of parents who normally count on schools and after-school programs to look after their children had to seek scramble. The furlough also froze local courts, the Department of Motor Vehicles and the city's parking-enforcement officers, who write about $100,000 in parking tickets on a typical weekday.
"I can't say I'm pleased," said Patricia Session, an employee at a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant who had to take the day off to care for her second-grader, Issac. "I would be at work. I didn't hear until yesterday that there was going to be no school today."
District employees, particularly the city's 12,000 teachers, were furious about the furloughs, and demonstrated in front of the nearly-empty District Building.
 
'Cannot Afford Pay Cut'
 "I cannot afford a pay cut," said Deborah Lyons, a teacher at the University of the District of Columbia. "I have a daughter in college, and this is going to cost me the equivalent of a semester's tuition."
But the district's fiscal straitjacket is similar to those of many other cities: tax revenues have been flat for three years, while spending has continued to rise. For Washington, the biggest fiscal pressures have come from increased spending to prevent crime. Under heavy pressure from Congress, the city has added 500 additional police officers and built a new prison and rehabilitation program with 650 employees over the past two years.
A recent survey by the league of 592 cities and towns showed a broad pattern in which stagnant revenues have been outstripped by spending on crime prevention, drug programs, homelessness and AIDS. On average, overall tax revenues are projected to climb to $552 a person in 1992, from $545 in 1991. But spending is projected to have climbed to $565 a person, from $547.
District politicians who support the furlough program said it represented the only way to avoid raising taxes on city residents, whose tax rates are already higher than people in the surrounding suburbs of Maryland and Virginia. "You can always affirm that this is painful, but that doesn't mean it isn't the right thing to do," said City Councilwoman Charlene Drew Jarvis. "If you don't want furloughs, are you willing to pay more taxes?"

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats;
Clinton Settles Into Theme Of Inclusion and Consensus

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FAYETTEVILLE, Ark., Oct.24

 BODY:
Settling into the groove of the traditionally long but cautious final days of a Presidential campaign, Bill Clinton spent his third day in a row carrying a message of inclusion and consensus to states that appear to be either solidly behind him or hold the possibility of upset victories.
Both the geography of the Democratic Presidential nominee's day and the unpartisan, somewhat Presidential tone of his speeches are indicators of his sense of the shape of the race, where it appears clear that the margin of victory in a three-way contest between Mr. Clinton, Mr. Bush and Ross Perot will be decided by independent and Republican voters. 
 In geographic terms, Mr. Clinton is spending a great deal of time and energy in territory where polls show there is a real chance he can steal a state that was regarded as inviolately Republican.
Ending a two-day swing of Western states with a Hollywood-flavored rally Thursday night in Republican Orange County, Calif., Mr. Clinton today took his two-jetliner entourage from a morning rally in the normally Republican state of Nevada to night-time speeches in Wisconsin and Missouri, two states where the polls suggest he is well ahead of Mr. Bush. In between, he was able to spare the time for a speech here, in his home state, on behalf of the Democratic Congressional candidate, John Van Winkle.
Speaking at the University of Arkansas, where he and his wife, Hillary, both once taught law, Mr. Clinton stood in front of the brick Old Main building to thank and rally his most faithful supporters.
"I will always be grateful to the people of this state for giving me the chance to serve, for working with me to do the things we had to do to move this state forward," he said. "Unlike the United States, things are going in the right direction now in Arkansas."
 
A Feel-Good Speech
 In matters oratorical, Mr. Clinton has all but abandoned the sort of partisan language used energize core supporters, turning instead to a feel-good theme intended to reach and reassure the Republican voters and the independent voters who were once supporters of Mr. Perot.
Speaking at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas this morning, he sketched a picture of a nation beset by an oppressive variety of ills but also facing an opportunity for "the greatest 20 years in our history." He urged his listeners to vote for him, not as a Democrat, but as a sort of national redeemer, a figure who would end the divisions of politics and move the country into a vague but glowing future.
"My fellow Americans, I do not seek a victory of political party," he told the cheering crowd. "I seek a victory for the American people. In times of change, Americans have to go beyond party."
Bruce Reed, a staff adviser to Mr. Clinton, said the candidate's typical speech in the remaining campaign days would probably continue along these lines.
Mr. Reed said Mr. Clinton's resolute depiction of himself as a "new" or "different" kind of Democrat helped also "in crass political terms."
"This inoculates him against the Republicans' only remaining line of attack," he said. "The Republicans' only shot at Bill Clinton is to paint him as a tax and spend liberal. He's not one and he wants to show he's not."
One past line of Republican attack re-emerged in a distant forum today. The Czechoslovakian newspaper Rude Pravo told how Mr. Clinton stayed with a family in that country when he visited there as a student in the late 1960's because he lacked money for a hotel. Republicans have raised questions about Mr. Clinton's trip to the Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc countries.
The Reuters news agency told today of a front-page article in Rude Pravo detailing Mr. Clinton's six-day stay with Maria Smermova, the widow of a Communist Party official, her daughter Jirina and son-in-law Bedrich Kopold.
The paper said the couple's son, Jan, was a classmate of Clinton's at Oxford University. Jirina remembered him as "a very kind young American student," the newspaper said.
If Mr. Clinton sees no gain in identifying himself in party-line terms these days, he still takes care to remember that he has opponents and to attack them. In Orange County Thursday night and in Las Vegas this morning, he continued to press the theme that it is Mr. Bush, not he, who is not to be trusted, and to criticize the President's economic record.
Increasingly as well, he depicts Mr. Bush in personal, dismissive terms as one who is fated to lose the election, knows it, and is desperate.
Interviewed from Las Vegas by a Miami radio station this morning, Mr. Clinton accused Mr. Bush of signing, in a "last-gasp" effort to save his campaign, a piece of legislation that he did not really support but that is favored by Cuban-American voters.
Mr. Clinton also says he does not dismiss Mr. Perot's ability to hurt him. He told reporters today that his campaign's surveys showed Mr. Perot's re-entry into the race had cost him "a little support," and that "Perot's going up may hurt me more than it hurts" Mr. Bush.
But if Mr. Clinton is still concerned enough about Mr. Bush to attack him directly, and about Mr. Perot to take indirect shots, the way he talks and acts increasingly shows signs of the assumption of victory. Today, for instance, the candidate was asked by a reporter about suggestions in an Associated Press article that some of his aides were privately saying that a Clinton Administration might delay seeking its promised tax cut for the middle class, if the economy did not show greater strength in the first year.
"Absolutely not," Mr. Clinton said, adding "I make the economic decisions in this Administration."

HEADLINE: Canadians Will Choose to Reweave the Constitution or Risk Its Unraveling

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Oct. 23

 BODY:
Canadian voters face a crucial national referendum on Monday to determine whether to confer special status on the country's French-speaking minority in Quebec and thwart a new separatist campaign.
Voters across Canada are being asked to say "yes" or "no" to a complex unity package, reached by political leaders two months ago in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, that would amend Canada's Constitution in order to meet, among other things, some of Quebec's longstanding demands for greater autonomy. 
 While Quebec would get special status because of its unique culture and a legal system based on the Napoleonic Code rather than on English common law, the amendment would make other significant changes, providing for a popularly elected Senate, giving the western provinces more clout in Ottawa, and guaranteeing aboriginal peoples' right to govern themselves.
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, a Quebecer, has tried twice in two terms to address the anxieties of a province that is a French-speaking island in a sea of English-speakers. He was asked on television recently why Quebecers needed the recognition as a "distinct" society when, for example, the Cajuns in Louisiana never had such protection.
"They weren't granted any distinctiveness, and the Acadians were wiped out," Mr. Mulroney replied. Without constitutional protection, Quebecers "inevitably become Cajuns," he said. "They don't want to become dancers in Louisiana with banjos."
Although the United States is officially neutral, Washington has quietly sounded warnings on separatism.
Despite warnings from the "yes" forces of increased regional tensions, more intolerance and financial troubles if the agreement is rejected, polls have shown the "no" side leading throughout the campaign, possibly reflecting discontent with the Prime Minister as much anything else.
Factions Rip Into
Patchwork Accord
Although the gap has recently narrowed in Quebec, a Gallup poll released on Tuesday found the accord seriously threatened everywhere except in the Atlantic provinces. The poll said 50 percent of Canadians are against the unity package, up 9 percentage points since an Oct. 7 poll.
"Yes" must win in all 10 provinces for the amendment to be ratified, according to the Prime Minister.
The groundswell of opposition caught political leaders by surprise. The accord is the handiwork not just of the ruling Progressive Conservative party but also of the Liberal and New Democratic opposition. Federal, provincial, territorial and aboriginal representatives took part in negotiations.
The complexities of the agreement make it hard to explain to voters, let alone promote. Both sides said it is difficult to build up much voter enthusiasm for legalistic compromises, a fact that the "no" side has exploited.
The "no" forces have also profited from regional rivalries, the failure of the agreement to meet the expectations of some interest groups and a general malaise over high unemployment and a sluggish economy.
But the "yes" side has yet to throw in the towel. The Prime Minister is still predicting a victory based on the large number of undecided voters.
Quebec's Premier, Robert Bourassa, a backer of the accord, justified his dogged optimism with a hoary allusion to baseball, which has suddenly become a symbol of national unity as a Canadian team plays the World Series for the first time.
Mr. Bourassa quoted Yogi Berra's favorite aphorism -- "it ain't over till it's over," adding, "We're still not at the end of the ninth inning." He and most other French Canadians are rooting for the Toronto Blue Jays, even though it puts them on the side of the American League rivals of the Montreal Expos. Much of the "yes" side's $5 million advertising budget has been spent on World Series commercials.
But Which Team
Is the Home Team?
 To demonstrate the bipartisan political support for the amendment, the Prime Minister, whose political tailoring is pinstripe conservative, is appearing on referendum platforms with political foes like Bob Rae, who heads Ontario's socialist-leaning New Democratic provincial government.
"The Prime Minister and I don't agree on a whole lot of things a lot of the time," Mr. Rae said as the two told students at Guelph this week why they should vote "yes" on Monday.
Their answer: the compromises would allow the country to better deal with its core economic problems, advance socially and protect minorities.
 
Fighting Separatism In 'Border Raids'
 The United States has not taken a position, but President Bush has repeatedly stated that he favors a united Canada, and Washington has quietly discouraged separatism.
The International Trade Commission issued a report in August saying that an independent Quebec would not be able to count on an automatic extension of free trade with the United States. While tolerable in the context of a Canada-wide agreement, heavy subsidies that the Quebec government has used for years to finance economic development might not be acceptable if Quebec were to become independent, the commission said.
The province is one of the world's largest debtors. Its foreign private debt is $25 billion, compared with about $30 billion in the former Soviet Union. American investors own about $15 billion of Quebec's debt, mostly in bonds held by state pension funds.
Prime Minister Mulroney denies that a "no" vote on Monday would be "a personal defeat for anyone." According to an Angus Reid poll taken last week, however, 73 percent of Canadians think he should resign or call new elections if the amendment is defeated.
 
Gutting Power Or Sharing It?
 Although the "yes" side has repeatedly stated that this is not a Mulroney agreement, his unpopularity has transcended the unity debate, and political analysts say many are likely to use their ballot to extract revenge for complaints against his Government.
"This is the crescendo of all that he has done, and if there's a loud clanger, I think he has to wear it," said Rafe Mair, a Vancouver radio talk show host who has galvanized much of the opposition on the west coast.
Mr. Mulroney says he will go about the business of governing the country, whatever the outcome. His mandate is up within a year anyway, and many expect him to call elections in the spring.
The agreement tries to realign the roles of the federal and provincial governments, an area in which the gulf between supporters and opponents is wide. Opponents like Pierre E. Trudeau, the former Prime Minister and a Quebecer, fear the gutting of federal powers. Advocates say there has been no big power shift.
The accord gives provinces primary jurisdiction over forestry, mining, tourism, municipal and urban affairs, housing, recreation, culture and manpower training, under arrangements to be negotiated. In culture, Quebec would have exclusive jurisdiction over activities within its borders.
A statement of national identity, known as the Canada Clause, declares that Canada is a parliamentary democracy, that aboriginal governments constitute one of three orders of government along with federal and provincial, that Quebec is a distinct society and that Canadians respect minority groups, ethnic and sexual equality and individual and collective human rights.
The amendment would create a popularly elected Senate with real powers to replace an appointed upper chamber, modeled after Britain's House of Lords. Under the amendment, each province would get six senators, who would be elected, except in Quebec, where the provincial government would appoint them. The two territories would get one senator each, for a total of 62.
A majority vote in the new Senate would veto natural resource legislation. A majority of French-speaking senators could block bills dealing with the French language and culture. On most other bills sent to the Senate by the House of Commons, the Senate could force a joint sitting.
The House of Commons would be expanded to 337 seats, and Quebec's representation in it would never fall below 25 percent.
Quebec would get three seats on the nine-member Supreme Court, a right the province has had since the court was established in 1876, to accommodate the country's two legal systems.
The amendment would give each province a veto over any change to these features of federal institutions.
 
Detractors Share Little But Distrust
 Opponents are essentially a grass-roots movement with little political or corporate backing and not much in common beyond a general distrust of politicians and a dislike of Mr. Mulroney.
The prevalent orneriness was summed up by an anonymous young caller to a Toronto talk show who, responding to the question how he would vote, said simply: "If the Government says 'yes,' I say 'no.' "
To Judy Rebick, president of the National Action Committee on the Status of Women, "what's happening now is an expression of how out of touch the elites of this country are with the people." One of her main complaints is that the agreement does not protect sexual equality, a point on which other feminists disagree.
The most influential opponent is Mr. Trudeau, who, unlike most in the province, believes in a strong central Canadian Government. He has spoken out against what he calls the Charlottetown "mess." He accuses Quebec of "blackmailing" the country with demands for increased autonomy against the threat of secession.
He also charges that the accord could override or modify the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Canada's Bill of Rights, which he integrated into the Constitution in 1982, and that this could undermine individual freedoms, a point contested by the "yes" camp.
Another major opponent is Preston Manning, leader of the populist Reform Party, who wants to give nothing away to Quebec. Mr. Manning, a sort of Ross Perot-type figure, also opposes self-government for aboriginal peoples, contending, among other things, that this would drain the federal treasury.
In Quebec, the "no" camp is led by Jacques Parizeau, head of the separatist Parti Quebecois.
The paradox has not been lost on anyone in Canada that the two arch enemies of a sovereign Quebec, Mr. Trudeau and Mr. Manning, are on the same side as Mr. Parizeau in this bizarre contest.
 
Eight More Years, Many Obstacles
 The Parti Quebecois's last effort to pull Quebec out of Canada failed. In 1980 it asked provincial voters to say "yes" or "no" to sovereignty. Nearly 60 percent said "no." But Quebec voters showed their unpredictability the following year when they re-elected the Parti Quebecois to govern Quebec.
Mr. Parizeau says that with a "no" vote he will accelerate efforts to leave the federation. "We perhaps at some point have to say to ourselves, for Canadians and for Quebecers, there's perhaps not much of a future in this."
Initially, the "yes" side, led by the Prime Minister, warned of catastrophic economic and political fallout if the Charlottetown agreement failed. For a while, financial markets took these declarations to heart, and there was a run on the Canadian dollar, accompanied by sharp falls in the stock market. The Bank of Canada was forced to boost interest rates dramatically, making economic conditions tougher for everyone.
But now the "yes" side has toned down its warnings, and economic markets, already anticipating a "no" victory, are calmer.
Mr. Bourassa's term does not expire for two years, but a "no" victory may force him to call elections sooner.
In order to achieve his separatist goals, Mr. Parizeau would not only have to win those elections, he would have to call for another sovereignty referendum in the province and win that, too.
Constitutional Affairs Minister Joe Clark predicted that a "no" vote would result in sovereignty for Quebec by the year 2000.
Mr. Parizeau, a bit cocky after the latest polls, calls the Clark schedule "a little slow," adding: "I don't have the taste to wait eight years."
 
 
 
THE CANADIAN VOTE
 
 
The Electorate: There are 18 million registered voters in Canada of a population of 27 million. Expectations are that more than 80 percent of eligible voters will got to the polls, a turnout higher than the 75 percent in last two federal elections.
The Issue: Voters are being asked to say "yes" or "no" to the following question: "Do you agree that the Constitution of Canada should be renewed on the basis of the agreement reached on Aug. 28, 1992?" for ratification, all ten provinces must approve the referendum.
In 1980 a provincial referendum on the question of sovereignty for Quebec was defeated by 60 percent of the voters
The Agreement: The agreement was signed on Aug. 28 in Charlottetown, Prince Edwards Island. It would:
Give greater autonomy to Quebec and other provinces
 Create a new popularly-elected Senate as Canada's upper chamber in parliament
 Establishe a process of self-government for native peoples
Adopt a "Canada Clause" that defines the nation as committed it to democratic values, sexual and ethnic equality and respect for human rights.
 Realign the Canadian Supreme Court to insure its adherence to both the English common law and the Napolenoic Code.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Corporate Taxes;
Clinton Seeks Taxes on Hidden Profits

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 23

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton's proposal to collect billions of dollars in taxes owed by foreign-controlled companies would tap into one of the richest, but also one of the most elusive, potential sources of new revenue available to the Government.
By aggressively enforcing existing tax laws, the Democrat would stop international corporations from avoiding taxes by shifting their profits overseas. He says he could raise $45 billion this way in four years. If his figure is wrong, one of the pillars of his plan to cut the Federal deficit will be seriously undermined. 
 Mr. Clinton's proposal is central to his dispute with President Bush over whether a Clinton Administration would have to raise income taxes on middle-income voters. Mr. Clinton says much of the revenue he plans to collect would come from corporations.
 
Shifting Profits Overseas
 At issue is a device used by companies that operate both in the United States and abroad. By paying inflated prices for products purchased from its overseas unit, a domestic company can artificially inflate its costs in the United States, which keeps its profits -- and therefore its taxes -- in this country to a minimum.
Under international tax rules this is illegal. Even related companies are supposed to price their transactions as if they were unrelated. But it is not easy for tax auditors to prove violations.
The Clinton campaign points out that in 1988, foreign-controlled domestic corporations took in $825.6 billion in receipts but kept profits low enough that they paid only $5.8 billion in taxes. Mr. Clinton's program promises to increase the tax collections from these companies by $45 billion over a four-year period.
His advisers say that that is a relatively modest target and that they seek only to collect what is due under existing laws.
Critics, including Bush Administration officials, argue that Mr. Clinton's goal is too ambitious and that collecting more taxes would discourage foreign investment in the United States. But it is hard for the Administration to criticize Mr. Clinton's proposal too strongly, since the Internal Revenue Service is already pushing hard to collect more of these taxes.
 
States, Too, Would Benefit
 Even before it became a matter of Presidential politics, the problem vexed tax officials seeking better enforcement methods. Legislation introduced this year proposed, in effect, to set a minimum tax on the business done by international companies. And the Internal Revenue Service has proposed regulations addressing how intangibles like software should be priced.
Both the legislation and the regulations have met with resistance from foreign nations and from companies that favor the status quo. But other new approaches, like arbitration, are getting favorable reaction.
Meanwhile, some aspects of the Clinton program are rarely if ever mentioned: that it would presumably also increase tax collections on American companies that use the same trick to shield profits from taxation, and that the states, too, would reap billions of dollars if the plan was carried through.
Many tax experts believe that Mr. Clinton is onto an important idea, although the exact amount he claims could be collected cannot be confirmed.
The current system of enforcing the tax laws "is close to being broke," said Gary C. Hufbauer, a tax expert at the Institute for International Economics. "And there is growing revenue in them hills."
 
Could Affect U.S. Companies
 Even if Mr. Clinton exaggerates the amount to be collected from foreign companies doing business in the United States, the same tax scheme is often used by American companies shifting profits to overseas subsidiaries, and if the crackdown extends to them, the Clinton campaign's revenue target might well be achievable.
Because tax avoidance is by definition hidden, it is exceptionally difficult to estimate how much money might be available from foreign-owned companies. The range of estimates runs from $3 billion a year to $30 billion, with the Clinton proposal assuming that the truth lies somewhere in the middle.
 
'Huge Amounts of Money'
 The President has repeatedly said Mr. Clinton plans to increase taxes by $150 billion over four years, an amount that Mr. Bush says could hardly be collected by taxing only wealthy individuals. In fact, the Clinton economic plan proposes to collect $91.7 billion from wealthy individuals, plus $58.3 billion by "closing corporate loopholes," including tax avoidance by foreign-owned companies.
Though enforcing tax laws on corporations would seem to be a politically appealing policy, the Clinton camp has evidently decided to focus its campaign promises on foreign companies, whose owners have less political clout.
Many states base their corporate taxes on how much a company owes the Federal Government. If it is true that foreign-owned companies are avoiding $30 billion a year in Federal taxes, the states are probably missing out on $7 billion a year -- more than the annual Federal aid to the states for mass transit programs.
"This is probably the largest single fiscal problem in the United States," said Dan Bucks, executive director of the Multistate Tax Commission, a non-partisan organization of 19 state tax agencies. "I don't know of any other issue that involves such huge amounts of money."
The $30 billion estimate, first published by the House Ways and Means Committee, is described by a committee staff member as a reliable "ballpark" figure. It was based on testimony by an I.R.S. official who had analyzed data on profits of international companies. The sampling showed that foreign-controlled companies consistently reported far less profit than domestic companies engaged in comparable businesses. The official calculated what tax would be owed if profits were comparable.
 
Widely Accepted Estimate
 Not only Congressional Democrats, but many Republican lawmakers, including Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Representative Duncan Hunter of California, and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, have accepted the $30 billion figure.
Subsequent studies by scholars and accountants have suggested that the lower profits reported by foreign companies are due largely to "innocent" factors like exchange-rate fluctuations, efforts to increase market share and differences in the historical accounting for depreciation of assets.
Even so, Tax Notes International, a respected trade publication, reported that the United States Tax Court is currently considering disputes in which the I.R.S. is claiming that United States and foreign companies owe $32 billion because of improper profit shifting.
And in 1989 alone, the I.R.S. proposed tax adjustments of $500 million against foreign companies and $4 billion against American companies for this kind of tax avoidance.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Campaign Finances;
Despite Economy, Clinton Sets Record for Funds

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 23

 BODY:
Despite their earlier fears that the recession would discourage contributors, Democratic fund-raisers have collected $62 million for the Presidential campaign, exceeding their record money drive of 1988 by about 20 percent, a senior Democratic official said today.
Rahm Emanuel, Gov. Bill Clinton's finance director, also said the party planned to spend $12 million, much of it in the final days of the race, on advertising that does not use the candidates' names but will nonetheless hammer home the party message, reminding voters of the stagnant economy. Four years ago, Mr. Emanuel said, the party spent $1 million for such advertising, which is not restricted by campaign spending laws. 
 Republican fund-raisers report that they have raised $59.9 million, also better than their 1988 showing, when they were slightly outspent by the Democrats. But according to filings with the Federal Election Commission, much of the Republican money arrived before the summer, when the Republicans were out-raising the Democrats by ratios of better than 3 to 1 in some months, and before opinion polls began to show a change in voter preferences against President Bush and for Mr. Clinton.
Ross Perot has given his campaign $46 million as of Oct. 14, $26 million alone in the first two weeks of October. The Texas independent, whose wealth is estimated by some to exceed $3 billion, has said he expects to spend more than $60 million by the time the race is over -- which will amount to only a couple of weeks' interest on his vast holdings.
The fund raising by the Democrats and Republicans supplements $55.24 million received by the Clinton campaign in July and by the Bush camp in August from the Federal Government in exchange for pledges by the candidates to limit direct campaign contributions.
About $10 million of the privately raised money may be spent directly on the Presidential campaign. Most of the rest is so-called soft money, which can be used for generalized advertising, voter drives and registration appeals. Soft money is also used for such things as bumper stickers and local canvassing, and is funneled to pivotal state and local races on which the Presidential candidates are running on the same slate.
Over the last decade, soft-money fund raising has grown from a relatively inconsequential aspect of Presidential campaigning to a dominant one. In 1980, for instance, the Republican spent only $15.1 million in soft money and the Democrats spent $4 million, according to the Citizens' Research Foundation, a California group that studies the role of money in politics.
Critics point to the extensive party fund raising as proof that the election laws have done little to limit the impact of big money in political contests. Indeed, the contributions have been raised with verve by the candidates' own financial aides acting in the name of the party as if contributing and spending restrictions hardly existed.
 
'Loopholes' in Financing System
 "At the Presidential level, huge amounts of private money are being raised, in a system designed to prohibit just that," said Ellen S. Miller, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group. "Today's Presidential public financing system is so ridden with loopholes that the public can take little comfort in it as a way of eliminating the influence of special interest contributions."
She noted that more contributions of greater than $100,000 were given this year than in the Watergate days, when the political excesses of large corporate donations prompted Congress to adopt laws intended to limit big donations. And five corporate contributors have given more than $100,000 to both the Democrats and the Republicans. They are Archer-Daniels-Midland, Atlantic Richfield, RJR Nabisco, Philip Morris and the Tobacco Institute.
But the Democrats have also benefited significantly from contributors who gave less than $200, particularly during the Democratic and Republican National Conventions. In June, July and August, Mr. Clinton reported receiving almost $7.2 million in small contributions, compared with about $3.4 million from larger contributors.
In the same period, the Bush campaign received only about $208,000 from small contributors and $3.3 million from larger donors. Democratic fund-raisers have said they had their single best mail-solicitation fund raiser on the Monday after the Republican convention.
Robert A. Farmer, the treasurer to the Clinton-Gore campaign and the main fund-raiser for Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic Presidential nominee in 1988, said the main difference this year was that the Democrats continued to take in large contributions through the fall.
"In the Dukakis campaign, our money slowed down considerably in September and October" as Mr. Dukakis slid in the polls, he said.
Political experts expressed surprise at the strong financial results, especially since the economy has been weak. For Mr. Clinton, who only six months ago had to go deeply into debt to keep his campaign alive, the large contributions surprised even his close aides.
Party fund-raisers and political scientists attributed the successful Democratic drive to Mr. Clinton's huge popularity gains after the Democratic and Republican conventions, particularly among smaller contributors, and to a fall finance drive that gained steadily from the growing perception that the Arkansas Governor was heading to the White House.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Voters;
Apathy Leads the Ballot In Struggling Gary, Ind.

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GARY, Ind., Oct. 23

 BODY:
In this city of abandoned stores and hard-to-remember good times, the Presidential campaign seems as far away as prosperity.
One of the only political posters up in downtown these final days is four years old and says, "Ministers for Jesse Jackson for President." 
 The sign hangs above an empty storefront.
Gary is part of the America many here say the candidates have apparently written off: a struggling, largely minority urban center, surrounded by richer and whiter suburbs. There is a quiet concern here that "black folks aren't on the priority list," said France Scurlark, a 75-year-old retired steel worker.
In Gary, there are very few Reagan Democrats, the white working-class voters the candidates have been chasing after like love-sick teen-agers. Those voters left town a long time ago, and the candidates have not been anywhere near Gary in years.
"Gary essentially is a black city," said Solomon Cameron, who has lived here for all of his 59 years. "Politicians have always taken black people and our votes for granted. This year is no different. Yes, I'd say, 'This is part of forgotten America.' "
But like people up and down Broadway, Gary's battered main street, Mr. Cameron said he would vote for Gov. Bill Clinton on Nov. 3. He is supporting Mr. Clinton not because the candidate has touched him with his vision for the future but because Mr. Clinton is not Ross Perot or President Bush.
Mr. Clinton may win by default.
"Perot is a comedian, and I think even less of the President," Mr. Cameron said. "That leaves me with one choice."
Despite the surface indifference to the election here, Richard G. Hatcher, Gary's former Mayor and now a law professor at nearby Valparaiso University, predicted a 70 percent turnout in the city.
"Gary needs a friend in the White House," said Mr. Hatcher, a Democrat. "Just the possibility that Clinton might be that friend will encourage a lot of people to come out and vote."
But Linda Harris, a 35-year-old clerk at So-Fine Fashions, said that although she would cast a ballot for Mr. Clinton, he would lose votes because he is taking blacks for granted.
"He's assuming because we're all tired of Bush, that we're going to vote for him," she said. "A lot of folks around here say they're not going to vote."
The support for Mr. Clinton, whether soft or solid, does not appear universal in this overwhelmingly black and Democratic city. Richard Taylor, 62, said he would vote for Mr. Bush. "I liked how he handled the gulf war," he said.
 
'Bush Is the Man'
 "These are tough times, and we need a man who can make tough decisions," said Mr. Taylor, a retired steel worker and former Marine who saw combat in Korea. "Bush is the man."
Outside of Gary and Northwest Indiana, Mr. Taylor will have more company. Indiana is the home state of Vice President Dan Quayle and has traditionally been a Republican stronghold in Presidential elections.
This, of course, is no traditional year. While Mr. Bush was nine percentage points ahead of Mr. Clinton in an Indianapolis Star poll in August, a similar poll taken Oct. 4-7 found support for Mr. Clinton at 42 percent, Mr. Bush at 41 percent and Mr. Perot at 8 percent. The poll of 803 likely voters had a margin of error of plus or minus three and a half percentage points, which meant that the major candidates were in a virtual tie.
Here in Gary, Mr. Perot is discounted by many, but not all. Jacqueline Jones, a shop owner, said she would support him because "the economy is the most important issue and he's a businessman, not a politician."
 
'Nothing Ever Changes'
 "But I really don't believe our votes matter," she said. "Nothing ever changes. The candidates couldn't give a hoot about Gary or any other urban area. We're being pushed to the side. I see a lot of apathy. People are disenchanted."
Those last sentiments were frequently repeated here in more than two dozen interviews, whether the voices belonged to middle-class blacks like Mr. Cameron and Mrs. Jones or to poor, struggling blacks like Nathan Davis, 47, and his friend Robert Hopkins, 28, who sell peanuts on the corner to survive.
In many respects, the concerns here sound like the concerns heard across the country, in leafy suburbs and in inner-city housing projects. The economy and jobs top the list, followed by health care, affordable housing and education.
But the worry about the future seems deeper in America's Garys because the residents often live so much closer to the edge. Here on Broadway, people also listed homelessness, police brutality and racial discrimination as important issues, issues that many said were being ignored.
"I think whoever has the money gets the consideration," said Yolanda Thornton, 29, as she waited for a bus. "We don't have it. As a black person, you get used to it. That's life for us."
There is plenty of pride and potential in Gary: beautiful beaches, fine lakefront homes and a short commute to Chicago. But there is not much else. There is no hotel, no major department store, no movie theater for Gary's 116,646 residents, 80 percent of whom are black.
While the state unemployment level was 5.9 percent in August, the most recent statistics available, Gary's unemployment rate was 12.2 percent. The steel mills that gave birth to Gary at the turn of the century and helped build much of the country have shrunk. One mill employed more than 25,000 people in the 1970's; now it employs 7,500.
Mary Fry can remember -- though the memory is fading -- when downtown Gary was bustling and confidence in tomorrow billowed into the sky with the smoke from the mills. She still works for a steel company and has raised two children here.
"There used to be around election time a whole lot of activity, but this time it's dead," she said, adding, "A lot of people just give up."
She, however, will not give up, she said, because "my children are grown, but I still have to worry about their future."
A few blocks away, Daniel Golden Jr., 22, was busing tables at his father's fast-food restaurant. He said he did not think black voters were being ignored by his choice for President, Mr. Clinton.
"Everybody here is for Clinton," Mr. Golden said. "So he doesn't have to worry about us. We're going to vote for him regardless. There's no other choice."
That is how Dionne Eallard, 27, said she felt: left without a choice.
"Blacks are in limbo," she said, turning from her desk in the finance department at City Hall. "It's been going on for so long. Ever since I've been able to vote, there hasn't been a Presidential candidate I would vote for or wear their button. Jackson inspired me, but I knew it was a no-win situation."
She said she would reluctantly vote for Mr. Clinton.

HEADLINE: Sticking With One of Their Men;
Clinton-D'Amato Is the Ticket for Many Reagan Democrats

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUFFALO, Oct. 21

 BODY:
Here in Erie County, many Reagan Democrats are finally drifting back to their party in this Presidential election. But a hardier species, which also came to life in 1980, survives: the D'Amato Democrat.
A striking number of Democrats who plan to vote for Bill Clinton on Nov. 3, after supporting Ronald Reagan and George Bush, say they will switch over to the G.O.P. column to vote for Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato. 
 The reasons vary -- some people say they simply believe in Mr. D'Amato's self-characterization as the "Senator Pothole" who has gotten things done, while others say they like the idea of backing a Republican to keep an eye on what they assume will be a Democratic White House. And one man here laughingly -- but favorably -- likened Mr. D'Amato's bombastic tenure to "getting to watch your crazy uncle go to the Senate."
Many of the voters say they blame President Bush for the state of the economy. But there appears to be less inclination to fault Senator D'Amato personally, even though he has generally supported Republican policies for 12 years now.
 
Not Inspiring Trust
 And many say they are D'Amato Democrats by default -- less from any continuing ardor for the Senator than from distaste for his opponent, Attorney General Robert Abrams.
Mr. Abrams has had to contend throughout this campaign with a cease less wave of commercials from the D'Amato camp, seeking to transform him from a mild-mannered public servant into a vicious mudslinger who is "hopelessly liberal."
"Don't ask me what it is, I just don't trust Abrams anymore," said Betty A. Sienkiewicz of Buffalo, "and if anybody should like him, it's me -- my maiden name is Abrams." (She is no relation.)
Frank Mulderig, a laborer for the city Buildings Department, said of Mr. Abrams, "He's the kind of a guy who, if you told him he had $200 to spend on a problem, he'd figure out a way to spend $250."
Said Jack Giardina, owner of the Basilica Diner in Lackawanna, "When it comes to holding the line on spending, you just need a more conservative guy than Abrams."
None of these comments, of course, can be taken as any indication that Mr. D'Amato will win the election. In a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans by nearly three to two, and where Mr. Clinton could attract a huge Democratic turnout, Mr. Abrams could probably prevail in this election even if a substantial number of conservative Democrats defect to Mr. D'Amato.
 
Still a Chance
 Certainly there are plenty of Reagan Democrats here who say that their re-found allegiance to the Democratic Party will include a vote for Mr. Abrams. And Mr. Abrams could win back many more conservative Democrats in the coming days: Vastly outfinanced by Mr. D'Amato, he is just beginning to unleash the advertising blitz his aides have promised for the final days of the campaign.
But interviews with more than 80 registered voters and recent polls indicate that with less than two weeks until Election Day, Mr. D'Amato is running a far more competitive race against Mr. Abrams here than President Bush is against Mr. Clinton. They also suggest that one important part of Mr. D'Amato's strategy -- holding on to many of the conservative Democrats who helped him squeak into the Senate in 1980 and win comfortably in 1986 -- could well be successful. His opposition to higher taxes and higher spending and support for the death penalty -- all classic Reagan Democrat issues -- have figured prominently in his ad campaign.
There is probably no better place to find the D'Amato Democrats than in largely blue-collar Erie County, which consists of Buffalo and its outlying suburbs and factory towns. Many voters here combine a virtually genetic registration in the Democratic Party with conservative values that have led many in recent years to vote for Republicans anyway.
In Mr. D'Amato's case, the numbers here are clear enough. There are 269,737 registered Democrats in Erie County and 165,190 Republicans, a margin that has persisted through the decade, and yet Mr. D'Amato handily won the county in elections in 1980 and 1986.
Mr. D'Amato got 168,641 votes in 1986 to 116,357 for the Democratic nominee, Mark Green. In 1980, he beat Elizabeth Holtzman 207,292 to 144,207.
 
Issues, Not Insults
 One remarkable undercurrent of this election season, in which Mr. Clinton may have successfully fended off queries about extramarital relations and his draft status by challenging voters to "stick to the real issues," like the economy, is that candidates like Mr. D'Amato may succeed in doing the same thing with questions that would seem to go to the heart of the public trust.
The Senator has been the subject of numerous investigations into allegations that he improperly intervened on behalf of his financial supporters, and a Senate Ethics Committee report said he improperly allowed his brother, who has since been indicted, to use his office for lobbying activities. But in a series of pre-emptive strikes, Mr. D'Amato has attacked Mr. Abrams's ethics in a series of television advertisements that seem to have helped the Senator by fueling the disgust of many voters with "mudslinging."
Many people here reacted with hostility when asked whether they were concerned about Mr. D'Amato's ethics.
"I just don't want to hear about any of the dirt, O.K.?" said Larry Kucharski, a 42-year-old warehouse worker in Buffalo's East Side and a Democrat who said he would vote for Mr. D'Amato again because he thought there was less chance he would vote to raise taxes. "Whatever happened in the past doesn't bother me. The only thing I want to know in this election is, what are you going to do for me?"
Some people, in fact, specifically said they were impressed with Mr. D'Amato's counterattacks. "The guy's had a lot of negative publicity, and he stood up to the negativity," said Mark Ruffato, a 31-year-old driver for the Pepsi-Cola company in Buffalo.
Mr. D'Amato also seems to have been spared much of the blame for a sluggish economy.
"When you're President, if things go wrong, you can't really say, 'Well, someone else did it,' " said Bonnie Boechel, a 26-year-old waitress in Lackawanna, N.Y. "But D'Amato, I think he's been trying to do something all these years, and it's not like you can totally blame him for the mess."
Mr. Mulderig, after beginning a lengthy tirade about what the Reagan and Bush Administrations had done to ruin the economy, was asked why he planned to vote again for Mr. D'Amato, a Republican in Washington during all that time. "You got me there," he said with a laugh. "I really don't know what to say."
 
'A Loudmouth'
 Still, many Democrats remain undecided, and even if they find Mr. D'Amato vaguely amusing, they are beginning to question just what he has accomplished.
"I don't know about this image D'Amato portrays," said Larry Brady, a 43-year-old construction worker at a site on Chippewa Street in Buffalo's downtown. "He's a bit of a loudmouth, he's always shooting his mouth off, but I'd like it more if I felt he was making more sense." Mr. Brady said he is leaning toward Mr. Abrams.
But even as they harbor doubts about Mr. D'Amato, the voters are also clearly wondering about Mr. Abrams. Two weeks ago, his frustration with Mr. D'Amato's attacks finally got the better of him, and he referred to the Senator as a "fascist" at a campaign rally. While few people here said they believed Mr. D'Amato's suggestions that it was an anti-Italian slur, several people said the incident made them wonder whether Mr. Abrams was too intemperate to be a good Senator.
"These guys are supposed to know what they're doing," said Alan Riley, a sports-card dealer, who had spread his wares at a table in the cavernous 110-year-old Broadway Market in Buffalo. "If you're a politician, you should give an awful lot of thought to what you're saying, particularly when you're going to slanderize your opponent."
Carol Wagner, a bakery saleswoman and Democrat who said she will vote for Mr. D'Amato, said the incident confirmed an impression of hers that Mr. Abrams was not ready for "the big leagues" in Washington.
"If you're going to speak in front of people, you should know what you're going to say," she said.
 
Many Still Undecided
 To be sure, many voters remain undecided, and some threaten to skip over the Senate race altogether when they get into the voting booth, although past elections suggest that most voters in the end will choose sides in both races. Still, with Mr. Abrams having begun his campaign for the Democratic nomination by arguing that he was the best candidate to take on Mr. D'Amato over ethics issues, the general mood of disillusionment cannot be encouraging.
"I don't agree with all the mudslinging," said Ron Lewandowski, a produce dealer at the Broadway Market. "It's like a cancer, spreading, spreading, but at this point, I'm not even interested in knowing which candidate started it."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Environmental Policy;
BUSH TO ANNOUNCE ENVIRONMENT PLAN

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 23

 BODY:
The White House is planning to announce a series of environmental regulations next week to focus attention on President Bush's environmental program just before the election, Administration officials and critics of the Administration said today.
Although the announcements appear to be aimed in part at fending off assertions that the White House has undermined clean-air laws, some of the rules may lead to additional criticism of the Administration's environmental record. 
 Indeed, the political strategy appears aimed in part at highlighting the Administration's differences with the Clinton campaign, appealing to industries that favor the Bush environmental program and the efforts of the White House Council on Competitiveness, led by Vice President Dan Quayle, to soften the impact of clean-air regulations on industry.
To some extent, the way the regulations are received depends on whether they include provisions that have been pushed by White House officials over the objections of the Environmental Protection Agency.
 
Signs of Softening
 Conflicts between the agency and White House offices over environmental issues have long held up important environmental regulations. Last month, the White House showed signs of softening some of its positions, when the White House chief of staff, James A. Baker 3d, ordered changes in a rule that would have allowed manufacturers to dispose of hazardous wastes in town dumps.
At the time, Bush Administration officials said the change was made out of concern that the Bush campaign had become vulnerable to Democratic criticism on the environment.
But in the past week, President Bush has been harshly critical of the Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate, Senator Al Gore, calling him "Mr. Ozone" for his views on how to cut air pollution.
The Sierra Club, which has been critical of the Administration's record, said it had learned of five announcements, one scheduled for each day beginning Monday. Environmental groups were issued invitations on Thursday to briefings on some of the announcements.
"This last minute flurry of activity will not obscure the fact that the Bush Administration has failed to issue dozens of needed regulations required under the Clean Air Act of 1990," said Blake Early, a Sierra Club official.
 
Political Purposes
 A White House official said that while some of the regulations had been moving through the normal review process for months, announcing them right before the election also served political purposes.
Some of the rules required by the Clean Air Act are being published well behind schedule, and others may have been weakened, but the Sierra Club said that one of the new rules, dealing with air pollution from coke ovens in the steel industry, is "strong enough that the environmental community will support it."
But environmentalists might end up objecting to parts of the regulations on acid rain pollution. These regulations, which were to be published last May but have been held up by a White House review, establish an "allowance" system letting coal-fired power plants buy and sell pollution rights.
The Administration won considerable praise for establishing this market-based approach to pollution control under the Clean Air Act.
But the Sierra Club said the Office of Management and Budget was trying to allow municipal waste incinerators to qualify for conservation allowances that were intended to promote conservation and the use of renewable energy.

HEADLINE: Mortgage Rates Jump

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 23

 BODY:
Average interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages shot up to 8.23 percent this week, the highest level in nearly four months, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation said today.
The rate, up from 8.06 percent a week earlier, was the highest since such mortgages averaged 8.29 percent in the week that ended on July 2. It was the sharpest weekly increase since mid-January. 
 Before rising five times in the last six weeks, mortgage rates had fallen consistently, from 9.03 percent in mid-March to a 19-year low of 7.84 percent in mid-September.
On one-year, adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an average initial rate of 5.13 percent, up from 5.05 percent last week and the highest since the week that ended on Sept. 11. Adjustable rates hit a low of 4.97 percent two weeks ago.
David Lereah, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, said he expected rates to edge down again after the Nov. 3 Presidential election.

HEADLINE: Tension of Waiting at The Daily News

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
A Daily News delivery driver, working on a loading dock this week, chalked across a blackboard: "Welcome to the NEW N.Y. Daily News!" It was an upbeat slogan, but with the newspaper's destiny in the hands of a bankruptcy judge, anxieties continued to weigh on the tabloid's employees.
"We've been in a constant state of crisis for three years," Juan Gonzalez, a Daily News columnist said on Friday. "We're so thoroughly demoralized that we're just working on automatic pilot." 
 Judge Tina L. Brozman of Federal Bankruptcy Court is expected to rule next week on Mortimer B. Zuckerman's $36.3 million bid to buy the newspaper.
Capping two years of extraordinary stress, including one of the nation's worst newspaper strikes, mass firings and months of bankruptcy reorganization, the court delays have only stoked the pressure-cooker atmosphere for News employees.
 
'This Is Our Last Shot'
 "This is like standing on a Times Square platform and it's 110 degrees and no train is coming and the temperature is rising," said Barbara Ross, a political reporter.
In a third-floor lunchroom at the paper's Brooklyn printing plant, a dozen ink-stained pressmen discussed their prospects.
"This is our last shot," said John Welch, a pressman with 41 years at The Daily News. "If this sale doesn't go through, we'll all be out the window, on the unemployment line."
But another pressman, Pete Kershaw, 55, interrupted: "But this guy Zuckerman, I really think he can be a savior for The News. I really think he can turn things around here."
 
Living on Hope
 Down one flight of stairs, a dozen delivery drivers were sipping coffee on a sorting dock.
"We're Daily News truckers -- survivors," said Jimmy Larkin, a 27-year veteran with The News's delivery fleet. "We've survived three years of ravages, strikes and uncertainty. We're alive. We live on hope."
What did he think of Mr. Zuckerman?
"If he's willing to treat us fairly, we'll put out a paper for him," Mr. Larkin said. "If he's willing to recognize our contribution, we'll recognize his contribution."
For his part, Mr. Zuckerman found himself sitting through a second day of bankruptcy proceedings on Friday as lawyers slogged through arguments in the Old Customs House in the Battery.
The New York Typographical Union Local 6 representing the printers, though acknowledging that new technology has nearly eliminated the need for their labor, wants the News and Mr. Zuckerman to honor the 18-year old contract.
Lawyers for the News estimated it costs $61,000 a year in wages and benefits for each printer, some $10 million a year, while an initial investment of about $2 million in automated machinery would eliminate the need for a composing room entirely. Mr. Zuckerman has offered to retain 80 printers and reduce their numbers to 15 workers by 1996 when he hopes to complete a new color printing plant for the paper.
The union has held out for severence pay of $50,000 for each printer let go, a proposal rejected by the prospective buyer.
Judge Brozman, apparently hopeful the two sides may negotiate a settlement on their own over the weekend, said she would issue a ruling on Monday before moving on to the larger issue of accepting Mr. Zuckerman's bid for the ailing tabloid.
 
Seeing Positive Side
 If many News employees viewed the future guardedly, some, like Tina Honnigringer, an advertising manager who works at the paper's headquarters at 220 East 42d Street in Manhattan, bubbled with optimism.
"This can only be positive. I'm very excited," she said. "Mr. Zuckerman will not only bring a new infusion of money, but he's got great ideas to improve the editorial product and increase circulation. And he's a New Yorker -- that's a great plus."
Cheryl Coleman, a secretary who spoke as she passed the vast globe that revolves in the Art Deco lobby of The News's headquarters, said of Mr. Zuckerman: "He wants to fire and rehire. He wants to save money. That commitment to efficiency is what the company needs to survive."
Ronald Hoff, 57, a sales representative who works at News offices in Garden City, L.I., the site of a printing plant that has not been used since the paper's 1990-1991 strike, said a purchase by Mr. Zuckerman would be a big relief. "We'll be able to get on with our lives, and get this paper back to where it should be."
 
Fear for Some Employees
 Most of the 10 unions at the News came to terms with Mr. Zuckerman in the fall, but two have opposed the purchase: the Newspaper Guild and the New York Typographical Union. Members of those two unions appeared most fearful about their prospects if Mr. Zuckerman takes charge.
Charles Dunn, a 45-year-old sales representative, said he was worried that Mr. Zuckerman would target Newspaper Guild members who participated in the 1990-1991 strike. "Those who crossed the line, the scabs, they'll keep their jobs," Mr. Dunn said. "And guys like me who walked the lines will get fired."

HEADLINE: Maputo Journal;
In the Midst of War, Art Is Thriving

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MAPUTO, Mozambique

 BODY:
At a crowded, stylish art opening here guests could have been forgiven for thinking they were at a SoHo gallery in Manhattan in the go-go years. Patrons circulated around bold canvases and sophisticated sculptures in a split-level loft.
A video of painters at work played in one corner. And the hottest artist in town, a mysterious woman from the provinces known simply as Renata, wearing 1950's pink sunglasses and a blue pants suit trimmed with safety pins, showed off her ceramics to adoring clients. 
 The event at the Brazilian Center was just one of several art happenings in this art-crazed city. Days earlier, a sculptor and critic, Eugenio Lemas, unveiled his 12-foot Calder-like outdoor iron sculpture whose spherical pieces, three years in the making, appeared to float on the grass.
For a change of tempo, there was an exhibition of photographs of Makonde sculpture, the tribal art whose spirit animates much of Mozambique's modern art.
 
'In the Avant-Garde'
 "I am not being chauvinistic, but Mozambique is in the avant-garde -- certainly in the southern African zone and probably elsewhere in Africa," said Malangatana Valente Ngwenya, a 56-year-old painter who is regarded as the father and nurturer of the vibrant contemporary art scene here.
"I know when I go to Tanzania, you don't find the boiling point that you do among the young artists of Mozambique," he said. "I passed by a cultural center yesterday where there will be a show of young artists. These young artists can pull you, can make you think twice about how to start a new painting."
Theories abound about why in a country where a 16-year-old war has ruined the economy and killed a million people there is so much new art and such a fraternity of artists who meet and talk and exchange ideas.
"Every day, I have hundreds of people asking if they can use the center to show their art," Luiza Helena Bennett, the director of the Brazilian Center, said. "It's incredible, very impressive."
The show that opened the other night juxtaposes fresh works of Mr. Ngwenya with those of younger painters as well as pieces from overseas.
Mr. Ngwenya -- known as Malangatana in art circles here and in Portugal, where his works are prized -- said there were probably two explanations, internal and external, for the abundance of art. He remembers growing up in a village in southern Mozambique where there was plenty of creativity.
"Aside from making useful things like gourds, people carved things for witch doctors, and there were very strong, impulsive dances," he said. "And there was poetry."
Just as important as this innate imagination, Mr. Ngwenya argues, was the exterior influence of Portuguese colonialism and what he calls its double-edged character.
"The colonial situation helped stimulate art," he said as he showed a visitor around his rambling house, where he is in the midst of building a cultural archive for Mozambican painting, sculpture and anthropological treasures. "Until 1975 when the Portuguese left, you didn't find any black doctors, or architects, or any blacks with academic credentials. This racism helped a lot to make people express themselves."
The repression was so pervasive, Mr. Ngwenya said, that after 9 P.M. Mozambicans were not allowed to walk on the street in Maputo. If they did, they faced a long prison sentence or being sent to the Portuguese island colony of Sao Tome.
 
Both 'Sweet and Sour'
 "But also there was a kind of non-racism, because there were some restaurants where blacks and whites could go," he said. "You could be drinking with a Portuguese but at the same time you could be swept off the streets. The relationship was sweet and sour."
Taken under the wing of a Portuguese modernist architect, Mr. Ngwenya had access to paints and canvas. With these he created works in the 1960's and 70's, often in brilliant oranges and reds, suggesting the torment the Mozambicans suffered under the Portuguese.
After independence, he supported the new Government but tried, he said, to send signals through his art that as the country slid into economic chaos and war, all was not well. "I'm a social painter, but not in a pamphleteering way," he said.
The new wave of young Mozambican artists show little concern with post-independence traumas, or even the civil war, but rather concentrate on modern renditions of traditional spiritual life. The works of 24-year-old Idasse, whose pieces in charcoal on paper were shown alongside Mr. Ngwenya's in Europe last year, evoke African mythologies of birds, animals, women.
 
Traditional Stories Used
 At the School of Visual Arts, one of the teachers, Ulisses Gomez Oviedo, said his students' works often hark back to traditional stories passed down from generation to generation.
"Ask them to describe their art, and they will tell stories of witch doctors, of old customs," Mr. Oviedo said. "They listen from the family, the grandfather. The art is very strong."
Alongside the flourishing production of art, a support system insures that word of what is new gets around.
A critic's circle writes in the Sunday newspaper, and the one television station often shows documentaries on artists. A video to appear on television of the opening at the Brazilian Center shows Renata stretched out on the floor dancing rhythmic movements to the thump of music and the excitement of the first-night crowd, emphasizing perhaps the multi-media dimensions of new Mozambican art.

HEADLINE: A Caprice That Chevy Couldn't Sell

SERIES: Closing Willow Run: At G.M., a Design Gone Wrong -- Fifth article of a series

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: YPSILANTI, Mich., Oct. 23

 BODY:
Kathy Graham, who oversees market research for new designs at the General Motors Corporation, still recalls the excitement of that day, back in 1989. "I was told, 'Run out to the front of the building! It's coming!' "
After two years behind locked doors, the 1991 Chevrolet Caprice Classic LTZ sedan, with its curvy lines and voluptuous rear end, was ready for a test drive. The consensus of Ms. Graham and her co-workers was that Charles M. Jordan, G.M.'s design chief, had a winner. 
 "We all went, 'Wow!"' Ms. Graham said.
Several months later, the six-passenger, rear-wheel-drive Caprice made its debut before the 4,000 people who would be building it at the Willow Run plant in Ypsilanti, 30 miles southwest of Detroit. Everybody said, 'Wow, what an ugly car!' " said Jerry Krampitz, who knows something about cars, having built them at Willow Run for 32 years. "It looked like an upside-down bathtub. I thought, 'I hope something like this sells."
Bob Hall, who had a new baby, a new house and little seniority in a company where seniority is everything, said he had a sense of impending doom. "People looked at that car and said, 'Guess we're next. There go our jobs.' "
This time, the workers, not the marketing experts and the designers, were right. The Caprice, mocked by Automobile magazine as "the knock-kneed Baby Huey," by others as Shamu the Whale, has been shunned by buyers. G.M. redesigned it for 1993 -- "in record speed," Mr. Jordan says -- but it was too late for Willow Run.
The failure of the Caprice, America's hottest-selling car in the late 1960's, was only the latest in a series of miscalculations that will ultimately cost Mr. Hall, Mr. Krampitz and their co-workers their jobs here. Sometime next year, the plant will close, one of 21 that G.M. will abandon as customers turn away from its showrooms.
"Were it just the Caprice that had bombed, it would be one thing," said Harley Shaiken, an auto expert at the University of California in San Diego. "But it happened as G.M.'s market share went down a very steep downhill slide. It was the equivalent of skiing down the Matterhorn."
Now, as rumors swirl about the future of G.M.'s chairman, and with some directors apparently pressing to quicken the pace of change at the nation's largest manufacturing company, the story of the Caprice illustrates one of G.M.'s biggest problems: Its stubborn -- some say arrogant -- insistence on doing things its own way long after the market has passed it by.
For G.M., once renowned for its management and its ability to lead the automotive world, the Caprice's failure also underscores the brutal competitiveness of the auto industry today. "A car is always a crapshoot," said Frank Joyce, a spokesman for the United Automobile Workers union. "But the Caprice was a dud in an environment in which it's increasingly difficult to be a success."
 
 
Failures Are More Costly
 No longer can G.M. conceive a car and dictate its success. No longer can it produce disasters like the Corvair or the Vega and still manage to forge ahead to greater profits. Now failures like the Caprice, or the Pontiac Fiero of the mid-1980's, can mean plant closings, the loss of thousands of jobs, the end of executive careers.
"The customer closed the factory," Maryann Keller, an analyst with Furman, Selz Inc. in New York, said, referring to Willow Run. "Why did the customer close the factory? Because they bought somebody else's car. Somebody else had something they wanted to buy, and G.M. didn't offer it. That's why plants close. They reflect corporate mistakes."
The man behind the Caprice, Chuck Jordan, occupies a corner suite at the General Motors Technical Center outside of Detroit, with an Art Deco-style teak sofa and oversized globe that dates to the 1950's, when the legendary Harley Earl was in charge of design. On his desk is a model of a big-finned 1959 Cadillac, which Mr. Jordan designed. In the 1950's, when G.M. owned the market, designing cars was much simpler.
"There was one Cadillac, one Chevy, one Pontiac, one Buick," he said. "Ford always copied us. We never paid attention to Chrysler. There were no Japanese. The Europeans weren't over here."
Now, after 43 years with G.M., Mr. Jordan's last day of work will be this Friday. With the way things are changing, he said, "I couldn't have timed my retirement better."
 
 
A Bold, but 'Wrong,' Design
 Mr. Jordan is part of the old G.M., analysts say, a culture that began changing last spring, when the G.M. board stepped in. "The car guys made the decisions," Ms. Keller said. "It just wasn't tradition to pay very much attention to outsiders, to the voice of the consumer as they now call it. When competition was minimal, they were probably going to be right. When competition increased, it became harder and harder for these guys to recognize that they were no longer dictating taste."
The Caprice, understandably, is not Mr. Jordan's favorite topic. "This was not a frivolous design," he said. "We thought we had a pretty graceful total car."
Some analysts admire the risks Mr. Jordan took. "It's a very bold car," said Leon Mandel, the publisher of Auto Week Magazine. "It's a very courageous car. It just happens to be wrong."
 
 
When Chevy Set the Pace
 For three decades, from the 1950's through the 1970's, Chevrolet's full-size models, from the fabled Bel Air, with its clean lines, to the Impala, with its distinctive sets of triple tailights, to the Caprice, ruled the open road. The cars, like G.M., seemed as invincible as America. And Chevrolet sold that image for decades, beginning on television in 1956 with "The Dinah Shore Chevy Show" with its "See the U.S.A. in Your Chevrolet," theme song, on up to today's "Heartbeat of America" advertising jingle.
Mr. Hall, the auto worker, who is 36, spent much of his childhood in the back of his father's Caprice. "The Caprice was more than just a car," he said. "My dad was from the hills of Kentucky. He grew up in the Depression. When he bought something, it had to be good. It had to last. That was the Caprice."
 
 
A Shrinking Part of the Market
 The end began during the gasoline shortages of the 1970's. G.M. and the other auto makers began introducing smaller, more fuel-efficient cars. Chuck Jordan helped shrink the Caprice in 1977.
By 1980, the company considered scrapping the Caprice by the end of the decade. But cars have special-interest groups, and the Caprice had Chevrolet dealers, owners of rental fleets and taxi companies, and police forces, who liked the way the car handled at high speeds.
And, in 1985, Robert D. Burger, then the general manager of Chevrolet, decided to take a chance on the Caprice. "There were a number of owners, in their late 50's and 60's, who wanted another Caprice, one more time," Mr. Burger, who has since retired, said in a telephone interview from his home in northern Michigan. "In spite of the fact that the market was shrinking, we decided we would take one last swing and reskin it and see how long it would go."
With G.M. still racking up record profits, it looked like a modest gamble. Chevrolet would continue to make the car with its old rear-wheel-drive configuration and large engines. It was still mostly opening plants, not closing them. Full-size, six-passenger cars still accounted for 15 percent of the market -- a market the Japanese had not yet invaded.
Reskinning the Caprice meant restyling the exterior. Customers who were shown prototypes expressed doubts about the heavy-looking rear end. "We waited, and thought, 'They will come to like it,' " Ms. Graham said.
Mr. Jordan, who owns a red Ferrari Testarossa, wants to talk about the cars now being developed at the Tech Center. "We're living in 1996 here," he said.
But it is very much 1992 in Ypsilanti. And the workers at Willow Run seem obsessed with the winter of 1989, when everything began to go wrong.
First, G.M.'s Chevrolet-Pontiac-Canada Group took over management of the plant. "C.P.C. had a reputation for closing plants," Mr. Hall said.
The old Caprice was being built in Arlington, Tex., and Lakewood, Ga. In late 1989, as Willow Run was being retooled to trade the popular Pontiac Bonneville for the Caprice, G.M. closed the Lakewood plant. The market was shrinking and fewer plants were needed, the company said.
 
 
A Party and an Award
 In January, 1990, Chevrolet-Pontiac-Canada threw a party at Willow Run. "All the bigwigs were there," Mr. Hall said. "They had hot dogs, popcorn, music. They told us, 'This car is going to be the flagship of our fleet sales, and you are going to be the main plant.' "
Ugly or not, the Caprice was Willow Run's car. The workers got on board. "You still have pride in your work," Mr. Hall said. "After a while, we said, 'Who knows? It could take off.' "
The restyled Caprice hit the market in 1990. The timing could not have been worse. By fall, gasoline prices were skyrocketing after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The economy was worsening. The Ford Taurus, which had made its debut several years earlier, was wildly successful. (Many analysts say Chevrolet had tried -- and failed -- to mimic the Taurus's jelly-bean shape with the Caprice.)
Bob Harlow, president of the U.A.W. local at Willow Run, bought the first car for sale that rolled off the line. It was $20,500 retail -- $16,000 with the worker's G.M. discount. "I wanted to promote sales," Mr. Harlow said.
The roomy car turned out to be perfect for his three small children. "I love my Caprice," Mr. Harlow said sincerely.
The parking lot at Willow run is filled with Chevy vans and pickups. Even if they did like it, the Caprice was too expensive for a lot of workers, especially since the lack of demand meant the end of overtime work.
In 1991, Motor Trend magazine named the Caprice its car of the year, an award that many people in the industry say is meaningless. "The Caprice certainly wasn't the marketplace's car of the year," Mr. Mandel said.
Doug Arter, an assembler, said he found it paradoxical that the workers received Car-of-the-Year T-shirts on the day they got layoff notices. The plant began a series of temporary shutdowns. Under terms of the contract, laid-off workers receive nearly their full incomes, plus benefits.
Pat Morrissey, a spokesman for General Motors, says the design of the 1991 Caprice did not prompt the closing of Willow Run. "There is simply not enough market interest in the full-size, rear-wheel-drive vehicles to justify building these vehicles at two plants," he said. He cited statistics: from 1982 to 1992, full-size, six-passenger cars dropped from 15 percent of the market to 8 percent.
Instead of being built at two plants, as it is now, the Caprice will be produced at only one, in Arlington, Tex.
 
 
Changes Weren't Anticipated
 Some analysts say General Motors should have seen the change coming. "Don't they understand that these trends don't happen in a nanosecond?" Ms. Keller said. "If the market for this car is declining, then why didn't they have something else to put in the factory? Take your pick: Either the car was ugly, or the customers were disappearing. In either case, they are to blame for not acting upon that information."
At Willow Run, even as they wait anxiously for transfers to other plants, the workers are building the 1993 Caprice. G.M. has slimmed down the 1991 version and recarved the rear-wheel openings to make the new model look less bottom-heavy.
Mr. Krampitz, the longtime auto worker, says he will probably be forced to retire and, at age 51, he is prepared to go to work cutting lawns. Mr. Hall and his wife, Jessie, who have two small children, are in turmoil. Should they pick up and follow the Caprice to Arlington, where there will be jobs for 400 Willow Run workers? Who knows how long Arlington will stay open?
"The new car looks a lot better," Mr. Hall said. "Too bad it's too late for us."

HEADLINE: Religion Notes

BYLINE: By Ari L. Goldman

 BODY:

Voting Your Religion
Not surprisingly, Americans put the economy ahead of all other issues in determining how they will vote this year for President. But in a new national poll sponsored by the VISN interfaith television network, 10 percent of respondents said the determining factor would be religion. 
 A telephone survey of 718 registered voters conducted early this month found that 74 percent said a candidate's economic plan would determine how they would vote. But among those who attended church more than once a week, the number who put economics first fell to 50 percent, as against 26 percent who cited religious issues.
The poll, conducted by Blum & Weprin Inc. of Manhattan from Oct. 8 to 10, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
The poll also found that despite the efforts of the Republicans to paint themselves as the party of God in this election, the Democrats were well ahead among churchgoing Christians.
Consistent with other polls, the new survey found Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas to be well ahead of President Bush, even among voters who said they attended church five or more times in the last month (46 percent to 34 percent). Ross Perot, the independent candidate, garnered 4 percent of these churchgoers.
The two major candidates ran neck and neck among voters who believe "everything in the Bible word for word," with Mr. Clinton favored by 37 percent and President Bush by 36 percent.
Micheline Blum, president of the polling company, said the results demonstrated that the issue of religion, "which has been a focal point of Republican politics for the last 12 years, is not helping this year in the way that the Bush campaign hoped it would."
 
Saints and Sinners
 This week, Operation Rescue, the militant anti-abortion group, sent more than 90,000 letters to Christian clergy members across the country with this message: "Pastor, warn your flock: To vote for Bill Clinton is to sin against God."
The letter, signed by Randall A. Terry, the founder and leader of the group, was not exactly a ringing endorsement of President Bush. "The alternative may not appear very good," it conceded, "but even a status quo administration would not rob us of the gains we've made in the last decade." It concluded: "Christian, vote your conscience, not your pocketbook -- both will be better off."
Max Parker, deputy press secretary for the Clinton campaign, said the letter was "an outrage" that twisted the Governor's beliefs and postions. "This is a prime example of a group that wants to continue to divide Americans over an emotional issue," he said. "By this point in the campaign, people realize that to conquer our greatest problems, we need to work together instead of buying into these divisive tactics."
 
Interfaith Miracles
 It had an "only in New York" quality: Jewish, Christian and Muslim clergy members gathered Thursday morning in a Roman Catholic Church to eat bagels and talk about Islam. A banner overhead said "Expect Miracles."
The words were the motto of the sponsoring group, a Partnership of Faith in New York City, which hopes to heal divisions in the city through better understanding between religions.
Imam Talib 'Abdur-Rashid used a common biblical metaphor to give an introductory talk about Islam, saying his religion was the latest "patch in Joseph's multicolored coat of faith." To demonstrate that Islam is not something foreign or fanatical, but familiar and neighborly, he led a discussion with four New Yorkers who lead Islamic lives in the city.
When the floor was opened to the visiting clergy, there were some sparks over the morality of the death sentence declared by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on Salman Rushdie for writing "The Satanic Verses." The assembled Muslims supported the decree, but Rabbi Marshall Meyer of Congregation B'nai Jeshurun in Manhattan called it "violent and fundamentalist."
Imam Talib, the leader of the Mosque of Islamic Brotherhood in Harlem, broke the tension when he said that Muslims were also upset by the film "The Last Temptation of Christ," by the singer Sinead O'Connor's ripping up a picture of Pope John Paul II and by the desecration of Jewish houses of worship and cemeteries.
"We have strong feelings about these things, and you are going to see us come out of our cocoon and talk about them," he said.
 
An Ideal Rabbi
 Rabbi Haskell Lookstein of Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun in Manhattan has won the Finkle Award, given each year to the rabbi who "exemplifies the highest ideals of the rabbinate, serves a congregation in exemplary fashion and reaches out to the broader community." The award, presented Thursday by the New York Board of Rabbis, includes a $10,000 prize.
The spiritual leader of Cambodian Buddhism, Preah Maha Ghosananda, has been awarded the $4,000 Professor Thorolf Rafto Prize for Human Rights for his work in promoting peace and reconciliation in his country. The prize is awarded by the Thorolf Rafto Foundation for Human Rights of Bergen, Norway.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Lists Public Works Bond Act Would Finance

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL

 BODY:
For almost a year, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has been touting his $800 million jobs bond act as a way to help pull New York State out of its deep recession by creating tens of thousands of jobs. But not until yesterday did his office release a list of the projects it said would be financed by the bond act, which is to be put before the state's voters on Election Day.
The release of the list, the subject of painstaking negotiations between the Governor, the Democratic-controlled Assembly and the Republican-led State Senate over the last few weeks, was clearly timed to help bolster the Governor's case for the bond act, Proposal 1 on the Nov. 3 ballot. And in this year of scarce resources, it provides the state's lawmakers something to dangle before their constituents as the election approaches. 
 Governor Cuomo said that the bond act would generate almost 35,000 construction jobs. Beyond that, the Governor's office has estimated that the public works projects built through the act would entice an estimated 122,000 permanent private-sector jobs and retain another estimated 42,000 existing jobs.
"These projects all share a common purpose: to create immediate jobs and to lay the foundation for sustained economic growth," he said. "They can provide the spark needed to begin the revitalization of communities across New York."
 
Money for Infrastructure
 The list includes 390 separate projects to improve infrastructure like roads and sewage hookups across the state, with an eye toward using those projects to attract business to New York.
The list includes nearly $300 million for New York City, like rebuilding piers at the South Street Seaport and Battery Park at a cost of $12 million; building a 600-space parking garage in Jamaica, Queens, for $6.4 million, and refurbishing the Staten Island Ferry Terminal for $6.3 million.
Under the list, which is in the form of a memorandum of understanding signed between Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature, Nassau County would receive $42 million, Suffolk would receive $43 million and Westchester, $28.5 million.
For Nassau County, the projects include $8.6 million to modify and expand a wastewater treatment center in Glen Cove, and $4 million to refurbish parking, lights and sidewalks in the village of Farmingdale. For Suffolk, the projects include $2.5 million to expand the Port Jefferson wastewater treatment plant and $3.5 million to revamp the infrastructure at the Brookhaven Industrial Park.
In each case, the county or municipality would be required to put up part of the cost of the project, so that the state would only pay a portion.
Conservative groups, which have been urging voters to reject the bond act as a fiscally irresponsible move that will saddle the state with more debt, questioned the timing of releasing the list yesterday and said that the voters should have been informed earlier of what they were being asked to vote for.
 
Questions of Timing
 "There's no reason that this document should be coming out just 10 days before the election," said Paul P. Jesep, a spokesman for Change-NY, a conservative group that supports less government spending. "New Yorkers have a right to examine this very clearly and carefully, and it should have been released a long time ago."
But Mardi Massaroni, a spokeswoman for the Jobs Bond Act Information Office, said the list took so long to compile because the state received many more applications than it had expected.
For the last week, officials have been working nearly around the clock to cull the final list from 1,000 proposed projects that would have required a total of $2.5 billion in assistance, she said.
Mitch Pally, vice president for legislative and economic affairs for the Long Island Association, a business and civic group, said that he welcomed the final list for Nassau and Suffolk Counties, even though the projects included were relatively modest.
"It's not like building Yankee Stadium, but when you add it all together it adds thousands of construction jobs and creates thousands more permanent ones," he said.

HEADLINE: Vehicle Sales in U.S. Jumped in Mid-October

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 23

 BODY:
Sales of domestically built cars and trucks jumped 27.1 percent in mid-October, compared with a particularly weak period a year earlier, auto makers reported today.
Sales of new North American-built cars rose 15.4 percent in the Oct. 11-20 period, while new-truck sales jumped 48.8 percent. Vehicles built in the United States, Canada and Mexico are considered domestic. 
 Cars sold at a projected annual rate of 6.4 million, the Commerce Department reported today, a vast improvement from the 5.8 million projected rate in the first 10 days of the month. Sales of light trucks were running at a projected annual rate of more than five million in the first 20 days of October.
Dealers also said auto sales were improving, and some expected even more sales after the Presidential election on Nov. 3.
"Sales have actually been pretty darn good," said Ray Spacagna, general manager of Mike Luna Chevrolet-Oldsmobile-Geo in Belen, N.M. But, he said, people coming into the dealership have been "a little bit worried about the economy and who's going to be President."
The reports follow the Chrysler Corporation's announcement on Tuesday that it earned $202 million in the third quarter. But the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company are expected to report combined losses of more than $1 billion next week.
Among the Big Three American auto makers, Ford reported the biggest gains: a 27 percent increase in car sales and a 52.4 percent gain in truck sales.
G.M. reported a 9.6 percent increase in car sales and a 40.5 percent gain in truck sales.
Chrysler's combined car and truck sales were up 15.4 percent, according to estimates by Ward's Automotive Reports, a trade publication. Chrysler does not report 10-day sales.
 
 
A Continuing Improvement
 Gerry Paul, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company in New York, said he was encouraged by the sales increases. "But it's probably not as strong as you'd expect," he said. "It's a continuing improvement, but it's also moving slowly."
Among Japanese auto makers with North American plants, the Nissan Motor Company reported its sales of American-made cars more than doubled in mid-October, while truck sales were up 67.9 percent. The Mitsubishi Motors Corporation reported a 57.6 percent gain in new-car sales. And the Mazda Motor Corporation reported a 53.4 rise in car sales, but a 50.2 percent drop in truck sales.
Wide percentage swings occur in sales of American-made Japanese cars because they have a small part of the overall market.
Also today, Chevrolet's general manager, Jim Perkins, announced that Chevrolet-Geo dealers had already ordered more than half of the 1993 production of the redesigned Geo Prizm, only about a month into the new model year.

Exxon Profits Up 1.8% and Mobil Advances 13.2%

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

 BODY:
The Exxon Corporation's earnings rose slightly, by 1.8 percent, in the third quarter while the Mobil Corporation's profits rose by 13.2 percent.
Both companies, the nation's two largest in oil, said they had benefited from higher natural gas and crude oil prices in the United States, and continued to generate the bulk of their profits abroad. Operations in gasoline and other petroleum products in the United States remained weak because of the economy and thin profit margins in the Midwest and East. 
 Excluding special items, Exxon's operating income rose by 6 percent in the quarter and Mobil's rose 11 percent. Both companies said they had modestly pared spending for plant expansions, drilling programs and other operations, which reduced costs and aided profits in the quarter.
Mobil said it had expanded its existing programs to cut costs and improve productivity. Allen E. Murray, chairman and chief executive, said its plan to trim 2,000 jobs by year-end was "proceeding on a wider front and at a faster pace."
 
Texaco Reports Gain
 Those cutbacks and the auctions of reserves and other properties, he said, "will result in higher productivity and significantly greater savings than originally estimated."
Texaco this week reported a 17 percent gain in operating income, and Amoco a gain of 16 percent, and analysts said they expected the major oil companies to report gains of 15 to 20 percent on average.
Chevron and ARCO, companies with large refining operations on the West Coast and significant producers of domestic natural gas, are expected to post substantially larger gains for the quarter when they report earnings on Monday.
Mobil's domestic refining unit had its third consecutive quarterly loss, while Exxon's refining profit in the United States fell 68 percent.
Gasoline demand in the United States "is still well below normal levels," said George F. Friesen, senior oil analyst for the Deutsche Bank Capital Group in New York.
Following are details from the Exxon and Mobil earnings reports:
 
Exxon
 Net income was $1.14 billion, or 90 cents a share, compared with $1.12 billion, or 88 cents a share, in the corresponding period a year ago. Revenue for the nation's biggest oil company, based in Irving, Tex., rose 11.3 percent, to $30.6 billion, from $27.5 billion.
The Exxon profit was modestly below analysts' estimates, in part because of the steep decline in refining profits in the United States, to $31 million, from $98 million. The oil giant's foreign refining profits, however, were up sharply, to $459 million, from $312 million.
Profits from drilling operations in the United States also rose drastically, to $272 million, from $142 million.Exxon's chemical unit reported higher profits, to $87 million, from $55 million.
Exxon's share price was unchanged yesterday, at $62, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Mobil
 Net income rose to $413 million, or $1 per share, from $365 million, or 87 cents per share. Revenues for the company, based in Fairfax, Va., increased 8 percent, to $16.2 billion, from $15.0 billion.
Mobil, the nation's second-largest oil company, posted its third straight quarterly loss in United States refining, a loss of $19 million. Higher natural gas and crude prices contributed to a profit surge in domestic drilling operations, to $146 million, from $39 million a year ago.
Natural gas prices for the quarter rose to an estimated average of $1.90 per 1,000 cubic feet in the United States, from $1.39 in the period a year ago. In foreign operations, natural gas prices rose to $2.92, from $2.78. Crude oil prices rose to an estimated average of $17.32 per barrel in the United States, from $16.31 a year ago. Foreign crude sales average an estimated $20.16 per barrel, compared with $19.32 a year ago.
Damage costs from Hurricane Andrew amounted to $13 million. Other one-time costs included $68 million in programs to trim employees and operations and a $50 million writeoff from an asset sale. Most of the costs were offset by a $106 million profit on asset sales.
Mr. Murray said that Mobil had raised $600 million this year from selling reserves and other assets and that more sales were expected this quarter. He added that the company had spent $154 million this year for early-retirement and other cost-reduction programs.
Mobil's share price gained 25 cents, to $63.375, on the Big Board.

West Point-Pepperell Buyer Steps Down as Its Chairman

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
William F. Farley resigned yesterday as chairman and chief executive of West Point-Pepperell Inc., a company he bought in 1988 for $1.5 billion in a highly leveraged hostile takeover, which ultimately led West Point to seek bankruptcy protection.
Mr. Farley, who is 50 years old, also resigned as chairman and chief executive of Valley Fashions Inc., the parent of West Point-Pepperell. 
 Holcombe T. Green Jr., an independent director named to the board of Valley Fashions when it emerged from bankruptcy protection last month, will succeed Mr. Farley as chairman and interim chief executive. Mr. Green, who is 53, is a principal of Green Capital Investors, an Atlanta investment partnership.
 
 
A Bitter Struggle
 Valley Fashions is the name taken by the West Point Acquisition Corporation when it emerged from bankruptcy. Mr. Farley created West Point Acquisition in 1989 to buy West Point-Pepperell, whose bed and bath linens are sold under brand names that include Martex, Utica, Lady Pepperell, Tastemaker and Vellux.
After a bitter struggle with Joseph Lanier Jr., West Point's chairman and the great-grandson of LaFayette Lanier, the company's founder, Mr. Farley acquired 95.3 percent of West Point's shares, financing most of the purchase with bank debt and $700 million of high-yield junk bonds. Mr. Farley's stake was limited to about $200 million in cash and West Point stock, analysts said.
Mr. Farley planned to sell West Point assets and purchase the remaining 4.7 percent of the shares he did not already own. Those plans were never realized, however, as the economic slowdown and the huge debt Mr. Farley placed on West Point dragged the company down.
By March 1990, West Point was in default on interest payments. It later filed for Chapter 11 protection.
 
 
Focus on Fruit of the Loom
 Mr. Farley, who engineered a successful leveraged buyout of Fruit of the Loom Inc. earlier in the 1980's, said in a news release that he intended to concentrate on that company. "At this time, with West Point's problems largely behind it, I feel that it is appropriate that I focus my attention on Fruit of the Loom," he said.
Burton Malkiel, a professor of economics at Princeton University, said the West Point takeover was a case study in what could go wrong in leveraged buyouts in the 1980's.
"To the extent that you leverage a perfectly fine company like West Point to the hilt, what might be a minor perturbation in sales for an unleveraged company can become a disaster for one that is heavily leveraged," he said.
Requests for an interview with Mr. Farley were denied.
Along with his resignation, Mr. Farley and his associates agreed to sell their remaining stock and warrants in Valley Fashions back to the company. Pamela L. Webber, a spokeswoman for Farley Industries, would not comment on the size or value of Mr. Farley's holdings.
On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, the price of West Point-Pepperell's shares rose 25 cents each, to $40.25. The company has 1.1 million common shares outstanding.

HEADLINE: Dow Gains 6.76 on Economic Signs

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stock prices managed a small gain yesterday during a drifting session in which investors apparently were somewhat encouraged by talk of possible strengthening in the economy.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.76 points, to 3,207.64, finishing the week with a net gain of 33.23 points. 
 Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by about 9 to 8 on the New York Stock Exchange. Big Board volume totaled 199.1 million shares, compared with 216.4 million Thursday.
 
 
Unemployment Claims
 Analysts said hopes had stirred in recent days that the pace of the economy might be picking up, at least a little. The latest data on initial claims for state employment insurance, for instance, showed that a recent downward trend was continuing.
But evidence of a stronger economy has also served to push up interest rates. Prices of long-term government bonds fell more than $2.50 for each $1,000 in face value yesterday.
Brokers said a good many investors were also sitting back to await the Presidential election, having already assigned a high probability to a victory by Gov. Bill Clinton.
"With a Clinton victory seemingly discounted by the market, the future trend in equity prices will be more influenced by the extent of economic recovery," John Shaughnessy of Advest Inc. said.
General Motors rose 5/8, to 33 1/2, in active trading amid reports that G.M. directors may be preparing to oust Robert C. Stempel as chairman.
Goodyear Tire and Rubber gained 1 7/8, to 67 5/8. Third-quarter profits came to $1.44 a share, up from $1.01 a share in the corresponding period a year earlier.
Exxon, which posted third-quarter earnings of 90 cents a share against 88 cents a share in the like period last year, was unchanged at 62.
Other gainers among the blue chips included American Telephone and Telegraph, up 1 1/8, at 43 1/8; Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, up 1 7/8 at 103 1/8, and Walt Disney, up 1 3/4, at 38 1/2.
R. P. Scherer lost 1 1/8, to 31, after a secondary offering of 3.5 million shares was priced at that level.
Nacco Industries climbed 5 5/8, to 43 7/8, as the company posted sharply higher third-quarter profits.
 
 
Salomon Slides
 Salomon Inc. dropped 3/4, to 33, after a 4 1/4-point slide on Thursday, when the company reported that its third-quarter earnings fell to $6 million from $85 million in the corresponding period last year.
Archive, one of the most active issues in Nasdaq over-the-counter trading, jumped 3 3/4, to 10 1/2, while Conner Peripherals rose 1/4, to 18 3/4, on the Big Board. Late Thursday, Conner agreed to acquire Archive for $11.25 a share in cash.
Sun Microsystems, another Nasdaq stock, climbed 3 3/8, to 32. The company reported sharply lower quarterly earnings late Thursday, but analysts described a bright outlook for future quarters.
The Nasdaq composite index edged up 0.18 point to 597.30. At the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index dropped 0.27 point to 374.24.

Dollar Rises Amid Rumors Of Bundesbank Rate Cuts

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday against most leading currencies amid a bullish market swept up in rumors about interest rates.
Gold prices rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $343.60 an ounce, up 50 cents from late Thursday. Republic National Bank said gold had risen 80 cents, to $343.20. 
 "I think we are seeing the beginnings of a bull trend" in the dollar," said Robert Ryan, a senior trader at the Bank of New York.
Traders concentrated on rumors of potential interest rate cuts by the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, and the reality of rising interest rates in the United States, Mr. Ryan said. These factors made a rising dollar inevitable, he said.
In New York, the dollar settled at 121.60 Japanese yen, up from 120.725 yen late Thursday. Overnight in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 121.20 yen, down 1.16 yen from Thursday's close. But it was quoted later in London at 121.90 yen.
 
Pound Falls in London
 At the close in New York, the pound fetched $1.6225, down from $1.6260 late Thursday. In London, the British pound fell to $1.6165 from $1.6230 late Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates included: 1.5275 German marks, up from 1.5080; 1.3630 Swiss francs, up from 1.3460; 5.1800 French francs, up from 5.1170; 1,340.5 Italian lire, up from 1,325.50, and 1.24675 Canadian dollars, up from 1.24175.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Thursday, included: 1.5305 German marks, up from 1.5080; 1.3635 Swiss francs, up from 1.3475; 5.1855 French francs, up from 5.1150; 1.7208 Dutch guilders, up from 1.6965; 1,338.75 Italian lire, up from 1,323.50, and 1.2470 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2423.
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $342.65 an ounce from $343.15 bid late Thursday. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid of $342.60 an ounce from $342.50 bid late Thursday. In Hong Kong, gold rose 89 cents an ounce to close at $343.36.
Silver fell worldwide. On the Comex in New York, silver settled at $3.769 an ounce, down from $3.781. In London, silver fell to a late bid of $3.78 from $3.79late Thursday.

HEADLINE: Franks Gets a Lift From an Opponent

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DANBURY, Conn.

 BODY:
Even supporters of Representative Gary Franks, the first black Republican elected to Congress since the 1930's, describe his first term as inauspicious. But the 39-year-old former alderman from Waterbury is now considered the front-runner in his re-election bid -- helped, oddly enough, by his most vitriolic opponent's decision to stay in the race.
Mr. Franks, who won his nomination through something of a fluke in a six-way race, is benefiting from Connecticut's three-party politics. A Connecticut Party, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s independent vehicle, has provided a home for State Representative Lynn Taborsak, a 49-year-old plumber from Danbury and the unexpected loser in a bitter Democratic primary fight. 
 Ms. Taborsak and the Democratic nominee, James Lawlor, a Waterbury Probate Court judge, now seem to be splitting the large anti-Franks vote in this diverse district, which stretches northwest from the bucolic northeastern suburbs of New York City through the conservative, working-class Naugatuk Valley to the old brass-making city of Waterbury.
 
Intense Rivalries
 Rivalries within the Fifth District are intense, suspicions mutual and pervasive. It is said that when the Naugatuck Valley wins a Federal grant, Waterburians view the money as foreign aid. The district was a Democratic bastion but became the most solidly Republican district in the state in the last three Presidential elections.
The candidates' geographies, personalities and backgrounds work to Mr. Franks's advantage. Ms. Taborsak undercuts Mr. Lawlor in the southwestern towns around Danbury, where he is viewed as something of a carpetbagger. Both are white Democrats. Mr. Franks splits the pro-choice vote with Ms. Taborsak and the Waterbury vote with Mr. Lawlor.
Earlier, the race's central issue had appeared to be Mr. Franks, and what his opponents called his continuing string of blunders. For instance, when Defense Secretary Dick Cheney testified before the Armed Services Committee on the Administration's plans to cancel the Seawolf submarine, a project important to the state's struggling economy, Mr. Franks had no questions for him. The Representative was in the restroom.
"Gary Franks is a slug," said Ms. Taborsak. "He's in over his head. His report card shows a big, fat F. He doesn't deserve re-election."
But geography is working against his challengers. The southwestern segment of the district, whose lines were essentially unchanged by this year's redistricting, tunes in to New York City; the northeastern portion catches New Haven and Hartford. That makes it impossibly dear to buy name recognition and gives Mr. Franks, who enjoys districtwide familiarity, a giant advantage.
 
Money in the Bank
 Mr. Franks raised a campaign fund of $577,000, one of the state's largest, and still has $200,000 in the bank to orchestrate a last-week crescendo. Mr. Lawlor reported having $2,821.54 in the bank at the end of September and debts of $15,000. Ms. Taborsak's campaign said it had $57,000.
"It's a microcosm of the difficulty in unseating an incumbent, even in a year of discontent," said Frederick Hartwig, an important Lawlor consultant as vice president of Garin Hart Strategic Research Group. "You can't give enough speeches or ring enough doorbells. The only way to win is through the mass media. That's just flat-out expensive. If Jim Lawlor spends as much as Gary Franks, I think we'd win. Can we spend less and win? I'm not sure."
Ms. Taborsak's liberalism and environmentalism gives her a solid base, but it alienates swing and conservative voters. And Mr. Lawlor's opposition to abortion has led some of Ms. Taborsak's supporters to make Mr. Franks their second choice. A Lawlor poll of 401 likely voters taken three weeks ago showed him trailing Mr. Franks by 16 points, 41 percent to 25 percent. Ms. Taborsak had 17 percent in the survey, which had a margin of error of 4 percentage points.
Mr. Lawlor insists he is catching up. But at times he appears to lack the fire of an underdog on the move. When Donna McLean, a nurse's aide, greeted him with a friendly "Remember me?" at the dedication of a new housing complex, Mr. Lawlor stared blankly at her. "Not really," he finally said. He then excused himself to prepare for his one-minute speech. In a subsequent interview, Mrs. McLean, once a Lawlor supporter, said she now was undecided.
"People want change," said Mrs. McLean, a co-captain of the housing complex's block watch. "They're sick and tired of what's going on. People don't care who's there. But if you're there, do the job. Just do it."
In many ways, the election seems a replay of the Republican primary that rocketed Mr. Franks into the national limelight. He was one of six candidates seeking the seat vacated by John G. Rowland, when he ran unsuccessfully for governor. He finished last on the first round of balloting at the district convention. But when several opponents pushed votes his way in a frantic but miscalibrated effort to deny the nomination to more hated rivals, he emerged on the ninth ballot as the consensus second choice. In one of the most celebrated campaigns of the 1990 election, he defeated the former Democratic Representative Toby Moffett, who was attempting a political comeback.
 
Courtship of the Media
 As the first black Republican to win a voting seat in the House of Representatives since Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal lured blacks away from the party of Abraham Lincoln, Mr. Franks was catapulted into the national limelight. He was eagerly courted by the Administration and the national media as a spokesman for black conservatives. Handsome and soft spoken, he was an instant hit on television and was flatteringly profiled in major newspapers.
The attention came in part because he focused on national issues.
But at home he was earning a reputation for unreliability. He missed scheduled meetings and Connecticut residents called him "Phantom Franks," as he had been dubbed by Mr. Moffett. Leonard D'Amico, a Beacon Falls selectman and a Republican since he moved to his wife's hometown 30 years ago, said he repeatedly called and wrote Mr. Franks's office over a controversy about a planned regional post office.
"We'd set a time and date for a visit and he'd cancel," said Mr. D'Amico, who added he got better service from Democrats. "When we looked to him for help, support and service all we got was lip service. He just wasn't there."
Asked whom he was supporting for Congress this time, Mr. D'Amico declined to say.
Mr. Franks has acknowledged problems with his early performance, but blamed staff members he dismissed shortly before Christmas. But the way he conducted the dismissals -- summoning the police to supervise senior staff members clearing out their desks -- brought further criticism.
Then came a spate of embarrassing disclosures over his personal finances. He was sued for falling behind on his mortgage payments and credit-card payments. A former campaign official also sued claiming he was owed back pay. And in February, it was divulged that the brother of former Waterbury Mayor, Joseph Santopietro, who helped engineer Mr. Franks's primary victory before being indicted, was on his payroll.
Mr. Franks dismisses the criticism as the venting of political enemies and disgruntled former staffers. He says liberal Democrats, especially fellow blacks, are trying to discredit him because they fear that his philosophy and success will draw minority voters back to the Republican Party.
"If you're delivering fish every Friday, the last thing you want is to teach people how to fish -- because then you're out of business," he said. "We have a great story to tell. We're the most pro-business, pro-jobs Congressman in Connecticut. But the media only puts bad things in the paper."

HEADLINE: Monday's Lament: Where Is That Hour?

BYLINE: By MOLLY O'NEILL

 BODY:
Tonight, the dream of all harried Americans will come true: They will be given an extra hour, free. In addition to this 60-minute gift from daylight time, the country gained 24 hours in February by dint of a leap year. And in June, a second was added to the nation's master clock at the United States Naval Observatory in Washington to reflect an infinitesimal slowing of the earth's rotation.
Adding up what happened in February and June, this year has had 86,401 extra seconds, making it the longest year since the same thing happened in 1972. But is Mr. or Ms. Too-Much-to-Do basking in a Zenlike calm, feasting on the manna of additional moments? 
 Not exactly.
"I feel more out of step than ever," said Marcy Mandell-Carey, an accountant in Manhattan. In addition to her sense that time has been compressed and its pace has grown ever faster, she said, everyday life seems to have more and more jarring incidents of temporal dissonance.
"Say I'm at home, on baby time, which is slow and easy, and my husband calls and he's on trading floor time," she said. "There's this panic to get in synch. Everybody is in their own time zone, or in two or three different time zones at once. Trying to reconcile the different clocks is like this new burden, something else to get frantic about."
In interviews with a wide range of people and experts, it is clear that people experience time idiosyncratically and, increasingly, with a jazzlike dissonance. Some experts theorize that this fractured sense of time contributes to the modern, much-bemoaned "time vise," adding stress to the workday and pressures on relationships.
Time means something different to just about everybody today. For the jazz musician and the classical musician, for the athlete in competition and the bus driver, there is little agreement on how to measure time.
And the country's two leading analysts of the use of time are at odds over whether Americans actually have more or less time for themselves.
In the best-selling book "The Overworked American: The Unexpected Decline of Leisure" (Basic Books, 1992), Dr. Juliet Schor, an economics professor at Harvard University, asserts that Americans work 158 hours more each year than they did 20 years ago.
"Pshaw," said Dr. John Robinson, director of the American Time Use Project at the University of Maryland in College Park, whose data suggest that Americans have gained five hours a week of leisure time in the last two decades.
But Dr. Robinson granted that this increase in free time may be difficult for people to detect because it accrues in small chunks rather than large blocks. What's more, he said, the complexities of people's lives and the round-the-clock workday have created "a genuine paradox between my data and people's experience of time."
The individual experience of time is the heartbeat of everyone's harried feeling. Douglas Adams, the author of "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," a series of science fiction books, has noticed that the constant stream of global information has led to "something gone wrong in interactivity."
"We are constantly responding to this far-flung stimulus that we can't possibly affect," he said. In so doing, he added, people are increasingly divorced from the moment and its pleasures.
 
Time Gallops, Says Gallup
 In a telephone survey of 783 working adults published by the Gallup Poll last month, for instance, 57 percent said they had too little time for hobbies; 48 percent longed for more time with their spouses, 39 percent for more time with their children and 57 percent for more time to relax.
Given the premium that people place on time, researchers of many disciplines are studying its effect on culture. Chronobiologists speculate about the physiological effects of jet lag. Psychologists treat the emotional effects of time scarcity. Physicists and theologians consider the cosmic implications.
But one thing is certain: The division of time into units depends on a basic social agreement. And like covenants ranging from the definition of family to dress codes, the shared perception of time has been shattered. "Consider what's happened in the past century as time went from being regulated by a clock in a town square to individual wristwatches," said Daniel J. Boorstin, the Librarian Emeritus of Congress.
 
Promptness Is So Modern
 Just as societies were reordered by the change from a lunar to a solar calendar, and as the social sense of time was sharpened when Sundial Standard was eclipsed by the pendulum's swing, the privatization of time has had a profound effect.
"It's all become quite precise and exacting," said Dr. Boorstin, who noted that the 12 virtues to which Benjamin Franklin aspired did not include promptness, because time was a gentler commodity, one measured by the turn of the earth.
Today, scientists look at the resonant frequency of cesium, hydrogen or mercury atoms to calculate Universal Standard Time, the gold standard of timekeeping. This method, said Dennis McCarthy, chief of earth orientation parameters at the Naval Observatory, measures time to accuracies of a billionth of a second a day.
But as the measure of time has become more accurate and finely parsed, the value of each moment has been inflated and the experience of time has become more fragmented.
 
Of Time and the M-104
 Even as he stood at Broadway and 52d Street on a recent afternoon, clocking the precise moments of departure and arrival of M-104 buses, Eli Greenberg, a bus dispatcher, acknowledged that time is a mutable concept. He said he experiences time one way when he is clocking uptown and downtown buses, and another when he is clocking crosstown buses.
"The crosstown routes are something else," he said. "There are more buses so everything goes faster."
When he runs 1,500 meters, said Sydney Maree, who holds the American record at that distance as well as at 5,000 meters, "time is faster and unforgiving: it's an explosion." In the longer race, he added, "there is time to correct for a mistake, and time floats."
Telecommunications has exaggerated the disparate and often competing time realities of everyday life, said Dr. Oliver Sacks, a professor of neurobiology at the Albert Einstein School of Medicine in the Bronx. In his book "Awakenings" (Dutton, 1973), he quoted a former music teacher suffering from Parkinson's disease as saying that she felt "unmusic-ed" by the disease, forced into a robotic gait alien to her own sense of tempo and time.
 
Marching to a Metronome
 "Neurobiologists call this 'kinetic melody,' " Dr. Sacks said. "The mechanization of time, dividing the day into little tasks to be done at a rate that is consonant with a machine rather than the body, is possibly the social parallel to this physiological disruption."
Even illusory changes in the perception of time can be disorienting. "Try to imagine resetting 4,000 watches," said Anthony J. D'Ambosio, executive director of Tourneau Corner, the Madison Avenue watch store. "It takes two days, and one's sense of time is completely disrupted."
Physiologically, "minute changes in time, or even the sense of time, can throw the biological clock into disarray," said Dr. Steven Reppert, a neurobiologist who specializes in chronobiology, the biological impact of time.
Dr. Irving Dardik, a medical researcher and a former chairman of the United States Olympic Sports Medicine Team, asserted that "society has created a nanosecond reality that is at odds with the human biological clock." This dissonance, by his research, contributes not only to psychological and social dysfunction, but to a variety of stress-related physical diseases.
 
A Furor Over Time Lost
 The preciousness of time is not solely a province of the 20th century. When Britain adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1752 and Sept. 14 followed Sept. 2, British subjects marched in fury, chanting, "Give us back our 11 days!"
Nevertheless, the greatest advances in adapting to and managing both the compression and individualization of time have been made in the last decade. A gong of optimism was sounded by the physicist Stephen W. Hawking, who once theorized that, in a shrinking universe, time would eventually run backward. In time, however, Dr. Hawking reversed his position. But not before world-class athletes and artists had begun talking about "the zone," the period of performance when time seems to stand still.
The boxer Ray Mancini once referred to three-minute boxing rounds as "all the time in heaven and hell put together and frozen."
 
Racing as Time Stands Still
 Mr. Maree, the runner, said: "Once I've transcended the physical pain, there is no time. I have no memory, none, of the race I ran between the gun and the finish line when I broke my first record."
Thelonious Monk Jr., a drummer and son of the jazz great, has had similar experiences. "I've been performing with such concentration that everything stopped, everything was silent and then, suddenly, it was over," he said. "And I was trying to figure out why people were clapping."
Time once stood still for Dr. Sacks in a swimming pool. "I got into the pool around 8 A.M., as usual," he recalled. "I was thinking about the patient who would eventually become the subject of my story 'The Last Hippie,' and between the swimming and the thinking I went into a timeless trance. When I looked at the clock, nearly three hours had elapsed and, of course, I thought the clock was broken."
 
Taking Time to Take a Breath
 In studying the experiences of athletes and artists, chronobiologists haven't been able to figure out how to slow the inexorable tick of the clock, but they now understand how to slow the experience of time's passing.
Dr. Jim Loehr, a sports psychologist, has pioneered the field of time-slowing. He recommends deep breathing, visualization and split-second preparation rituals like bouncing a basketball or winding up for a tennis serve to launch an athlete into his or her winning zone. He is credited with markedly improving the performance of dozens of baseball basketball players as well as tennis players like Martina Navratolova and Jim Courier.
In the last year, he said, more and more business executives and politicians have hired him to teach micro-time-management techniques.
"There are fewer and fewer large blocks of time in which an executive or anybody else can recover and regroup these days," he said. "This promotes tremendous dissonance, frustration and ultimately the sense of being in a time vise. But there are lots of 25-second intervals in which deep concentration and visualization can make time stand still, can revitalize a person, reacquaint them with their own rhythm and launch them into timelessness."
The way an athlete uses a second makes the difference between winning and losing, Dr. Loehr said. So just think of the dissonant edges that can be smoothed, the idiosyncratic realities that can be bridged by mere mortals blessed with 86,401 extra seconds.
"Time," Francis Bacon wrote, "is the greatest innovator."

HEADLINE: Ordering Takeout? Chew on This First

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV

 BODY:
Just blame the children.
After all, before they were born, it was easy to go out to a restaurant. There was no fretting, no babysitters; the only decision was what kind of food to eat. Then they arrived, and dining out has never been the same. Especially since dining out now so often means dining in, eating food delivered from a restaurant in front of the television. 
 To a home diner, delivery must seem like a sad compromise when a fondly remembered fettucine Alfredo, served in a restaurant with spirited grating of cheese and milling of pepper, more closely resembles a glutinous softball in the living room. In truth, delivered food will rarely be as good as restaurant food. It all suffers to a certain degree in the course of delivery. But careful selection from menus and a few other basic steps can go a long way toward improving the chances of an enjoyable home-delivered meal.
Except in New York City, where for years the delivery choices depended on how efficiently restaurants slid their menus under apartment doors, home delivery around the country has meant little more than pizza. But home delivery is now among the fastest-growing segments of the food industry, a $6.8 billion business in 1991, up from $5.7 billion in 1988, according to the Hale Group, a management consultant to the food industry.
"There's no one in the household anymore who's responsible solely for the preparation of food," said Bill Hale, president of the Hale Group. "The restaurant industry has become a surrogate servant, preparing the in-home meal."
Across the nation, the choices have multiplied. In big cities, more and more restaurants of all price ranges have turned to home delivery to regain business lost to changing tastes and the recession. Chains like Ho-Lee Chow, a Chinese specialist in the Midwest, and Tony Roma, a nationwide barbecue chain, are specializing in takeout and home delivery.
In many areas, third-party services take orders and deliver from a variety of restaurants. Where there were just a handful of these services five years ago, there are now around 500, said Peter Hetherington, publisher of the newsletter Meal Delivery Digest. One such service, Bring Me My Dinner in East Norwalk, Conn., delivers from 44 restaurants, competing against five other services in Fairfield County, said its president, Charles Singewald.
However food comes to your door, here are some things to remember:
* Simpler foods travel better. In Indian food, for example, plain tandoori chicken, grilled in a clay oven, withstands travel better than dishes in heavy sauces, which can congeal.
* Cold and room-temperature items are good bets. Cucina, an Italian restaurant in Park Slope, Brooklyn, sells a wide-range of cold antipasto selections that travel well, including homemade sausages, lentil salads and a terrine of eggplant and roast peppers. Sushi travels very well.
* Crisp deep-fried foods like french fries or fried calamari often become soggy in the container. If you order fried food, make sure that it is from a nearby restaurant and that it can be delivered quickly.
* Don't expect food cooked to order. A hot dish often continues to cook in its delivery package. One of the best items for delivery at Good Enough to Eat, a homey American restaurant on the Upper West Side, is meatloaf, a dish in which warmth is more important than how well done it is.
* Pasta is a problem. Because it continues to cook in the container, home-delivered pasta can become gummy. "You have to undercook the pasta," said Phyllis Scicchitano, co-owner of Cucina. Stanley Poll, owner of William Poll, a fancy-food shop on the Upper East Side, agrees. "It's in the way you prepare it," he said. "If it has to go right from the oven to the table, I'd either not order it or ask if it comes in a reheatable container."
* Robust foods travel better than delicate ones. Baked clams, for example, need to be served hot and fresh; they can become rubbery during transport. A minestrone soup (which can be reheated) would be a better choice.
The last rule is the most basic of all. Delivery food can be only as good as the restaurant it comes from. If you don't like a pizza or the lo mein in the restaurant, it will not improve when it is delivered at your home.

HEADLINE: U.S. Has Long Supported U.N.'s Work

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Siddharth Dube's "U.S. vs. U.N." (Op-Ed, Sept. 28) broadly misrepresents true circumstances. 
 The United States is fully committed to the United Nations Charter. Explicit in the Charter is respect for the views of all members and dedication to world peace and development. The United States has tangibly and unselfishly contributed over the years to United Nations initiatives, many of them far removed from narrow definitions of national self-interest. The speech by President Bush at the General Assembly responded to the Secretary-General's agenda for peace by pledging United States cooperation in the wherewithal for United Nations peacemaking, peacekeeping, and peacebuilding efforts.
The United States has never entertained "fantasies" about United Nations capabilities, but the vision of a peaceful and prosperous world has never dimmed. As complementary instruments, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations have received consistent United States support.
The United States supports the Secretary-General's efforts to increase United Nations efficiency and effectiveness, including consolidation of departments. Contrary to Mr. Dube's assertion, development programs have not been cut back. United States impatience with the excesses of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization led us and other countries to withdraw from that organization, as is our right. The United States, however, remains an active contributor to other agencies, such as the United Nations Children's Fund, Development Program and High Commissioner for Refugees. We are fully paying our peacekeeping assessments, paying our regular assessments and have a plan to pay back arrears over three years.
The rest of Mr. Dube's article is full of presumptuous assumptions about the motives and intentions of the President and the United States. Let me assure Mr. Dube that the United States commitment to the promotion of global peace and security, including the welfare of all peoples, is undiminished.

HEADLINE: Japan's Emperor Tells China Only of His 'Sadness' on War

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 23

 BODY:
Emperor Akihito, opening the first visit to China by a Japanese monarch, acknowledged today that Japan's wartime occupation had "inflicted great suffering on the people of China," but he stopped short of the apology demanded by a growing number of Chinese.
 The Emperor's statement, made shortly after his arrival, unambiguously placed the blame on Japan for its wartime aggression, marking the clearest acceptance ever by Tokyo of responsibility for its conduct in the 1931 seizure of Manchuria, the 1937 invasion of China and the brutal occupation that followed. 
But the statement was also consistent with the position of the Japanese Government that no outright apology for Japanese actions was necessary. In addition, many prominent right-wing political groups in Japan had opposed issuing any kind of an apology on the Emperor's trip.
 At a banquet tonight in the Great Hall of the People, the first of many to be held for the Emperor and his wife, Empress Michiko, the Emperor said: "In the long history of relationships between our two countries, there was an unfortunate period in which my country inflicted great suffering on the people of China. About this I feel deep sadness."
 The Chinese authorities refused to say whether they considered the comments satisfactory. "It is up to the Japanese side to decide what remarks the Emperor will make during his visit to China," said Wu Jianmin, spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
 
Beijing Seeks Economic Aid
 The Emperor's arrival here, hailed by both countries as the first such visit in their 2,000-year relationship, was accompanied by a 21-gun salute and military bands that sent the strains of Japan's anthem once again wafting across Tiananmen Square. Eager for economic help and international recognition, Chinese officials said the visit represented "a new stage in relations."
The Japanese Government clearly hopes for the same, broadcasting videos on Chinese television this week to introduce Akihito as the symbol of a new, peace-loving and technologically advanced Japan.
 The trip also has great import diplomatically. China is worried that Washington will take a harder line against Beijing on human rights issues if Gov. Bill Clinton is elected President, and it wants to show its appreciation for Japan's support while other countries have expressed disapproval.
 Japan, on the other hand, is increasingly worried about signs of growing Chinese military strength and wants to improve the climate for greater economic and political cooperation with Beijing.
 
Limits on the Emperor
 According to the Japanese Constitution, the Emperor has no independent powers and all of his statements on sensitive matters are prepared by the elected Government and the Foreign Ministry bureaucracy, which have made it clear that they hope his six-day visit will increase popular support for Japanese-Chinese friendship.
 In recent months, the Japanese business community has become convinced that China's economic reforms are real and has revived its interest in investing in China. A consortium of Japan's biggest trading companies announced just before the Emperor's departure for Beijing that it was considering a $4 billion investment in a petrochemical complex in China, and other companies are investing heavily.
 But the war issue always threatens to create strains, with some signs that Chinese popular animosity toward Japan has even increased. Indeed, there is a widespread feeling throughout East Asia that Japan has been slow to face its militaristic past.
 
Rejects Reparations for Women
 In recent years, the Chinese have protested things like the way the war is described in Japanese textbooks, visits by Japanese political leaders to a shrine for Japanese war heroes and statements by some Japanese politicians that China has exaggerated the number of people killed in the war.
 In recent months, Chinese feelings were inflamed by Japan's refusal to pay reparations to the families of Chinese and Korean women who have come forward after decades to silence to say that they were kidnapped during the war and forced to provide sex to Japanese troops.
 Japan maintains that it settled the issue of the war with China in 1972, when it established diplomatic relations with Beijing. At that time, China dropped its demand for reparations but cleared the way for large amounts of investment and trade.
 In the nearly four years since Akihito ascended to the Chrysanthemum Throne, Japanese officials have reluctantly edged the new Emperor beyond the vague locutions of his father, Hirohito, who often referred to the "unfortunate" and "regrettable" past, but never acknowledged Japan's specific responsibility for the invasions launched in his name.
 Akihito has been more forthcoming, especially at a 1990 dinner with Roh Tae Woo, the President of South Korea, and during a tour last year that the Emperor took through Southeast Asia. But in China, where 20 million people were killed or wounded at Japanese hands, sensitivities are especially acute.
 
Echoes of Pearl Harbor Issue
 The debate in Tokyo over how to word tonight's speech cast a shadow over the Emperor's departure for several weeks. It also echoed a similar debate on the 50th anniversary of the bombing of Pearl Harbor last Dec. 7. At that time, Japanese officials said they were reflecting deeply on Japanese deeds but did not think an apology to the United States was appropriate.
 Most younger Japanese say they see no reason that the Emperor should not apologize. Some express resentment at what they say is the tendency by Japan's neighbors, including China, to bring up the question of apologizing in order to embarrass Japan into giving more foreign aid or trade concessions.
 But powerful voices in the right wing of the governing Liberal Democratic Party say an apology would humiliate the country and the new Emperor. They also say Japan did nothing worse in China than Britain, the United States or other colonial powers trying to carve up its territory.
 
No Signs of Protest
 One of Japan's largest dailies, Mainichi Shimbun, noted today that the Chinese Government "has promised a nationwide welcome" and cleared the streets of dissenters seeking apologies and monetary compensation.
 In fact, on the streets of Beijing today, few seemed to be paying much attention to the 58-year-old monarch. He was greeted at the airport by young Japanese students waving paper flags, and at the official guesthouse by 500 Chinese children.
 Only small crowds gathered for the formal arrival ceremonies on Tiananmen Square. There were no protests, perhaps because some of those leading the campaign for Japanese compensation have reportedly been sent away on business trips or detained by the police.
