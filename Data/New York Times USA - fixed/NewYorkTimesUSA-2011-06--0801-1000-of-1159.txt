HEADLINE: Are Taxes High or Low? A Further Look

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: While some assert that a drastic lowering of tax rates could pay for itself by unleashing growth, taxes are already lower for most Americans than they have been since the 1960s, an economist writes.

 BODY:
Bruce Bartlett held senior policy roles in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations and served on the staffs of Representatives Jack Kemp and Ron Paul.
A couple of weeks ago, I discussed the low level of federal taxes as a share of the gross domestic product in the United States, both historically and in comparison with other developed economies. I noted that total federal revenue -- income, corporate and payroll taxes combined --- has been below 15 percent of gross domestic product for three years in a row, its lowest level since 1950 and well below the postwar average of about 18.5 percent of G.D.P.
Judging by their comments, a great many readers were incredulous. For years, Republicans have told them over and over again that taxes in the United States are exceptionally high and the primary obstacle to growth, and that a huge tax cut would do more to raise growth than any other policy.
For example, former Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, has proposed reducing the top statutory income tax rate on individuals to 25 percent and abolishing the taxation of interest, dividends and capital gains. The Tax Policy Center estimates that this plan would reduce federal revenues by $8 trillion over the next decade. 
Governor Pawlenty contends that unprecedented growth will result -- to such an extent that there will actually be no revenue loss at all.I am not picking on Governor Pawlenty; all of the candidates for the Republican presidential nomination support similar policies, and not one has criticized him for making outlandish claims. Rather, I want to emphasize how widespread the view is, at least among Republicans, that Americans are overtaxed.
A common criticism of my earlier point about federal taxes as a share of G.D.P. is that I ignored marginal tax rates -- the tax on each additional dollar earned -- and the payroll tax, which is the largest tax that most people pay. Of course, I did not ignore the payroll tax; it is part of total federal revenues. But the point about marginal rates is worth exploring further, since economists agree that this is often the most important tax rate for economic decision-making.
The Tax Policy Center annually calculates average and marginal tax rates for four-person families with the same relative income. It starts with the median income, which is the exact middle of the income distribution, with half of all families above and half below. It then calculates tax rates for those with half the median income, a common definition for the working poor, and twice the median income, which would represent the reasonably well-to-do. 
The table below shows the average and marginal tax rates for each of these families since 1955, including both federal income taxes and the employee share of payroll taxes.
As one can see, average tax rates on the working poor have never been lower; in fact, they pay neither income taxes nor the employee's share of the payroll tax, because the earned income tax credit offsets both and even gives them a small refund on top. 
However, the tax credit is phased out at a rate of 21.06 percent for families with two children after their earned income reaches $16,690. The loss of a refundable credit is exactly the same, economically, as paying more taxes, and this is what imposes such high marginal rates on the working poor.
A typical middle-class family, on the other hand, is paying less in federal taxes than it has since 1967. Its marginal rate is also down substantially since it peaked in 1982 at 31.7 percent. The well-to-do family, too, has seen its average and marginal tax rates decline substantially.
Of course, these data do not prove that taxes are not too high. That is a subjective judgment related to issues of fairness and the value that people assign to the government benefits they receive in return. Many in the Tea Party talk as if the value of government is zero; consequently, they would probably complain about any tax level above zero.
Nevertheless, it is clear that federal taxes have not been rising and are, at least in historical terms, lower for most taxpayers than they have been since the 1960s. Those who assert that taxes are rising or are at confiscatory levels simply do not know what they are talking about.

HEADLINE: The Mayors' Foreign Policy

BYLINE: CLYDE HABERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Day: The United States Conference of Mayors is urging President Obama to bring home the troops, and the investments. Forty years ago, it spoke out more forcefully. Also, what City Room is reading in other papers and blogs.

 BODY:
New York mayors have long reserved the right to their own foreign policy, whether or not it jibes with what the striped-pants set is saying in Washington. Edward I. Koch and Rudolph W. Giuliani were singularly outspoken.
 On occasion the City Council has also chimed in on something international besides a pancake house, typically by renaming a street. In that manner, it has expressed opinions on Israel (with Yitzhak Rabin Way and United Jerusalem Place), Cuba (Brothers to the Rescue Corner), South Africa (Nelson and Winnie Mandela Corner) and Nigeria (Kudirat Abiola Corner). 
 But the city has now been left in the dust on America's defining foreign entanglements of this generation: the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
 On Monday, with no detectable New York involvement, the United States Conference of Mayors passed a resolution urging President Obama and Congress to get their act together and "speed up the ending of these wars." The conflicts are costing the United States $126 billion a year, the resolution said, and the money would be better spent on repairing America's broken economy and infrastructure and on reducing the federal debt. 
 "It's time to bring our investments back home," Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa of Los Angeles said as he assumed the presidency of the mayors conference at its annual gathering, held in Baltimore. "We can't be building roads and bridges in Baghdad and Kandahar, and not in Baltimore and Kansas City." 
 The resolution could hardly be considered flamingly radical, not with its call to end the wars "as soon as strategically possible" and to withdraw American forces "in a measured way that does not destabilize the region." That's a far cry from, "Out - now!"
 Indeed, "it reflects in large part what the president believes," Mr. Villaraigosa said Monday evening in a phone interview from Washington after he and other mayors met with Mr. Obama at the White House. By coincidence, the president is planning a speech for Wednesday to announce the scale and the pace of troop withdrawals from Afghanistan. 
 Carefully worded though the mayors' resolution was, including a requisite expression of support for "our brave men and women in uniform and their families," it was a striking departure for the conference. The group normally leaves foreign and defense matters to the pros. The last time it spoke up like this was 40 years ago, during the Vietnam War.
 It did so more daringly back then. In June 1971, it passed a resolution calling on President Richard M. Nixon not only to pull all United States forces out of Vietnam but also to do so in nothing flat - by the end of that year. A leader of that antiwar action was New York's own, Mayor John V. Lindsay.
 Over the decades, New York's chief executives have tended to stand aloof from their brother and sister mayors. But Mr. Lindsay, who had national ambitions, got into the thick of things over an unpopular war. Not that his resolution changed anything. And a year later, the conference did a full 180, voting a new resolution that supported the Nixon administration on Vietnam. The war dragged on.
 There's no reason to expect this latest resolution to be any more of a catalyst for bringing the troops home. That said, it is an unmistakable sign of how weary of these long wars the country has become, and how much pain the nation's cities have felt since the economy headed south three years ago. New York is no exception, though there has been no comparable formal expression of dismay from the mayor or the City Council since the invasion of Iraq eight years ago. 
 But don't view the Baltimore resolution as an antiwar protest, Mr. Villaraigosa cautioned. "We saw this as a jobs issue, pure and simple," he said. Mayor Michael A. Nutter of Philadelphia, the conference's new vice president, made a similar point. "We don't consider this to be a quote-unquote war resolution," Mr. Nutter said by phone. "We actually consider it to be an economic policy resolution." 
 "I think," he said, "that it's mirroring what's really going on in the country."
 For full local Times coverage, including news that a large number of court-appointed receivers for distressed properties in New York are politically connected lawyers, that prosecutors charged that nearly all of the $600 million paid to the main contractor for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's CityTime project has been tainted by fraud and that the police suspect that the gunman who killed four in a Long Island pharmacy on Sunday was addicted to painkillers, see the N.Y./Region section.

HEADLINE: Senate Republicans Ponder Marriage Vote as Clock Ticks

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
ALBANY -- With the legislative clock ticking down to its final hours, the Republicans who control the State Senate still have not decided whether to allow a vote on same-sex marriage.
A vast majority of the 32 Senate Republicans oppose same-sex marriage. But at least a couple of them support the measure, and the Republican caucus is under enormous pressure from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York and gay-rights groups to permit a vote on the issue.
Many lawmakers and staff members have said publicly and privately that they believe the issue would probably pass the 62-member Senate if it were put to a vote. There are already 31 declared votes in favor of same-sex marriage -- 29 of the 30 Democrats, and two of the Republicans -- and several Republicans have acknowledged they are undecided. 
Republican senators, who say they are trying to operate by consensus, have spent hours discussing their feelings about marriage, and about homosexuality, over the past week. Some of the Republicans are morally opposed to same-sex marriage; some are open to it but concerned about the political implications for themselves and their party; some say they are worried about the repercussions for socially conservative religious organizations; and some argue that the issue should be decided by popular referendum, not legislation.
''Gay marriage is something that the conference still has to make a decision on, and has not done so,'' said Senator Thomas W. Libous of Binghamton, the second-ranking Republican in the Senate.
Mr. Libous said he thought the Republican caucus would make a decision on marriage Wednesday morning, because some lawmakers hoped to leave Albany that night. The Senate majority leader, Dean G. Skelos of Long Island, affirmed that point on Tuesday, saying that he expected the legislative session to end Wednesday.
The governor said Tuesday that he believed ''the people are entitled to a vote on this issue.''
''It is an important issue, there's been a lot of discussions, there's a lot of opinions, there's a lot of information, there's been a lot of public demonstrations in this building, and I believe people are entitled to a vote,'' he said. ''Let the elected officials stand up and say yea or nay. I believe that's how democracy works, and I believe the state is entitled to a vote on this issue.''
Some Republican senators said they believed the session could continue for a day or two.
''It appears by mid- to later in the week, we'll be gone, so that's the time constraints that you're working up against,'' said Senator Joseph A. Griffo, a Republican from Rome, who opposes same-sex marriage.
''There are some who may feel like, should we do this at all; there are some that feel we should do it; there are some that want to vote, regardless of how they're going to vote,'' he added, calling it ''an evolving conversation'' among his colleagues.
The internal politics of the Senate Republican caucus have been complicated this week by the most intense protests to date against same-sex marriage. The demonstrations -- throngs clogged the Senate halls on Monday -- were countered on Tuesday with a rally of several hundred people supporting same-sex marriage, and the competing protests served to remind Republicans of the risks their party faces from its conservative base if a majority Republican Senate passes same-sex marriage.
At the same time, Senate Republicans have enjoyed unusually good relations with Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who has supported significant parts of the Republican Party's economic agenda, even while intensely lobbying for same-sex marriage.
Republicans would please significant parts of their electoral base if they adjourned without a vote, but there are also potential risks to the party, which would undoubtedly be criticized by some as antidemocratic if it refused to allow an open vote on a high-profile issue. And Republican lawmakers might then have to confront the issue again next year, when all state lawmakers will face voters.
The state's Conservative Party, which has provided key support to many Republican candidates, staunchly opposes the measure.

HEADLINE: Indian Company Under Scrutiny Over U.S. Visas

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON and VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
A giant Indian outsourcing company with thousands of employees in the United States is facing an expanding federal investigation prompted by claims from an American whistle-blower that it misused short-term visitors' visas to bring in low-cost workers from India.
Accusations that the company, Infosys Technologies, repeatedly violated the terms of business visitor visas were first raised in a lawsuit filed in February in Alabama by Jack Palmer, an Infosys project manager. Aside from Mr. Palmer, at least two other Infosys managers in the United States have submitted internal whistle-blower reports pointing to Indians on business visitor visas who were performing longer-term work not authorized under those visas, according to internal documents and current Infosys managers.
In May, Infosys acknowledged that it had received a subpoena from a federal grand jury in Texas seeking information about the company's use of the visitor documents, known as B-1 visas, which are easier to obtain. This month, N. R. Narayana Murthy, an Infosys founder, expressed his concern about that investigation at a board meeting in Bangalore, India, in his final address before he retired as company chairman. 
''As I leave the board, I feel sad'' about the subpoena, he said. ''The issue will be decided on its merits in due course,'' said Mr. Murthy, who is something of a legend in global business for building the company over three decades from a $250 investment into an outsourcing powerhouse with $6 billion in revenues.
In papers filed in Mr. Palmer's lawsuit, Infosys denied all his accusations and asked a federal judge to remove the dispute from court and send it to arbitration. In a statement, Infosys said it was committed to ''absolute compliance'' with American visa requirements and had undertaken an internal review of its practices.
''Infosys is a large and rapidly growing company,'' the statement said. ''We have made changes over time to certain of our policies relating to the business visa program and we may continue to make improvements in those policies and controls.''
The Infosys inquiry coincides with a broader attack in Congress on longer-term visas, known as H-1B, that Infosys and other Indian companies rely on to bring Indian technology workers to the United States. With unemployment for Americans stubbornly high, lawmakers have become increasingly reluctant to defend H-1B visas, which give temporary residence to highly skilled foreigners. In recent years, the top companies receiving those visas were not American names, but Infosys and another big Indian outsourcing company, Wipro.
Last week, Representative Zoe Lofgren of California, the senior Democrat on the immigration subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee, introduced a bill that would increase the wages employers would have to pay H-1B workers, in an effort to ensure they do not undercut Americans. The measure is specifically aimed at Indian outsourcing companies. Last year, Congress added an extra $2,000 to the fee for H-1B visas, in another move aimed at the Indian companies.
Yet the criminal investigation is perhaps the most worrisome development for Infosys, which enjoys a reputation as one of India's best-run and most respected companies. The events began with Mr. Palmer, 43, a project manager from Alabama who was hired by the company in 2008. In a sworn affidavit he submitted to the federal court, Mr. Palmer said his differences with Infosys management began after he was summoned to a meeting in Bangalore in March 2010. Top executives, he said, discussed ways to ''creatively'' get around H-1B visa limitations ''to fulfill the high demand for its customers at lower cost.''
In general, B-1 visas are granted to business visitors coming to the United States for short stays to attend meetings, conferences or training sessions, or to install specialized equipment. Visitors may not be employed for contract work like H-1B workers, nor can they be paid salaries in this country. There is no annual limit on business visitor visas, whereas H-1B visas are restricted to 85,000 a year.
Mr. Palmer said his supervisors asked him to write letters inviting workers to come from India for sales and training meetings, letters he believed were false. ''I refused to write the letters,'' he said.
After word got out of his refusal, Mr. Palmer said, he was chastised by his managers and began to receive threats by e-mail and telephone. In October, Infosys has confirmed, Mr. Palmer filed a whistle-blower report about B-1 visa holders from India assigned to projects he or others managed. His report said the B-1 visa holders were doing the same tasks as workers on H-1B visas, including writing and testing software code. Mr. Palmer said he personally knew of at least 60 Indian workers doing contract work on B-1 visas.
Mr. Palmer still works at Infosys. He feels isolated and besieged within the company, according to Kenneth Mendelsohn, his lawyer in Montgomery, who has instructed him not to speak publicly about his experience.
''I'm protecting him as best I can so Infosys doesn't fire him,'' Mr. Mendelsohn said. But Mr. Mendelsohn provided documents and e-mails that he said Mr. Palmer has shared with investigators from the State Department Bureau of Diplomatic Security, the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department.
In one e-mail, another Infosys manager confirmed to Mr. Palmer that three Indians on B-1 visas were ''working on client sites'' on a contract with Baker Hughes, an oil services company in Houston.
In an e-mail exchange with Jeffrey Friedel, a top lawyer for Infosys, Mr. Palmer described the work assigned to one B-1 visa holder on a project for Heidrick & Struggles, an executive search company in Chicago. ''His project task consists of reviewing designs and then to physically create and write test scripts,'' Mr. Palmer wrote. ''This process is repeated over many weeks.''
Referring to the same employee, another manager wrote that he was ''working on a B-1 visa'' and cautioned his colleagues not to include the man's name in any contracts. ''We can't put name on B-1 people for contract,'' the manager wrote.
In an e-mail in December, Mr. Friedel assured Mr. Palmer that the issues he had raised ''have made it clear to management that certain changes need to be made to our systems.'' Mr. Friedel enumerated seven steps the company would take to prevent misuse of visitor visas.
But only this month, another Infosys manager became alarmed after discovering by chance that B-1 workers were among the team members on a project under the manager's supervision. ''There was no significant difference between the B-1 and the H-1B employees in the type of work they did,'' the manager, who was granted anonymity out of fears of retaliation by the company, said in an interview.
At least one of Infosys' major clients, Wal-Mart, has been contacted by investigators about its contracts with Infosys. Greg Rossiter, a Wal-Mart spokesman, declined to comment. There has been no suggestion of wrongdoing by any Infosys client mentioned in the visa investigations.
A State Department official in India said Infosys and other Indian companies had made use in recent years of an exception in the complex visa guidelines that allows them to send workers to the United States on B-1 visas for up to six months for certain short-term projects that might otherwise have required an H-1B visa. Since last year, the State Department has clamped down on the use of that exception and is considering whether to eliminate it, the official and several outsourcing executives in India said.
Mr. Palmer, who is known as Jay, filed his lawsuit claiming that Infosys had failed to protect him from threats from within the company he received after submitting his whistle-blower report, and had unfairly withheld more than $100,000 in bonuses he was owed. Described by his lawyer, Mr. Mendelsohn, as ''on an emotional roller coaster,'' Mr. Palmer has reported receiving a new death threat against himself and his family as recently as April.
While denying Mr. Palmer's claims, Infosys has noted that Indian employees with business visitor visas are a small part -- less than 2 percent -- of its teams in the United States. The company reports a total of 15,500 employees in this country, including 10,100 on H-1B visas. North American clients account for 65 percent of the company's revenue.
At least one top Indian executive overseeing United States immigration procedures has resigned from the company, Infosys said.
But Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee who closely monitors United States visa programs, said he remained skeptical of Infosys's intentions.
''It appears the B-1 visa program has become a subterfuge for companies wanting to avoid the cap-and-wage requirements of the H-1B visa,'' Mr. Grassley said.

HEADLINE: Sales of Existing Homes Hit Six-Month Low in May

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Sales of previously owned homes hit a six-month low in May and the supply rose, pointing to a housing market still struggling to regain its footing. 
The National Association of Realtors said on Tuesday that sales slipped 3.8 percent month over month to an annual rate of 4.81 million units, the lowest since November.
It was the second straight month of declines. The drop was smaller than economists had expected, but the April sales figure was revised lower, leaving a report that was largely in line with expectations in financial markets.
While the fall in sales last month was partly a result of tornadoes and flooding, with sales in the Midwest and South hit the hardest, it underscored fundamental weakness.
''It's indicative of the depressed housing demand that we have been seeing for some time, and that's a function of the slow economic recovery and tight credit markets,'' said Michelle Meyer, an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York.
At May's weak sales pace, it would take 9.3 months to clear the inventory of previously owned homes on the market. That is up from a nine-month supply in April.
The report was the latest to confirm a sustained weakness in the economy through the second quarter, which has been marked by a sharp slowdown in regional factory activity, soft retail sales and anemic employment growth.
But the smaller-than-expected decline in sales was yet another hopeful sign that the economy was set to regain momentum in the second half of the year.
In the 12 months to May, home resales were down 15.3 percent.
There were 3.72 million previously owned homes on the market in May, excluding so-called shadow inventory.
The month's supply was the highest in six months and a supply of six to seven months is generally considered ideal, with higher readings pointing to lower house prices.
The generally weak housing market tone was underscored by the median home price, which at $166,500 was 4.6 percent lower than a year earlier. That compared with a 6.6 percent decline in April.

HEADLINE: Markets Surge as Fear Of a Greek Default Eases

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Global stocks rallied and the euro rose on Tuesday on growing optimism that Greece would be able to hold off a debt default ahead of a vote of confidence in the Greek government.
The vote, held after markets had closed in the United States, was a crucial hurdle that Greece had to clear to avert a debt default. As expected, Parliament reaffirmed its confidence in the administration of Prime Minister George Papandreou in the early morning vote in Athens on Wednesday.
World stocks had tumbled almost 8 percent from three-year highs in early May as the threat of a disorderly restructuring of Greek debt shook global markets and banking shares in Europe and elsewhere. 
Euro zone finance ministers said the Greek government had until July 3 to approve reforms to get the next installment of 110 billion euros ($157 billion) in aid from the European Union and International Monetary Fund.
''There is increased optimism that one, the prime minister will survive the confidence motion tonight and two, that will pave the way for austerity measures to be passed,'' said Nick Stamenkovic, a strategist at RIA Capital Markets in London.
''As a result, Greece will get the necessary financing to push the debt restructuring further down the road,'' Mr. Stamenkovic said. ''But the stakes are high.''
European shares rose at their fastest pace in two months, and benchmark government debt prices on both sides of the Atlantic fell.
On Wall Street, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 17.16 points, or 1.34 percent, at 1,295.52, posting its largest percentage daily gain in two months.
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 109.63 points, or 0.91 percent, at 12,190.01. The Nasdaq composite was up 57.60 points, or 2.19 percent, at 2,687.26.
Earlier in Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top regional shares added 1.5 percent to close at 1,096.95, its biggest gain since April 20. The MSCI world equity index rose 1.6 percent and an index of emerging market stocks gained 1.5 percent.
The Federal Reserve began a two-day meeting that ends Wednesday, when Fed watchers hope to learn more about the United States central bank's policy to deal with an economy that shows signs of slowing while underlying inflation pressures build.
The euro was up 0.01 percent at $1.4410. Even though Mr. Papandreou's cabinet survived the confidence vote, the euro's gain could still be short-lived since it would not necessarily guarantee that Greece would be able to pass new austerity measures on June 28, traders said.
''The picture is so uncertain about the euro zone periphery that it will prevent big investors from taking large directional positions,'' said Roberto Mialich, currency strategist at UniCredit in Milan. He expected gains to be capped below $1.4450.
Crude oil prices turned negative just before noon in New York trading after the monetary fund warned Spain of considerable risks to its recovery.
The August contract for light crude settled up 54 cents at $94.17.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note was down 6/32 to 101 8/32. The yield rose to 2.98 percent, from 2.96 percent on Monday.
Gold rose for a third day, driven by a weaker dollar and uncertainty over the outcome of the Greek confidence vote.
June gold futures finished up $4.50 at $1,546 an ounce.

HEADLINE: 100 Days

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
There is something crazy about what is going on in our country today. Our fiscal condition continues on an unsustainable path, the European currency is heading for a crackup, the Arab world is in the midst of a crackup, unemployment is creeping upward and basically our two parties are telling us that they will not make the reforms that we know are necessary because it would involve too much pain and could imperil their chances of winning the presidency in 2012.
Ever since President Franklin D. Roosevelt's legendary ''First 100 Days'' in office -- which stabilized a country ravaged by the Depression -- the first 100 days of every president have been used as a measuring stick for success. That's over. I've said this before, and I believe it even more strongly today: We've gone from the first 100 days to the ''Only 100 Days.'' 
Really -- it feels as if Barack Obama had 100 days to push through the basics we needed to stabilize the economy and then lay the basis for his one big initiative -- health care reform -- and then he was preparing for the midterms, and then he was recovering from his midterm losses and then he was announcing his re-election bid and then, judging from all the Republicans who have declared for the presidency already, the 2012 race got started. As such, the chances of the two parties successfully doing something big, hard and together to fix the huge problems staring us in the face are very small -- unless the market or Mother Nature imposes it upon them.
Therefore, let us all now hold our breath and hope that nothing really bad happens until the next president has his or her 100 days in early 2013 to take a quick shot at fixing the country before getting ready for the 2014 midterms and 2016 elections.
There is no way that America can remain a great country if the opportunities for meaningful reform are reduced to either market- or and climate-induced crises and 100 working days every four years. We need a full-time government, and instead we've created a Congress that is a full-time fund-raising enterprise that occasionally legislates and a White House that, save for 100 days, has to be in perpetual campaign mode.
To get elected today, politicians increasingly have to play to their bases and promise things that they cannot possibly deliver (5 percent annual growth for a decade) or solutions to our problems that will be painless for their constituencies (we'll just raise taxes on the rich or we'll just cut taxes even more) or to keep things just as they are even though we know they can't possibly stay that way without bankrupting the country (Social Security and Medicare benefits).
The truth is, we need to do four things at once if we have any hope of maintaining American greatness: We need more stimulus to keep the economy from slipping back into recession. But we need to combine that stimulus with a credible, legislated, long-term plan for cutting spending and getting the deficit under control -- e.g., the Simpson-Bowles deficit-reduction plan. And we need to raise new revenues in order to reinvest in the sources of our strength: education, infrastructure and government-funded research to push out the boundaries of knowledge.
That's right. We need to do four things at once: spend, cut, tax and invest. And unless we do all four at once we're not going to break out of our slow decline. But to do all four at once will require a new hybrid politics, which does not conform to the political agenda of either major party.
The Democrats are ready for more stimulus but have refused to signal any serious willingness to cut entitlements, like Medicare, that we know are unsustainable in their present form. The Republicans are all for spending cuts but refuse to accept any tax increases that we need to pay for the past and invest in the future. So what we're basically saying as a country is that unless the market or Mother Nature make us pay, we are going to hand this whole bill over to our children.
Maybe it is just my friends, but I find more and more people completely disgusted by this situation and looking for a serious Third Party candidate who could run in 2012 and deliver the shock therapy to the corrupt, encrusted, two-party duopoly now running the show in America.
Such a Third Party would have a simple agenda: 1) Inject a short-term stimulus. 2) Enact Simpson-Bowles. 3) Shrink our presence in Afghanistan. 4) Raise automobile mileage standards. 5) Impose a gasoline tax to pay for a massive increase in government-supported scientific research and a carbon tax to pay for new infrastructure and stimulate clean-power innovation.
Do I think such a Third Party can win in 2012? Not likely. But it doesn't have to win to be effective. If such a party attracted substantial voters on such a platform, it would shape the agendas of the Republicans and Democrats. They would both have to move to attract these voters by changing their own platforms and, in so doing, might even create a mandate for the next president to govern for an entire term -- not just 100 days.

HEADLINE: Albany Reaches Deal on Tax Cap And Rent Rules

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE and THOMAS KAPLAN; Danny Hakim contributed reporting.

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and legislative leaders struck a tentative deal on Tuesday paving the way for a vote on issues that affect millions of New Yorkers -- renewing regulation of rent-regulated apartments, capping property taxes for homeowners and raising tuition at state universities -- but reached no agreement on whether to take a vote on legalizing same-sex marriage.
Mr. Cuomo praised the deal as significant progress toward his key goals, but some rank-and-file Democrats questioned whether the agreement would do enough to protect the millions of New York City residents who live in rent-regulated apartments. 
The state's annual legislative session had been scheduled to end on Monday, and lawmakers are now pushing to complete their work and go home.
The rent, property tax and tuition measures -- some details of which were still being negotiated on Tuesday night -- are expected to begin moving to the floor of the Senate and Assembly on Wednesday. At the same time, Mr. Cuomo and Senate Republicans continue to negotiate details of the marriage bill, which is strongly supported by the governor and the Democratic-controlled Assembly, but is one vote short of majority support in the Republican-controlled Senate.
The passage of the housing and education measures, and the success or failure of same-sex marriage, will put a final stamp on Mr. Cuomo's eventful first six months in office, which had been marked by battles with core constituencies in his own party over economic and fiscal issues.
The rent deal appeared to fall well short of what many Democrats and tenant activists had hoped for, though Democratic lawmakers will probably vote for it. And the modest strengthening of rent regulations came at a high price for Democrats from New York City -- a commitment to pass a property tax cap, which many Democratic lawmakers fear will exacerbate disparities in education spending between wealthy and poor school districts.
The renewal of rent regulations would leave in place laws that allow landlords to deregulate apartments when tenants' rent and income reach certain thresholds, but would raise those thresholds, to $2,500 from $2,000 in monthly rent, and to $200,000 from $175,000 in annual household income. Tenant advocates had sought for more than a decade to abolish the deregulation laws, and they hoped finally to achieve that goal under Mr. Cuomo, a popular Democrat.
The proposed rent deal also requires that landlords document more of the money they spend to improve rent-stabilized apartments before they can pass along those costs to renters.
But with Senate Republicans, whose districts have relatively few regulated apartments, unwilling to make further concessions, Assembly leaders appeared ready to settle for what they could get.
''I think the days of pushing are over,'' said the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat. ''We have come up with a deal that -- as opposed to expiration, as opposed to straight extender, which has been the Senate position all along -- is a significant improvement.''
Mr. Cuomo, speaking to reporters Tuesday night, said the rent deal represented progress for tenants. ''You can have an opinion, but there are also facts, and the facts are that this extends and strengthens the laws,'' he said. ''And the fact is, this is a much better deal than the last arrangement that was agreed on rent renewal.''
But the deal drew sharp criticism from tenant advocates.
''Governor Cuomo has been telling people for months that the big difference between 1997 and now is that George Pataki is not the governor and that he is a strong Democrat and that he is going to deliver real rent reform,'' said Michael McKee, the treasurer of the Tenants Political Action Committee, referring to a previous renewal deal forged by Mr. Pataki, a Republican. ''This is not real rent reform. This is continuing the phase-out and elimination of the entire rent regulation system in the downstate region.''
Lawmakers also agreed to allow the State University of New York and the City University of New York to raise tuition at a rate of $300 a year in each of the next five years. While full details of the deal were not available on Tuesday, lawmakers said students who depend on state financial aid to pay their full tuition bills would be exempt from the increase.
The property tax measure, which affects homeowners throughout New York, would cap annual increases in the amount of property taxes collected annually by school districts and towns at 2 percent a year or the rate of inflation, whichever is lower, while offering some relief for local governments from state spending mandates. Mr. Cuomo and Senate Republicans say the legislation will curb soaring property taxes in places like Long Island, Westchester County and pockets of upstate New York, where residents face some of the highest property taxes in the country.
The proposed tax cap, the broad outlines of which were hashed out by Mr. Cuomo and legislative leaders last month, drew praise from business groups that had pushed hard for the measure.
''Clearly, the property tax cap puts a discipline on continued growth in local spending and state mandates for spending that we haven't been able to achieve on any other basis,'' said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, an association of business leaders. ''From the standpoint of the taxpayer, and the overall economic interests of the state, this is a very good thing.''
Economists and analysts have a range of opinions about the effectiveness of property tax caps. While conservatives tend to like them, those on the left often prefer tax breaks aimed at low- and middle-income families.
New York's tax cap is more closely modeled on a cap that has been in place for years in Massachusetts, which limits the overall tax increases in a school district, as opposed to assessments.
Joan Youngman, senior fellow at the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, a Massachusetts research group that studies land use, said the 2.5 percent tax cap in Massachusetts, passed in the 1970s, had been effective.
''To have a state that was known as 'Tax-achusetts' that had a commitment to many social programs putting in a limit that caused real pain and cutbacks, and gradually over time to work our way through it -- all you can hope for is relative stability,'' Ms. Youngman said. ''I don't want to jinx Massachusetts, but it has for several decades been a relatively stable situation, and when it comes to property taxes, that is high praise,'' she added.

HEADLINE: Reviving a Nuclear Plant

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Nuclear Plant, Left for Dead, Shows a Pulse'' (front page, June 16): 
Your article about the Tennessee Valley Authority's plans for our uncompleted Bellefonte nuclear plant exaggerated the significance of Bellefonte's older design and painted a picture of a decrepit ''salvage heap.''
T.V.A. is rigorously inspecting Bellefonte and will replace any components that do not measure up to modern standards. Nuclear safety systems will receive the greatest scrutiny. Control systems will be updated to digital, and the control room will be the most advanced in the nation.
While some equipment and material have been removed from Bellefonte and used elsewhere by T.V.A., most of it would have been replaced anyway before the unit was allowed to operate. The massive steel-reinforced concrete structures at Bellefonte are as strong and safe as any modern structures.
T.V.A.'s successes in restoring to service Browns Ferry Unit 1 and Watts Bar Unit 1 -- both of which are older than Bellefonte -- have taught us how to fully evaluate and modernize nuclear plants to ensure safe and economical operation. Should we proceed with Bellefonte Unit 1, we expect its power to be competitively priced and the best option for electricity that is both safe and clean.

HEADLINE: Crimes Against Property, as Protests

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
Do crimes against property in which no one is killed or injured constitute acts of terrorism? That is one of two nagging questions that run through Marshall Curry and Sam Cullman's thoughtful documentary, ''If a Tree Falls: A Story of the Earth Liberation Front.'' The other has to do with the efficacy of traditional forms of peaceful protest.
In the 1990s, frustrated by its inability to accomplish its goals, the Earth Liberation Front, a leaderless international coalition of radical environmental groups, turned to acts of civil disobedience and destruction of symbols of environmental abuse. Were these actions, which caused many millions of dollars' worth of damage, terrorist acts? 
In March 2001 the American arm of the front was designated as the country's ''No. 1 domestic terrorist threat'' by the F.B.I. After 9/11 that description became a loaded term, the word ''terrorist'' implying a murderous agenda by a group devoted (in its own words) to ''economic sabotage and guerrilla warfare to stop the exploitation and destruction of the environment'' through nonviolent means. But is burning down a company and threatening the livelihood of its workers truly nonviolent?
The film focuses on the life of Daniel McGowan, a mild-mannered idealist who for several years was caught up in the front's campaign, which grew to include arson. In December 2005, several years after leaving the group, Mr. McGowan was arrested in New York and sentenced to seven years at the federal penitentiary in Marion, Ill.; in February of this year he was moved to a similar prison in Terre Haute, Ind. The sentence came with a ''terrorism enhancement'' provision that allows a judge to apply a harsher standard if the crime fits the traditional concept of ''terrorism.'' But does it?
Evenhandedly weighing both sides of these issues, ''If a Tree Falls'' is cautiously sympathetic to Mr. McGowan, who says he now regrets some of his actions, as do other front members who were part of a cell that was broken in an extensive F.B.I. investigation known as Operation Backfire.
''If a Tree Falls'' is a personal story that doesn't strive to be a comprehensive history of the Earth Liberation Front. According to the film, the cell in which Mr. McGowan operated as a prime mover crumbled amid heated debate about whether to cross the line into physical violence and go after captains of industry. Today autonomous, anonymous cells of the front still operate, although with much less frequency.
Soft-spoken and out of shape, Mr. McGowan doesn't fit the popular image of a fiery-eyed radical activist. Born in 1974, the son of a New York policeman, he attended business school and briefly worked for a large public relations company. Galvanized by a documentary film about environmental destruction, he moved to Eugene, Ore., where he threw himself into environmental causes. One of his earliest radical acts was to be a lookout while front members burned down a timber plant.
The film's sobriety and carefully balanced arguments make it an exemplary piece of reporting, although its emotional heat rarely rises to a boil. The most heartbreaking scenes show 500-year-old redwoods being felled and harvested and aerial views of clear-cut forest that resemble scraggly bald patches on a half-shaved head. Although a lumber executive says that for every tree cut down, six more are planted, it still hurts to see these majestic, centuries-old forest sentinels reduced to plywood.
In the most inflammatory scene, overzealous police officers in Eugene douse protesters with pepper spray and tear gas as they cling to trees that are about to be cut down to make room for a corporate parking lot. That confrontation helped push the Earth Liberation Front to take bolder actions that included the burning down of timber companies, S.U.V. dealerships, a wild-horse slaughterhouse and a $12 million ski lodge in Vail, Colo.
The film visits Mr. McGowan at his sister's New York apartment, where he stayed while under house arrest. He is the furthest thing from a firebrand. The film's contrite talking heads acknowledge that serious mistakes were made. On May 20, 2001, a poplar farm wrongly believed to be raising genetically engineered trees was set on fire. On the same day a $2 million fire destroyed the Center for Urban Horticulture at the University of Washington, where, it turned out, there were no genetically engineered plants.
Since then the front's appetite for destruction has cooled.
IF A TREE FALLS
A Story of the Earth Liberation Front
Opens on Wednesday in Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Cut, Baste, Stitch, Sing!

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
The big voice and dramatic flair that served Wanda Imasuen well as a community organizer are turning out to translate nicely to another stage: musical comedy.
Ms. Imasuen plays several roles in an updated revival of the fabled 1937 revue ''Pins and Needles'' that aims to demonstrate that when it comes to the struggles of working people, as she puts it, ''the same thing that was happening then is happening now.''
Running at the Irondale Center in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, from Wednesday through July 9, the show, comprising sketches and songs, is a joint endeavor of the Obie-winning Foundry Theater and Families United for Racial and Economic Equality (Furee), which since 2001 has worked to increase access to housing, jobs and services for low-income families.
Bringing together artists and activists on this kind of project might seem like a leap of faith, but Melanie Joseph, the artistic director of the Foundry, doesn't see it that way. And she has history to back her up. After all, ''Pins and Needles'' in its original incarnation was created to benefit the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union -- and ended up as one of the decade's biggest Broadway hits. 
Most of the 14 songs in this new version, ''Furee in Pins & Needles,'' are by Harold J. Rome from the original production, and include a satirical song called ''Doing the Reactionary.'' That song pokes fun at politicians who change their political stances in reaction to criticism. While Eastern European immigrants made up the show's original union-member cast, the new ''Pins & Needles'' features mostly minority women. To reflect the times, songs about Mussolini, Hitler and Stalin were jettisoned; two blues songs by Josh White were added. Contemporary sketches zing Donald Trump and applaud new rights for domestic workers.
During its long initial run, some 40 songs came and went into the revue, so this mix-and-match production is in character, explained Richard Harper, the musical director. ''There's no standard version of this show, so it was open to interpretation,'' he said.
''Pins & Needles'' is the final and most elaborate production in a Foundry festival called NYC ... Just Like I Pictured It, which began in the spring. For each piece, an activist group was matched with theater professionals to come up with a performance that reflected an idealized version of New York; in one instance Adhikaar, a Queens group that promotes rights for Nepali-speaking communities, put on a short play based on the true story of a woman from such a community who was abused for years by her employers.
''Art,'' Ms. Joseph said, ''should be part of the creative process of changing the world.''
With a noted Off Broadway director in Ken Rus Schmoll and a nine-performance run, ''Pins & Needles'' strives for professionalism even with an amateur cast in which all hopefuls who auditioned landed a part.
At one Saturday afternoon rehearsal in the basement of an arts center in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, cast members picked their way through scenes and tried kicking up their heels on cue.
Ms. Imasuen, who retired from Furee in 2010 after seven years as a lead organizer, was playing a nasty social services manager who clashes with an applicant for medical benefits, portrayed by Cynthia Butts. After a long wait, Ms. Butts receives the wrong form and is forced back in line. The scene, one of the new segments, was from Lynn Nottage's 2004 play ''Fabulation or, the Re-Education of Undine,'' about a successful woman whose life tumbles south.
Meanwhile, Shannon Barber, a 30-year-old community organizer who has conducted surveys of police behavior in struggling neighborhoods, waited for his turn to rehearse several roles, including those of a factory superintendent and a newspaper editor. He also sings Josh White's ''Free and Equal Blues.''
''When I knock on doors, I'm doing what this play does to an audience,'' he said. ''I'm grabbing their attention.''
Daniel Katz, a historian at the State University of New York Empire State College in Brooklyn, talked to four cast members from the original production for his forthcoming book, ''All Together Different: Yiddish Socialists, Garment Workers and the Labor Roots of Multiculturalism.''
With 250,000 members, the garment workers' union in 1936 was ''one of the most powerful unions in the country,'' Mr. Katz said.
''The union not only had an extraordinary education program,'' he continued, ''but they had classes in economics and philosophy, drama clubs and an athletic league.''
It also had a reputation as a hotbed of radical politics, which is what led its president, David Dubinsky, to create a production company that would humanize the union, using the tools of showbiz, Mr. Katz explained. ''Pins and Needles'' opened on Nov. 27, 1937, at the Labor Stage Theater and was soon a hit. (The New York Times called it ''a witty and tuneful morsel considerably enhanced by the infectious enthusiasm of the cast.'')
About a year later it moved to the larger Windsor Theater, where it ran until June 1940 -- 1,108 performances in total. The cast performed at the White House at the invitation of Eleanor Roosevelt and went on a national tour.
Now remembered as a footnote in theater history, ''Pins and Needles'' has not gone the way of other revues popular in their day that disappeared entirely. Barbra Streisand performed ''Doing the Reactionary,'' ''Not Cricket to Picket'' and other songs from the score on a 1962 album. The Roundabout Theater revived the show in 1978; last year the Cock Tavern Theater in London drew good reviews for its own rendition.
''There have been constant attempts to bring it back, but it was always difficult because it was always so much of its time,'' said John Kenrick, a theater historian. ''Musical theater right now seems to have lost all of its political content.''
The show's history was one reason that Mr. Schmoll was excited to sign on as director. ''I jumped at the chance,'' he said. ''I was interested in making theater with people not necessarily within the theater community.''
''Culture in this country and in this town is owned by a specific class of people, mostly upper-middle-class white,'' he added. ''But there are all kinds of people who can make art -- and for whom art is made.''

HEADLINE: Blocks From the President, Developers Plan Big

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Since the late 1990s, the once-desolate section of downtown Washington east of the White House has undergone a striking transformation. About $10.6 billion has been invested in more than 150 real estate projects. Some 56,000 people now live downtown, up from 38,000 in 2000.
And after years of planning, the most ambitious of the downtown projects is finally under way. Construction began in March on CityCenterDC, a $700 million complex envisioned as a modern-day Rockefeller Center, with 2.5 million square feet of office, residential and retail space as well as a public plaza and park. Completion of the bulk of the project is expected in late 2013, according to the two real estate companies, Hines Interests of Houston and Archstone of Englewood, Colo., that won development rights in 2003.
One of the largest downtown projects in the nation, CityCenterDC will fill 10 acres, all city-owned except for the land beneath two condo buildings. Bounded by New York Avenue and 9th, H and 11th Streets NW, the site was once occupied by a convention center that was demolished in 2004 (a year after the larger Walter E. Washington Convention Center was built nearby), leaving a giant parking lot in one of the city's most desirable locations, only two blocks from two of the busiest Metrorail stations. 
''This really is the hole in the doughnut,'' said William M. Collins, a senior managing director of Cassidy Turley, a national brokerage, which is not involved in CityCenterDC.
CityCenterDC is one of several major projects around the country that were stalled by the recession. But while construction has yet to begin developments like Grand Avenue in Los Angeles and Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn (except for the Nets basketball arena, where work is under way), CityCenterDC was able to move forward because of a recent $620 million equity investment by the real estate arm of the Persian Gulf state of Qatar. The Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Company is now the project's principal owner.
The complex will be made up of six buildings, 10 and 11 stories in height in keeping with the District of Columbia's 130-foot height restriction. At their base will be 185,000 square feet of retail stores facing the street. An additional 110,000 square feet of retail space is planned for the project's second phase, which will also include a luxury hotel.
To integrate the site with its surroundings, the sections of I and 10th Streets that were cut off to make way for the old convention center will be restored. Alleyways, largely restricted to pedestrians, will run between buildings and provide space for smaller stores.
The two office buildings, with a total of 520,000 square feet, and two condominium buildings, with 216 units, were designed by the prominent London architect Norman Foster's firm, Foster & Partners, whose other projects have included the reconstruction of the Reichstag in Berlin. The two rental apartment buildings, with 458 units, were designed by Shalom Baranes, a local firm that worked on the redevelopment of the Homer building in downtown Washington at 13th and F Streets NW.
Even though nearly 7,000 new rental units are scheduled to be completed in Washington in the next few years, prospects are good for the apartments because of their central location, said Gregory H. Leisch, the chief executive of Delta Associates, a real estate consulting firm that advises Hines and Archstone. Condo prices in the city center have risen 1.8 percent in the past year, to an average of $710 a square foot.
The demand for office space from law firms and other private tenants -- the space will be too costly for government tenants, said Bill Alsup, a senior vice president of Hines -- is improving, according to Cassidy Turley. But Hines suffered a setback last July, when the national law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom renewed its lease at 1440 New York Avenue NW, rather than fulfilling an earlier plan to lease 350,000 square feet at CityCenterDC. ''It would have been very nice to have had a major tenant commitment prior to the start of construction, but it wasn't critical,'' said Mr. Alsup.
Tom Fulcher, an executive vice president at Studley, a brokerage that represents tenants, said most large Washington law firms with leases expiring in 2015 and 2016 had made their real estate decisions because large blocks of space can be scarce in a city without skyscrapers. One exception pursued by the developers is Arnold & Porter, which is searching for about 335,000 square feet. But the project's biggest challenge, said Jason Jacobson, a group vice president at Archstone, will be getting the retail mix right. Downtown has a lot of ''fast fashion, geared toward younger people,'' he said. ''Our goal is to bring it up a notch.''
Gerry Widdicombe, the director of economic development for the Downtown D.C. Business Improvement District, a group that helps to market the neighborhood, estimated that Washington residents spent as much as $1 billion a year in suburban shopping centers because of a dearth of stores within the District of Columbia.
The developers are seeking a mix of stores, including apparel, home furnishings and electronic goods, said Mr. Alsup, whose company developed and manages Galleria malls in Houston and Dallas. About one-third of the space will be limited to stores new to downtown, he said. Mr. Jacobson said some space along the alleys would be made available to local fledgling retailers.
Not surprisingly, the developers are trying to persuade the retailer highest on everyone's list -- Apple, which has one store within the District of Columbia, on Wisconsin Avenue in Georgetown -- to open a much bigger store of 15,000 square feet or more.
John Asadoorian, a regional retail broker, said CityCenterDC's leasing goals demonstrated how downtown had matured. ''Ten years ago, you probably could not have talked about the type of retail they are trying to attract,'' he said.
Even before the Qatari investors became involved, Hines and Archstone determined that leasing to banks would not help them create lively shopping streets, Mr. Alsup said. But as it happened, their hesitancy on bank branches meshed with the policies of their financial partners, who adhere to the restrictions of Shariah, or Islamic law, including the ban on collecting interest. Restaurants will be able to serve liquor, but retailers whose primary business involves selling alcohol will not be allowed, Mr. Alsup said.
In their marketing materials, Hines and Archstone say they intend to provide ''an authentic place for urban residents to socialize outside their homes.''
But some planning specialists have wondered if people in downtown Washington will view the plaza, which will be situated between the condo and rental buildings, as public space for them to enjoy. ''Putting the plaza in the middle of a large development just feels more private,'' said David Dixon, who is in charge of planning and urban design at Goody Clancy & Associates, a design firm in Boston.
Mr. Jacobson said the developers planned to offer programs in the plaza and would make it welcoming with public art and landscaping. ''People will find it to be inviting,'' he said. ''I realize we have to convince some people. Hopefully, we'll do a better job over the next year or so.''

HEADLINE: For New Life, Blacks in City Head to South

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY

 BODY:
In Deborah Brown's family lore, the American South was a place of whites-only water fountains and lynchings under cover of darkness. It was a place black people like her mother had fled.
But for Ms. Brown, 59, a retired civil servant from Queens, the South now promises salvation.
Three generations of her family -- 10 people in all -- are moving to Atlanta from New York, seeking to start fresh economically and, in some sense, to reconnect with a bittersweet past. They include Ms. Brown, her 82-year-old mother and her 26-year-old son, who has already landed a job and settled there.
The economic downturn has propelled a striking demographic shift: black New Yorkers, including many who are young and college educated, are heading south. 
About 17 percent of the African-Americans who moved to the South from other states in the past decade came from New York, far more than from any other state, according to census data. Of the 44,474 who left New York State in 2009, more than half, or 22,508, went to the South, according to a study conducted by the sociology department of Queens College for The New York Times.
The movement is not limited to New York. The percentage of blacks leaving big cities in the East and in the Midwest and heading to the South is now at the highest levels in decades, demographers say.
''I feel a strong spiritual pull to go back to the South,'' Ms. Brown said.
Middle-class enclaves, like Jamaica and St. Albans in Queens, are feeding this exodus. Black luminaries -- like James Brown, W. E. B. Du Bois and Ella Fitzgerald -- once lived in St. Albans, a neighborhood that is now being hit by high unemployment and foreclosures.
The migration of middle-class African-Americans is helping to depress already falling housing prices. It is also depriving the black community of investment and leadership from some of its most educated professionals, black leaders say.
The movement marks an inversion of the so-called Great Migration, which lasted roughly from World War I to the 1970s and saw African-Americans moving to the industrializing North to escape prejudice and find work.
Spencer Crew, a history professor at George Mason University who was the curator of a prominent exhibit on the Great Migration at the Smithsonian Institution, said the current exodus from New York stemmed largely from tough economic times. New York is increasingly unaffordable, and blacks see more opportunities in the South.
The South now represents the potential for achievement for black New Yorkers in a way it had not before, Professor Crew said. At the same time, unionized civil service jobs that once drew thousands of blacks to the city are becoming more scarce.
''New York has lost some of its cachet for black people,'' Professor Crew said. ''During the Great Migration, blacks went north because you could find work if you were willing to hustle. But today, there is less of a struggle to survive in the South than in New York. Many blacks also have emotional and spiritual roots in the South. It is like returning home.''
Ms. Brown, who spent 35 years investigating welfare fraud for New York State, may have seemed the embodiment of the black American dream in New York City.
In the 1950s, her parents moved to Harlem, and then to Queens, from Atlanta. Her grandmother was a maid; her grandfather was a brick mason. One generation later, her parents were prospering. Her father became a senior tax official for the state; her mother was an executive assistant to the state corrections commissioner.
But Ms. Brown says New York is now less inviting. She plans to join her 26-year-old son, Rashid, who moved to Atlanta from Queens last year after he graduated with a degree in criminology but could not find a job in New York.
In Atlanta, he became a deputy sheriff within weeks. She is hoping to open a restaurant.
''In the South, I can buy a big house with a garden compared with the shoe box my retirement savings will buy me in New York,'' she said.
The Rev. Floyd H. Flake, pastor of the 23,000-member Greater Allen African Methodist Episcopal Cathedral in Jamaica, Queens, said he was losing hundreds of congregants yearly to Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia.
''For decades, Queens has been the place where the African-American middle class went to buy their first home and raise a family,'' Mr. Flake said. ''But now, we are seeing a reversal of this as African-Americans feel this is no longer as easy to achieve and that the South is more benevolent than New York.''
Some blacks say they are leaving not only to find jobs, but also because they have soured on race relations.
Candace Wilkins, 27, of St. Albans, who remains unemployed despite having a business degree, plans to move to Charlotte, N.C.
She said her decision was prompted by an altercation with the police.
In March 2010, witnesses say, Ms. Wilkins was thrown against a car by a white police officer after she tried to help a black neighbor who was being questioned. She was charged with resisting arrest and disorderly conduct, according to the Queens district attorney's office.
Ms. Wilkins disputes the charges, which are pending, and has filed a complaint against the police. A police spokeswoman said the department was investigating her complaint.
''Life has gone full circle,'' said Ms. Wilkins, whose grandmother was born amid the cotton fields of North Carolina and moved to Queens in the 1950s.
''My grandmother's generation left the South and came to the North to escape segregation and racism,'' she said. ''Now, I am going back because New York has become like the old South in its racial attitudes.''
Many black New Yorkers who are already in the South say they have little desire to return to the city, even though they get wistful at the mention of the subways or Harlem nights.
Danitta Ross, 39, a real estate broker who used to live in Queens, said she moved to Atlanta four years ago after her company, responding to the surge in black New Yorkers moving south, began offering relocation seminars. She helped organize them, and became intrigued.
Ms. Ross said she had grown up hearing stories at the dinner table about segregation. She said the Atlanta she discovered was a cosmopolitan place of classical music concerts, interracial marriage and opulent houses owned by black people.
A single mother, she said that for $150,000, she was buying a seven-room house, with a three-car garage, on a nice plot of land.
Ms. Ross said she had experienced some culture shock in the South, and had been surprised to find that blacks tended to self-segregate, even in affluent neighborhoods.
She said that the South -- not New York -- was now home.
''People in Georgia have a different mind-set and life is more relaxed and comfortable here,'' she said. ''There is just a lot more opportunity.''

HEADLINE: Public Unions Take On Boss to Win Big Pensions

BYLINE: By CHARLES DUHIGG

 BODY:
COSTA MESA, Calif. -- City council elections in this Southern California city are usually sedate. Hot-button issues include whether libraries should stay open at night. Campaign budgets often don't top $10,000.
Then Jim Righeimer, a conservative activist and real estate developer, jumped into the race last year.
The city was on the road to insolvency, he warned, because public employee unions had pressured politicians into handing over generous salaries and pensions. The police chief received $298,000 a year in total compensation, Mr. Righeimer noted. The deputy fire chief had retired with a pension of more than $182,000 a year.
City workers weren't fans of Mr. Righeimer, who had been critical of public unions for years. Local police and firefighter groups started mailing leaflets and towing a billboard around town attacking him, implying he had skipped out on numerous debts. Public employees spent more than $100,000 opposing him, and six unions from neighboring regions spent another $33,000 endorsing his opponents. 
''They try to drag you through the mud so bad that everyone else says, 'I don't ever want these guys as enemies, I'll just leave them alone,' '' said Mr. Righeimer, who still managed to win a council seat.
Costa Mesa, population 110,000, is California in miniature. For years, public employee unions across the state have often used their influence -- sometimes behind the scenes but occasionally with public, hardball campaigns -- to push for improved worker pay and benefits. They have exercised power beyond their numbers by donating money to lawmakers, burnishing candidates' credentials with endorsements and supplying volunteers during elections.
Public employee unions are hardly the only group involved in bare-knuckles politics. Businesses lobby fiercely and executives make hefty campaign donations.
But public workers have a unique relationship with elected officials, because government employees are effectively negotiating with bosses whom they can campaign to vote out of office if they don't get what they want. Private unions, in contrast, don't usually have the power to fire their members' employers.
Even in recent years, as economic troubles have worsened, benefits for some government workers have grown. In 2008, for instance, lifeguards in Laguna Beach started receiving increased retirement benefits as the state's economy began to slow. The next year, the town's chief lifeguard retired at age 57, with a $113,000-a-year pension after 36 years on the job.
Lawmakers in both political parties have often acceded to unions' requests to avoid political confrontations or to curry favor. They have pushed difficult choices into the future.
But now, with the expenses of past promises coming due, the cost of deferred decision-making is mounting. California alone needs to begin devoting an additional $28 billion a year to state and local public pensions to remedy an existing shortfall, according to one nonpartisan study -- and nationwide, estimates of such deficits reach into the trillions over the next few decades.
''We had no idea what we were doing,'' said Tony Oliveira, who as a supervisor in Kings County, in central California, voted to increase employees' benefits, and now is on the board of the state's enormous pension fund. ''This was probably the worst public policy decision in the state's history. But everyone kept saying there was plenty of money. And no one wants to be responsible if all the cops quit to get paid more in the next town.''
Public employee unions, in their defense, say politicians have unfairly made them into simplistic bogeymen, responsible for problems that have myriad causes. Not all government workers receive generous pensions, they note. A public worker enrolled in the state's largest pension fund who retired in 2008 with more than 30 years of service received a pension of $66,828 a year, on average, and a retiree with 20 to 25 years of service received around $34,872. Public workers who retire with fewer years on the job receive even less.
Moreover, unions note that they have improved millions of lives and are standing up for workers, who are mostly middle class, at a time when many families are losing ground financially.
''We fight for our pensions and paychecks the same way C.E.O.'s fight for theirs,'' said Scott Diederich, a lifeguard and president of the Laguna Beach Municipal Employees' Association.
Union leaders argue that pension shortfalls account for a proportionally tiny portion of governments' financial problems and, by all accounts, there are plenty of parties to blame for the growth in payrolls and obligations. Pension officials add that workers are making sacrifices: in the last year, more than 100 California cities and agencies have lowered retirement benefits for new hires or increased the amount employees must contribute for pensions.
But no matter what steps are taken, the cost of public pensions will most likely preoccupy many states for years. In California, New Jersey and Illinois, lawmakers may eventually need to increase taxes more than 17 percent or cut government services to pay public retirees' benefits, according to a nonpartisan study. In some states, no matter how much the economy rebounds, pension funds may not be able to meet their obligations without significant government support.
And as legislatures in many states consider their options, battles with public workers are becoming rancorous. In Texas, Michigan, Idaho, Arizona and elsewhere, public employee unions have pushed for recall elections of lawmakers or of new laws that reduce workers' benefits. In Wisconsin, skirmishes have temporarily shut down the state Senate, and more than a quarter of senators -- both union critics and supporters -- are potentially facing recall.
In California, where the Teachers Association, the prison guards' union, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, or Afscme, are particularly influential, confrontations are especially intense, though some union officials concede something needs to change.
''Are we supposed to turn down a raise, or not fight as hard as possible for our members?'' asked Nick Berardino, general manager of the Orange County Employees Association. ''But, yes, we understand that reform is necessary and we want to be good partners.''
But critics -- who note that Mr. Berardino's organization has helped finance political attacks in Costa Mesa -- worry that such partnerships are not capable of an equal give-and-take.
''In my six years in Sacramento, the only time I ever received a phone call in the middle of a vote was when the head of a state labor federation chewed me out because I hadn't voted yet,'' said Joe Nation, a Democrat who served in the California Assembly from 2000 to 2006. ''You learned pretty quickly that you don't want to upset these guys.''
The Unspoken Cost
Ron Seeling warned them that serious problems could be looming.
It was 1999, and the California Public Employees' Retirement System, or Calpers, the large government agency that manages retirement benefits for more than 1.6 million public workers, retirees and their families, was lobbying the legislature to increase employees' benefits. Calpers's plan would lower the retirement age for some workers to 50 years, even as it raised pensions to as much as 90 percent of their salaries.
Lobbyists were arguing that the plan -- which would ultimately create the largest pension increase in the state's history -- wouldn't cost ''a dime of additional taxpayer money.''
But Mr. Seeling, the agency's chief actuary, knew that wasn't necessarily right. Sitting at his desk, poring over spreadsheets, he saw the truth. Calpers, at the time, was awash in cash and many cities believed that pensions were essentially self-funding if the stock market remained high. But if the market stumbled, he realized, Calpers's plan could cost taxpayers billions of dollars.
Mr. Seeling cautioned the Calpers board of the risks, but his worries were brushed aside. Calpers's job is to invest pension funds to get the best returns and administer benefits to retirees. But it has also been an advocate for public workers. Many board members, when Calpers was pushing its plan in 1999, were closely aligned with the people who benefited from increased pensions. Six of Calpers's 13 board members were elected by government retirees or workers, as required by state law. Another was a union official. Two others were politicians who had sought union endorsements and campaign contributions.
''Labor controlled too much of the board,'' Mr. Seeling, now retired himself, said in an interview. ''It's been harmful to the state.''
When Calpers's plan to expand pensions came up in the state Legislature, lawmakers from both parties voted for it. On the Senate floor, it passed after 45 seconds of debate with no dissenting votes. Some legislators from that period, in interviews, said they believed that public workers deserved to share in the economic growth.
Other lawmakers were told if they didn't vote for the plan, public employee groups would attack them in ads and give their opponents tens of thousands of dollars in contributions, and they could lose endorsements from police, firefighters or other influential groups, according to legislators and lobbyists.
Such threats, politicians knew, were real. Over the next five years, public sector unions would spend more than $77 million on California state elections and ballot initiatives alone.
Mr. Seeling issued another warning to the Calpers board at a meeting in 2001. This time, it was considering a proposal that would encourage cities to increase workers' benefits by allowing officials to change actuarial calculations, so they could raise pensions without incurring higher costs right away. One board member, echoing Mr. Seeling's concerns, told his colleagues they were ''playing with fire,'' according to a transcript of that session. But a majority approved the plan anyway.
In 2009, Mr. Seeling told a room of pension experts that the agency's ever-escalating payouts were becoming ''unsustainable.''
''Board members came up to me afterwards and said, 'We agree with you, but if we say it publicly, it's political suicide,' '' Mr. Seeling recalled in an interview.
Mr. Seeling eventually told the agency's leaders he wanted to retire. He still believed in Calpers's mission and was still proud of his role in helping millions of state workers retire with dignity. But the job's stresses were taking a toll.
When the financial crisis hit in 2008, his warnings came true. The value of Calpers's fund dropped $100 billion from its peak, losing over a third of its worth. The cost of pension promises, however, was still going up. More than 190 California cities and agencies have increased government workers' benefits since the economic downturn began.
When the California Legislature tried to scale back pension costs, some unions went on the offensive. Last year, the California Correctional Peace Officers Association, the prison guards' union, spent $250,000 attacking Anna Caballero, a Democrat campaigning for state Senate. The attacks were payback, lobbyists and lawmakers say, for legislation that slightly lowered pension rates for some future government workers. Ms. Caballero lost that race.
The union representing the prison guards spent another $3.6 million supporting eight dozen other candidates, including the present governor, Jerry Brown, and criticizing their opponents.
Earlier this year, a new prison guard contract came up for approval in the Legislature. The Legislative Analyst's Office estimated it would cost an additional $51 million in its first year, and Republican lawmakers, looking for ways to narrow an estimated $10.8 billion budget gap, said they had the votes to kill the deal.
Then a Republican senator, Anthony Cannella, changed his mind and voted for the prison guards' contract. It passed.
Mr. Cannella was elected over Ms. Caballero, the target of the attacks by the correction officers' union.
The union ''was actually crucial to my election,'' Mr. Cannella said in a video produced by the union.
In a statement, Mr. Canella said that he favored pension reform, and that the contract he had voted for, which was bundled with other agreements, forced state employees to shoulder more of their pension costs and established equal compensation with other state workers. A representative of the prison guard union said it evaluated candidates based on a variety of factors, including their philosophies, integrity and effectiveness.
Calpers says its retirement fund is healthy, having earned back more than $70 billion of the value lost since 2007. But it still has asked the state for $3.6 billion this fiscal year to pay for promises made to retirees. It expects to ask for another $3.5 billion next year.
In a statement, Calpers said that ''to paint the picture that the Calpers board and its decisions are driven by labor is misleading and inaccurate. ... The board is well diversified and decisions are not made by the board alone,'' but also by its staff. Calpers said legislators were told in 1999, when the agency lobbied to increase worker's benefits, that there was a cost to the plan.
''The costs of Calpers pensions for the state represents 2.2 percent of total general fund expenditures,'' the agency wrote. ''To suggest that pension costs are the cause of layoffs, degradation of our schools or the California economy would be irresponsible.''
In statements, Afscme said it had backed Calpers board candidates who were most qualified to protect members' retirements. Art Pulaski, the executive secretary-treasurer of the California Labor Federation, a coalition of 1,200 affiliated unions, wrote in a statement that the idea ''that unions have spent money on elections to control politicians is as offensive as it as inane. In every election, we carefully analyze candidate records and positions and support those most likely to support policies that help working families.''
Mr. Seeling, for his part, is now enjoying retirement with a pension of about $78,000 a year.
''I can live on it,'' he said. ''I wish I had more. But it's enough. I don't think anyone needs that much more for a comfortable life.''
Operation Domino
It was informally known among local union leaders as ''Operation Domino,'' and for years the goal was straightforward: persuade one city to increase salaries and pensions for workers, and then approach neighboring municipalities and argue that if the increases weren't matched, the city's police, firefighters or other employees might quit, in large numbers, and go elsewhere.
By the time the dominos made it to Costa Mesa, neighboring areas had already toppled. ''The unions would say, 'Gee, Irvine, Newport, all of these nearby cities, they offer these higher benefits for police and firefighters and it's a real tight labor market, and if we don't receive similar benefits, what if we leave and go work there?' '' said Allan Roeder, Costa Mesa's city manager for more than two decades, who retired in March with a pension of $190,000 a year.
Then, starting about a decade ago, word began to spread that the Costa Mesa police had more than a dozen vacancies they couldn't fill. Graffiti became more common. Police representatives warned that gang activity was rising and, without strong benefits, the department couldn't attract officers.
When Mr. Roeder went to the grocery store, residents asked him why he wasn't keeping the streets safe.
''When achieving public safety is threatened, law enforcement gets what they want,'' he said.
Today, many Costa Mesa police officers and other safety workers are eligible to retire as young as 50 years of age, receiving up to 90 percent of their salaries each year for life.
In other communities, unions used more subtle methods. Lifeguards in Newport Beach helped win public support for increased pensions by expanding the city's junior lifeguard program, which started with 50 children and now enrolls 1,200 a year.
''Everyone in this community knows we're the people making sure their sons and daughters don't drown,'' said Brent Jacobsen, who has been a lifeguard for 24 years. ''I talk to a lot of parents because of the junior lifeguards, and I tell them we expect to be treated fairly.''
Last year, the head of the junior lifeguard program retired with a pension of $105,000 a year.
Soon after Newport Beach increased benefits, Mr. Jacobsen's brother-in-law, a lifeguard in nearby Laguna Beach, persuaded his city to raise pensions.
The costs of such increased benefits, in many places, weren't felt for years. But starting in 2007, Costa Mesa had to draw on its reserve accounts to pay bills. The city stopped buying fertilizer and seed for some parks and canceled street maintenance projects. Last year, pension costs topped $15 million, up from $6 million a decade ago and more than triple the amount the city spent filling potholes and maintaining playgrounds and on capital projects.
Then Mr. Righeimer declared his candidacy for city council. After winning a bruising race, he proposed outsourcing as many as 18 city services, from firefighting to payroll, to private firms. The move, he said, would cost the city less in salaries and free taxpayers from additional pension liabilities. Pink slips were sent to almost half the city's 472 employees, though some of those layoffs, which do not take effect until September, might be rescinded if the outsourcing bids do not meet expectations.
On the day the pink slips were handed out, a city worker, 29-year-old Huy Pham, climbed to the roof of City Hall and jumped to his death. A local union organization helped pay for television commercials that implied the mayor and city councilors were responsible.
''People like Jim Righeimer have a visceral dislike for people in unions,'' said Mr. Berardino, the Orange County union leader. ''And I understand that people are angry because they see their own retirement accounts shrinking, and wonder, why shouldn't public workers suffer, too?
'Race to the Bottom'
''But why are we making this a race to the bottom? Why aren't we making sure every working American gets a decent pension after a lifetime of work?'' Mr. Berardino asked.
Mr. Berardino and other labor leaders around the state are discussing with Governor Brown and legislators proposals that could standardize pension benefits, so that cities are not competing with each other, and cap yearly retirement payouts at $127,000 or less.
Many of those details are still under negotiation and the plan might not win approval. Even if it does, it is unclear how much immediate relief such reform could bring. By law, the pension formulas of existing workers are essentially unalterable -- any changes affect only future hires. And studies by nonpartisan academics indicate that even if public work forces stop growing and the stock market rebounds, it may not be enough to prevent a pension funding crisis. In some states, including California, a study found that pension fund managers needed to earn a 12 percent return each year for the next three decades to meet obligations. Such prolonged returns are far higher than historical norms. (Calpers, in a statement, said it expected to earn double-digit returns this year, and disagreed with the 12 percent estimate.)
''Governments are going to have to decide if they want to raise taxes or cut services or do a bit of both,'' said Robert Novy-Marx, a professor at the Simon Graduate School of Business at the University of Rochester who, with Joshua Rauh of the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, has studied the expected costs of future pension obligations. ''There's no other way out of this. State and local governments have become like Detroit car manufacturers, trapped under pension promises that are growing faster than their economies.''
In the meantime, Costa Mesa -- like many cities in California and around the nation -- continues to debate how pension costs should be borne. At a recent city council meeting, Mr. Righeimer and his colleagues sat in session for more than six hours, until well past midnight, as dozens of workers, citizens, union supporters and other speakers, in three-minute increments, criticized the layoffs and vowed they would remember politicians' decisions at election time.
In the audience sat three local firemen wearing Costa Mesa Fire Department T-shirts, all of whom declined to give their names.
''I'm not here on anything official,'' one said. ''We just like the council to know that we're watching them.''

HEADLINE: British Leader Rebuts Commanders' Concerns About a Long Libya Campaign

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS; Eric Schmitt contributed reporting from Stuttgart, Germany, and David D. Kirkpatrick from Tripoli, Libya.

 BODY:
LONDON -- Prime Minister David Cameron issued a stern rebuke Tuesday to Britain's top military commanders in the air campaign against Libya after they warned in the last week that British forces would come under heavy strain if the air operations continued indefinitely.
''There are times when I wake up and read the newspapers and think, 'I tell you what, you do the fighting and I'll do the talking,' '' Mr. Cameron told a Downing Street news conference. 
Mr. Cameron's outburst seemed to be prompted by a lead article Tuesday in The Daily Telegraph, a Conservative newspaper with strong military links, that quoted the officer in overall command of Britain's air operations in Afghanistan and Libya as warning of serious consequences for Britain's air combat capacity if the Libya operation runs beyond September.
The warning by a top Royal Air Force commander, Air Chief Marshal Sir Simon Bryant, following similar remarks last week by the highest-ranking officer in the Royal Navy, Adm. Sir Mark Stanhope, added to the growing disquiet in Western capitals over the Libyan operation.
Originally envisaged as lasting a matter of weeks, the air campaign is now into its fourth month. It has seen NATO conduct nearly 12,000 air missions over Libya, about one-third of them involving strikes by bombs or missiles, some of them seemingly intended to kill the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.
The airstrikes have virtually obliterated Colonel Qaddafi's Bab al-Aziziya command compound in Tripoli, the Libyan capital, and reduced the fighting capacity of the Libyan forces by about 50 percent, according to Pentagon estimates. But there has been no sign that the Qaddafi government is at risk of crumbling under the pressure, at least not soon.
Much of the pressure NATO is facing over the Libyan operation comes from the dissent within NATO itself, with some member nations saying the campaign has gone beyond the mandate given by a United Nations Security Council resolution in mid-March that approved NATO action to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya and to undertake other missions to protect the country's civilian population from the Qaddafi forces.
Those misgivings seemed to be compounded in recent days by two NATO strikes that, for the first time since NATO took command of the air operations from the United States on March 31, appeared to have caused significant numbers of civilian casualties. The first of those strikes, in the early hours of Sunday, struck what Libyan officials described as an apartment building in Tripoli, killing nine people, including women and children.
But NATO is now investigating the possibility that the building might have been hit by a Soviet-made SA-6 surface-to-air missile from a Libyan stockpile that was hit in an airstrike that night, rather than an errant NATO missile.
''When reports of the building being hit first appeared, NATO looked to see if there were planes nearby, and there were,'' said a NATO official who spoke on ground rules of anonymity. ''There was a report of a weapons failure, and NATO concluded that this may explain what happened. Subsequently, we learned about the SA-6, which came from a site we were targeting at the same time.''
One sympathizer with the Libyan opposition, speaking on the condition of anonymity for his safety, said that the destroyed home had belonged to a well-known Qaddafi opponent.
Nevertheless, the episode amounted to at least a temporary propaganda coup for the Qaddafi government, which has insisted for weeks that the airstrikes were deliberately targeting civilians, and called on world opinion to force NATO to abandon the attacks.
Mr. Cameron has been keen to resist those pressures, and last week -- as NATO extended the mandate for the airstrikes by 90 days -- he spoke strongly in favor of continuing the attacks until Mr. Qaddafi is driven from power.
''The pressure is building militarily, diplomatically, politically and economically on Qaddafi, who is running out of time, running out of friends -- his oil minister is gone, his foreign minister is gone, the pressure is building,'' Mr. Cameron said.
With that debate under way, Mr. Cameron could not have welcomed his military commanders questioning how long Britain could continue the fight. But his dispute with them has centered, in part, on the operation's costs, and how that affects the armed forces' long-term fighting capacity.
Although Britain's air combat role in the Libyan conflict involves a relatively small number of Tornado and Typhoon attack jets, as well as Apache attack helicopters, the government has admitted that the operation could cost hundreds of millions of pounds at a time when the Cameron government has imposed stringent budget cuts on the armed forces, amounting to an 8-percent reduction over four years in a defense budget of about $60 billion.
But Mr. Cameron, after summoning Air Chief Marshal Bryant and Admiral Stanhope to Downing Street, said at his Tuesday news conference that British forces would remain committed to the Libyan operation for as long as was needed. ''Generally speaking,'' he said, referring to the two commanders, ''they are absolutely clear that we can keep up this mission as long as is necessary, and that time is on our side, not Qaddafi's.''

HEADLINE: Sagging Economy Draws Attention to War Spending

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER; Carl Hulse contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama will talk about troop numbers in Afghanistan when he makes a prime-time speech from the White House on Wednesday night. But behind his words will be an acute awareness of what $1.3 trillion in spending on two wars in the past decade has meant at home: a ballooning budget deficit and a soaring national debt at a time when the economy is still struggling to get back on its feet.
As Mr. Obama begins trying to untangle the country from its military and civilian promises in Afghanistan, his critics and allies alike are drawing a direct line between what is not being spent to bolster the sagging economy in America to what is being spent in Afghanistan -- $120 billion this year alone.
On Monday, the United States Conference of Mayors made that connection explicitly, saying that American taxes should be paying for bridges in Baltimore and Kansas City, not in Baghdad and Kandahar. 
The mayors' group approved a resolution calling for an early end to the American military role in Afghanistan and Iraq, asking Congress to redirect the billions now being spent on war and reconstruction costs toward urgent domestic needs. The resolution, which noted that local governments cut 28,000 jobs in May alone, was the group's first anti-war vote since it passed a resolution four decades ago calling for an end to the Vietnam War.
And in a speech on the Senate floor on Tuesday, Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, said: ''We can no longer, in good conscience, cut services and programs at home, raise taxes or -- and this is very important -- lift the debt ceiling in order to fund nation-building in Afghanistan. The question the president faces -- we all face -- is quite simple: Will we choose to rebuild America or Afghanistan? In light of our nation's fiscal peril, we cannot do both.''
Demonstrators describing themselves as ''angry jobless citizens'' said they would picket the Capitol on Wednesday to urge members of Congress to use any savings from Mr. Obama's troop reductions to create more jobs. The group sponsoring the demonstration, the Prayer Without Ceasing Party, said in a statement on Tuesday that it was ''urging the masses to call their congressmen and the president to ensure that jobs receive a top priority when the troops start returning to America.''
Spending on the war in Afghanistan has skyrocketed since Mr. Obama took office, to $118.6 billion in 2011. It was $14.7 billion in 2003, when President George W. Bush turned his attention and American resources to the war in Iraq.
The increase is easy to explain. When Mr. Obama took office, he vowed to aggressively pursue what he termed America's ''war of necessity'' (Afghanistan) and to withdraw from America's ''war of choice'' (Iraq). He has done so; the lines on Iraq and Afghanistan war spending crossed in 2010, when the United States spent $93.8 billion in Afghanistan versus $71.3 billion in Iraq, according to the Congressional Research Service.
But the White House is keenly aware that the president is heading into a re-election campaign; with the country's jobless rate remaining high, topping 9 percent, his poll numbers on his handling of the domestic economy have plummeted.
''Do we really need to be spending $120 billion in a country with a G.D.P. that's one-sixth that size?'' asked Brian Katulis, a national security expert at the Center for American Progress, a policy group with close ties to the Obama administration. ''Most Americans would be shocked to know that we're spending that kind of money for jobs programs for former Taliban, and would wonder where are our jobs programs for Detroit and Cleveland?''
In 2010, Congress -- at the Obama administration's request -- set aside $100 million to support programs in Afghanistan aimed at moving former insurgents off the battlefields and into the country's mainstream economy. Those efforts -- similar to what the Bush administration did in Iraq -- have yet to bear much fruit; the 1,700 fighters who have enrolled in the reintegration program represent only a fraction of the estimated 20,000 to 40,000 Taliban insurgents, The New York Times reported Monday.
Most American aid bypasses the Afghan government and goes to international companies, a practice that, according to a June 8 report by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, can undercut the Afghan government and lead to redundant and unsustainable donor projects. But Obama administration officials complain that the Afghan government of President Hamid Karzai has, thus far, been unwilling to tackle corruption in any meaningful way, making it hard to argue that it should get more money directly.
In Washington, the argument over whether the United States should be building bridges in Kandahar or Cleveland is bound to grow even louder as the 2012 election campaign heats up.
After Senator Manchin made his speech on Tuesday calling for an end to nation-building in Afghanistan, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, took to the floor to rebuke him, calling Mr. Manchin's remarks characteristic of the ''isolationist-withdrawal-lack-of-knowledge-of-history attitude that seems to be on the rise.''
But in Mr. McCain's own Republican Party, which has historically been more supportive of both the Iraq and Afghanistan wars than Democrats, there is clearly some queasiness about war spending during a period of economic distress.
Four years ago, Representative Ron Paul of Texas was the only Republican presidential candidate raising concerns about the costs of the Afghanistan or Iraq wars. But last week, Mr. Paul was joined explicitly by another contender, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former governor of Utah and the Obama administration's former ambassador to China, who said that the cost of a continued military presence was a leading factor in his belief that a major troop drawdown should begin in Afghanistan.
''Very expensive boots on the ground may be something that is not critical for our national security needs,'' Mr. Huntsman said.
Even when Mr. Obama does withdraw the bulk of troops from Afghanistan, Americans will still be footing the bill for years, argued William R. Keylor, an international relations professor at Boston University.
''The total cost of the war, the longest in American history and one that was paid for by borrowing rather than by increased taxation, should not be measured solely by the costs of financing the troops and the extensive aid programs administered by the State Department,'' Mr. Keylor said. ''It should also include long-term costs of the war, primarily veterans' benefits for the returning soldiers, who will require medical and mental health services for many years to come. Long after the last troops depart from the country, that hidden part of the bill will come due.''

CORRECTION-DATE: June 24, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about the economic and fiscal effects of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan misstated the foreign policy record of the United States Conference of Mayors, which called this week for an early end to the wars in favor of spending on domestic needs. It was the group's first anti-war vote since the Vietnam era, not its only venture into foreign policy issues since then. (The group has repeatedly voted in favor of nuclear disarmament.)

HEADLINE: Huntsman Enters Race With Promise of Civility

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG; Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
JERSEY CITY -- Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former governor of Utah, officially announced he was running for president on Tuesday, telling supporters and reporters gathered at a park facing the Statue of Liberty that he would be a better leader than President Obama, for whom he served as the ambassador to China until recently.
''He and I have a difference of opinion on how to help a country we both love,'' Mr. Huntsman said of Mr. Obama. ''But the question each of us wants the voters to answer is who will be the better president, not who's the better American.''
Under cloud cover that turned the Hudson River behind him a steely gray, Mr. Huntsman vowed to provide ''leadership that knows we need more than hope'' and ''leadership that doesn't promise Washington has all the solutions to our problems.'' 
Speaking to a sparse crowd in a steady voice but with little emotion, Mr. Huntsman gave hints of a platform that would include ''broad changes to the tax code,'' a tackling of spending on entitlements and a shift in foreign policy -- for now -- away from overseas conflict. He said it was ''not that we wish to disengage from the world,'' but rather ''that we believe the best long-term national security strategy is rebuilding our core here at home.''
Promising a cordial campaign, Mr. Huntsman said, ''It concerns me that civility, humanity and respect are sometimes lost in our interactions as Americans'' and added, ''I don't think you need to run down somebody's reputation in order to run for the office of president.''
Expressing respect for the president, Mr. Huntsman said the Obama administration had failed to fix the economy. ''For the first time in our history we are passing down to the next generation a country that is less powerful, less compassionate, less competitive and less confident than the one we got,'' he said, calling that ''totally un-American.''
Mr. Obama's campaign responded in kind with an e-mail to reporters that criticized Mr. Huntsman's stated support for the proposed budget of Representative Paul Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, accusing him of embracing ''a budget plan that would slash our commitment to education, wipe out investments that will foster the jobs of the future and extend tax cuts for the richest Americans while shifting the burden onto seniors and middle-class families.''
In speaking at Liberty State Park here, Mr. Huntsman was revisiting the spot where Ronald Reagan returned to the campaign trail after winning the Republican presidential nomination in 1980 as the great promise of the conservative movement after the Watergate scandal drove the Republican Party from power.
Mr. Huntsman enters the field without such perceived conservative bona fides. Although he has a record in Utah of tax cuts and opposition to abortion, he has also taken some positions -- including previous support for same-sex civil unions and a cap on emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide -- that, along with his time in the Obama administration, may prove unpopular with Republican primary voters.
Speaking with reporters on his campaign plane later in the afternoon, Mr. Huntsman also said he would not sign the no-new-taxes pledge from the antitax group Americans for Tax Reform. He said his decision was in keeping with a general distaste for such pledges, which is why, he said, he would not sign a similar pledge against abortion. And he said he would ''respect the state's decision'' if New York were to move forward with a law legalizing same-sex marriage.
During his address here, Mr. Huntsman sought to turn his experience in China to his advantage, saying that his service there -- and in other foreign postings during his career -- gave him a useful perspective on his home country.
''The view of America from 10,000 miles away is a picture of liberty, opportunity and justice; people secure in their rights and in love with their freedom; people who've done more good for more people than any other nation on earth,'' he said.
His campaign for the most part lived up to its early reputation for expert stage management. Mr. Huntsman, slim with salt-and-pepper hair, stood on a riser draped by two American flags that fluttered gently in the breeze and with the Statue of Liberty at his back. Wearing a blue suit and power-blue tie, he had approached the podium by walking across a long field of grass with his family -- his wife and six of his seven children -- at his side.
But announcements are fleeting moments in modern-day presidential campaigns. The challenges come when candidates get out onto hustings -- meeting voters, dodging barbs from opponents and effectively begging for money from contributors.
Mr. Huntsman, who is independently wealthy, had 15 fund-raisers along for the ride with him on Tuesday on his chartered campaign plane as he made a quick campaign stop in Exeter, N.H. Donors said the campaign had offered seats on the aircraft in return for a pledge to raise $25,000 by the end of the month, a critical early-campaign filing period, and donations of $5,000 to Mr. Huntsman's political action committee.
At the Exeter Town Hall, Mr. Huntsman received mostly polite, sometimes boisterous, applause after giving an almost identical announcement to the one in New Jersey. Many in the crowd said they did not know much about him before coming to hear him speak, and one new supporter, Peyton Carr, 67, acknowledged that Mr. Huntsman could have a hard time surviving the primary season.
Democrats and Republicans agree that some of his past positions supporting the so-called cap and trade policy to limit emissions -- which conservatives deride as ''cap and tax'' -- and comments that Mr. Obama's stimulus plan ''wasn't large enough'' would provide challenges.
On Tuesday, Democrats called attention to Mr. Huntsman's recent statements dropping his support for cap and trade and criticizing the stimulus. In an e-mail, the Democratic National Committee said he ''has attempted to reinvent himself as a candidate who can compete in the Republican primary.''
Speaking with reporters on his way back from New Hampshire, Mr. Huntsman said that the cap and trade proposal -- which would create emissions allowances that could be traded among companies -- made less sense in the current economy, and that his comments on the stimulus were being taken out of context and did not reflect his full thinking at the time.
''I'm delighted that people care enough about a margin-of-error candidate to be dumping stuff like this,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Fed's 3-Year Rescue Plan Falling Short of Promise

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve hoped that its three-year-old economic rescue campaign would reach a climax at the end of June. It hoped that consumers and businesses by now would be spending more and more, and the central bank could start doing less and less.
That peak now looks like a long plateau. The Fed still is expected to announce Wednesday that it will halt the expansion of its aid programs at the end of June, as scheduled, when it completes the purchase of $600 billion in Treasury securities. But growth is sputtering, and economists now expect that the Fed will leave its $2 trillion of bandages, props and crutches untouched until next year. 
The pace of economic expansion has repeatedly fallen short of the Fed's predictions, and the central bank is expected to lower its eyes once again when its releases a new forecast after a two-day meeting of its policy board, the Federal Open Market Committee.
Economic forecasters, many of whom also thought 2011 would be a more prosperous year, say that they underestimated the impact of the Japanese earthquake on the production of cars and other goods. They also point to a lack of confidence, an elusive concept that basically defines the willingness of consumers and businesses to spend more money than is justified by current circumstances.
''The most important thing I missed is how fragile confidence is. When anything goes off-script, the impact is magnified by this very fragile psyche,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.
Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed's chairman, said this month in Atlanta that the recovery was continuing at a ''moderate pace, albeit at a rate that is both uneven across sectors and frustratingly slow from the perspective of millions of unemployed and underemployed workers.''
Mr. Bernanke will again answer questions from reporters Wednesday afternoon, part of a new practice the Fed has initiated to explain its policies and defend its judgments.
Since 2008 the central bank has taken a series of unprecedented steps to arrest the financial crisis and then to restore growth. It is holding short-term interest rates near zero, and has tried to reduce long-term rates by purchasing huge quantities of mortgage-backed securities and Treasuries. The final installment of those purchases is scheduled to take place next week.
Economists do not expect the event to ripple through the economy. The prevailing view is that the impact of the purchases was felt mostly at the time they were announced, based on the total amount the Fed promised to spend, and that markets have not responded to the daily transactions in which the Fed bought those Treasury securities from financial companies.
''Nothing will change on July 1,'' said James O'Sullivan, chief economist at MF Global. ''Monetary policy will not be that different'' because the Fed still will hold the Treasuries on its balance sheet.
Moreover, a number of studies have concluded that the Fed's efforts have had only a modest impact on the economy. Stock prices have climbed. Corporations have rarely been able to borrow money more cheaply. Mortgage loans have seldom been available at such low interest rates. But companies are hiring few new workers, and people are buying few new homes. Almost 25 million Americans cannot find full-time work, a number that is rising again after declining modestly over the last year.
When the economy faltered last summer, the Fed announced a giant stimulus program. This year, the leaders of the central bank have shown little appetite for another intervention.
Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials have sought to discourage speculation in recent weeks, arguing that monetary policy cannot address the nation's fundamental problems, including the collapsed housing market, the federal deficit and trade imbalances with developing nations.
The political backlash against the current round of asset purchases is one reason for the Fed's timidity. Some at the central bank also see evidence of diminishing returns from additional spending. And the Fed has made clear that it its primary focus is on the pace of inflation, in part because the central bank regards slow, steady price increases as a prerequisite for sustainable job creation.
Last year prices were falling; this year, prices are increasing, and the Fed is frozen as a consequence as it searches for any indication that inflation will exceed its 2 percent speed limit.
''We're a long way from where we were last summer,'' Mr. O'Sullivan said.
The Fed also is waiting to see what Washington will do about its own financial problems. A failure to raise the debt ceiling, the maximum amount the government can borrow, could precipitate a financial crisis. Mr. Bernanke has said that short-term spending cuts could weaken the economy, while a long-term plan to reduce spending could increase growth.
''They won't rule out anything because they know a lot depends on what the fiscal policy makers do, and that is inherently unpredictable,'' Mr. Zandi said.

HEADLINE: In G.O.P. Presidential Race, a Focus on Cash Over Votes

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY; Kitty Bennett contributed reporting from St. Petersburg, Fla., and Emmarie Huetteman from Washington.

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. -- With their first major fund-raising deadline nine days away, the Republican presidential candidates are in a cutthroat, coast-to-coast scramble to sign up top party donors to gain a financial edge -- and, just as crucial, to block them from helping a rival campaign.
Mitt Romney has raced through Florida, Georgia, Nevada, Idaho, Colorado and California in the last week, tapping into the widest fund-raising network of any Republican in hopes of creating a gold-plated sense of inevitability in the party's nominating contest.
But Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, is not the only candidate pursuing people on that list, which he built four years ago. It contains targets of opportunity for Jon M. Huntsman Jr., who declared his candidacy on Tuesday and is trying to poach former Romney contributors. 
The focus of the campaign -- for the rest of June, at least -- is on donors, not voters. As President Obama appeared this week at his 30th fund-raising event of the year, Republican contenders were more likely to cross paths in hotel ballrooms in Las Vegas or boardrooms on Wall Street than in the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire.
The contest is playing out with donors like Dr. Akshay Desai, who runs the Universal Health Care Group in Florida. Four years ago, he was a top Romney fund-raiser. This time, a 90-minute private meeting at Dr. Desai's office was not enough for him to give an automatic commitment to Mr. Romney.
''He's a fantastic human being and a great candidate, but I have not made up my mind yet,'' Dr. Desai said. ''I've met with Tim Pawlenty, and we had a very good discussion. I've been talking to Jon Huntsman on the phone and look forward to meeting him.''
Dr. Desai's comments echoed a theme that came up in interviews with several contributors and fund-raisers who have been slow to pledge their loyalties in a campaign lacking a front-runner. By the end of the month, Mr. Romney hopes to have made the case that he deserves that distinction -- if not to voters, than to donors.
There is little doubt, even among his rivals, that Mr. Romney will raise more than any Republican candidate. Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, known for her fund-raising abilities, has just joined the race, and other candidates like Newt Gingrich have struggled. Mr. Romney collected $10 million during a one-day telethon last month in Las Vegas, and his goal is to collect three times that amount before the second quarter closes on June 30, when candidates are required to report their fund-raising to the Federal Election Commission.
He is working to solidify the perception that he is the candidate who is best equipped to challenge Mr. Obama. He highlights his business experience and his strength as a general-election candidate during private meetings, whether they are with doctors and real estate developers here in Florida, Mormon business leaders in Idaho or the party's reliable set of donors in Orange County, Calif.
''They're going to put up a big number for this quarter -- considerably larger than anybody else in the field,'' said Austin Barbour, a nephew of Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi and a member of Mr. Romney's national finance committee. A strong performance at last week's debate also helped. ''Folks who were on the fence who watched that said, 'Man, this is a good opportunity for us to get on board.' ''
Other contenders, particularly Mr. Huntsman and Mr. Pawlenty, are presenting themselves as alternatives to Mr. Romney and urging donors to disregard the juggernaut he is building. Mr. Huntsman and Mr. Pawlenty are also trying to tap into the network that helped financed President George W. Bush's campaigns.
David F. Girard-diCarlo, a former ambassador to Austria in Mr. Bush's administration, said he had been courted by all the major candidates. He signed with Mr. Huntsman last week.
''It's far too early to predict whether this president is really vulnerable,'' Mr. Girard-diCarlo said. ''But if Republicans put up someone who can appeal to independents, we can win.''
Since leaving Beijing as ambassador in late April, Mr. Huntsman has spent much of his time meeting donors. The top echelon of Republican bundlers -- people who raise money from others in a pyramid-type system -- is close-knit, and news travels fast. In recent weeks, Mr. Huntsman has arrived on the doorstep of many donors who have seen Mr. Romney but not committed to him.
William E. Ford, the chief executive of the General Atlantic investment firm, had not met Mr. Huntsman until he arrived in Mr. Ford's Manhattan offices two weeks ago. For two hours, Mr. Huntsman, accompanied by his wife, Mary Kaye, answered questions from Mr. Ford and six colleagues.
''I've got a lot of respect for Mitt, and I've met Mitt,'' Mr. Ford said. ''He has deep relationships with a lot of people from the financial and business world already. I think very highly of him, but I just believe that Huntsman's more in tune with the American people.''
For Mr. Pawlenty, a former governor of Minnesota, raising money has been a steep challenge, according to his advisers. He continues to spend a considerable part of his time introducing himself rather than collecting checks. Mr. Pawlenty is likely to raise only a few million dollars in the second quarter, putting him at a considerable disadvantage.
''We're working hard to introduce him to folks around the state who are interested in him and who haven't committed,'' said Justin Sayfie, a Fort Lauderdale lobbyist and co-chairman of the Pawlenty campaign in Florida. ''The friend-raising is something that is still going on.''
A review shows that Mr. Romney's strength is robust in all regions of the country. Each time he visits a city, he releases a long list of endorsements. His schedule in Florida late last week -- marathon sessions of dinner, breakfast, lunch, dinner and lunch -- underscores his ability to raise money efficiently because he is known to most donors.
''He's never really stopped since 2007,'' said Mel Sembler, a Florida developer and a former ambassador to Italy during the last Bush administration, who hosted an event that raised $250,000 for Mr. Romney. The pitch from Mr. Romney and the others includes forceful criticism of how Mr. Obama has handled the economy. The downturn, though, is making it more difficult to raise money. The checks are smaller, fund-raisers say, and slower to roll in.
''Anybody that's asking folks to write checks to a campaign knows that in lean times people have a harder time,'' Mr. Romney said last week in Tampa. ''We're trying to raise enough money to run a campaign, but we're not trying to overflow the coffers.''

GRAPHIC: MAPS: June Fund-Raising Sprint: Jon M. Huntsman Jr., Tim Pawlenty and Mitt Romney have scheduled more intensive fund-raising efforts than the other Republican presidential candidates for the second half of June. The events are outside the early-deciding states of Iowa and New Hampshire.

HEADLINE: European Leaders Propose a Sweeter Deal for Greece

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE and MATTHEW SALTMARSH; Stephen Castle reported from Brussels and Matthew Saltmarsh from Paris.

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- Seeking to sweeten the medicine for Greek politicians who must decide next week whether to embrace a strict austerity plan, the president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, on Tuesday proposed early payment to Athens of about 1 billion euros in money from the European Union.
At a meeting of European leaders on Thursday and Friday, Mr. Barroso is expected to propose to make it easier for the debt-laden country to use the money, the equivalent of $1.4 billion, to encourage economic growth. 
''Greece has the potential to access a significant amount of E.U. money,'' Mr. Barroso said in Brussels, adding that the money should be concentrated where it can create jobs. The idea, he said, was to ''front-load and accelerate them, so that Greece gets the benefit now.''
Fitch Ratings said Tuesday that it would consider even a voluntary rollover of Greece's sovereign debt as a default, which would lead it to cut the country's credit rating. And Timothy F. Geithner, the United States Treasury secretary, criticized Europe for failing to speak with one voice on the Greek crisis.
Speaking in Washington, Mr. Geithner called on Europe to ''speak with a clearer, more unified voice on the strategy'' for Greece, according to Bloomberg News. ''I think it's very hard for people to invest in Europe, within Europe and outside Europe, to understand what the strategy is when you have so many people talking.''
Mr. Geithner said he told leaders of the Group of 7 industrialized countries last weekend that the European Union had ''a very substantial financial arsenal'' at its disposal and that it needed to ensure that they were ''available to be deployed to do the kind of things they need to do to make this process work.''
''That means make it available so banks can be recapitalized where they need capital, to make sure there is a funding available to the banking system,'' he said. He added that there was ''no reason why Europe cannot manage these problems.''
European leaders have been desperately trying to prevent a Greek default, which would hurt global markets and could fatally undermine the euro monetary union. Some analysts have said it could have an effect on credit and debt markets comparable to the one that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
The warning by Fitch kept pressure on Prime Minister George A. Papandreou of Greece and his newly shuffled government, which survived a vote of confidence early Wednesday. It also kept the heat on European policy makers as they worked on a second bailout for the country.
Parliament will be asked to endorse further spending cuts, which are a condition of receiving a fresh disbursement of 12 billion euros, or $17.1 billion, from last year's 110-billion-euro bailout from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.
''The assumption must be that if these two critical votes are passed, the short-term pressure on Greece will ease,'' said Adam Cole, head of foreign exchange strategy at RBC Capital Markets in London.
The Barroso plan is intended to help tackle one of the main obstacles facing the Greek economy, which risks a downward economic spiral of low growth that depresses government tax revenue.
A large pot of money has been allocated to Greece for job creation projects, but of a total of 20 billion euros for 2007-13, only about a quarter has been disbursed. One of the obstacles is that most of the grants require matching money from the country receiving aid, something that Greece is now unable to afford. Changing that rule, however, would be time-consuming, so officials think that accelerating payments would be a quicker way of helping the Greek economy.
Mr. Barroso also reinforced calls for Greek politicians to endorse the austerity measures. ''My message today is that if Athens acts, Europe will deliver,'' he said. ''If anyone thinks that without the program agreed with the E.U. and the I.M.F. we can still get by somehow, there's an alternative program, that's not true. There is no alternative. The E.U. and the I.M.F. won't support any other program.''
Euro zone finance ministers have said that a second Greek bailout would include a contribution by private holders of government bonds. Ministers have asked that the contribution be voluntary but ''substantial,'' but its nature remains uncertain.
That uncertainty has raised concerns at ratings agencies. Andrew Colquhoun, a senior director for Asia-Pacific sovereign ratings at Fitch, said at a conference Tuesday in Singapore that Fitch would regard a debt exchange or voluntary debt rollover ''as a default event and would lead to the assignment of a default rating to Greece.''
But Cristina Torrella, a senior director in Fitch's financial institutions group, said in a statement that a restructuring or rollover of Greek government debt ''would not automatically trigger a default by the major Greek banks.''
''The precise rating actions on the banks will depend on the full terms of the sovereign event and the extent to which this considers maintaining solvency and, vitally, liquidity in the Greek banking system,'' Ms. Torrella said.

 BODY:
Republicans say they won't raise taxes. Democrats are reluctant to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. So discretionary spending -- the roughly 35 percent of government that includes other social programs and the military -- will have to be a big part of any deal in coming weeks to raise the debt ceiling.
But there is a little problem with discretionary spending. 
According to the government's official forecasts, discretionary spending is already slated to shrink significantly. Military spending will fall by 25 percent, as a share of the economy, over the next decade. Domestic programs will shrink even more, and by 2021 they will account for their smallest share of the economy since the 1950s.
I'm guessing you haven't heard of these plans, however. That's probably because plans is a bit of an exaggeration. Assumptions is a better word: per Congress's orders, the baseline budget numbers unrealistically assume that future discretionary spending will grow only with inflation, rather than with population growth and economic growth, too.
As a result, Vice President Joe Biden, Republican leaders and the other deficit negotiators not only have to cut discretionary spending to make progress. They have to cut it even more than the Congressional Budget Office, the keeper of the official numbers, already assumes that spending will be cut.
And the scale of the cuts could do real damage. They could jeopardize food safety, highway quality and F.B.I. investigations. They could hurt the poor at a time when unemployment remains near a three-decade high. They could undermine education and scientific research, the best hopes for future prosperity.
The goal of deficit reduction can't simply be arithmetic. It has to be philosophical, as well. In what ways is the private sector incapable of planting the seeds of future economic growth -- and what, therefore, must the government do? What's the least amount of spending needed to ensure a decent life for even the most vulnerable citizens? Who is in the best position to pay that money?
By many accounts, the debt ceiling negotiators, starting with Mr. Biden and Eric Cantor, the second-ranking House Republican, have made progress. They could potentially get to their goal -- $200 billion in average annual deficit reduction over the next decade -- with a combination of discretionary cuts and tweaks to Medicaid, Medicare and maybe Social Security. President Obama's intention to withdraw troops from Afghanistan will help.
But even if the negotiators reach their short-term goal, they won't be close to getting the deficit under control. That would require closer to $500 billion in annual deficit cuts over the next decade.
Eventually, the country will have to confront the deficit we have, rather than the deficit we imagine. The one we imagine is a deficit caused by waste, fraud, abuse, foreign aid, oil industry subsidies and vague out-of-control spending. The one we have is caused by the world's highest health costs (by far), the world's largest military (by far), a Social Security program built when most people died by 70 -- and to pay for it all, the lowest tax rates in decades.
To put it in budgetary terms, the deficit we imagine comes largely from discretionary spending. The one we have comes partly from discretionary spending but mostly from everything else: tax rates, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.
Taxes may be the toughest issue politically, but the mechanics of raising taxes are not all that difficult. As the 1990s demonstrated, the economy can grow rapidly even after a modest tax increase. As the last decade showed, a big tax cut doesn't necessarily prevent mediocre growth.
Bruce Bartlett, a former Treasury Department official, has pointed out on The New York Times's Economix blog that average federal tax rates are ''lower for most taxpayers than they have been since the 1960s.'' The government could raise about $60 billion a year by letting the high-end Bush tax cuts lapse and tens of billions more by reducing tax breaks for companies and individuals.
On Social Security and Medicare, Washington could start by reducing benefits for the affluent -- that is, the people who have received the biggest pay raises and tax cuts in recent years and whose life expectancy has risen the most. When conservatives like Mitch Daniels, Glenn Hubbard and Greg Mankiw talk about means-testing benefits, they're talking about exactly this: making the programs more progressive.
Beyond means testing, the most promising strategy on health costs is probably a combination of conservative and liberal ideas.
Medicare could get more serious about refusing to pay for health care that doesn't make people healthier, as the Obama administration has urged. The program could also introduce more incentives for people to choose cost-effective care, as Republicans prefer. Medicare's problems are large enough that every plausible idea deserves a chance.
Discretionary spending, as more than one-third of the federal government, obviously must be part of the solution. In particular, bipartisan budget groups have called for annual military cuts of about $100 billion, or about one-seventh of the total budget, which would begin to reverse the post-9/11 spending bulge. Social programs -- which often fail to achieve their fundamental goals -- could also stand some rigorous scrutiny.
But the problem with the current debate is just how much of the budgetary burden falls on a relatively small part of the government. It isn't just any part of the government, either. It is the part that has the best record of turning today's spending into tomorrow's economic growth.
Tax cuts don't deliver nearly the economic oomph that their advocates claim. Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security, central to a decent society as they may be, certainly don't do much to plant the seeds of future prosperity. Discretionary spending really can.
Discretionary spending let the Defense Department build the Internet. It let the National Institutes of Health finance life-saving research. It has helped make possible the semiconductor, the broadband network, the highway system and airports.
If we're smart, we won't just avoid damaging cuts. We will even find a way to increase forms of discretionary spending. As history has shown, economic growth remains the best deficit-reduction strategy of all.

HEADLINE: Security Professionals Say Network Breaches Are Rampant

BYLINE: RIVA RICHMOND


HIGHLIGHT: A study from the Ponemon Institute suggests that network security breaches at companies are occurring much more often than is publicized.

 BODY:
There has been a flood of news about hacker break-ins at companies. But how bad is the situation really?
Significantly worse than the headlines suggest, and getting worse still, a new study from the research firm Ponemon Institute suggests. The study says breaches are rampant and occurring much more often than is publicized.
The firm's survey of 581 security professionals at large companies in the United States, Britain, France and Germany found that 90 percent of them had at least one breach in the last year and 59 percent had two or more. And the costs are mounting; 41 percent of break-ins cost more than half a million dollars.
Study participants broadly agreed that cyberattacks were getting more frequent, more severe, and harder to detect and stop.
Indeed, hackers are increasingly staging targeted attacks aimed at stealing something specific, said Larry Ponemon, founder of the institute. They study the target, find an opening and then quietly get in and out. Most are mercenaries, members of criminal syndicates or representatives of unfriendly countries, he said, and their attacks "are much more stealthy and much more difficult to identify." 
About 60 percent of respondents said they were able to identify the source of at least some of the attacks suffered by their organizations. They traced 34 percent of them to China and 19 percent to the Russian Federation.
Both countries are known hotbeds of hacking for profit and economic advantage. "China is prolific and noisy," said the former National Security Agency director Mike McConnell, speaking at an event at the 92nd Street Y in New York last week. "They are literally taking terabytes of data" and focusing on virtually every sector of the economy. Russian hackers are considered especially skilled and known for taking things undetected, he said.
Nearly half of the breached companies surveyed by Ponemon suffered a damaging loss of data, which "speaks volumes about the mindset of the attacker community," said Karim Toubba, vice president of security strategy at Juniper, which sponsored the survey. The large majority are in it for financial gain and don't talk about what they do -- unlike LulzSec and Anonymous, who are hacking for fun and politics and have been loudly bragging about their activities.
Victimized companies overwhelmingly prefer to keep quiet, too. When they do talk, it's usually after a loss of consumer information, which is subject to laws requiring disclosure. But most of what is being stolen is corporate information that doesn't have to be disclosed, Mr. Ponemon said, whether it is intellectual property like design documents or financial information. There's certainly little reason to talk when, as the Sony case has shown, news of your vulnerability might make hackers hit you harder, customers lose confidence in you and your stock price drop.
As attackers step up their games, defenders are struggling to cope. Security professionals are pessimistic about their ability to prevent hacks; 57 percent said they had little or no confidence in their organizations' ability to prevent a breach. They're coming to believe that "maybe the bad guys are getting so good -- or so bad -- that maybe it is impossible to meet the security needs of the organization," Mr. Ponemon said.
Respondents are also concerned about insufficient security budgets and say the complexity of modern networks is a major challenge. Corporate networks are growing more unruly and harder to control as employees use more mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, adopt cloud services and log onto social networks, all of which carry security threats. Meanwhile, I.T. departments must manage a growing array of specialized security technologies that may or may not work together to help security departments detect and halt attacks.
"When you put all of this into one big stew, it's not very tasty," Mr. Ponemon said.

HEADLINE: Across the World, Less Interest in Leaving Home

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Gallup found that 14 percent of the world's adults said they would migrate to another country if they could in a 2008-10 survey, down from 16 percent in 2007-9.

 BODY:
Fewer residents of the world are trying to get out of Dodge, according to Gallup.
The polling organization found that 14 percent of the world's adults would be interested in migrating to another country if they could. That is down from the 16 percent of adults with the same desire in 2007.
The numbers are based on telephone and face-to-face interviews with 401,490 adults in 146 countries from 2008 to 2010, and 259,542 adults in 135 countries from 2007 to 2009.
Residents of every area of the world except North America and the European Union decreased their desire to emigrate: 
The biggest decline was in sub-Saharan Africa, although the share of people there wanting to move is still high: 33 percent in 2008-10, versus 38 percent in 2007-9.
Perhaps these declines are signs of improving economic and political conditions in the developing world. Gallup's analysts, however, suggest that instead the trends may be explained by greater economic uncertainty worldwide, which would make emigration riskier than usual.
For those who did say they wanted to leave their homelands, the most desirable country to move to is the United States, where about a quarter of emigrant-wannabes would choose to land. The next most pined-for destinations are the United Kingdom and Canada. The top non-Western destination, a few places down, is Saudi Arabia.

HEADLINE: Fish Prices and the Environmental Debate

BYLINE: MOTOKO RICH


HIGHLIGHT: Does environmentally conscious fish shopping come at a price? Some findings from the New York marketplace.

 BODY:
Our colleague Sam Sifton, over on Diner's Journal, highlights the Tumblr blog of the Bloomberg restaurant reviewer Ryan Sutton. Mr. Sutton tracks prices at restaurants (and high-priced ones at that, judging from the $298 meal at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas and the $21 burger at the Lion in Manhattan, currently featured on the home page), as well as running the Dover Sole Price Guide, a comparison of, well, Dover sole prices at 25 swanky restaurants in New York City.
 Given all the attention that fish is getting these days for both health and environmental issues, Economix decided to take a quick look at the comparative prices of various fish recommended by the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch, which grades menu choices based on how the fish have been caught or farmed.
 Unfortunately, the United States Department of Agriculture does not track seafood prices the way it does milk, eggs, beef, fruit and vegetables.
So I took a selection of five fish listed under "best choices" and five on the "avoid" list, all commonly used by home cooks, and compared prices at four New York area seafood sellers: FreshDirect, the online grocery delivery service; Fish Tales, in Brooklyn; Wild Edibles, at the market in Grand Central Terminal; and Citarella, on the Upper West Side.
 Over all, it looks as if being environmentally conscientious will come at a price. Wild Alaska salmon, on the "best choices" list, ranges from $23.99 to $34.99 a pound, while Pacific halibut is anywhere from $23.99 to 29.99 a pound. On the "avoid" list, monkfish is $10.99 to $14.99 a pound while farmed Atlantic salmon is just $11.99 to $13.99. 
 But there are outliers. On the "best" list you can go for domestic farmed tilapia for as low as $7.99. And being environmentally reckless can be costly, too: for Chilean sea bass, you'll have to shell out as much as $29.99 a pound.

HEADLINE: How Social Ventures Can Produce Profits

BYLINE: MP MUELLER


HIGHLIGHT: Three examples of small businesses that built their businesses by giving money away.

 BODY:
Last decade, it was all about going green to differentiate your company in the hearts and minds of consumers. Today, it's social entrepreneurship that's the nice new thing that can make your company stand out.
The 2010 Edelman goodpurpose global study (PDF), found that 87 percent of American consumers expected businesses to consider societal interests at least as much as their own interests. And 62 percent said that it was no longer enough for corporations to give money to good causes; they needed to integrate those causes into their businesses.
Edelman cites declining trust that the government can solve our social issues as one explanation for this call to businesses and individuals to step up. In its March/April brief, TrendWatching suggests that practicing Random Acts of Kindness is a winning strategy for businesses. While this may seem like the kind of thing only big corporations can afford, there are many small businesses taking advantage of this cultural shift to differentiate their businesses and make a difference in their communities. (We just published a small-business guide to starting your own social venture.)
Laurie Loew started Give Realty two and a half years ago. She was coming out of a divorce and got into real estate by accident. It was during the recession, there was a slump in home sales - you may have heard! - and she was struggling with how to set herself apart from all of the other struggling real estate agents in Austin, Tex. "One half of my brain was feeling sorry for myself because my ex-husband and I were fighting over money, " said Ms. Loew. "Then I realized how fortunate I was compared to a lot of women going through divorce. I came up with the idea of giving 25 percent of my commissions to the charity of my clients' choice. I thought the worst thing that could happen is a bunch of other Realtors would copy my idea and a bunch more money would go to charity."
As of today, Ms. Loew has given more than $112,000 to 40 different nonprofits. Three out of four clients come to her specifically because of her business model. The surprise bonus, she said, is the quality of clients she attracts. "I'm surrounded by the best clients - the ones who want to make the world a better place," she said. "They value my time, the mission of Give Realty, and they are very, very special people." For some extra feel-good public relations, she arranges check presentations with the charities and her clients, and she posts the resulting photographs on her Web site.
Neil Goldman, chief executive of Hotels for Hope, which is also based in Austin, doesn't think his travel agency would have experienced the growth it has if not for his social business model. In April 2010, inspired by the buy-a-pair, give-a-pair model of Tom's Shoes, Mr. Goldman asked his hotel chain partners to donate $1 for every room night he booked, which Hotels for Hope promised to match. Mr. Goldman says the company was still able to save clients an average of 24 percent off hotel "rack" rates. And in its first year, it donated almost $25,000 to five national and international charities. "Charity is atonement, giving money back to redeem ourselves," Mr. Goldman said with a smile. He noted that Hotels for Hope has doubled its staff and that it was much easier for him to recruit talented, motivated employees since adopting the social enterprise model.
Tyler Merrick started an ad agency in Dallas, but the father of three young girls longed to do something more meaningful. Mr. Merrick decided to invest all of his savings in something he called Project 7, an organization that tries to offer help in seven areas of need. Project 7 sells bottled water, gum, mints and coffee with the promise that "when you buy, they give." Sales proceeds from the products are tied directly to nonprofit partners that teach, feed and house those in need.
Coupled with simple, appealing packaging, the model has gotten the products on the shelves of Whole Foods, Wal-Mart and Caribou Coffee. Not bad for a company competing side-by-side with Coke, Pepsi and other leading packaged-good giants - and truly impressive for a company of five people that's been in business two and a half years.
"We were up against Kraft, Hershey's and Mars for gum and mints," Mr. Merrick said of meeting with Wal-Mart's buyers. "Wal-Mart is the biggest seller of gum and mints in the world. Getting one product on their register is like hitting the lottery. They gave us three products at their register to launch at their West Coast stores." Initial sales reports, he said, had the company's mints and gum well ahead of Wal-Mart's goals - with no merchandise support.
From that initial Wal-Mart order, Project 7, which publishes an annual report of its impact on its Web site (PDF), was able to buy 100,000 meals for families struggling in Southern California and planted 80,000 avocado and mango trees in Haiti. At its two-and-a-half-year mark, Project 7 is projecting profitability, something that often takes well financed packaged-good businesses five years to achieve.

HEADLINE: Want to Pay Less for Car Insurance? Have Good Credit

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Good credit can help you get better car insurance rates.

 BODY:
Everyone knows that having a good credit score qualifies you for lower interest rates on loans and better terms on credit cards. But it can also affect the rates you pay for car insurance - sometimes quite significantly, when the savings are measured over time.
The most important factors in setting rates generally are your age, where you live and driving record, says Des Toups, senior managing editor of CarInsurance.com, a rate-quoting Web site. But most insurers also check your credit when quoting a rate, because there's a correlation between your score and the likelihood you will file an insurance claim. The higher the score, the less likely you are to file one.
While the practice of checking credit scores for auto insurance quotes is widespread, it's still somewhat controversial. One company, Cure Insurance, markets itself as one that specifically does not check credit scores. "Think about it," the round blue "spokes head" that functions as the company's logo, says on its Web site. "What does credit history have to do with your driving skills?" A handful of states, including California and Massachusetts, forbid the practice of checking credit scores for auto insurance quotes. But efforts to ban it nationally through federal legislation have failed.
An analysis from Carinsurance.com finds that drivers with credit scores over 750 - typically considered very good credit -- pay considerably less than a driver in the same age bracket with merely average scores.
The study compared the lowest rates offered for nearly 43,000 single-driver policies insuring one car with liability, comprehensive and collision coverage, when the driver reports no violations or accidents. The credit score used was calculated using data from TransUnion, one of the three major credit bureaus; it isn't a true FICO score, which is the number a lender typically uses. Rather, it's a version of the so-called insurance score that insurers check when you apply for coverage. The insurance version uses the same information as a traditional credit score, but gives more weight to factors deemed to reflect risk, like bankruptcy filings and maxed-out credit cards, Mr. Toups says.
The analysis found that young adults ages 25 to 34 with clean driving records, for instance, pay an average of $1,938 a year for full auto coverage. But those same drivers with a credit score over 750 pay an average of $1,155 - a 40 percent savings.
Drivers in that same age group with credit scores of 650 to 749 pay an average of $1,658, a savings of $280 compared with the overall average; those with lower scores, of 500 to 649, pay an average of $2,023, or $85 more. (Drivers with no credit file are penalized the most; they pay an average of $2,182, or $244 more than the overall average.)
The benefit continues through subsequent age brackets as well. Premiums tend to drop as drivers age, but high credit scores still mean you'll pay less. If you kept a good credit score until retirement, you'd save nearly $23,000 over the average premium paid by people with similar driving records, Mr. Toups says.
Do you think it's fair that your credit history affects your car insurance rates?

THE FIG TREE AND THE WASP
It could be a 20th century version of Genesis. In the beginning there was Robert Fano, Fernando Corbato and J. C. R. Licklider. There were others, of course. Many others. John McCarthy and Edward Fredkin at a Cambridge consulting firm, BBN (Bolt Beranek & Newman) - Licklider was at MIT, then BBN, then at ARPA, and ultimately back at MIT - but MIT was the hub. A group of professors and engineering students wanted to change how computers were used and as a result changed the world. Licklider, by all accounts, was the visionary, the force behind it all. He was not only the oracle of the revolution, but he managed to put himself in a position in the government (at the newly created ARPA) where he could channel financing to projects of interest to him. And he wrote a number of legendary articles, where he foresaw the World Wide Web and personal computers. [23] He saw computers not just as adjunct to problem-solving, but - he took the term explicitly from biology - in a symbiotic relationship with man. His paper "Man-Computer Symbiosis" (from 1960) opens with what might be considered a metaphor - except that it isn't one, it is an illustration of what the relationship between man and computer can become.
The fig tree is pollinated only by the insect Blastophaga grossorum. The larva of the insect lives in the ovary of the fig tree, and there it get its food. The tree and the insect are thus heavily interdependent: the tree cannot reproduce without the insect; the insect cannot eat without the tree; together, they constitute not only a viable but a productive and thriving partnership...
Man-computer symbiosis is a subclass of man-machine systems. There are many man-machine systems. At present, however, there are no man-computer symbioses... The hope is that, in not too many years, human brains and computing machines will be coupled together very tightly, and that the resulting partnership will think as no human brain has ever thought and process data in a way not approached by the information-handling machines we know today. [24]
Many of these early pioneers came from different fields. Licklider had come from psychology; Corbato from physics; Fano from electrical engineering. [25] 
I contacted Dr. Corbato. 
ERROL MORRIS: Tom Van Vleck urged me to talk to you about my brother and his contribution to e-mail.
FERNANDO CORBATO: I don't remember the technical details of who did what and so forth. But Noel was right in the middle of things - working on the inner machinery of the system - and was one of the really crack system programmers. He knew how to make things work, how to put them together. And could write really well. It was a big project. And a very tough one, because we were breaking new ground in all directions. But the core of it was the young people who believed in the idea and made it work. 
ERROL MORRIS: What was the idea?
FERNANDO CORBATO: Back in the early '60s, computers were getting bigger. And were expensive. So people resorted to a scheme called batch processing. It was like taking your clothes to the laundromat. You'd take your job in, and leave it in the input bins. The staff people would prerecord it onto these magnetic tapes. The magnetic tapes would be run by the computer. And then, the output would be printed. This cycle would take at best, several hours, or at worst, 24 hours. And it was maddening, because when you're working on a complicated program, you can make a trivial slip-up - you left out a comma or something - and the program would crash. It was maddening. People are not perfect. You would try very hard to be careful, but you didn't always make it. You'd design a program. You'd program it. And then you'd have to debug it and get it to work right. A process that could take, literally, a week, weeks, months - 
ERROL MORRIS: Yes. I remember my brother lugging around reams of paper, all of these computer print-outs. It seemed like a nightmare.
FERNANDO CORBATO: Yes. People began to advocate a different tactic, which came to be called time-sharing. Take advantage of the speed of the computer and have people at typewriter-like terminals. In principle, it seemed like a good idea. It certainly seemed feasible. But no manufacturer knew how to do it. And the vendors were not terribly interested, because it was like suggesting to an automobile manufacturer that they go into the airplane business. It just was a new game. A group of us began to create experimental versions of time-sharing, to see if it was feasible. I was lucky enough to be in a position to try to do this at MIT. And we basically created the "Compatible Time Sharing System," nicknamed CTSS from the initials, that worked on the large mainframes that IBM was producing. First it was going to be just a demo. And then, it kept escalating. Time-sharing caught the attention of a few visionary people, like Licklider, then at BBN, who picked up the mantle. He went to Washington to become part of one of the funding agencies, namely ARPA. ARPA has changed names back and forth from DARPA to ARPA. But it's always the same thing.
ERROL MORRIS: They're close.
FERNANDO CORBATO: Yes, it is the same organization. They just keep periodically relabeling themselves. Sometimes "Defense" was the initial word and sometimes "Advanced Projects Research Agency." Anyway, Licklider went down to DARPA [Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency] and proceeded to get in the position where he could go out and parcel out a lot of money, to try to encourage people to do good research. And, in particular, the one thing he was quite interested in was time-sharing and he came up to MIT and talked to a bunch of us. In those days, the MIT computation research was sprinkled in a lot of directions, a lot of different groups. And Bob Fano was one of the people that was involved in the discussions. He was a little bit like the elder statesman, even though he was just a few years older. But he took it upon himself to propose a new project, which came to be called Project MAC, which would collect together all these different groups who were interested in man-machine interaction. 
ERROL MORRIS: What year was this? 
FERNANDO CORBATO: I believe it was '63. I don't have the dates firmly locked in my mind. But we had done a demo with four typewriters in November of 1961 and we kept improving it. Fano proposed this project, which we all kind of coalesced on, and by the end of 1962, he had the proposal written.
ERROL MORRIS: And the goal was -
FERNANDO CORBATO: - to use CTSS as an initial platform and to explore the ramifications of man-machine interaction. It was also an opportunity to build a tool. [26]
ERROL MORRIS: From the beginning, did you have terminals hooked up to the mainframe? Was that something that happened early on?
FERNANDO CORBATO: It happened fairly rapidly. During that summer of anticipation, we beefed up CTSS by acquiring an IBM terminal controller, which was a big box called a 7750 that allowed us to have a large number of terminals. Modems were just coming into play. We were able to attach modems to the 7750, and modems to the terminals, and interconnect the modems via phone lines. MIT, at that point, had its own switched telephone network and we were allowed to put our modems onto the MIT telephone network. So to connect a terminal, it was just a matter of dialing up from the terminal's modem and being assigned to the next available modem at the 7750. 
ERROL MORRIS: I spent a summer with my brother in 1969. And his apartment had a terminal.
FERNANDO CORBATO: In '69? Absolutely. We had a phone and a modem at each terminal. And we could dial up the computer. The speed wasn't very high. The modems started out being 110 baud, which roughly is a dozen characters per second.
ERROL MORRIS: That's incredibly slow - 
FERNANDO CORBATO: They were slow and as big as a shoebox. And it was really pretty awkward. We were lumbering along. But just being able to do it at all was a big step forward. The technology was just changing from vacuum tubes, the 709, to the transistor machine, the 7090. Project MAC was going to be several hundred people, and so we needed the space to start a project of that magnitude. Fano managed to work out the plan to get space over in Technology Square, which became Project MAC's first home. Initially we had just two floors. One of the service bureaus had decided they'd over-expanded and wanted to give up the space they had in the building. We were able to get one floor, and then another floor opened up, and so forth. 
ERROL MORRIS: Did many patents came out of this? 
FERNANDO CORBATO: We didn't try to patent anything. The object was to influence the direction of the computer industry. 
ERROL MORRIS: Which you did.
FERNANDO CORBATO: - which we did. That was our goal. And to form a nucleus of computer science at MIT. Until then, computer specialists had been sprinkled around in various groups and places. 
ERROL MORRIS: And still no computer science department -
FERNANDO CORBATO: Most of the key leaders came out of the electrical engineering department. But electrical engineering at MIT was a peculiar department. It had a very, very broad view of what its charter was. It had everything, from biologists to material scientists - a rich tradition of being very spread out in its research directions. And so, most of the people that joined us, Project MAC, were part of electrical engineering, but not all. And Fano asked everyone to make their principal office in the same building where the computer was. This is turning into a longer story than I expected. 
ERROL MORRIS: That's fine.
FERNANDO CORBATO: And we wanted to come up with hardware that was designed to be time-sharing from the word go, rather than designed for batch processing. So we shopped around. And we talked to about half a dozen different vendors. IBM thought they were the prime possibility, because we were using an IBM machine for CTSS. But we discovered afterwards that they had been working on the 360 line of computers - a very ambitious project in its own right - to produce a family of machines, small to large, which were all batch processors. Unfortunately, a lot of the architecture was against the grain of what we were trying to do with time-sharing. [27]
ERROL MORRIS: So you didn't go with IBM -
FERNANDO CORBATO: We formed a triumvirate. Bell Labs, MIT and the G.E. Computer Department agreed orally to work on this project. And each group had its own expectations of what they were going to get out of it. MIT was trying to influence the world. Bell Labs was trying to get a machine which was going to be a workhorse for their laboratories. And General Electric was hoping to get a brand new shiny product that they could sell to other customers. That was the genesis of Multics. We threw down the gauntlet and said, "This is what we're going to do," which was very unusual for software projects in those days. 
ERROL MORRIS: Did you have any idea how difficult it would be to actually change how people used computers?
FERNANDO CORBATO: No. We didn't realize how difficult it was going to be. Once you start from scratch, you really have to do everything. And even though we had anywhere from 50 to 100 people at one time working on the project, it was still a tremendous effort to try to get everything right. It was a visionary goal that everyone who joined the project came to believe in. It wasn't just another job. And that's how we kept people like your brother interested as a career. He was part of a group of people that knew how to make things happen. It was an exciting time, and everybody was inspired because they felt they were working on something worthwhile, not just another programming job. Not just another product.
ERROL MORRIS: But e-mail? Was it a big thing? Or was it just -
FERNANDO CORBATO: E-mail just evolved. One of the first things you notice when you have everyone on the same machine is that it's possible to share information back and forth. You can let others use your programs. You can send them data. You can send messages to one another. So early in the game with CTSS, we started up the ability to send messages to people that were logged in. I don't remember exactly when we began to allow messages to be saved. But that was a natural consequence. And about the time that Multics was coming to life, the idea of networking also began to come to life. 
ERROL MORRIS: Networking?! Did everything start at MIT?
FERNANDO CORBATO: No, it started with Larry Roberts, then at ARPA, who proposed - with Licklider's encouragement - what came to be called the ARPANET. [28] He went around to all of the sites that Licklider was funding and talked up the idea, "Wouldn't it be great if we could all send programs back and forth to each other, and to even operate computers from one side of the country to another?" 
ERROL MORRIS: But didn't you have to deal with different kinds of computers?
FERNANDO CORBATO: The ARPANET was complicated, because everybody in the country had different kinds of equipment. And so, part of creating the ARPANET was to come up with a plan to, homogeneously, allow people to talk to each other, even though they had different kinds of equipment. And Larry proposed a so-called interface message processor - an IMP - attached to what ever computer they were using. And the IMP smoothed out the fact that everybody had a different computer. [29] There were a lot of DEC computers, but there was a tremendous amount of variety. And that allowed the variety to be screened off, so people could communicate. Each of the sites that was interested got an IMP and programmed it to match the ARPANET, and then programmed the IMP to match whatever equipment they had. [30] At MIT we did that, too.
ERROL MORRIS: With so many innovations, what are you most proud of?
FERNANDO CORBATO: Oh, the fact that it was a team effort. We were able demonstrate that interactive computing was not only a viable idea but a powerful one. 
ERROL MORRIS: But when you first started -
FERNANDO CORBATO: It was very different. Batch programming software was not designed to be interactive. It was designed to dump out reams of paper, at best. It's when you begin to get into the man-machine business, when we had first had time-sharing, that you designed different interfaces. You designed different ways to edit text. You designed different ways to write programs. It changed your strategy. All of that first began to show up on these mainframes that were being time-shared. And then, it migrated from the mainframes to the mini computers, which maybe had 10 or 15 people on them, and finally the personal computer, as the hardware kept allowing more new options. 
ERROL MORRIS: Did you foresee any of this back in the early '60s? 
FERNANDO CORBATO: In a dim way. Not quite so dramatically. We didn't quite know which shoe would fall next. For example, we knew, from the earliest days, that a graphical interface would be advantageous. But the economics were such you couldn't afford it. It would cost $50,000 to create a terminal for just one person. It just was not feasible. 
ERROL MORRIS: But didn't you experiment with graphical interfaces, as well? I remember seeing one.
FERNANDO CORBATO: Yes, we did have one attached to CTSS, which was called the Kluge, a very fancy graphical terminal. [31] [32] 
But it wasn't until the personal computer showed up that people began to really see the potential. There is a side bar on that. One of the reasons that IBM jumped into personal computers was that Apple II was so successful. But the reason the Apple II was so successful was not because it was such a great machine. It was because there was one program on it which suddenly made it of immense value to companies, namely VisiCalc, the first electronic spreadsheet. It was a runaway success. Apple doesn't like to admit it, but that was the main reason why people were buying Apple IIs. And that's what got IBM's attention - suddenly the business world was finding something valuable that they weren't building.
ERROL MORRIS: History is odd. It's almost impossible to guess what will be saved and what will fall by the wayside. I'm indebted to Tom Van Vleck and glad that he has become an historian. Without him, I would never know about my brother's work. I told him he should publish a book. And he said, "What would I want to do that for?" [laughter] He said, "If I put it online, I can constantly update it and correct it and improve it. If I write a book, it's just a book."
FERNANDO CORBATO: Yes, yes. That's the modern publishing conundrum, isn't it? 
ERROL MORRIS: I keep thinking of the crowd at my brother's funeral. How did they all know? Do you remember how you found out?
FERNANDO CORBATO: I don't remember, but I remember it was a shock. The Multics group, by and large, was young. And death was not a common phenomenon. Very few people have died that worked on the project. That will change with time, of course. 
ERROL MORRIS: Yes. Time catches up with all of us, eventually. 
FERNANDO CORBATO: But this project inspired people. They felt they were working on something that would last. It was a chance to make a mark on the industry and to change the way things happened. 
ERROL MORRIS: To change the world.
FERNANDO CORBATO: Yes. We were the forerunners of the way things went.

[23] Memorandum For Members and Affiliates of the Intergalactic Computer Network
[24] Man-Computer Symbiosis 
[25] Oral history with Robert Fano from the Charles Babbage Institute, University of Minnesota: "It was around 1960. Let me see if I can remember the exact date. There was a great deal of concern on the part of the administration about computer facilities at MIT. So they appointed a committee to make a recommendation consisting of Al Hill, Phil Morse, and myself. Various records also show Jerry Wiesner [Pres. Kennedy's science adviser and, eventually, president of MIT] was a member. But I do not recall - he probably left for Washington. But he did not really play a part. We promptly appointed a technical committee, which consisted of the various computer types at MIT: Corby, and John McCarthy, and Minsky, and Doug Ross, and Jack Dennis were there. Herb Teager was chairman. Now by that time the idea of timesharing was already moving, and they proposed the development at MIT of a timesharing system."
[26] In an interview years earlier, Corbato said, "So that was mostly to convince the skeptics that it was not an impossible task, and also, to get people to get a feel for interactive computing. It was amazing to me, and it is still amazing, that people could not imagine what the psychological difference would be to have an interactive terminal. You can talk about it on a blackboard until you are blue in the face, and people would say, 'Oh, yes, but why do you need that?' You know, we used to try to think of all these analogies, like describing it in terms of the difference between mailing a letter to your mother and getting [her] on the telephone. To this day I can still remember people only realizing when they saw a real demo, say, 'Hey, it talks back. Wow! You just type that and you got an answer.'"
[27] Fernando Corbato, "IBM was trying to humor us. They viewed it as kind of an interesting experiment. Unbeknownst to us in this whole time frame, they were hard at work developing what came to be known as the 360 line of machines and they had it close to their vests. The people that had sold the management of IBM on the 360 had convinced them that it was a machine to solve all problems from here to forever after. That wasn't true. Clearly, timesharing was not on their agenda and they viewed it as an aberration. They saw the goal as to have a line of machines which allowed them to sell much like the auto manufacturers. You would have a starter machine and then a larger machine and then a larger machine. They saw it only as a way to sell machines to customers. They did not think of it in terms of the way people would use computers." 
[28] In his ARPA Program Plan of 1968, Lawrence Roberts wrote, "Just as time-shared computer systems have permitted groups of hundreds of individual users to share hardware and software resources with one another, networks connecting dozens of such systems will permit resource sharing between thousands of users."

HEADLINE: Once More, With (Loss of) Feeling: Michigan to California on a Suzuki SV650

BYLINE: RONALD AHRENS


HIGHLIGHT: One month after hauling his effects to his new home in Southern California, the author returns to Ann Arbor to retrieve his motorcycle.

 BODY:
A month after driving a rented moving truck to Los Angeles, I returned to my former home, Ann Arbor, Mich., for my motorcycle, a 2002 Suzuki SV650.
I expected my next road trip to last four days, equal to the initial haul, but it would be antithetical in every other way. My rig this time would be a 363-pound "naked" bike, with little bodywork and no windshield, powered by an efficient yet punchy 645cc V-twin.
So, why worry? Aside from the endurance challenge posed by sitting on the equivalent of a pommel horse for four days, I feared another Big Incident.
In 1974, while stopped at a roadside historical marker in Montana, the Triumph I was shepherding from Omaha to Seattle backfired on restart, igniting a leaky carburetor which sent a plume of flame skyward. The fire prevented me from reaching the manual fuel shutoff, and while I did salvage my sleep roll, the same could not be said for the Triumph.
Later that day, overcoming my grief, I stuck out my thumb and caught a ride to Seattle. The episode would go far to explain the 37-year interval between multistate rides.
But my yellow SV has always performed as dependably as the national debt. Retrieving it from a friend's garage in Michigan, I started for California on June 16 through morning mist. Fifty miles along I-94, the left-side saddlebag's rain cover ballooned in the wind and ripped away, bending the drive chain's plastic guard into the wheel. Not an auspicious start.
Inside my helmet, my ears registered the bent guard as an oversize jack of spades flapping against bicycle spokes. Hoping this was my Big Incident for 2011, I stopped, bent the chain guard back into line, cut away the rain cover and started anew.
The SV surrenders its rider to wind, rain and bugs; a bumblebee striking my helmet's visor at 75 m.p.h. sounded like a bullet hitting a washtub. At every fuel stop -- 22 of them for 58.1 gallons in 2,387 miles, for roughly 41 m.p.g. overall observed economy -- I scrubbed away the invertebrates. Unlike big Harleys and Honda Gold Wings, the SV does not have audio equipment or Bluetooth connectivity. No automatic transmission, no trailer, either; it's a motorcycle.
Between Indianapolis and Terre Haute, Ind., my clothes dried out.
The only pain relief I sought, an ibuprofen pill, was taken on that first night, which I spent at the Congress Inn, along I-70, at Troy, Ill. Maheep Pannu, the desk clerk and a second-year medical student at St. Louis University, was listening to a recording of Sikh prayers in Punjabi when I checked in.
"Did Congressional representatives actually stay here as guests?" I gamely asked.
"I hope so," Mr. Pannu said. "We'll take anybody at this point."
The Gateway Arch welcomed me to St. Louis the following morning. I picked up I-44 through the forested limestone hills of southern Missouri and rode toward Joplin, the site of the tornado on May 22. Arriving there, I bought The Joplin Globe, which reported that nothing could protect against a 200-m.p.h. cyclonic wind that plowed along as slowly as a wheat harvester.
"This was a big puppy," said Gary Gugala of Pittsburg, Kan., a Salvation Army captain, stopping his relief van to dispense cold beverages to demolition workers. He said the triage center he staffed 90 minutes after the strike looked "like a war zone."
Following Route 60 west across the northern Oklahoma prairie to Bartlesville, I saw the Price Tower, a Frank Lloyd Wright skyscraper that suggested a Gothic cathedral composed of Prairie-style houses. An online search substantiates my perception that the Tower leans slightly -- a bit of Pisa in Sooner Country.
Leaving Bartlesville, I pumped 2.4 gallons at the Phillips 66 station on Frank Phillips Boulevard, facing the ConocoPhillips technology center. If motorcycling could claim the equivalent of taking the waters at Lourdes, this would be it.
Route 60 meets Route 40 at Amarillo, Tex. To reach Southern California in the projected four days, I had to propel myself across the Missouri Compromise Line of 1820 and bear down. Saturday morning's cheese omelet, hash browns and homemade bread at the Oklahoma Hills Cafe, in Seiling ("Crossroads of Northwest Oklahoma," according to various notations around town) fortified me to crank hard. I covered 665 miles.
Trying to hold 80 m.p.h. in a merciless New Mexico headwind caused an abrupt drop in fuel economy. To my surprise, I saw no trace of smoke from the wildfires that earlier had shrouded Albuquerque and Durango, Colo., in acrid brown air.
Sunday's 695-mile run from Grants, N.M., meant alternating between northern Arizona's chilly highlands and fantasizing about Gatorade flavors in the Mojave Desert.
The SV's odometer registered 20,000 clicks soon after the Colorado River crossing that separated Arizona from California. Just before sunset, I turned onto my street in suburban Monrovia.
Before the pressing matters of an oil change and a new filter, I thought of Barry Manilow, as I was wont to do this trip, and his "Looks Like We Made It."

HEADLINE: How Agriculture Affects Endemic Fish

BYLINE: JOHN S. SPARKS and CHRISTOPHER B. BRAUN


HIGHLIGHT: Although dams in Madagascar often provide water needed for village rice production, they often have devastating environmental consequences, including extinction of endemic fishes.

 BODY:
Friday, June 17
Walking to Lake Andrapongy through a lengthy series of rice paddies and mud fields laced with zebu dung, we become disheartened. It looks as though more and more of the flood basin has succumbed to agriculture. The water is fetid on our approach and we expect yet another disappointment. One team member who went down to see the lake returns, exclaiming, "There's nothing here in this schistosome-infested dung-hole!" Still, we approach some local fishermen and inquire whether the damba (Paretroplus damii) is still present in the lake. They assure us it is, and after seeing our photos, they say that Paretroplus maromandia and a species of Ptychochromis (P. inornatus) are also still present in the basin, although they have become increasingly rare and are now extremely difficult to catch.
To our surprise, within a few minutes of reaching the lake and explaining what we are after, we are presented with two large damba. As soon as we start to process those specimens, another bucket comes in, followed by yet another. This continues until we have to call for a cease. Amazingly, this lake, which at first glance appeared to be completely trashed environmentally, still supports a healthy population of endemic damba. We call it a night and look forward to more fish in the morning.
We aren't disappointed. We awake to several villagers carrying buckets filled with damba. After processing their catch, we head down to the lake ourselves and make an intriguing observation. The locals here use a wooden stick, called a doboka, that has a cone-shaped tip to pound the water and frighten the damba into nets they trail behind their pirogues, which are dug out canoes. We have never seen a similar technique and speculate that it evolved in this culture specifically to target the hearing specialized damba. It certainly seems effective, and by the end of the day, we have a nice collection of Paretroplus damii for the American Museum of Natural History. Still, we have failed to obtain a single specimen of the other two endemic cichlids known from the lake, which John Sparks collected here in the mid 1990s. We also document the sounds of the doboka and look forward to analyzing the recordings back in New York.
We leave Andrapongy to sample a very different habitat several hours to the east: the rocky, shallow, fast flowing Mangarahara and Amboaboa rivers near the town of Mandritsara, home to the beautiful Lamena (Paretroplus nourissati) and many other endemic species. We know from some of our colleagues in Europe that we may be in for a letdown, given that the World Bank constructed a dam upstream on the Mangarahara, and that when they last visited, both the Amboaboa and Mangarahara were completely dry. Although these dams often provide much needed water for village rice production, they often have devastating environmental consequences, including extinction of endemic fishes. After driving over poor roads for hours, we are treated to an incredible backdrop of sheer granite peaks and lush valleys as we approach the Mangarahara basin. To our surprise, we find both the Mangarahara and Amboaboa rivers to be flowing at a decent rate, about the same as when Dr. Sparks visited a decade and a half ago. As usual, we ask permission to camp and fish the river from the local village chief. This is a lengthy discussion, but we manage to explain what species we are after, and get permission to set up camp for the night. 
We are awakened by a cacophony coming from the direction of one of our tents, where a large congregation of villagers has assembled, each carrying a bucket or cup with a couple of native killifish (Pachypanchax). Luckily, some of the fishermen have also brought a nice collection of Lamena, a streamlined cichlid fond of hiding under rocks in riffles and cascades. The traditional method of fishing for Lamena is akin to "noodling" - the locals surround a rock under which they believe a Lamena to be hiding and feel around until they corner and grab it. By the early afternoon we have a nice series of Lamena and Pachypanchax, but have been unable to collect any of the other species known to be endemic to this small section of river. This once highly diverse river has become, like most others in Madagascar, depauperate. We can only wonder if the years when the basins did not flow led to the demise of some species, and hope they will one day recolonize this stretch of river from refuges farther upstream.

HEADLINE: A Look at Readers' Comments on Our Libertarian Post

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: An interesting debate has erupted in response to Five Thirty Eight's post on an apparent uptick in libertarian leanings.

 BODY:
If you don't make it a habit of perusing FiveThirtyEight's comment section, aside from missing the many, many insights of our learned readers, you also probably missed the interesting debate that erupted in response to Nate Silver's post on Monday about an apparent uptick in libertarian leanings.
The argument, generally, was over the merits of libertarianism as a governing philosophy. But more fundamentally, readers were sparring over just what, exactly, libertarianism is. And, for the most part, each camp rhetorically pushed the other side's viewpoint to its extreme.
Readers on the anti-libertarian side of the ledger dominated the early stages of the discussion. Eric from Oregon defined a libertarian as "just an anarchist with a mortgage."
"Both are juvenile/idealistic/uninformed ideologies that are simply oblivious to the realities of modern existence."
BlueMoose of Binghamton, N.Y., had a similar take: "So-called libertarianism is nothing but warmed-over laissez-faire Republicanism with a smattering of anarchism thrown in to delude the gullible. It didn't work in the 19th century and it will work even less now."
In turn, the pro-libertarians offered a different definition of their politics. James from Arizona wrote, "Libertarian (does not equal) someone who believes that the government is best when it governs least. A Libertarian is someone who emphasizes the value of personal liberty; holding it as a key or even fundamental political virtue."
And JP from Washington wrote: "I love the straw men. Most libertarians believe you need a government that is strong enough to perform basic functions well, which is what is called for in the Constitution."
Dennis from Michigan made a similar point: "Libertarians are not Anarchists. Smaller government, which can mean different things to each, not no government."
Another charge that was leveled against libertarians was that the gulf between libertarian theory and day-to-day life is too wide, or as Jerry Rubin of Wisconsin put it, "People want government out of their lives until they need them!"
Evan of the Bronx agreed, writing, "Americans love the idea of libertarianism, until they actually have to live its reality."
Some readers questioned the very premise of the article, that libertarian ideals were in fact on the rise. Scott McIntosh of Chevy Chase, Md., wrote, "I'm not sure that the first question provides a reliable measure of economic libertarianism. The question asks whether 'the government is trying to do too many things that should be left to individuals and businesses.' But what the government 'is trying to do' is a moving target. For better or worse, the government is doing a great deal more under the current Administration than it was doing a few years ago. So even if nobody's values regarding economic regulation had changed, you would expect to see a rise in the percentage of people who think the government is now going too far."
Sajwert from New Hampshire boiled down the overall debate to its crucial question. Sajwert addressed the question to libertarians, but it could equally be asked of Republicans and Democrats: "Exactly HOW much LESS government do they specifically want?"
It's the same question that underlies almost every debate in Washington, including health care and financial regulations (as well as our recent redistricting discussion): Where exactly should we draw the lines?
..
For readers who want to learn more about libertarianism, here are some resources (for, against and neutral):
"The Libertarian Vote" and "The Libertarian Vote in the Age of Obama," by David Boaz and David Kirby from the Cato Institute.
The Libertarian Party's platform.
A 2010 essay by Christopher Beam in New York magazine, "The Trouble With Liberty," highlights the growing popularity of libertarians, but asks, "Do we want to live in their world?"
In a GQ essay from 2009, Andrew Corsello lamented the ballooning influence of the libertarian author Ayn Rand. (Warning: the essay has some not-so-nice words).
And in 2008, Nathan Thornburgh, in Time, wrote a good primer on libertarianism.

HEADLINE: Big Deal | A Rare Fifth Avenue Mansion Goes on the Market

BYLINE: SARAH KERSHAW


HIGHLIGHT: The house at 973 Fifth, designed by Stanford White, is for sale for $49 million.

 BODY:
Take a mansion for sale on a singular block of Fifth Avenue, designed by a Gilded Age architect whose work defined an aesthetic that forever changed the landscape of the well-to-do corners of New York, throw in a $49 million price tag, and you have a blockbuster listing that is going on the market this weekend.
The mansion at 973 Fifth Avenue, with its grand Italian Renaissance Palazzo style and more than 15,000 square feet of living space on seven floors, was built for Henry H. Cook, a banker and railroad tycoon, and completed in 1907, a year after the architect, Stanford White, was shot and killed by the jealous husband of a former lover. It was one of the last buildings White designed, in the swan song of Beaux Arts architecture, before Modernism began to overtake the Renaissance ideal, architectural historians say. 
Cook at one point owned the entire block from Fifth to Madison Avenue, between East 78th and 79th Streets, and limited the building heights on Fifth with deed restrictions, ensuring that nothing taller than a town house was built on the block, along a stretch of the avenue known as Millionaire's Row. Cook himself died in 1905, before his mansion was complete, with family members inheriting it. It last sold in 1977 for $600,000, according to property records. The house is being sold by the estate of Victor Shafferman, a businessman who died in 2009.
The listing broker, Paula Del Nunzio of Brown Harris Stevens, said that in her 25-year career only two other mansions on Fifth Avenue, the Duke Semans mansion, which sold for $44 million in July 2010, and a mansion at 1130 Fifth, which sold for $17.5 million in 1999, had changed hands.
In his 30-year career with McKim, Mead & White, White was known for his precise attention to every detail inside his creations. His clients sought him out not only to design their residences but also to furnish them, as he provided all the trappings of wealth with one-stop shopping. He even, as Ms. Del Nunzio noted, helped them plan extravagant social events inside their homes.
The 973 Fifth Avenue property, which faces Central Park, has retained many of the original features, including the moldings, fireplaces and leaded-glass windows, and the rooms are laid out according to the original floor plan, although Ms. Del Nunzio would not say when the house was last renovated.
An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the date of Stanford White's death.

HEADLINE: Regions Settles S.E.C. Case Over Former Morgan Keegan Funds

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The settlement was announced the same day that Regions Financial said its Morgan Keegan unit was for sale.

 BODY:
Lucas Jackson/Reuters Robert Khuzami, director of the S.E.C.'s enforcement division, in February.As regulators announced a settlement Wednesday with Morgan Keegan of charges that it defrauded customers during the financial crisis, its parent put the brokerage firm on the block.
Morgan Keegan, a unit of Regions Financial, the big Alabama-based bank, agreed to pay $200 million to resolve a case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission. It accused the brokerage firm and two former executives of mispricing risky mortgage-backed bonds in supposedly conservative mutual funds.
One of those executives, the funds' portfolio manager, James C. Kelsoe Jr., agreed to a lifetime ban from the securities industry.
"The falsification of fund values misrepresented critical information exactly when investors needed it most - when the subprime mortgage meltdown was impacting the funds," Robert Khuzami, the director of enforcement at the S.E.C., said in a statement. "Such misconduct does grievous harm to investors."
Also Wednesday, Regions announced that it was putting Morgan Keegan up for sale in an effort to raise money to repay the $3.5 billion government loan it received during the financial crisis.
"The resolution of this legacy regulatory matter gives Regions great flexibility with respect to the Morgan Keegan franchise," said Grayson Hall, the chief executive of Regions, which sold the bond funds connected to this case in 2008 to another asset management company.
Regions, which has owned Morgan Keegan since 2001, has retained Goldman Sachs to handle the sale of the brokerage firm. The firm, which is based in Memphis, could fetch as much as $1.5 billion, according to a person briefed on the business.
The action against Morgan Keegan is just one of a spate of enforcement actions taken against firms related to their mispricing of mortgage securities in their mutual funds during the financial crisis. The S.E.C. has brought similar cases against the Charles Schwab Corporation, Evergreen Investments and the State Street Corporation.
Federal authorities have recently stepped up actions against large banks related to their crisis-era conduct. On Tuesday, JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay about $150 million to settle civil accusations that it misled investors in a complex mortgage securities transaction in 2007.
Last month, federal prosecutors in Manhattan filed a civil action against Deutsche Bank, accusing it of lying about the quality of home loans it handled for the Federal Housing Administration. The bank is fighting the case.
Still, authorities continue to field questions about why they are not bringing criminal charges against bank executives and others who may have engaged in illegal practices during the mortgage boom.
During a conference call with regulators on Wednesday, a reporter asked why the government did not bring criminal charges in the Morgan Keegan case. The government officials declined to comment.
Investors in the five Morgan Keegan bond funds are said to have lost about $1.5 billion. These funds, which were marketed as relatively safe investment vehicles, lost more than half their value when the market for mortgage securities first seized up in 2007.
Two former Morgan Keegan executives - Mr. Kelsoe and Joseph Thompson Weller, a controller - were accused in the case.
Mr. Kelsoe, who started managing the Morgan Keegan funds in 1999, was a vocal booster of mortgage securities during the housing boom and became one of Wall Street's top-ranked mutual fund managers. Investors reaching for extra yield during last decade's persistently low-interest-rate environment flocked to Mr. Kelsoe's funds.
But regulators said that Mr. Kelsoe ignored the funds' charter by investing predominantly in the risky structured products that became popular during the credit bubble, including pools of subprime mortgage-backed securities.
The S.E.C. action also accused him of instructing Morgan Keegan's accounting department to make fake "price adjustments" to inflate the value of the funds' mortgage-backed securities holdings as the housing market began to sour.
Mr. Kelsoe became an early, prominent casualty of the crisis in subprime mortgage bonds.
"What was an ocean of liquidity has quickly become a desert," wrote Mr. Kelsoe in a report to his investors in October 2007 as the fund was plummeting. He once compared his "intoxication" with low-grade mortgage securities to that of fund managers seduced by dot-com stocks.
Mr. Kelsoe, 49 and a resident of Memphis, agreed to pay a $500,000 penalty and accept a permanent ban from the securities industry. Mr. Weller agreed to pay a $50,000 fine.
Regulators from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra, as well as regulators from five Southern states were involved in the Morgan Keegan investigation and settlement.
Federal and state authorities continue to pursue separate claims against Morgan Keegan related to its sale of auction-rate securities, another risky investment product that soured during the financial crisis.
Although buffeted by the government's accusations, Morgan Keegan has performed well. Potential buyers could include a bank or brokerage firm looking to bolster its presence in the Southeast, or a private equity firm. A number of buyout shops have previously made successful investment in brokerage firms and asset managers, including Hellman & Friedman, TA Associates and Lightyear Capital.

HEADLINE: Capital One's Response to Outrage Over ING Direct Purchase

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Customers of ING Direct USA are unhappy about the online bank's sale to Capital One.

 BODY:
ING Direct USA account holders are reacting to the sale of the online bank about as well as they would if Capital One's famous television barbarians had battered down the doors of their homes.
Social media sites, including ING Direct's own Facebook page, and banking blogs have erupted with customer antipathy for the deal, which was announced last week. A sale was required by European regulators as a condition of financial assistance given to ING's Dutch parent bank during the banking crisis. ING Direct, headquartered in Wilmington, Del., offers savings accounts, checking accounts, mortgages and brokerage services to 7.7 million customers.
The main theme of the rants - er, posts -- seems to be the concern that ING's brand of low-fee, low-maintenance banking, combined with responsive customer service, would soon be a thing of the past under the new ownership. 
ING became popular offering no frills accounts, a savings account with competitive rates but no minimum balance, for instance, and no monthly fee. Users also especially like a feature that lets them easily establish subsavings accounts for specific purposes, like vacations or taxes, and have money transferred automatically from other accounts.
"TERRIBLE NEWS," said a typical entry, from someone called Red Broad on the Facebook page.
"I've been really happy with ING, but C1 have a horrible reputation for fees and customer support, quite the opposite to ING's business model. I'm really sad to see it go this way. I'm willing to bet that ING will lose at least 50% or more of its account holders due to this takeover. What a shame to see a truly customer oriented bank fall into the hands of a bank with probably the worst customer relations out there. I REALLY DON'T want to change banks, I LOVE my banking experience with ING, I can't see me staying with C1 though so I guess I'll just have to start looking around...sigh..."
And this one, from Steve Bush: "I feel betrayed by a trusted friend. What a shame."
Many of the posts used language that can't be used in a newspaper, although a few optimistic comments dismissed the predictions of banking apocalypse. "A lot of you people seem to be taking this a little too hard," said Matt Cannon on Facebook. "No one has any idea yet what's going to happen, but I severely doubt ING Direct will see any significant change in the way they do business, no need to run for the hills yet."
We here at Bucks wondered if this outpouring of emotion gave the folks at Capital One pause, so we asked them some questions that seem to be on customers' minds. The bank declined to provide "yes or no" answers to queries about specific changes, saying it was too soon to do so. But the spokeswoman Tatiana Stead did offer the following responses via e-mail.
To us, it looks like they're at least leaving open the option of adding fees and minimum balances and subsuming the ING Direct brand altogether. Do you feel reassured by the responses below?
Q: Why are customers of ING so upset about the sale of their bank to Capital One?
ING has developed a unique connection with its customers. There are millions of "happy savers" across the country who are incredibly loyal and value their relationship with ING. We truly appreciate that, and we intend to do everything we can to maintain that trust and their enthusiasm.
We deeply understand and respect the value and the loyalty ING has created. Together with the ING team, we have the capabilities and insights to sustain and build the power of that franchise to better serve customers and create great value for our shareholders and associates.
Q: What changes are you planning to make to ING Direct's account offerings? Will subaccounts for specific savings goals remain?
We have no plans to make any significant changes. ING customers should expect the same great customer experience and the "status quo" from ING for the foreseeable future.
Q. Are you planning any new fees or minimum balance requirements?
ING Direct has built a large and valuable franchise of engaged customers by focusing on a few simple proconsumer products. We deeply understand the value of the loyalty and advocacy ING Direct has been able to build with its customers. Everything we do as we integrate our businesses will be thoughtful and surefooted with a focus on sustaining and building that customer loyalty. We will focus on the customers, channels, products, and pricing strategies that build the best long-term customer relationships and deliver the best cost of funds.
Q: Does the reaction suggest Capital One might need to enhance customer service? How might this be done?
ING was a pioneer in direct banking and has built an incredibly successful, customer-centric model focused on building and sustaining long-term relationships. One of our primary objectives will be to ensure that we sustain and, where we can, enhance the exceptional customer experience ING delivers today. We want to reassure the current customers of ING Direct that the great products and experience they've come to expect will continue and, in fact, expand over time.
Q. Will ING Direct be operated separately or integrated into Capital One's operations?
ING Direct and Capital One share a heritage of innovation, a strong focus on building customer franchise and an unwavering commitment to find, empower and unleash extremely talented people. We have been impressed with the management team of ING Direct and what they have accomplished.
As I am sure you will appreciate, over the upcoming weeks we want to get to know ING Direct's management team and associates even better as we determine how best to organize to deliver the customer experience as well as the financial and strategic results we have been discussing.
Capital One will work closely with the leadership team at ING Direct team to establish a management structure designed to ensure that the combined company achieves the highest quality integration and has the best leadership in place to carry on and build upon ING Direct's great customer franchise.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Reaches Deal With Union to Avert Layoffs

BYLINE: NICHOLAS CONFESSORE


HIGHLIGHT: The state's biggest public employee union agreed to accept no pay raise for the first three years of a five-year contract, as well as furloughs.

 BODY:
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has reached a deal with the state's largest public employee union that would avert the impending layoff of thousands of New York state workers, union officials announced on Wednesday.
Under the agreement, state workers represented by the union, the Civil Services Employees Association, would get no pay raise this year or in the next two years. They would also accept a five-day unpaid furlough this year and a four-day unpaid furlough next year. And thousands of state workers would begin to pay a bigger share of their health insurance premiums, reducing costs to the state. 
State workers would get 2 percent wage increases in the fourth and fifth years of the five-year contract agreement, and lump-sum bonuses in the third and fourth years that will not increase their base pay. 
The deal must be approved by the state Legislature and ratified by the union's rank-and-file membership.
"These are not ordinary times, and CSEA and the Cuomo administration have worked very hard at the bargaining table to produce an agreement that balances shared sacrifice with fairness and respect," said Danny Donohue, the union's president. 
Mr. Donohue had harshly criticized Mr. Cuomo in recent months for threatening to lay off close to 10,000 workers to meet his goal of cutting $450 million from the state's operating budget this year.
In a statement released by the union, Mr. Cuomo said: "I commend the union and its leadershipfor making a significant contribution to help get the state's fiscal house in order and making the sharedsacrifices these difficult times require. Working together, we will turn this state around and get our economy moving once again."

HEADLINE: A Hybrid for His Holiness? 'No Comment,' Says Mercedes-Benz

BYLINE: PAUL STENQUIST


HIGHLIGHT: The German automaker refused to confirm reports that the next vehicle used to transport Pope Benedict XVI during papal visits will be a plug-in hybrid based on the M-Class S.U.V.

 BODY:
Pope Benedict XVI will soon go green, if not as green as he may have liked.
The Vatican reportedly will replace the current popemobile, based on the Mercedes-Benz M-Class, with a plug-in hybrid also based on the M-Class platform. As such, and contrary to the pope's original wishes, the vehicle will not draw energy from celestial bodies.
Instead, the vehicle's powertrain is said to be similar to that of the Mercedes Vision S500 plug-in hybrid concept shown at the 2009 Frankfurt auto show, which was powered by a 10-kWh lithium-ion battery pack, a 60-horsepower electric motor and a V-6 gasoline engine. In Frankfurt, Mercedes claimed the Vision would have a range of up to 18.5 miles on electric power alone.
Asked to confirm the reports, Dan Barile, a Mercedes-Benz spokesman, said that it was against company policy to comment on special vehicle orders, real or otherwise.
While popes once traveled in the open, the effort to assassinate Pope John Paul II in 1981 led to the development of more secure vehicles.
The current papal ride prominently features a tall cabin with large windows of bulletproof glass through which the pope can see and be seen. The pope enters the vehicle at ground level and a hydraulic lift raises him into the cabin.
While early pontiffs were transported like royalty on a sedan chair carried on the shoulders of attendants, contemporary leaders of the Roman Catholic Church have traveled in a wide range of specially built automobiles. Among them were Lincolns similar to those built for American presidents and a massive Mercedes-Benz 600.
A plug-in hybrid popemobile undoubtedly would return better fuel economy than any of the pope's recent vehicles, but that sedan chair still would take the prize for green transportation.

HEADLINE: On Gore's Climate and Obama Complaints

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: The missing links in Al Gore's rebuke of Obama and attacks on climate naysayers.

 BODY:
8:33 p.m. | Updated Former Vice President Al Gore has swung back into the climate debate with a 7,000-word essay in Rolling Stone under the headline, "Climate of Denial- Can science and the truth withstand the merchants of poison?"
The piece, primarily a full-bore assault on ideologues and special interests doling out climate disinformation, contains some valuable lines, including:We ignored reality in the marketplace and nearly destroyed the world economic system. We are likewise ignoring reality in the environment, and the consequences could be several orders of magnitude worse. Determining what is real can be a challenge in our culture, but in order to make wise choices in the presence of such grave risks, we must use common sense and the rule of reason in coming to an agreement on what is true.It's getting attention this morning mainly for Gore's direct criticism of President Obama. He acknowledges that Obama has had to deal with a host of profoundly challenging issues, but adds:President Obama has never presented to the American people the magnitude of the climate crisis. He has simply not made the case for action. He has not defended the science against the ongoing, withering and dishonest attacks. Nor has he provided a presidential venue for the scientific community - including our own National Academy - to bring the reality of the science before the public.I agree with him on this. (Read on for more on on my views of Obama's climate choices.) But I find Gore's essay mostly a rehashed and padded sermon to the converted, with heaps of boilerplate on the science and information wars and very little beyond a plea to Obama to ignore political realities and return climate to his to-do list and a tired invocation to concerned Americans to "reduce energy use," "join an organization," "contact your local newspapers" and the like.
There's not a single mention of the profound need to bolster the intellectual infrastructure this country would need if it is both to grasp the nature of the entwined climate and energy challenges and to address them in a sustained way.
The piece retreads old arguments implying that if the disinformation on this tough issue were swept away (along with bad media habits), some kind of magical consensus would emerge. That's a fundamental misreading of a lot of social science, at least to my eye. There are inconvenient truths, yes. But we also have "An Inconvenient Mind." 
The piece falls into the partisan trap of painting all opponents in one color when in fact there are conservatives who care about science and energy, even some (Charles Krauthammer comes to mind) who -- while challenging the portrayal of global warming as a real-time crisis -- see the value in a high tax on gasoline, swapped for lower taxes elsewhere.
Considering both the gaps in Gore's essay and his criticisms of Obama, it's worth revisiting two pieces I wrote in January. The first, written on the night of the State of the Union Address, was titled "Obama Ducks and Covers on Climate." Here's the opening thought:The "C-word," climate, appears to have become to the Beltway what the "P-word," population, has been in climate treaty negotiations for a long time - unmentionable.
It's one thing to cave to a wave of naysaying climate rhetoric and build a new American energy conversation on points of agreement rather than clear ideological flash points like global warming.
It's another to duck and cover entirely on climate.... At a Washington meeting last spring [2010] on adapting to climate change, Obama's science adviser, John Holdren, said that he expected "a major speech" on climate from Obama down the line. This year, if the president doesn't engage with voters on America's Climate Choices, his campaign pledge to have science treated with integrity will appear awfully hollow.A second relevant post -- "It's Your Obama 'Moment.' What Do You Say?" -- was written just before the speech and laid out my suggested strategy for the president on energy and climate, while also leading to a followup piece rounding up suggestions of a variety of thinkers and doers focused on energy.
What's your take on next steps for this president, and/or whoever might follow him, on energy and climate?

HEADLINE: Welcome to Silicon Valley, Larry Summers

BYLINE: EVELYN M. RUSLI


HIGHLIGHT: In the latest Silicon Valley-Washington pairing, Lawrence Summers, the former Treasury secretary, has joined the board of Square, a technology start-up.

 BODY:
J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press and Jin Lee/Bloomberg News Lawrence H. Summers, left, and Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Square.
In the latest pairing of Silicon Valley and Washington, Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary and chief economic adviser to President Obama, has joined the board of Square, a technology start-up.
"We are proud to have Larry join our board and we welcome his insight and decades of leadership to our growing company," Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Square, said in a statement. "Square is at a key point in our trajectory and we know Larry will contribute tremendous wisdom and expertise toward our continued success."
 It's a notable addition for Square, a rising mobile payments company based in San Francisco that facilitates credit card transactions on mobile devices. Square, which is said to be in the middle of a fund-raising round that would value the company at more than $1 billion, is best known for its roster of technology power players. Besides Mr. Dorsey, who co-founded Twitter, Square is also led by its chief operating officer, Keith Rabois, a prominent angel investor and early employee of PayPal and LinkedIn. Its board includes Vinod Khosla, a co-founder of Sun Microsystems and a clean-technology venture capitalist, and Roelof Botha, a partner at Sequoia Capital. 
In contrast, Mr. Summers is a D.C. veteran. 
A former president of Harvard, Mr. Summers served in both the Clinton and Obama administrations. He joined the National Economic Council in 2009 and most recently served as President Obama's chief economic adviser. His ties to Capitol Hill and the White House could be a major asset for Square, which is operating in the fast-evolving world of mobile payments. The market -- which is currently a jumble of start-ups, technology giants and traditional financial institutions -- could face more scrutiny as it grows since it is under the umbrella of the oft-regulated financial services industry. 
The appointment comes as other technology start-ups try to strengthen their political ties. Last month, Facebook hired Joel Kaplan, a former member of President George W. Bush's White House staff, to lead its Washington office. Other notable political insiders at Facebook include its general counsel, Ted Ullyot, a former clerk for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, and its chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, a former chief of staff to Mr. Summers when he was Treasury secretary.

HEADLINE: The Huntsman Candidacy

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: The needle the former Utah governor needs to thread.

 BODY:
Can a moderate Republican win the G.O.P. nomination? That's the question everyone's asking with regard to Jon Huntsman, who formally announced his candidacy yesterday, and the answer is a resounding yes. From George H.W. Bush and Bob Dole through George W. Bush and John McCain, the modern-day Republican Party has a long tradition of picking nominees whose records and positions place them to the left of True Conservatism, at least as defined by movement institutions, talk radio and the like. Even in the age of the Tea Party, there's reason to imagine this pattern persisting: Many Republican primary voters hold heterodox positions (for instance, on tax increases on the rich) relative to the official conservative line, several of the crucial early primaries allow independents to cross over and vote, and in races against incumbent presidents there's a high premium on electability. It's certainly possible for a Republican to be too liberal for the primary electorate, and often a moderate candidate has to flip-flop on a key issue (or six) to appease the party's interest groups. But still, the historical record suggests that there's more room between Rush Limbaugh and the center than many commentators (and politicians) seem to think.
But note that most of the winning moderates I just listed came into their races as frontrunners, with massive establishment support. Huntsman doesn't have that kind of frontrunner status, which means that the real question for his candidacy is slightly different: Not whether a moderate Republican can win, but whether a moderate can win as an insurgent. This is a trickier case, but here too there's a model: The McCain campaign in 2008, which crashed and burned early and then turned into a come-from-behind affair, in which a man the base mistrusted on almost every issue nonetheless emerged victorious at the end of a long drawn-out slugfest. And sure enough, Huntsman seems to be following the McCain '08 playbook, hoping to upset Mitt Romney in New Hampshire, eke out a win in South Carolina, and then ride the momentum from those wins all the way to the nomination.
But there's a further wrinkle, which is that the Mitt Romney of 2012 has a very different profile than the Romney of 2008. In '08, Romney labored - with some success - to brand himself as Mr. Conservative, and woo movement voices and institutions to his banner. After "Obamneycare," though, that path to the nomination has been closed, and this time around Romney seems to be running a campaign premised on competence rather than ideology, positioning himself as the heir to George H.W. Bush, Bob Dole, and all the other moderate Republicans who held off populist challengers on their way to the convention. In other words, Huntsman doesn't just have to thread the moderate-as-insurgent needle, he has to do it against a moderate frontrunner whose profile - competence, business experience, Mormonism - is remarkably similar to his own. If Romney were still the candidate of talk radio and Jim DeMint, Huntsman might be able to outflank him in states like New Hampshire by positioning himself as the more electable and more independent-minded candidate. But as it stands, it isn't clear how a rich handsome well-coiffed Mormon RINO distinguishes himself from the more famous, better-funded rich handsome well-coiffed Mormon RINO who's currently leading in the polls. (Maybe his anti-interventionist positioning will do the trick, but in a domestic-oriented campaign season, that seems somewhat unlikely ...)
This may explain why the former Utah governor has spent the last few weeks staking out unexpectedly (and somewhat implausibly) right-wing positions on economic issues, explicitly endorsing the Ryan budget and (alas!) embracing the balanced-budget amendment boondoggle. He's trying to get to Romney's right, because that's the only place he sees real domestic-policy running room. But while that running room exists, it's by no means clear that Huntsman of all people is the right guy to make that move work - especially since he risks alienating his natural constituency in the process. And if the question the Huntsman campaign is testing is "can a moderate Republican win the nomination by rebranding himself as the 'true conservative' insurgent in a race against a moderate frontrunner," I suspect that the answer is no.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington.

 BODY:
Today's Times
 Bridges for Kandahar or for Kansas City? That will be the subtext tonight when President Obama addresses the nation about his plans for withdrawing American troops from Afghanistan. The Times's Helene Cooper reports that, as Mr. Obama begins trying to untangle the the United States from its military and civilian promises in Afghanistan, his critics and allies alike are drawing a direct line between what is not being spent to bolster the sagging economy in America to what is being spent in Afghanistan - $120 billion this year alone. For the rest of June, presidential candidates are chasing donors, not voters, particularly in the unsettled Republican race. The Times's Jeff Zeleny reports on the cutthroat, coast-to-coast scramble to court top donors and lock them in before rivals can. The Times's Sheryl Gay Stolberg went to Stillwater, Minn., to explore how a stay-at-home mother and onetime federal tax lawyer became Representative Michele Bachmann, the staunch fiscal conservative and brash Tea Party leader who is now seeking the Republican nomination for president. Ms. Stolberg reports that Ms. Bachmann's disenchantment with the public school system led to an interest in politics, but that her role as mother to both her biological and foster children is what spurred her to seek public office. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, chastised members of his party on Tuesday for seeking to end American involvement in the NATO-led mission in Libya. Mr. McCain, along with Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, introduced legislation on Tuesday that would offer Mr. Obama official Congressional authorization of the Libyan operations. The Times's Jennifer Steinhauer explains why the move, an effort to blunt House measures seeking to cut off financing for the Libya operation, exposes the unusual foreign policy divide within the Republican Party. Jon M. Huntsman Jr., officially beginning his candidacy for the White House on Tuesday, told a crowd of supporters that he would be a better leader than his former boss, Mr. Obama. The Times's Jim Rutenberg, on hand for Mr. Huntsman's announcement at Liberty State Park in New Jersey, lays out the challenges facing Mr. Huntsman as he seeks the Republican nomination.
Happenings Around Washington
The big news, of course, is the president's speech at 8 p.m. But earlier in the day, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will push ahead in his budget negotiations with a bipartisan group of lawmakers. Representatives Donna Edwards, Democrat of Maryland, and Leonard Lance, Republican of New Jersey, will host a ceremony in the Capitol to honor the winners of this year's Congressional Art Competition.

HEADLINE: 2012 Republicans Respond to Obama Speech

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Some of the leading Republican presidential candidates offered dramatically different reactions to President Obama's announcement of troop reductions in Afghanistan.

 BODY:
Some of the leading Republican presidential candidates offered dramatically different reactions to President Obama's announcement of troop reductions in Afghanistan, a reflection of the schism in the Republican Party over the future of the war.
Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, issued a sharp rebuke of the president's proposal to withdraw 10,000 troops immediately and the remaining 20,000 troops from the 2009 "surge" within a year. In a statement, Mr. Pawlenty called the speech "deeply concerning."
"Look how he phrased the outcome of this war," Mr. Pawlenty said on "The O'Reilly Factor." "He said we need to end the war, quote unquote, responsibly. When America goes to war, America needs to win. We need to close out the war successfully, and what that means now is not nation-building. What it means is to follow General Petraeus's advice and to get those security forces built up where they can pick up the slack as we draw down." 
Mr. Pawlenty has staked out the most hawkish position of the major presidential candidates. Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former governor of Utah, has chosen the other side, having said this week that the United States should "move on" from the decade long war in Afghanistan.
In a statement after Mr. Obama's speech, Mr. Huntsman said that "now it is time we move to a focused counterterror effort, which requires significantly fewer boots on the ground than the president discussed tonight. We need a safe but rapid withdrawal which encourages Afghans to assume responsibility."
Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, is somewhere in the middle. In a statement, Mr. Romney said that "we all want our troops to come home as soon as possible," but he stopped short of praising Mr. Obama's speech.
"We shouldn't adhere to an arbitrary timetable on the withdrawal of our troops from Afghanistan," Mr. Romney said. "This decision should not be based on politics or economics. America's brave men and women in uniform have fought to achieve significant progress in Afghanistan, some having paid the ultimate price. I look forward to hearing the testimony of our military commanders in the days ahead."

HEADLINE: Need a Six-Pack? Hit the Basement

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLL

 BODY:
OAKTON, Va.
TIM ARTZ'S brewery is enclosed by glass walls on three sides and looks out onto a bluff of apple trees and a garden filled with beans, squash and 35 varieties of pepper. On a raw April morning, the brewery doors were open but the brewery itself was warm; the gas burner below the 30-gallon brew tank was cranking at near full power.
Mr. Artz was already a good 90 minutes into his brew day; the grain was milled and the hops were measured and waiting on a nearby table. It was just the moment for his wife to emerge from the house and ask if he and his guests would like a fresh mug of coffee.
Mr. Artz, 48, is just a home brewer, not a professional; his main job is director of information technology at a health care firm. But with the elaborate set-up he has built and installed in his Florida room (there is a big cask for holding mash and an $1,800 fermentation tank, in addition to the 30-gallon kettle), he could easily be mistaken for much more than an amateur. 
Home brewing, which was rendered illegal by Prohibition and not legalized again until 1979, is enjoying a resurgence. The American Homebrewers Association, based in Boulder, Colo., had just 11,724 members in 2006; that has since more than doubled, to 26,000. This increased interest, in turn, has fostered a mini-boom in brewing equipment, according to Gary Glass, who is the director of the association. ''Home-brew supply shops reported a growth of 16 percent in gross revenue, according to 2009 numbers,'' Mr. Glass said, referring to the change from the prior year. The numbers for 2010 are not yet available, he added, but he anticipates double-digit growth once again.
This increase has been aided by the rise of social clubs, books and competitions geared to home brewers, as well as by the success of microbreweries over the last two decades, which has inspired many amateur beermakers. The D.I.Y. and locavore movements have played a role, too. ''There is a trend to do things more locally,'' Mr. Glass said. ''You don't get any more local than doing it at home.''
Even the recession did not slow things, Mr. Glass added. ''Part of the theory,'' he said, ''is that people have more time for hobbies when they are unemployed or underemployed.''
In a way, the revival recalls America's roots. The Pilgrims are said to have landed at Plymouth Rock rather than continue on to Virginia, because they had run out of beer and wanted a fresh supply. Many founding fathers brewed ales on their farms. (George Washington's recipe for a porter brewed with molasses, recently recreated by a Brooklyn brewer, has been commercially produced by the Shmaltz Brewing Company.) Even the Obamas have joined in; they served an ale brewed at the White House and flavored with honey from the beehives there at their Super Bowl party this year.
For many people, home brewing summons visions of beat-up equipment that is stashed in a corner of a garage, dragged out only occasionally, powered by modest propane tanks normally attached to the barbecue and yielding just a few gallons. (Professional breweries measure output by the barrel -- roughly 31 gallons each.)
But as the ranks of amateur brewers grow, more of them are like the Artz family, people with high-end equipment who brew lots of beer and have a dedicated brewing space in their homes.
''When we looked at the house and walked into the room, we both knew this is where the brewery would be,'' said Dot Artz, who occasionally brews with her husband but on that April day was growing crystals in the kitchen with the couple's 8-year-old son, Ben. (A true D.I.Y. family, they also forage for mushrooms, make their own soap, keep four beehives and smoke meat on a large smoker made out of a cleaned and repurposed oil drum.) The Artz family has also made substantial outlays for their pastime. Mr. Artz rolled his eyes and grinned mischievously when asked how much he has spent on brewing over the years. ''A lot,'' he said. ''It is definitely not a cheap hobby.''
Some home brewers who invest heavily harbor ambitions of one day opening a professional brewery (as amateurs they cannot legally sell their wares). But other big spenders have no grand business plans; they equate brewing to activities like golf: a pastime that is a labor of love, exploration, trial and error, frustration and, finally, pride, when the water, malt, hops and yeast combine just right to pour a perfect pint.
For these dedicated hobbyists who are willing to spend money, said Mr. Glass, beer equipment manufacturers, like Sabco, of Toledo, Ohio, and More Beer, of Concord, Calif., are now making high-end commercial-grade products for home use.
''It is still the exception, not the rule,'' said Mr. Glass, who is emphatically not one of the high-end hobbyists. He brews about six times a year, and does so on a Frankenstein system, an affectionate term used by home brewers to describe a mishmash of equipment that is not pretty, but gets the job done.
But the president of Sabco, Bob Sulier, believes the number of high-end brewers is growing. In the past, the company's Brew Magic system -- their $6,000 flagship -- was sold primarily to professional brewers, he said, but now many are being bought by home brewers or home-brew groups. In 2010, the company sold about one Brew Magic system a day, he added.
''We cater to the higher end of the group, the advanced home brewers,'' Mr. Sulier said. ''For many, this is the next logical step. They are willing to drop a dollar.''
For many, the hobby began in college. Some wanted to drink well for less money and others were inspired by ''starter'' products like Mr. Beer kits, plastic barrels costing about $40 that have pre-measured ingredients and simple instructions and yield about two gallons of beer.
But like many pastimes, home brewing can grow addictive -- and become more expensive.
Kal Wallner, a 41-year-old electrical engineer from Ottawa, said he spent about $5,000 on an all-electric brewery (most are gas-fed) that he installed in a basement room underneath his front porch steps. His goal was ambitious: a system that, ''when you walked in, people would immediately think of a real brewery.''
Currently, Mr. Wallner's brewery is in storage waiting for a move to the family's new home. When he moves there next month, he will have more space for his brewery and plans to install floor drains, completely tile the room and add some new equipment.
''It is a lot of work,'' he said, ''but worth it.''
Bryan Rabe, a 31-year-old municipal worker from Albertville, Minn., agrees. Mr. Rabe, who is married and has a year-old daughter, installed a 20-gallon system in a small basement room that once held his heating and air-conditioning system and water heater. He designed the system, just 36 inches wide, to fit into this challengingly small space; much of it is automated and is run from a panel that resembles a microwave and is built into the wall.
Mr. Rabe, who tends to favor light American lagers and some German lagers, stores his finished product in a refrigerated room next to the brewery; that cooling room feeds directly to four taps in the wall of his basement bar. The brewery is just one of many caverns in his man cave, which also includes a game room, a home theater and a wet bar.
''You can go downstairs, and you can pretty much stay there,'' Mr. Rabe said. ''Only thing it doesn't have is a bed.''
Sometimes, even a basement bar is not enough for a home brewer. Christopher Bowen built a pub to go along with his 10-gallon brewery, both in an 800-square-foot shed on waterfront property in Bethlehem, Pa., that also holds a cottage he owns with his sister and a friend. Mr. Bowen, a 44-year-old financial planner and father of three, calls the shed the HammerSmith Brewery and Alehouse. Inside it resembles a British pub, complete with 24 lidded 20-ounce beer steins reserved for regular visitors.
Mr. Bowen, who favors making ales and long-forgotten beers, first ventured into home brewing seven years ago, when he stopped into a local supply shop to get a birthday present for a friend and left with $300 of brewing equipment for himself.
Soon, he was entering competitions and in 2007 won a gold medal at the 30-year-old Great American Beer Festival, the nation's largest beer gathering, held annually in Denver. Most Saturday mornings, he can be found brewing in the shed; he also plays the role of a brewer in local historical reenactments and is popular on the home-brewing lecture circuit.
The competition Mr. Bowen won is just one of the hundreds of competitions worldwide each year. Even professional breweries give home brews a shot at stardom. In the annual Longshot contest held by the Boston Beer Company, makers of Samuel Adams beers, home brewers send in recipes; the two winners have their beers brewed, bottled (with their likenesses on the label) and distributed to a national audience.
Mr. Bowen's home pub has televisions, comfortable seating, a dartboard and a cellar filled with whiskey and wine barrels used for aging beer. Everything a beer lover needs -- almost.
''We just don't have a bathroom,'' Mr. Bowen said. ''But we are in pretty secluded area, or the cottage is just 20 steps away if needed.''
Cloning A Favorite
HERE is a neat party trick some home brewers play. They offer their friends, say, a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, and see if they catch on that it came not from a bottle but from a home recipe.
Such beers are known as clone brews, and there are books, Web sites and online forums dedicated to the art of deconstructing the commercially sold beers they mimic. Following recipes that are often provided by breweries themselves, interested brewers can whip up favorites like Samuel Adams Boston Lager or New Belgium Fat Tire Amber Ale.
''Commercial beers serve as a common language,'' said Randy Mosher, a Chicago-based beer consultant and author of ''Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales and World-Altering Meditations in a Glass.'' ''It's a place where home brewers can understand taste familiarity.''
To learn how to brew your favorite commercial beer, like Guinness, Bass Ale and Chimay Red, pick up a copy of ''Clone Brews: Homebrew Recipes for 150 Commercial Beers,'' by Tess and Mark Szamatulski, a husband and wife who own a home-brewing supply shop in Connecticut. Also, Web sites like HomeBrewTalk.com and tastybrew.com offer user-submitted recipes for commercial as well as original beers in their forum sections.
In formulating clone beers, which can be made with even a rudimentary brewing system like the $40 Mr. Beer kit, the home brewer will see, taste and smell each ingredient individually. ''The goal should be to tear apart the beer you are drinking to understand it,'' Mr. Mosher said.
Once home brewers have successfully mimicked a recipe, they can begin a process that Mr. Mosher calls ''wandering in the wilderness'' -- inventing his own recipes.
''I see brewing as an art form,'' Mr. Mosher said. ''You can sit in a museum and copy paintings, but eventually you want to find your own voice.''

HEADLINE: Nothing but Blue Skies for a Fake Harvard Law Grad

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
''Suits,'' a new legal series beginning on Thursday on USA, erupts from a Mount Vesuvius of absurdities, and yet like so much else in the USA stable, it comes in relatively good faith -- not merely with a snappy sense of its own fun, but also with a chipper belief in the viability of renewal. The channel seems to have a mandate to uplift the national mood, to appeal to the fantasy of second chances and sexy opportunities. On a USA series there are no dank unemployment offices, no cups of weak coffee, only high floors, soaring views and crisp French roasts.
Forged seemingly on creative autopilot, these shows typically feature well-meaning guys in a bad way getting a shot at professional reinvention, one in which they are guaranteed never to be subjected to anything but the comeliest female work force. On ''Burn Notice'' a former spook disenfranchised by the government rectifies injustices for the criminally exploited of Miami; on ''White Collar,'' a high-I.Q. con man is rescued from a prison sentence and sent to work nailing thieves and forgers for the feds; on ''Royal Pains,'' a fired emergency room physician finds employment as a concierge doctor on the East End of Long Island, conveniently right around Memorial Day. 
Gleaming sunlight is as much a character on these series as the actual spies and cops and healers. As if in receipt of an order from the Federal Communications Commission prohibiting inclemency, the standard USA series does not depict rain.
''Suits'' follows the formula meticulously, with bright skies, floor-to-ceiling windows and a brilliant, bungling autodidact who, having never finished college, lands a job as a summer associate at a glitzy Manhattan law firm. The underachiever in question is the boyishly forlorn-looking Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams). Orphaned and raised by his grandmother, he ekes out a living by taking the LSATs for people who couldn't solve a logic problem if they had been tutored by Socrates.
I will spare you the precise and preposterous details of how Ross becomes a protege of the hotshot womanizing litigator Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht), but suffice it to say that Ross is the kind of guy who seems to have the capacity to recite American case law the way that 10-year-olds can quote passages of ''Harry Potter.'' Ross took the New York bar exam on a bet and passed.
The only sticking point to his employment is that Ross must pretend that he attended Harvard Law School, a deceit that we are meant to believe that he can pull off, even though nearly every other lawyer at the firm is a graduate. ''Suits'' makes enough fun of Harvard, and the cliche of the climbing drone it produces, that Yale alumni might want to consider viewing parties.
Though the series begins amusingly enough, it quickly descends into cloying buddy escapade, in which the full-of-heart slacker seeks to teach his careerist boss how to care, and the careerist boss teaches his moldable young thing about cunning and diligence and clothes that cost a mortgage payment. ''Suits'' carries the banner of populism and wears the wardrobe of the elites.

HEADLINE: Albany Mulls Altering Way State Permits Power Plants

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Utility customers would be able to pay off the cost of making their homes more energy efficient through charges on their monthly electric bills and the process of getting permits for new power plants would be streamlined under a bill that state lawmakers in Albany were expected to pass on Wednesday night.
The bill would revive procedures for locating power plants that were in effect until 2003. Since then, representatives from some areas, including parts of the Bronx, and Astoria and Long Island City in Queens, have opposed renewing the rules because they feared the rules would allow a greater concentration of power plants that would add to air pollution. 
Supporters of a renewal argued that the high cost of electricity in the state was in part because construction of power-generating plants had come to a near-standstill in the last eight years. The divide could not be bridged until Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo pressed for a compromise that assuaged some of the concerns about the environmental impact and included the consumer loan repayment option, which the Working Families Party had championed.
Senator Michael N. Gianaris, a Democrat from Queens, said before the vote that the proposal appeared to be ''a very good siting bill that will facilitate more construction but also do it in a way that is mindful of overburdened communities and the environment.''
Mr. Gianaris, whose district includes a waterfront area that contains six power plants, had opposed a blanket renewal of the old rules, which exempted plants that generated no more than 80 megawatts from the statewide approval process.
He said the weak economy and shortage of financing, not the lack of a fast track for permitting, had been the primary hindrance to construction of new plants. But Arthur Kremer, a former assemblyman who lobbied for the renewal of the law, disagreed. ''There's nothing major being considered anywhere in the state because there's no siting law,'' Mr. Kremer said.
The bills introduced in the Senate and Assembly on Wednesday, as the legislative session drew to a close, created a new, more environmentally friendly fast track than the previous law, lowering that threshold to 25 megawatts and setting a six-month deadline for review of applications to modify or restart existing plants if the amount of pollution they emit would be reduced. The reviews would be conducted by a state board with representatives from several agencies and some public members that would supersede local permitting agencies.
The loan-repayment proposal, known as on-bill recovery, was written to help consumers who cannot afford to have their homes or businesses retrofitted to reduce energy consumption. Utilities would lend those customers the money for the work, and their savings on future bills would be used to repay the loans. The limits would be $13,000 for residences and $26,000 for businesses, at interest rates to be decided.
That program is expected to create so-called green jobs by stimulating investment in energy-saving devices and home improvements. In 2009, the state enacted a law known as Green Jobs/Green New York that was supposed to create the equivalent of more than 14,000 full-time jobs and reduce pollution by making one million homes and buildings more energy-efficient. The proposed law is seen by its proponents as a critical conduit to achieving those goals.
''This is a simple and creative solution to intertwined problems of climate change, joblessness and economic stagnation,'' said Dave Palmer, executive director of the Center for Working Families. which helped devise the program. ''It puts New York at the forefront of national efforts for a green economic recovery. We are the first state to implement on-bill financing on a statewide basis and to mandate utility participation.''

HEADLINE: In History's Lost and Found, One Soldier's Watch

BYLINE: By AUSTIN CONSIDINE

 BODY:
ON April 29, 1945, Allied captives at Stalag VII A, a prisoner-of-war camp in southeast Germany, heard the rumbling of artillery in the distance. Lt. Charles B. Woehrle, 28, of the United States Army Air Forces, peered though the barbed wire fence to the town of Moosburg in the Isar River valley below. Plumes of white smoke rose above the village.
Gaunt, unwashed and lice-ridden, Lieutenant Woehrle checked the new Patek Philippe watch on his wrist and noted the time. The watch was stainless steel -- an uncommon luxury at the time -- with a hand-stitched alligator strap.
From the camp's position in the foothills of the Alps, Lieutenant Woehrle and his fellow prisoners watched as men from Gen. George S. Patton's Third Army lowered the Nazi flag above the town square and raised an American flag in its place. Using the shorthand he had learned in college -- indecipherable to his captors -- the lieutenant scrawled some notes on the back of an envelope containing a letter from his mother, all the while referring back to the watch. 
''American flag raised over Moosburg at 12:40,'' he wrote. ''At gate U.S. flag was raised at 1:03,'' he scribbled. Later: ''Sherman tank enters compound at 2:04.''
General Patton was just behind, donning his iconic ivory-handled pistols and riding trousers. Prisoners cheered, wept and swarmed the tanks.
The following month, the lieutenant planted his first footsteps back on home soil in New York City, the same watch ticking on his wrist.
German captors, forced marches and a prison barter economy that could have fetched anything for that watch -- perhaps even his freedom -- had not separated him from his Patek Philippe. But decades later, a burglar in St. Paul did.
Call it a homecoming, or perhaps the best story of brand loyalty ever told. When Mr. Woehrle, now 94, arrived in New York again last week, this time to receive a replacement for his beloved watch, it was just the latest improbable twist in an Odyssean saga that has bound war prisoner to watchmaker for 67 years.
By the summer of 1944, Lieutenant Woehrle had been a prisoner at Stalag Luft III (later made famous by the 1963 film ''The Great Escape'') for more than a year. A bombardier aboard a B-17 Flying Fortress, he had already beaten some incredible odds. His plane was shot down by German flak the previous May over the Bay of Biscay. Four of his crew members were killed when a group of Focke Wulf 190 fighters strafed the burning plane. A faulty parachute fractured his jaw and dislocated his shoulder.
Compared with the Gestapo camp where he was interrogated, Stalag Luft III, in what is now western Poland, could have been much worse. Most prison camps were. But Stalag Luft III, for aviator officers only, was run by the Luftwaffe, and its administrators generally treated captives with the respect common among airmen.
Still, it was a prison. Despite the Red Cross packages, the men were always hungry. Lieutenant Woehrle lost 30 pounds. Young men who once talked about pinup girls instead fantasized about favorite recipes.
Around that time, Lieutenant Woehrle came across a Patek Philippe advertisement. He had given his old watch to a camp chaplain, who he decided needed it more than he did.
''I knew that they were expensive because Patek Philippe was a name I had seen in Harper's Bazaar or Esquire,'' he said. He knew it was a long shot, but he tore out an order form anyway, and mailed it with a note promising to pay the watchmaker once he was freed.
Months passed; he forgot about the watch. To his surprise, one day it arrived. Camp administrators were reluctant to give it to him. They feared he might use it to bribe a guard. They relented when a ranking American colonel promised that the lieutenant would do no such thing.
''It was an electrifying experience for the whole camp,'' Mr. Woehrle said. (Patek Philippe said its Geneva archives reveal no other instance of a watch sold to a prisoner of war.) ''I had lines of fellows out in the hall knocking on my door, waiting to see the watch.''
Dick Schiefelbusch, 92, a retired professor from Lawrence, Kan., remembers the watch. ''It was one of those kind of positive events, one of those things that was talked about,'' Mr. Schiefelbusch said. ''You don't feel quite as lonely -- or as out of it -- if you have something like that happen.''
As the war's end hastened, conditions worsened. On Jan. 27, 1945, the prisoners of Stalag Luft III were informed they had to evacuate overnight. By 11 p.m. they were leading a forced march of the entire camp. Thousands of prisoners marched about 50 miles to the town of Spremberg, Germany, through snow and freezing temperatures. Some died along the way. Then they were packed into windowless boxcars. Three days later Lieutenant Woehrle arrived at Stalag VII A, outside Moosburg -- a much harsher camp than Stalag Luft III. It was a horrendous three months. Men were flea-bitten, starved and could not bathe. ''We just existed in that camp,'' Mr. Woehrle said.
After the war, Mr. Woehrle returned home, opened a film company and paid for his watch. All Patek Philippe wanted was about $300, he said -- a steal even back then. Every four years, he faithfully sent the watch to Geneva for maintenance, until one day in the mid-1970s his home in St. Paul was burglarized. He scoured the local dealers and pawnshops. The watch was gone.
Louise Woehrle, daughter of Mr. Woehrle's late identical twin, Richard, first learned about the watch last August while making a documentary about her uncle, planned for completion this fall.
''My dream since hearing this story was to find a way to replace the watch with another and give it to him as a gift,'' she wrote in an e-mail.
She contacted Patek Philippe in Geneva, which connected her with Larry Pettinelli, president of Patek Philippe U.S.A. She hoped the company could help her locate a replacement. That was harder than Mr. Pettinelli expected. But through private dealers, he and his lead technician found a close match in good condition, a midcentury Calatrava model, slightly larger than the original, with a yellow gold casing. The company did not want to disclose its value.
The Stern family in Geneva, which owns the company, decided to give the watch to Mr. Woehrle as a gift. Last week Mr. Woehrle and his niece flew to New York. At Patek Philippe's office on Thursday, Mr. Pettinelli wore a white glove as he presented the watch to Mr. Woehrle. ''I want your fingerprints to be the first ones on this watch,'' he said.
Eyes glistening, a cry of delight escaped the old veteran's lips: ''Oh! Isn't this lovely, lovely?''
Mr. Pettinelli fastened it to the former prisoner's left wrist. Mr. Woehrle held it proudly aloft.
''When God wants to do something wonderful, it begins with a difficulty,'' he said. ''And if he wants to do something extremely wonderful, it begins with an impossibility.''
Correction: June 30, 2011, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Thursday about an American World War II veteran who received a replacement for the Patek Philippe watch that he had during the war but later lost in a burglary misidentified a German prisoner-of-war camp where he had been held. It was Stalag VII A, not Stalag Luft VII A.

HEADLINE: Budget Office Warns About Debt

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The national debt is on pace to equal the annual size of the economy within a decade, levels that could provoke a European-style crisis unless policymakers take action on the federal deficit, according to a report by the Congressional Budget Office. 
The report, released Wednesday by the nonpartisan agency that calculates the cost and economic impact of legislation and government policy, offers a fresh reminder of what is at stake as Congress considers whether to raise the federal debt ceiling. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is leading discussions aimed at slashing more than $2 trillion from the federal deficit over the coming decade as the price for permitting the government to take on more debt to pay current obligations.
Most ominously, the report warned of a ''sudden fiscal crisis'' in which investors would lose faith in the United States government's ability to manage its fiscal affairs. In such a fiscal panic, investors might abandon United States bonds and force the government to pay unaffordable interest rates.
At that point, it warned, policymakers would have to win back the confidence of the markets by imposing spending cuts and tax increases far more severe than if they were to act now.
The findings are not significantly new, but the budget office's analysis underscores the magnitude of the nation's fiscal problems as negotiators struggle to raise the current $14.3 trillion debt limit and avoid a first-ever default on United States obligations.
With the government now required to borrow more than 40 cents of every dollar it spends, the budget office predicted that without a change of course the national debt would rocket from 69 percent of gross domestic product this year to 109 percent -- the record set in World War II -- by 2023.
Those projections are based on the assumption that tax cuts from the Bush administration are extended and that other current policies, like maintaining doctors' fees under Medicare, are continued as well.

HEADLINE: For SUNY and CUNY, Top Lawmakers Support Plan to Raise Tuition $300 a Year

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
For decades, leaders of the City University of New York and the State University of New York have chafed under the whims of state lawmakers who approved double-digit tuition increases in some years and none in others, leaving administrators struggling to make ends meet with little ability to plan ahead.
But in what some university officials and faculty members are hailing as a major victory, legislative leaders in Albany agreed on Tuesday to a policy that would, for the first time, set a fixed rate for tuition increases: $300 annually for the next five years. In the first year alone, the increase is expected to create an additional $50 million in revenue for CUNY, and $40 million for SUNY. 
''The last thing you want in higher education is large, unexpected increases that families cannot anticipate,'' said Jay Hershenson, senior vice chancellor for university relations at CUNY.
The agreement, which the full Legislature must vote on before it becomes law, would require that all of the money raised from the tuition increases go directly to the universities, according to lawmakers and their aides. In the past, some of the revenue from tuition increases has been used for other state programs. The agreement also calls for state aid to the universities to be maintained at current levels, unless the governor declares a fiscal emergency.
''Across the country, states have been cutting their university systems,'' said Assemblywoman Deborah J. Glick, a Democrat from Manhattan and chairwoman of the Assembly Higher Education Committee. ''I think this will stanch the bleeding and begin the rebuilding of what is two great university systems.''
Ms. Glick said the new policy would promote stability not only in the universities, but also in the surrounding communities. ''This is investing in our human capital,'' she said. ''People who go to SUNY and CUNY overwhelmingly remain in the state.''
The increase would affect 136,084 CUNY undergraduates on 11 campuses, including the City College of New York and Hunter College in Manhattan, as well as 909 students taking online classes, CUNY officials said. The current tuition is $4,830 annually for full-time New York residents.
CUNY last raised tuition, by $230, in January, to help offset a nearly $300 million reduction in state aid since 2008 -- a loss that brought state financing down to about $1 billion annually, according to university officials.
At SUNY, the increase would affect more than 220,000 students at 29 four-year colleges across the state, including campuses at Albany, Binghamton, Buffalo, Old Westbury, Purchase and Stony Brook. The current tuition is $4,970; it was last increased, by $310, in 2009.
SUNY officials have said the additional money would be used to decrease class sizes, hire more full-time faculty and maintain existing classes and programs.
Leaders at CUNY and SUNY said they would seek to help students eligible for state tuition assistance by covering all or part of the increase, based on the amount of aid each person currently receives. But some students worried that a $1,500 increase over five years would put college out of reach for many people.
''I think it's ridiculous,'' said Cory Provost, a recent Brooklyn College graduate who is chairman of CUNY's Student Senate. ''Families and students are in a bind because of the economy, and trying to fix the state budget by forcing students to pay more money isn't going to fix the problem.''
But Kaitlyn Beachner, president of the SUNY Student Assembly, said the unpredictable tuition increases in past years had also been difficult for students. While some students are opposed to any increase, she said, the Student Assembly passed a resolution in 2008 calling for a rational tuition plan that would allow increases of no more than 5.5 percent per year. ''We want students to know freshman year how much they would be paying for their education,'' she said.

HEADLINE: The Theater of an Italian Summer

BYLINE: By GUY TREBAY

 BODY:
MILAN
IT is a too-little-appreciated fact that the Italians do summer better than anyone else in the world. Sure, Americans have cookouts and fireworks, Northern Europeans make their nude tent camps in the dunes, and the French devote themselves with the usual mirthless rigor to organizing perfectly detailed vacances d'ete.
But the Italians, particularly (though not exclusively) those of a certain social and economic stratum, have the advantage. For a start, they inhabit a gorgeous peninsular landmass and string of dependent islands enfolded by a sapphire sea. Also, their history of seafaring trade and conquest has made them at home by the shore.
There is another thing, though: a deeply rooted sense that good living is the point of existence, and few better examples of this cliche that happens also to be a fact can be found than in a recently published book from Rizzoli, ''Hotel Il Pellicano.'' 
A photographic history by three generations of photographers (Slim Aarons, John Swope, Juergen Teller) of a chic 1960s resort tucked into the cliffs along the Tuscan coast in Porto Ercole, ''Hotel Il Pellicano'' mainly depicts a particular set of bronzed and contented Italians, often titled or well-born but certainly far from poor. What makes the book so irresistible is not the aristo name-check: Corsini, Pucci, Borghese, Pignatelli.
It's that the people in the pictures (taken over five decades) seem to possess that confident, offhand chic that only Italians bring to the season, along with an inherent sense of the theater of summer that, one is happy to report, was a notable feature of the men's wear shows here this week.
One highlight of the theme was Massimiliano Giornetti's show for Ferragamo, where the designer, a spotty performer who in the past has lapsed into lugubrious styling and demonstrated a curious color sense, hit stride. Here he was relaxed and assured, his official point of reference the Riviera in the South of France, yet his point of view irrepressibly Italian. In a limited palette of navy, khaki and jade, Mr. Giornetti showed neat blazers in light cottons -- in some cases high-buttoned and double-breasted, in others with flour-sacking stripes at the hem -- voluminous trousers (a growing trend), open-weave cotton fishermen's sweaters and sling-back espadrilles.
Any of the models could easily have walked right off the runway and onto the terrace of Il Pellicano, where a tanned beauty of some sort would be waiting with Negroni in hand.
Similarly, at the Armani and Emporio Armani shows, the designer appeared more at ease than in the recent past -- lighter and better able to settle into what he does best. That is, easy cardigan jackets with molded shoulders, geometric prints so subtle they're close to invisible, full trousers that stop at the ankle and that, when not afflicted with diaper fronts, are neatly proportioned. He also showed his take on the ubiquitous boat shoe.
It is no secret that Giorgio Armani is a sun worshiper, whether on his yacht or at his villa on the volcanic island of Pantelleria. Likewise it's public knowledge that, having recovered from a serious illness, he wants to work less hard and enjoy life more. And that decision showed in the designs.
Nobody will ever accuse Dean and Dan Caten, the Dsquared designers, of failing to get the most out of life. The tiny twins have the feverish energy of certain insects; certainly they appear to use more wing beats per second than the rest of us. They play hard and work harder, and an overlooked accomplishment is how easy they make it seem. Often there are so many elements in a Dsquared show that you have wade through the thematic welter to see what's actually going on. This season they served up super-camp glam rock, beefcake in the Cyclades (never let it be said that the Catens are subtle: MYKONOS was printed across one hairless Adonis's barely clad behind), Scandinavian fishermen and Rome street toughs.
''We always find a lot of lot of stuff to shoot,'' Jim Moore, the creative director of GQ, observed later of the Dsquared show.
It probably takes the skill of a seasoned editor like Mr. Moore to cut past the styling gimmicks and see a collection filled with cool elements like a well-cut jacket with flap cargo pockets, a camouflage anorak in loud colors destined to camouflage nothing and a neatly cut sky blue blazer worn over lemon yellow trousers and red driving shoes. That last outfit was exactly the thing that, in an ideal world, a gentleman might wear for summer travel. That will never happen, of course, as long as sweats and hoodies are the sartorial default of airborne bums.
As at the Bottega Veneta, Burberry, McQueen and Gucci shows, reviewed earlier online, there was a fair amount of assurance going around, and a sense that many of the high-end labels, by gently tweaking core identities, have managed to squeak through the economic downturn.
The slick, stylish and comparatively restrained show of gigolo wear that Roberto Cavalli's son and co-designer, Daniele, presented in the gardens of the Palazzo Serbelloni was both a literal and figurative example of staying true to a brand's DNA.
''At the end of the day, the Italians are about making money,'' said Nick Sullivan, the fashion editor of Esquire, meaning that what is often derided as the commercialism of Italian fashion is most likely its strength. (A glimpse at venerable labels like Lubiam, made by a firm founded in 1911 and still family owned, proves Mr. Sullivan's point. Lubiam's two-button L.B.M. 1911 jacket, minimally tailored, stitched from undyed cloth and then garment-dyed, is probably among the best utility articles of summer clothing a man could own.)
''It's easier to make the commercial interesting than it is to make the weird presentable,'' Mr. Sullivan said.
Weird will always be with us, of course.
''A little something for the Esquire demographic,'' Dan Peres, the editor of Details, remarked to Mr. Sullivan at the Jil Sander show.
He was joking, of course.
THE target demographic for Raf Simons's collection for Jil Sander remains a mystery. What is odd about this is that Mr. Simons exerts a powerful influence on fashion, produces a perfectly wearable commercial collection for the label, and yet strains for effects at a show so full of strange elements and disparate references (handicrafts, high-tech fabric, demented ultraluxe materials -- lacquered eel skin, anyone? -- neck-slung passport folios, pinstriped and pleated jazz dance shorts that looked like something you might wear to the funeral of ''Anything Goes'') that the net effect is elephant-gives-birth-to-mouse. Alas, over years spent looking at his designs, one has yet to detect evidence of a sense of humor. And we can all agree that fashion at the moment could use a few yuks.
Luckily we have Miuccia Prada for that. Prada may not be the only designer who approaches her craft the way John Cage did music, open to the incidental, the accidental and naturally democratic in her refusal to draw distinctions between high and low, beautiful and ugly, bad and good. Yet one can't easily think of anyone else in her singular league.
Like one of those people who, once knocked on the head, develop off-kilter taste buds, Ms. Prada can be counted on to pile the oddest things on her plate. This season, in a space carpeted in emerald green Astroturf dotted with blue foam cubes, and to a soundtrack of Fun Boy Three's ''Tunnel of Love'' and ''Summertime,'' she heaped references so crazily ill-assorted that the result was both goofy and somehow culturally acute.
Who else but Miuccia Prada would have the wit to pair trousers printed in floral patterns to make Lilly Pulitzer blanch with shirts stitched with cowboy yokes and ornamented with glass-jewel studs? Who else would show puffer jackets printed like kiddie pajamas with neatly cut trousers and golf shoes rendered in tricolored patent leather? Who beside her would sneak into the mix a selection of shorts and jackets in subtle plaids that even editors who've seen it all sat making notes of the pieces they plan to order for themselves?
Prada's are not exactly the kind of clothes one might wear to Porto Ercole. Or maybe they are.
Of the three photographers featured in the Rizzoli book, the most recognizable name is probably that of Juergen Teller, the German photographer whose gross-out antics and skewed visual perspective have done so much to render Marc Jacobs's advertising campaigns memorable.
In the Teller pictures of Hotel Il Pellicano, people from a new generation of hotel guests seem far less preoccupied than their predecessors were with appearing soigne and chic. They are rich enough and secure enough to clown it up for the camera. Having been raised in the era of sampling, tweets and Snooki, they have an innate appreciation for the vulgar and random. They also know that sometimes your bloopers are your best ideas.

HEADLINE: N.B.A. Players Union Says League Is Making Unrealistic Demands

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK

 BODY:
After watching N.B.A. owners reject their best offer to date -- including a $500 million concession in salaries -- officials for the players union went on the offensive Wednesday, charging the league with distortions and unrealistic demands at the bargaining table.
In a hastily called meeting with a handful of reporters, union leaders also disclosed that the N.B.A. is seeking the return of $160 million earned by players in the 2010-11 season -- money that was committed under the current labor deal. 
''That's money that players have already earned, worked for this past season,'' said Derek Fisher, the president of the National Basketball Players Association. ''That's off the table, as far as we're concerned. To me, it speaks to the arrogance that they feel in approaching us with their proposal, to be able to go back and reach for those dollars.''
Responding to Fisher's comments, Commissioner David Stern said: ''Players have benefited from the current system more than the teams. For them it has been a much better partnership. We are sorry that the players union feels that way since it doesn't seem designed to get us to the agreement that is so important to the teams, and we had hoped, the players.''
The $160 million in question is part of a withholding account, based on a deduction of 8 percent of players' earnings; it is a mechanism to ensure that player salaries do not exceed 57 percent of league revenues. With salaries expected to fall well below that threshold this season, the players anticipate a full refund in August.
The escrow-tax dispute is emblematic of the larger battle as the sides try to negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement. The league is claiming losses of at least $300 million per season and wants a vastly different economic model. The players generally want to retain the current system.
Union leaders were angered Tuesday, when Stern publicly disclosed key elements of the league's latest proposal after a bargaining session in Manhattan. Stern revealed that the N.B.A. had offered players a minimum of $2 billion a year over the course of a 10-year labor deal and that it was proposing a ''flex cap'' instead of a hard salary cap.
Union officials say that proposal is not as generous as it appears, and that the flex cap is simply a hard cap in a different form.
The players are making $2.17 billion in salary and benefits this season, the union's executive director, Billy Hunter, said, so the N.B.A.'s offer represents an immediate $170 million reduction. Although Stern said the figure could rise, based on certain benchmarks, Hunter said the proposal amounted to a 10-year salary freeze. He also said it would result in $8.2 billion less for players over the next 10 years, when compared to earnings expected under the current system.
''Their demand is gargantuan,'' Hunter said, ''and we just can't meet it.''
The players have instead offered to reduce salaries by $500 million over the next five years, which Stern dismissed Tuesday as ''a modest proposal.''
The union is also opposed to a 10-year agreement. Significantly, the N.B.A.'s television deals are due to expire in 2016 -- about halfway through the 10-year window -- which means the players could be cut out of any major increase in broadcast revenue, Hunter said.
The parties will hold another bargaining session Friday, but neither side anticipates a deal before the collective bargaining agreement expires on June 30. Owners will meet in Dallas next Tuesday and could vote then for a lockout.
Hunter said he assumed that they would, noting, ''We're been threatened with that for the last two years.''

HEADLINE: Regions Settles S.E.C. Action And Puts a Unit Up for Sale

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
Lucas Jackson/Reuters Robert Khuzami, director of the S.E.C.'s enforcement division, in February.As regulators announced a settlement Wednesday with Morgan Keegan of charges that it defrauded customers during the financial crisis, its parent put the brokerage firm on the block.
Morgan Keegan, a unit of Regions Financial, the big Alabama-based bank, agreed to pay $200 million to resolve a case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission. It accused the brokerage firm and two former executives of mispricing risky mortgage-backed bonds in supposedly conservative mutual funds. 
One of those executives, the funds' portfolio manager, James C. Kelsoe Jr., agreed to a lifetime ban from the securities industry.
''The falsification of fund values misrepresented critical information exactly when investors needed it most - when the subprime mortgage meltdown was impacting the funds,'' Robert Khuzami, the director of enforcement at the S.E.C., said in a statement. ''Such misconduct does grievous harm to investors.''
Also Wednesday, Regions announced that it was putting Morgan Keegan up for sale in an effort to raise money to repay the $3.5 billion government loan it received during the financial crisis.
''The resolution of this legacy regulatory matter gives Regions great flexibility with respect to the Morgan Keegan franchise,'' said Grayson Hall, the chief executive of Regions, which sold the bond funds connected to this case in 2008 to another asset management company.
Regions, which has owned Morgan Keegan since 2001, has retained Goldman Sachs to handle the sale of the brokerage firm. The firm, which is based in Memphis, could fetch as much as $1.5 billion, according to a person briefed on the business.
The action against Morgan Keegan is just one of a spate of enforcement actions taken against firms related to their mispricing of mortgage securities in their mutual funds during the financial crisis. The S.E.C. has brought similar cases against the Charles Schwab Corporation, Evergreen Investments and the State Street Corporation.
Federal authorities have recently stepped up actions against large banks related to their crisis-era conduct. On Tuesday, JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay about $150 million to settle civil accusations that it misled investors in a complex mortgage securities transaction in 2007.
Last month, federal prosecutors in Manhattan filed a civil action against Deutsche Bank, accusing it of lying about the quality of home loans it handled for the Federal Housing Administration. The bank is fighting the case.
Still, authorities continue to field questions about why they are not bringing criminal charges against bank executives and others who may have engaged in illegal practices during the mortgage boom.
During a conference call with regulators on Wednesday, a reporter asked why the government did not bring criminal charges in the Morgan Keegan case. The government officials declined to comment.
Investors in the five Morgan Keegan bond funds are said to have lost about $1.5 billion. These funds, which were marketed as relatively safe investment vehicles, lost more than half their value when the market for mortgage securities first seized up in 2007.
Two former Morgan Keegan executives - Mr. Kelsoe and Joseph Thompson Weller, a controller - were accused in the case.
Mr. Kelsoe, who started managing the Morgan Keegan funds in 1999, was a vocal booster of mortgage securities during the housing boom and became one of Wall Street's top-ranked mutual fund managers. Investors reaching for extra yield during last decade's persistently low-interest-rate environment flocked to Mr. Kelsoe's funds.
But regulators said that Mr. Kelsoe ignored the funds' charter by investing predominantly in the risky structured products that became popular during the credit bubble, including pools of subprime mortgage-backed securities.
The S.E.C. action also accused him of instructing Morgan Keegan's accounting department to make fake ''price adjustments'' to inflate the value of the funds' mortgage-backed securities holdings as the housing market began to sour.
Mr. Kelsoe became an early, prominent casualty of the crisis in subprime mortgage bonds.
''What was an ocean of liquidity has quickly become a desert,'' wrote Mr. Kelsoe in a report to his investors in October 2007 as the fund was plummeting. He once compared his ''intoxication'' with low-grade mortgage securities to that of fund managers seduced by dot-com stocks.
Mr. Kelsoe, 49 and a resident of Memphis, agreed to pay a $500,000 penalty and accept a permanent ban from the securities industry. Mr. Weller agreed to pay a $50,000 fine.
Regulators from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra, as well as regulators from five Southern states were involved in the Morgan Keegan investigation and settlement.
Federal and state authorities continue to pursue separate claims against Morgan Keegan related to its sale of auction-rate securities, another risky investment product that soured during the financial crisis.
Although buffeted by the government's accusations, Morgan Keegan has performed well. Potential buyers could include a bank or brokerage firm looking to bolster its presence in the Southeast, or a private equity firm. A number of buyout shops have previously made successful investment in brokerage firms and asset managers, including Hellman & Friedman, TA Associates and Lightyear Capital.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: In North Dakota City, River's Threat Renewed

BYLINE: By A.G. SULZBERGER; Timothy Williams contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
MINOT, N.D. -- The first time rising waters forced a quarter of the residents here to abandon their homes several weeks ago, many of them simply hauled their possessions up to their second floors to keep them dry. But as the river that divides downtown began rising to record levels this week, those same homeowners confronted a sobering realization: the second floor might not be high enough.
In this summer of unrelenting flooding across the Midwest, with record flows along giants like the Mississippi and the Missouri Rivers, one of the most striking scenes of unfolding destruction is occurring here on the banks of the diminutive Souris River -- known as ''The Mouse,'' after its French name. 
This city is bracing for a powerful surge of water predicted to break records by as much as five feet. As sirens blared, more than 11,000 residents evacuated their homes on Wednesday for the second time in a month, this time with the grim assurance from local leaders that the river would overtop levees in a matter of hours and swamp a huge section of the city for weeks. And, right on schedule, the fast-moving water started pouring over defenses that had kept the city dry for more than six decades.
Residents worked desperately at first to clear all they could from homes, trying to contain their emotions as they made difficult choices and calculated gambles about what to leave behind. A month ago, Harrietta Summers, a first-grade teacher, moved all her possessions up to the second floor of her longtime home along the river. This time, she emptied her cabinets and her closets, figuring that the water would keep rising.
''It's going to hit the roof,'' Ms. Summers said with forced cheer, her smile finally giving way to tears.
Down the street, Bobbi Linrud helped pack up the childhood home where she had taken a boat to fetch her prom dress during a flood 40 years ago that destroyed much of the city. Ms. Linrud hoped that the water would not climb to the once-implausible level of the second story, where many of her mother's possessions were still stacked from the first evacuation.
During a break, she put up a sign by the front door announcing a beach party. ''If we're leaving, we'll leave with a smile, and we're not leaving till the whistle blows and they say get out,'' she said.
The siren came soon enough, a few minutes before 1 p.m., sending Ms. Linrud and others racing for higher ground.
The water, already higher than that of the devastating flood of 1969, which prompted the construction of current river defenses, was expected to continue rising through the weekend, shattering the 130-year-old record. The river, which is controlled by dams, has also forced evacuations in a number of small communities.
The flood promised to deliver a brutal blow to a city, the fourth-largest in North Dakota, that has enjoyed years of remarkable growth and prosperity. Its success driven by a regional oil boom and a healthy agricultural industry, Minot (pronounced MY-not) has mirrored the general prosperity of a state that had been a rare bright spot in these difficult financial years, with a growing economy and the lowest unemployment rate in the nation.
In fact, that boomtown atmosphere -- property values have doubled in the decade at a time when the vacancy rate has been less than 1 percent -- has left the people who have been forced to evacuate struggling to find a place to live.
Every hotel in the surrounding area is fully booked -- many of them have been for years, serving as a sort of permanent temporary housing for oil field workers -- and with few rentals available, people have turned to families, friends, co-workers and even local college dormitory rooms.
The head of the Minot Area Chamber of Commerce was staying in a trailer in the backyard of a friend. About 200 people turned once again to Red Cross shelters.
This was the unhappy reality for April Moses, who had struggled through the final, uncomfortable week of her pregnancy at a shelter in an auditorium during the first evacuation. Less than two weeks later she returned with her newborn son.
Unable to find alternative housing at any price, Ms. Moses now expects to stay for as long as a month, living alongside her parents, daughter and baby son in a room full of strangers. ''I'd rather be home of course,'' she said.
The fact that this was the second mandatory evacuation, after the shared sense that the community had avoided calamity the first time when the defenses held back the flood waters, complicated residents' reactions. Some refused to evacuate. Even some officials wondered at how badly an unexpected heavy rain storm to the north had worsened the river flows and caused this week's flooding.
''We breathed a sigh of relief and thought everything was going to be fine,'' said Maj. Gen. David A. Sprynczynatyk, the head of the North Dakota National Guard.
Linda Johnson was so confident that the threat had passed -- though officials had guardedly warned that the situation could worsen at any time -- that she used the evacuation of her home and gift shop, Home Sweet Home, as an excuse to remodel when she returned.
Ms. Johnson re-carpeted, refinished the floors and repainted the walls. When she restocked the shelves, the shop had never looked better. After evacuating again she is praying that a newly erected levee behind the old Victorian building will hold the water back.
Karen Caudill had no such hope. Her home was just feet from the levee, and she frantically shifted through her possessions Wednesday in advance of what she has taken to calling the ''prairie tsunami.'' Ms. Caudill's closets were still full, piles of toys sat in one room and mementos in another. Furniture and appliances were left to be destroyed.
As Ms. Caudill sorted through her things, the smoke from her cigarettes mixing with her tears, she said she was sure she would never see her one-story home again. The experience was similar to losing her husband last year to cancer. ''You thought you had more time than you do,'' she said.
Online Correction: June 22, 2011, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A previous version of this article misstated how long ago the flood record was set in Minot, N.D.; it was 130 years ago, not 230.

HEADLINE: Homophobia Still an Obstacle In African Women's Soccer

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN

 BODY:
Shortly before she was hired in 2009 as the first female coach of Nigeria's powerful women's national soccer team, Eucharia Uche said at a seminar that she was troubled by the presence of lesbians on the squad, calling it a ''worrisome experience.''
Over the past two years, as Nigeria progressed toward the Women's World Cup, which begins Sunday in Germany, Uche said that she has used religion in an attempt to rid her team of homosexual behavior, which she termed a ''dirty issue,'' and ''spiritually, morally very wrong.''
FIFA, soccer's world governing body, states as part of its mission a desire to use the game in ''overcoming social and cultural obstacles for women with the ultimate aim of improving women's standing in society.'' But the story of Nigeria's Super Falcons illustrates the cultural obstacles that remain for many African women who play soccer decades after more assertive efforts at inclusivity occurred in places like the United States, Germany, Norway, Sweden and more recently in Brazil. 
Uche said she had never witnessed her own players participating in homosexual activity. Instead, she said that she had relied on rumors, speculation and news media accounts to form her belief that lesbian behavior had been common in the Nigerian team.
''When rumors are strong, you are bound to believe it is happening,'' Uche, 38, said in a telephone interview from Nigeria's World Cup training camp in Saalfelden, Austria.
In March, Uche made similar remarks to The Daily Sun newspaper of Nigeria. The newspaper also quoted a former technical assistant for the country's soccer federation, James Peters, saying that he had removed some players from Nigeria's women's team last year, ''not because they were not good players, but because they were lesbians.''
That was not her style, Uche said from Austria. Instead, she said, she had regularly brought in Pentecostal ministers to pray with and counsel her players. Her players routinely read the Bible and sometimes prayed together, Uche said.
''The issue of lesbianism is common,'' said Uche, who previously played in the World Cup for Nigeria and described herself as a Christian who is married and a mother of two children. ''I came to realize it is not a physical battle; we need divine intervention in order to control and curb it. I tell you it worked for us. This is a thing of the past. It is never mentioned.''
On a continent where homosexual behavior is widely considered immoral, lesbians are sometimes ostracized and subjected to beatings. In countries like South Africa and Zimbabwe, some women are raped in a so-called corrective treatment for homosexual behavior.
In one high-profile case in South Africa, a top female soccer player and lesbian activist, Eudy Simelane, 31, was murdered in 2008. Although one of her attackers testified that robbery was the motive in the stabbing death, Simelane's death became the focus of a campaign to draw attention to violence against gays and lesbians.
Last year, Nigeria, which is making its sixth appearance in the World Cup, accused Equatorial Guinea, another Cup participant, of using at least one and perhaps two male players on its team because of their supposed masculine appearance. Soccer officials from Equatorial Guinea called the charge unfounded, saying it stemmed from an ''inferiority complex'' among rival African teams.
The case was dismissed by the Confederation of African Football, the continent's governing body, according to a spokesman for the Nigerian soccer federation. Uche said, ''Until it is proved, no one can say a player is a man or a woman.''
The treatment of lesbians in sport is not a matter restricted to women in Africa. Some women on previous United States national soccer teams have been reluctant to live openly gay lifestyles for fear of repercussions. And despite all the advances of gender equity in sport, lesbianism remains a sensitive matter in recruiting in college basketball.
But homosexuality remains a particularly taboo subject and carries a significant social stigma in many parts of Africa. Nigeria is divided between a Muslim north and Christian south. Homosexual acts are prohibited and those who are openly gay or lesbian risk harassment and blackmail, experts said. In Nigeria's north, gay men can face death by stoning for sodomy.
''It's sad because a lot of Nigerians look at homosexuality almost as a disease,'' said Unoma Azuah, a Nigerian-born novelist who teaches literature at Lane College in Jackson, Tenn., and has written extensively about the treatment of lesbians and bisexuals in Africa's most populous nation. ''It's a very harsh environment.''
As economies have stagnated in countries like Nigeria and Uganda and many people have lost faith in progress, they have increasingly turned to conservative interpretations of Christianity and Islam, said Marc Epprecht, a historian who is the acting head of the department of global development studies at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, and has researched gender and sexuality in Africa.
''Homophobia is an easy way to simplify the message of these churches,'' Epprecht said. '' 'Our church is more moral than that one. Come join us. You can have a good life on earth if you follow strict, simple beliefs.' ''
Joanie Evans of England, who is a co-president of the International Gay and Lesbian Football Association, said her group was ''appalled'' by the Nigeria situation.
''Women in sport are seen as a poor relation as it is,'' Evans said. ''To discriminate against women again because of their sexuality is really damaging.''
Evans criticized FIFA for not being as forceful in fighting against homophobia as it has been trying to counter racism in soccer. FIFA said that gender discrimination was strictly prohibited and that violations could result in suspensions or expulsions, but that it could not comment on the Nigeria case because it had received no official information or complaints.
In South Africa, one soccer team has challenged homophobia on the continent. It is an openly lesbian team of black players in Johannesburg called the Chosen Few. Still, participation carried its risks, players told The New York Times in interviews for a video made during the 2010 men's World Cup.
One player, Tumi Mkhuma, said she had been raped and left pregnant by the attack. After losing her baby, she said she twice tried to kill herself. The Chosen Few was a second family, she said, and while playing, ''I feel free to be who I am.'' Still, Mkhuma continued to be pained by the assault.
''Sometimes, I wish I was dead,'' she said.
In Nigeria, it seems unlikely that any lesbian players would live so openly as to challenge Uche, the coach, and risk losing a spot on the national team and a chance to play professionally in Europe or the United States, said Azuah, the Nigerian writer.
''I don't see any choice they have,'' Azuah said. ''I know a lot of homosexuals who have found a way to survive, to pretend. Maybe some of them have felt a spiritual transformation. Who knows? The most important thing is to be empowered and have a career, no matter how uncomfortable it makes them.''
When asked about her coach's position, Precious Dede, Nigeria's captain and goalkeeper, said in a telephone interview from Austria that she was not in position to answer such a question. ''I don't know anything about it,'' she said. ''Anything she tells you is the fact.''

HEADLINE: Beijing Warns U.S. About South China Sea Disputes

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG

 BODY:
BEIJING -- The Chinese vice foreign minister warned the United States on Wednesday to stay out of the increasingly tense territorial disputes and maritime conflicts in the South China Sea, which has some of the busiest shipping lanes in the world and is believed to be rich in oil and natural gas reserves.
All or parts of the sea are claimed by Brunei, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. China and Vietnam are the most vocal in their claims, and have been involved in diplomatic disputes in recent years involving fishing vessels and maritime surveillance boats. But this year has been more tense than usual. Vietnamese officials accused Chinese vessels of cutting cables to oil exploration ships in May and June; Chinese officials have denied some of those accusations and have warned Vietnam and other nations that only joint oil exploration is acceptable. 
Standoffs have also taken place this year between Chinese and Philippine vessels. In March, two Chinese maritime surveillance ships ordered a Philippine survey ship away from an area called Reed Bank. The Philippines later sent in military aircraft.
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said last year that the United States had a ''national interest'' in the South China Sea and could facilitate talks, worrying China that it was going to step into the territorial rivalry.
''Regarding the role of the United States in this, the United States is not a claimant state to the dispute,'' the vice foreign minister, Cui Tiankai, told reporters on Wednesday. ''So it is better for the United States to leave the dispute to be sorted out between the claimant states.''
Mr. Cui added, ''I believe the individual countries are actually playing with fire, and I hope the fire will not be drawn to the United States.''
He was speaking at the Foreign Ministry ahead of a weekend meeting in Hawaii between senior Chinese and American officials that has been called to discuss issues in the Asia-Pacific region. The meeting, which the two sides say is a first round of consultations, was set up after President Hu Jintao visited Washington in January. The meeting will be led by Kurt M. Campbell, an American assistant secretary of state, and Mr. Cui.
The South China Sea is not officially on the agenda, but the issue will almost certainly come up. The United States has not taken a side in the territorial disputes, but has urged nations to resolve them peacefully. China insists that it will talk to the countries on a bilateral basis and that it will not negotiate with claimants in a multilateral manner, which those countries would prefer.
''Some American friends may want the United States to help matters,'' Mr. Cui said. ''We appreciate that gesture, but more often than not, such gestures will only make things more complicated.''
He added that ''if the United States does want to play a role, it may counsel restraint to those countries who've been frequently taking provocative action, and to ask them to be more responsible in their behavior.''
In giving his warning, Mr. Cui hinted that anti-American fervor could be brewing. ''To be honest with you, the Chinese public is following very closely whether the United States will adopt a just and objective position on matters like these,'' he said.
Officials in the Philippines said Wednesday that the United States was obligated by a 1951 treaty to help defend Philippine interests if ships came under attack in the South China Sea, The Associated Press reported.
At the briefing, Mr. Cui also talked about North Korea, which is officially called the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, an issue of great concern to both Chinese and American officials. The United States has been pressing China to do more to control North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-il, a frequent visitor to China.
''From what we've seen and heard, what the D.P.R.K. leaders and delegation members have seen in China has had an impact on their thinking,'' Mr. Cui said. ''They are now considering whether there need to be some initiatives on the front of economic reform and opening.''
He added: ''We should encourage and support such a trend. Of course, it will take some more time for there to be a fundamental improvement in the D.P.R.K. economy. So we also need to have patience. We cannot expect things to change overnight simply because there is an increased interest in economic development.''

PERSON: Brian Haw 

HEADLINE: Brian Haw; Demonstrator Against Wars Was 62

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Brian Haw, who day after day and night after night for nearly a decade maintained a vigil outside Parliament in London to protest the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, becoming an annoyance to some politicians and a stopping point for tour guides, died on Saturday. He was 62. 
Mr. Haw died in Germany, where he had been receiving treatment for lung cancer since March, his family told The Associated Press.
On June 2, 2001, Mr. Haw -- an evangelical Christian who had previously taken his one-man world peace mission to Northern Ireland during the so-called Troubles and to the killing fields of Cambodia as that country tried to heal -- set up a makeshift camp on the grassy area in Parliament Square.
At first, his protest was directed at the impact of United Nations economic sanctions, imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, on the children of Iraq. After the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, which Prime Minister Tony Blair's government supported, it became, to use Mr. Haw's preferred term, a protest for peace.
Not long after, he moved to the pavement opposite the Houses of Parliament and began building what grew into a wall 20 yards long of peace flags, handmade placards (''Stop Killing My Kids'') and photographs (Mr. Blair with a Hitlerish mustache). The police would tear down that wall in 2007, but Mr. Haw, with one sign, stayed.
Parliament Square became his home. His mail was delivered there. It was his registered address when he ran for Parliament in 2004, receiving 298 votes. People gave him food, coffee, tobacco. He slept under a green tarp and spent his days hectoring the powerful across the road through his bullhorn. Drivers would honk in support. Three times, he said, his nose was broken by irate passers-by.
City officials and members of Parliament passed several measures to oust him. Most were overturned. One, which required protesters to have authorization from the police ''when the demonstration starts,'' could not be applied to him retroactively.
He continued to demonstrate ''because our country is committing infanticide, genocide, the looting of nations,'' he told reporters in 2010. ''I'm determined to be there until they kill me.''
Brian William Haw was born in Barking, near London, on Jan. 7, 1949. He served in the Merchant Navy before attending a religious school in Nottingham for one semester, after which he embarked on his world peace mission.
Mr. Haw is survived by seven children. He and his wife, Kay, divorced in 2003, a year and a half into his round-the-clock demonstration in Parliament Square. ''I can't kiss my own child each night, but I'm doing this for all the children,'' he told The New York Times in 2005.
On Monday, his camping chair and footstool remained in place across the street from Parliament.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: High-Speed Rail Poised to Alter China

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Ian Johnson contributed reporting from Beijing and Adam Century contributed research from Beijing.

 BODY:
CHANGSHA, China -- Even as China prepares to open bullet train service from Beijing to Shanghai by July 1, this nation's steadily expanding high-speed rail network is being pilloried on a scale rare among Chinese citizens and news media.
Complaints include the system's high costs and pricey fares, the quality of construction and the allegation of self-dealing by a rail minister who was fired earlier this year on corruption grounds.
But often overlooked, amid all the controversy, are the very real economic benefits that the world's most advanced fast rail system is bringing to China -- and the competitive challenges it poses for the United States and Europe.
Just as building the interstate highway system a half-century ago made modern, national commerce more feasible in the United States, China's ambitious rail rollout is helping integrate the economy of this sprawling, populous nation -- though on a much faster construction timetable and at significantly higher travel speeds than anything envisioned by the Eisenhower administration. 
Work crews of as many as 100,000 people per line have built about half of the 10,000-mile network in just six years, in many cases ahead of schedule -- including the Beijing-to-Shanghai line that was not originally expected to open until next year. The entire system is on course to be completed by 2020.
For the United States and Europe, the implications go beyond marveling at the pace of Communist-style civil engineering. China's manufacturing might and global export machine are likely to grow more powerful as 200-mile-an-hour trains link cities and provinces that were previously as much as 24 hours by road or rail from the entrepreneurial seacoast.
Zhen Qinan, a founder of the stock exchange in coastal Shenzhen and the recently retired chief executive of ZK Energy, a wind turbine producer in Changsha, said that high-speed trains were making it more convenient to base businesses here in Hunan Province. Populous Hunan has long provided labor to the factories of the east, but its mountains have tended to isolate it from the economic mainstream.
Mr. Zhen ticked off Hunan's attributes: ''Land is much cheaper. Electricity is cheaper. Labor is cheaper.''
Around China, real estate prices and investment have surged in the more than 200 inland cities that have already been connected by high-speed rail in the last three years. Businesses are flocking to these cities, now just a few hours by bullet train from China's busiest and most international metropolises.
Meanwhile, a shift in passenger traffic to the new high-speed rail routes has freed up congested older rail lines for freight. That has allowed coal mines and shippers to switch to cheaper rail transport from costly trucks for heavy cargos.
Because of this shift, plus the construction of additional freight lines, the tonnage hauled by China's rail system increased in 2010 by an amount equaling the entire freight carried last year by the combined rail systems of Britain, France, Germany and Poland, according to the World Bank.
The bullet train bonanza, and the competitive challenge it poses for the West, is only likely to increase with the opening of the 820-mile Beijing-to-Shanghai line, which will create a business corridor between China's two most dynamic cities. The railway ministry plans 90 bullet trains a day in each direction.
The trains will barrel along at initial speeds of 190 miles per hour, with plans to accelerate to 220 miles per hour by the summer of 2012, if the first year of operation goes smoothly.
Even at the initial speeds, they will take less than five hours to cover a distance comparable to New York to Atlanta -- which requires nearly 18 hours on Amtrak.
China's huge investment in high-speed rail may be instructive to the United States, whether for proponents of federal rail investments or critics who consider bullet trains a boondoggle.
President Obama, who has proposed spending $53 billion on high-speed rail over the next six years, faced a setback in his budget deal in April with Congressional Republicans, who eliminated money for that plan this year.
Last fall, newly elected Republican governors in Florida, Ohio and Wisconsin turned down federal money their Democratic predecessors had won for new rail routes, worrying that their states could cover most of the costs for trains that would draw few riders.
But then, high-speed rail is not universally acclaimed in China, either. Financial regulators in Beijing have cautioned banks to monitor their rising exposure from hefty loans to the rail ministry. To pay for rapid deployment of the high-speed system, the ministry has borrowed more than $300 billion. It plans to invest an additional $115 billion this year, despite running losses on existing operations that it attributes mainly to rising diesel fuel costs for older lines, as well as rising interest payments.
Among the biggest beneficiaries of the high-speed rail system are firms that contribute nothing to defray its costs. Those would be freight shippers, which now have more exclusive use of the older rail lines, with fewer delays.
On the older tracks, the rail ministry has long been able to dictate that freight rates would subsidize passenger trains because the ministry owns those older tracks outright. The new, high-speed lines -- passenger trains only -- are owned by joint ventures between the rail ministry and provincial governments. That has prevented the ministry from forcing freight shippers to cross-subsidize the new high-speed services. As a result, passengers must pay much higher fares on the new trains than on the older ones.
The lack of freight subsidies is also causing concern in the rail and banking industries that the debt agreements of some joint ventures might need to be revised to extend the repayment of investment costs over more years.
For ordinary citizens, meanwhile, the steep prices for high-speed train tickets have touched China's raw nerve of rising income inequality.
''The government is just abusing the money of the common people,'' said one posting on an Internet discussion forum, defying the network's censorship.
From Changsha to Guangzhou, the one-way fare in economy class for the two-hour journey, at speeds of up to 210 miles per hour, is 333 renminbi ($51). That is comparable to a deeply discounted airfare, but expensive for a migrant worker from Hunan who might earn only $160 to $400 a month in wages in Guangzhou.
The same trip takes nine hours on an older, diesel train. But it costs only 99 renminbi ($15).
Chinese and foreign engineers have questioned the long-term strength of the concrete used in bridges and viaducts under contracts awarded during the term of the disgraced former rail minister, Liu Zhijun.
The rail ministry's new leaders, brought in after the corruption investigation, contend that safety concerns are misplaced. But they have responded to public anger over fares by announcing plans to lower the top speed on many routes on July 1 -- which will not only address safety questions but will sharply reduce the amount of electricity consumed -- and pass on the savings through reduced fares.
When the Beijing-to-Shanghai line opens, it will create a north-to-south artery with links to east-to-west rail lines at two dozen stations along the way.
''It's the network together that makes it work -- knowing you can go from Shijiazhuang to Beijing and then transfer to Tianjin, so the coal guys can go to the port and conduct business with their shippers, for example,'' said John Scales, a rail expert in the Beijing office of the World Bank who has advised China.
Already, the longer routes elsewhere appear to draw much heavier ridership. The trains, which typically carry 600 passengers, sometimes sell out despite departures every 10 or 15 minutes, particularly on Fridays but sometimes even at lunchtime in the middle of the week.
Of course, high speed is relative. First, a passenger must actually get a seat.
Zhou Junde, a migrant construction worker with a large red and green tattoo of a hawk on the right side of his neck, stood in line here at the Changsha station on a recent Friday afternoon to buy a high-speed ticket to Guangzhou. But the next high-speed train was sold out, and so was the next one 10 minutes after that. He would have to wait 30 minutes to board a train with a seat.
''Sometimes,'' he said, ''I come several hours early to get the departure I want.''

HEADLINE: Cuomo Secures Big Givebacks In Union Deal

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
ALBANY -- The state's largest public-employee union, acknowledging the pressures on government workers around the nation, agreed on Wednesday to major wage and benefits concessions in a pact to avoid sweeping layoffs.
The five-year agreement between Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, and the Civil Service Employees Association, includes a three-year wage freeze, the first furloughs ever for state workers and an increase in the amount employees must pay toward their health insurance.
Savings would amount to $73 million this year, and as much as $1.6 billion over five years, if other labor unions representing public workers agreed to similar concessions. Absent those agreements, there could still be layoffs of some public workers, the Cuomo administration said. 
The agreement was announced as the governor and lawmakers negotiated over a number of issues in the waning hours of the legislative session. Senate Republicans had not decided on Wednesday night whether to allow a vote on the most contentious issue, the proposed legalization of same-sex marriage.
The negotiations between Mr. Cuomo and the union, which represents about a third of the 186,000 state workers, were largely free of the public rancor that accompanied efforts to reduce spending on labor in New Jersey and Wisconsin.
''I want to applaud C.S.E.A. for understanding, truly, the situation that the state is in,'' the governor told reporters on Wednesday night. ''The union really stepped up and helped the state out at a very precarious time, from a financial point of view.''
In a statement, Danny Donohue, the president of the union, said, ''These are not ordinary times, and C.S.E.A. and the Cuomo administration have worked very hard at the bargaining table to produce an agreement that balances shared sacrifice with fairness and respect.''
The deal is subject to ratification by union members, who will vote by mail over the next several weeks. It would provide pay raises of 2 percent in the fourth and fifth years of the contract.
Mr. Cuomo, facing shrinking resources because of the recession, had earlier in the legislative session won approval of a state budget that depended on a $450 million cut in labor costs, either from layoffs or union concessions.
He had also proposed reducing pension benefits for new government workers; that proposal is unlikely to be approved in this session, but will be a potential flash point going forward.
Edmund J. McMahon, director of the Empire Center for New York State Policy, a research group that favors reduced government spending, called the deal a mixed bag.
On one hand, Mr. McMahon said, the agreement was not an effort at significant transformation, like that tried by Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who sought to end collective bargaining for many public-employee unions. On the other hand, he said, the New York deal marked a sharp departure from the state's previous four-year labor contract, which put in place base wage increases of 3 percent a year for the first three years and 4 percent in the fourth year.
''In Wisconsin, they tried to change the rules,'' Mr. McMahon said, adding, ''If you're negotiating within the rules of the game, this is probably the best deal you can get.''
Under the terms of the deal announced on Wednesday, lower-paid employees -- those whose salaries start at about $33,000 or less -- will have their share of health care premiums rise to 12 percent, from 10 percent, for individuals. More highly paid employees will have their share rise to 16 percent. The cost of family health coverage will also increase; for more highly paid employees, for example, the share will rise to 31 percent, from 25 percent. State officials expect that, as in the past, the health care changes will also apply to retirees, a potentially critical part of the overall savings.
In addition to taking a five-day furlough in the current fiscal year, employees must take a four-day leave in the year after, though the second-year furlough will be repaid at the end of the contract term.
Employees who remain through 2013 will earn one-time bonus payments of $775 in 2013 and $225 in 2014 -- such one-time payments do not compound over time like salary increases, which increase long-term cash costs for the state and the burden on the pension system.
In addition to the wage and benefits concessions, the union also agreed to an overhaul of the disciplinary procedures for state employees accused of abuse or neglect of the developmentally disabled. The state and the union will develop a series of punishments for employees who commit disciplinary offenses in an effort to end the seemingly random punishments handed out by arbitrators to employees in the past. And there will also be an overhaul of the current arbitration panel and higher pay in an effort to recruit better arbitrators.
The Cuomo administration had pressed for the changes after a series of articles in The New York Times examining the treatment of the disabled in group homes and state-run institutions. Among the newspaper's findings: The state has retained workers who committed physical or sexual abuse, rehired many workers it had fired, shunned whistle-blowers and rarely reported allegations of abuse to law enforcement officials.
While employees represented by the Civil Service Employees Association averted layoffs, the Cuomo administration is still negotiating with a number of other unions, including the Public Employees Federation, which represents 56,000 employees and is the second-largest union of state employees. The state has put forward a July 15 deadline for layoffs in other unions if an agreement is not reached to reduce their wages and benefits.
The Public Employees Federation has had more contentious talks thus far with the Cuomo administration, going so far as to post the administration's negotiating position on the Internet, but its position was weakened by the agreement announced on Wednesday.
Ken Brynien, president of the Public Employees Federation, issued only a brief statement, saying his union ''stands ready to meet with the state's negotiators to reach an agreement.''

HEADLINE: Some Ways to Get Started As a Social Entrepreneur

BYLINE: By SUSAN MORAN

 BODY:
With the economy still struggling, it may seem like an impossible time to start a do-good social venture. It can be hard enough to operate any business profitably -- let alone one that also tries to improve the world. But some observers believe that the tough times may be increasing interest in social ventures.
''I get the sense that the recession actually has resulted in more people taking interest in investing in companies that are doing the right thing right from the start,'' said Wes Selke, investment manager at Good Capital, a social-impact venture capital firm in San Francisco. As one indicator, at least three social-impact funds have raised more than $100 million in the last couple of years: Ignia Fund, Leapfrog Investments and MicroVest.
Marrying mission and money in one business can be tricky. This guide focuses on commercial, profit-making businesses and entrepreneurs who want to build self-sustaining social ventures, a term that encompasses nonprofit and profit-making companies as well as some new types of legal hybrids, like an L3C, which stands for low-profit limited liability company. These ventures are commonly thought of as enterprises that serve a so-called triple bottom line: people, planet and profits. 
At a social venture, the social mission is expected to be at least as important as the money-making mission. So, for example, the tobacco giant Philip Morris does not pass the test even though it donates generously to artistic and social causes. But a business that addresses a socioeconomic or environmental challenge as part of its DNA -- for instance by selling low-cost solar-powered lanterns to villages that lack electricity -- would be considered a social enterprise, according to Deb Nelson, executive director of Social Venture Network, an organization of some 500 chief executives, company founders, nonprofit leaders and investors.
To those looking to start such ventures, social entrepreneurs and investors offer the following pointers.
IT'S O.K. TO MAKE MONEY If you choose the profit-making model, stick with it -- without apology. A few years ago, Assaf Shafran founded a nonprofit in Israel that offered a smartphone-based dispatching system for first responders, like firefighters and emergency medical technicians.
But his social venture, called IsraeLife, had an impossible time giving the system away to volunteer organizations, largely because the organizations were suspicious of giveaways -- they demanded exclusive rights or they got mired in red tape related to receiving gifts. Mr. Shafran decided he could do more good by selling the systems. In 2008 he and his team formed a profit-making division, called NowForce, which has expanded into the United States. The business has raised $2.5 million from private investors, and Mr. Shafran expects sales to surpass $3 million this year.
Proudly embracing a profit-making model may require focusing on the balance sheet before unleashing the social mission. ''You can't pay employees a livable wage if you don't have money in the bank,'' said Lisa Lorimer, former chief executive of the Vermont Bread Company, which started making organic cookies in 1978.
VENTURE CAPITAL NOT THE SOLE OPTION Financing a social venture can be even more challenging than financing a traditional business. Some entrepreneurs prefer to self-finance with the help of bank loans. Others pursue venture capital, and they accept the loss of control that entails.
Vermont Bread began with a commitment to paying employees a ''livable wage'' -- three to four times more than the minimum wage most competitors offered. It also offered employees health insurance and bought ingredients from local and sustainable farms, which further squeezed margins, according to Ms. Lorimer.
As a result, the company grew deliberately, mostly through bootstrapping and bank financing. At a time when many in the baking business said the company was unrealistic in trying to sell organic goods (with their brief shelf life) and to pay employees a premium, Vermont Bread was able to find a local bank that offered small loans so the fledgling business could buy equipment -- one pan, one truck, one pizza oven at a time.
BE WARY OF GROWTH In 2005, James Gutierrez founded Progreso Financiero, a bank based in Mountain View, Calif. It offers small loans, averaging $1,000, to individuals and small businesses with little or no credit history, through staffed kiosks in Hispanic grocery stores and pharmacies in California and Texas. Borrowers often use the loans to buy a delivery truck or other equipment.
Mr. Gutierrez, 33, whose grandparents immigrated to the United States from Mexico, conceived Progreso Financiero as a ''social entrepreneuring'' research project when he was earning an M.B.A. at Stanford. He wanted to see if microlending, which was taking off in India, could help the millions of immigrants in the United States. He started in one Mexican supermarket in East Los Angeles. Before long he was operating staffed kiosks in 16 Sears and Kmart stores, which he figured would be magnets for many Latino families. ''We thought this was a great opportunity, a great way to grow fast,'' he said. It did not turn out that way.
Sears and Kmart shut down Progreso's kiosks because their loan volume was thin. ''We found out that the grass-roots supermarkets are where people go three times a week, not the national chain stores,'' Mr. Gutierrez said, which ended up being a valuable lesson. The closings prompted Progreso to refocus on what Mr. Gutierrez called the basic building blocks: technology, automated credit scoring (yielding more loans per store per month), and the grass-roots supermarket channel.
Progreso's business model is based on charging an average percentage rate of 36 percent, roughly double the rate for bank credit cards but much less than the rates that many payday loan services charge. If borrowers pay back loans on time, Progreso grants them better terms on subsequent loans. With 480 employees, the company has secured more than $75 million in venture capital and another $75 million in debt financing, and it has issued more than 160,000 loans. Its loss rate is 5 to 10 percent, and Mr. Gutierrez said he expected the bank to become profitable next year.
HIRE CREATIVELY Despite paying less than mainstream companies, social enterprises have the ability to hire talented people.
Mathieu Senard is chief executive of Alter Eco Americas, a San Francisco-based company that sells organic Fair Trade products, including dark chocolate bars, quinoa, rice and sugar to retailers. (Fair Trade purchasers offer above-market prices and promote sustainability in developing countries.)
Mr. Senard and Edouard Rollet started the company in the United States in 2005, hoping to fight poverty through business. They buy goods at a premium from small farming cooperatives in developing countries. Mr. Senard expects sales to grow to $5 million this year from $3 million last year.
Alter Eco broke into Whole Foods early on, but its products were not widely distributed nationwide. Mr. Senard feared that he could not afford the industry talent he needed to capture more shelf space. His big break came unexpectedly, four and a half years ago, when Kate Tierney, vice president for sales at a big natural foods distributor, agreed to serve on Alter Eco's board.
Ms. Tierney introduced Alter Eco to influential brokers and retailers. At one point she joined Alter Eco executives on a visit to a farming cooperative in Thailand. Not long after spending three days in a small village, Ms. Tierney told Mr. Senard that she planned to leave her job and come work for him. ''I was like a deer in the headlights,'' Mr. Senard said. ''I said, 'We can't afford you. We'd have to cut your salary in half.' '' Undeterred, Ms. Tierney joined Alter Eco and has helped double the company's sales.

HEADLINE: Derivatives Cloud the Possible Fallout From a Greek Default

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY; Binyamin Appelbaum contributed reporting.

 BODY:
It's the $616 billion question: Does the euro crisis have a hidden A.I.G.?
No one seems to be sure, in large part because the world of derivatives is so murky. But the possibility that some company out there may have insured billions of dollars of European debt has added a new tension to the sovereign default debate.
In years past, when financial crises in Argentina and Russia left those countries unable to make good on their government debts, they simply defaulted. But this time around, swaps and other sorts of contracts have become so common and so intertwined in the financial markets that there are fears among regulators and financial players about how a Greek default would play out among derivatives holders.
The looming uncertainties are whether these contracts -- which insure against possibilities like a Greek default -- are concentrated in the hands of a few companies, and if these companies will be able to pay out billions of dollars to cover losses during a default. If there were a single company standing behind many of these contracts, that company would be akin to the American International Group of the euro crisis. The American insurer needed a $182 billion federal bailout during the financial crisis because it had insured the performance of mortgage bonds through derivatives and could not pay on all of them. 
Even regulators seem unsure of whether a Greek default would reveal such concentrated risk in the hands of just a few companies. Spokeswomen for the central banks of both Europe and the United States would not say whether their researchers had studied holdings of such contracts among nonbank entities like insurance companies and hedge funds.
Asked about derivatives tied to Europe at a Wednesday press conference, Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said that the direct exposure is small but that ''a disorderly default in one of those countries would no doubt roil financial markets globally. It would have a big impact on credit spreads, on stock prices and so on. And so in that respect I think the effects in the United States would be quite significant.''
Derivatives traders and analysts are debating just how much money is involved in these contracts and what sort of threat they pose to markets in Europe and the United States. On the one hand, just over $5 billion is tied up in credit-default swap contracts that will pay out if Greece defaults, according to Markit, a financial data firm based in London. That is less than 1 percent the size of Greece's economy, but that is a conservative calculation that counts protections banks have in place offsetting their positions, and is called the net exposure.
The less conservative figure, the gross exposure, is $78.7 billion for Greece, according to Markit. And there are many other types of contracts, like about $44 billion in other guarantees tied to Greece, according to the Bank of International Settlements. The gross exposure of the five most financially pressed European Union countries -- Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain -- is about $616 billion. And the broader figure on all derivatives from those countries is unknown.
The pervasiveness of these opaque contracts has complicated negotiations for European officials, and it underscores calls for more transparency in the derivatives market.
The uncertainty, financial analysts say, has led European officials to push for a ''voluntary'' Greek bond financing solution that may sidestep a default, rather than the forced deals of other eras. ''There's not any clarity here because people don't know,'' said Christopher Whalen, editor of The Institutional Risk Analyst. ''This is why the Europeans came up with this ridiculous deal, because they don't know what's out there. They are afraid of a default. The industry is still refusing to provide the disclosure needed to understand this. They're holding us hostage. The Street doesn't want you to see what they've written.''
Regulators are aware of this problem. Financial reform packages on both sides of the Atlantic mandated many changes to the derivatives market, and regulators around the globe are drafting new rules for these contracts that are meant to add transparency as well as security. But they are far from finished and could take years to put into effect.
Darrell Duffie, a professor who has studied derivatives at the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University, said that he was concerned that regulators may not have adequately studied what contagion might occur among swaps holders, in the case of a Greek default.
Regulators, he said, ''have access to everything they need to have. Whether they've collected all the information and analyzed it is different question. I worry because many of those leaders have said there's no way we're going to let Greece default. Does that mean they haven't had conversations about what happens if Greece defaults? Is their commitment so severe that they haven't had real discussions about it in the backrooms?''
Regulators aren't saying much. When asked what data the Federal Reserve had collected on American financial companies and their swaps tied to European debt, Barbara Hagenbaugh, a spokeswoman, referred to a speech made by Mr. Bernanke in May in which he did not mention derivatives tied to Greece. At the Wednesday press conference, Mr. Bernanke said that commonly cited data on derivatives do not take into account the offsetting positions banks have on their Greek exposures. And with those positions, he said, even if there is a Greek default, ''the effects are very small.''
At the European Central Bank, Eszter Miltenyi, a spokeswoman, said: ''This is much too sensitive I think for us to have a conversation on this.''
On Wall Street, traders are debating whether the industry's process for unwinding credit-default swaps would run smoothly if Greece defaulted. The process is tightly controlled by a small group of bankers who meet in an industry group called the International Swaps and Derivatives Association.
The process is fairly well developed, but it has been little tested on the debt of countries. For the most part, Wall Street has cashed in on credit-default swaps tied to corporations' debt.
For most purposes, determining whether a default occurred in a country's debt falls to ratings agencies like Fitch and Moody's. But for the derivatives market, a committee of I.S.D.A. makes the call.
If the committee decides there was a default, it passes the baton to Markit, which is partly owned by the banks. Markit holds an auction to determine how much value has been lost on the debt, and that determines how much money is paid out to the parties that purchased the insurance.
Marc Barrachin, who runs the auctions, said there was no reason to worry about the process.
''The process is very smooth, very well understood by market participants,'' said Mr. Barrachin, the director of credit products at Markit. ''I mean if you go back to 2008 right in the fall, in five days we had auctions for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Lehman Brothers, and two weeks after that you had Washington Mutual. I go back to that period of stress and the orderly settlements of large amounts of credit derivatives, for names that were widely followed, were testament of the efficiency of the auction system.''
In the case of A.I.G., there was not an unwind process run by I.S.D.A. because A.I.G.'s contracts were tied to mortgage bonds. Those sorts of derivatives pay out money over time, whereas derivatives tied to a country's debt pay out on one occasion: if a default occurs. That makes sovereign derivatives more similar to derivatives on corporate bonds and different in some ways from the situation at A.I.G.
But the smoothness of the process would be irrelevant if the risk were concentrated in just a few weak institutions.
The uncertainty around how a sovereign default would course through the derivatives market had greatly increased the price premiums banks were charging to put on new derivatives trades related to European countries. As of last week, the price to insure against default on $10 million of Greek debt was $1.9 million per year, up from $775,000 a year ago, according to Markit.
''There is lack of transparency and visibility in these products, and that increases the risk,'' said Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, a boutique banking firm in New York.

HEADLINE: Focus on Prescription Records Leads to Arrest in 4 Killings

BYLINE: By AL BAKER and JOSEPH GOLDSTEIN; Angela Macropoulos, Anahad O'Connor and Nate Schweber contributed reporting.

 BODY:
On a winding road in Medford, N.Y., about two miles from the pharmacy where four people were killed over the weekend, a squad of police vehicles converged on a neat Cape Cod-style house on Wednesday morning.
Stacey Bohlert, who lives next door on Pitchpine Place, called her mother to say she thought a killer might be in the backyard. There were probably about 20 officers, in plainclothes and in uniform, said Peter Spano, who was doing siding work two doors down. It looked like a SWAT team, Mr. Spano, 52, said.
There was no apparent struggle or difficulty inside. The officers came out escorting a gaunt man, later identified as David Laffer, and arrested him in connection with the killings at the pharmacy, Haven Drugs, several law enforcement officials said. The crime appeared to have been the most severe example of a national epidemic involving drugstore robberies by prescription drug addicts. 
Mr. Laffer, 33, was taken to the Suffolk County police headquarters in Yaphank for questioning and later charged with first-degree murder and with resisting arrest. His wife, Melinda Brady, 29, was charged with third-degree robbery. They were scheduled to be arraigned Thursday at district court in Central Islip.
The arrests and charges were products of hundreds of tips that came in after surveillance images of a suspect were made public. The assailant came with a backpack, and inventory showed that the primary type of drug he stole that morning was hydrocodone, the main ingredient in Vicodin. More than 11,000 hydrocodone pills were missing, according to a law enforcement official who insisted on anonymity because the investigation was continuing.
The gunman also stole unspecified quantities of two other medications, promethazine and cheratussin, found in a popular recreational drug beverage called Purple Drank, the official said.
The burst of violence at Haven Drugs occurred shortly after 10 a.m., and the suspect was quickly labeled a ''drug user'' by law enforcement officials, who said no money was taken.
Detectives interviewed physicians who prescribe painkiller medication, as they sought to focus on people who might have an interest in obtaining pharmaceutical drugs.
A prosecutor in the Office of the Special Narcotics Prosecutor for New York City re-examined prescription records that the office had in its possession, another law enforcement official said. Those records are part of continuing long-term investigations into prescription drug diversion, the official said.
Mr. Laffer's name caught the prosecutor's attention because he lived in Medford and previously filled hydrocodone prescriptions at Haven Drugs, the official said, adding that the office also learned that Mr. Laffer had a pistol permit. The official said Ms. Brady had also filled oxycodone prescriptions, though there was no evidence she had ever filled them at Haven Drugs.
After comparing Mr. Laffer's driver's license photo with the images captured on the surveillance video at Haven Drugs, investigators in the Office of the Special Narcotics Prosecutor believed they had discovered a possible suspect, and passed on the information to the authorities in Suffolk County.
There are indications that Mr. Laffer had already come to the attention of the Suffolk authorities by then.
If Mr. Laffer had indeed become a chronic drug user who committed the killings, it would be a sharp, surprising turn for the young man. Four years ago, he and Ms. Brady married at Giorgio's on the North Shore of Long Island, after proposing to her at a hockey game.
But Mr. Laffer's apparent addiction to painkillers led him to the low-slung interior of Haven Drugs, officials said.
More than 1,800 pharmacy robberies have taken place across the country over the last three years, though few if any involved mass killings. Last year, the Suffolk County Police Department recorded eight robberies of pharmacies in the area it polices, which excludes some towns in the county. So far this year, there have been four, including the one on Sunday.
Two customers were fatally shot, Jaime Taccetta, 33, and Bryon Sheffield, 71; and so were two employees, Raymond Ferguson, 45, a pharmacist, and Jennifer Mejia, 17, a high school student.
By Wednesday evening, the Suffolk authorities had not charged anyone in the robbery and killings. One investigator said the investigation was ''ongoing,'' and around 5:30 p.m., officers led Mr. Laffer, dressed in a white jumpsuit, from the back of police headquarters.
In a statement, the Suffolk County executive, Steve Levy, praised the police arrest and the work ''to rapidly bring into custody an individual suspected in the heinous quadruple murder that took place just three days ago,'' but he pointedly did not name the man.
Those who knew Mr. Laffer described him as energetic and kind. He was a fan of the Islanders and was extremely competitive in a local dek hockey league, playing goalie and defense with tremendous heart.
''He was very nice,'' said Trish Bohlert, a neighbor who attended Mr. Laffer's wedding. ''He seemed very happy.''
Paul Rubell, a lawyer for COSA Instrument Corporation, said Mr. Laffer was a former employee, but declined to provide more details. The company produces and distributes measuring instruments.
Andrew Oliveri, 31, who played for four years with Mr. Laffer on a team called the Dragons, was incredulous that his name had surfaced in connection with the killings. Yet, Mr. Oliveri said he had heard a couple of years ago that Mr. Laffer ''was starting to get into things he wasn't normally doing.''
Ms. Bohlert said she heard that Mr. Laffer had been recently unemployed and that his wife had been jobless for at least a year. Mr. Spano was more direct in his appraisal of Mr. Laffer, saying, ''He looked like he was somebody coming close to death.''

HEADLINE: China Moves Closer to Libyan Opposition

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
BEIJING -- China's foreign minister met here with the leader of Libya's rebel opposition on Wednesday and said in a statement afterward that the opposition was ''an important dialogue partner,'' the latest in a series of Chinese moves to improve ties to the opposition.
Yang Jiechi, the foreign minister, declared after his meeting with the rebel leader, Mahmoud Jibril, that the opposition ''has been increasingly representing the Libyan people and has gradually become an important political force in Libya.'' Mr. Yang repeated China's calls for a negotiated peaceful settlement to the conflict. 
China has consistently preached nonintervention in recent years and has opposed international efforts to put pressure on even repressive governments like those in Zimbabwe, Sudan, Myanmar and North Korea. When the United Nations Security Council voted in March to authorize airstrikes against Colonel Qaddafi's forces to prevent them from killing civilians in opposition areas, China was one of five countries that abstained.
China's departure from its usual reticence toward political opposition groups has prompted significant discussion among experts on China's foreign policy, with the main focus on the country's shift from being an oil exporter as recently as the early 1990s to importing half its oil now.
''It's unusual for them to negotiate with anyone other than the incumbent government, but clearly China has oil interests,'' said Ben Simpfendorfer, the managing director of Silk Road Associates, an economic and political consultancy in Hong Kong that focuses on China's relations with the Middle East.
Libya was a large oil exporter until the recent civil conflict halted shipments.
Mr. Yang said in his statement that China was not just looking out for its own interests. ''China has no interest to seek any gain on the Libya issue,'' he said in the statement. ''China considers the crisis as internal politics of Libya. China believes that the future of Libya should be decided by the Libyan people.''
The statement on Wednesday said that Mr. Jibril had agreed that the opposition would protect the people and assets of Chinese companies in territory that the opposition controls.
Mr. Jibril is the chairman of the executive board of the Libyan opposition's National Transitional Council.
Strong criticism of Colonel Qaddafi by other Arab countries, like Qatar, as well as efforts by African leaders to negotiate a settlement in Libya may have made China more willing to depart from its usual practice of avoiding contact with opposition groups, Mr. Simpfendorfer said.
China buys half of its oil and gas from the Middle East, and now buys more oil and oil products from Saudi Arabia, for example, than the United States does.
China also buys sizable quantities of oil from Libya, although less than it buys from Saudi Arabia. China purchased $4.45 billion worth of Libyan crude oil last year, according to data from Global Trade Information Services Inc., a data service based in Columbia, S.C.
China's ambassador to Qatar, Zhang Zhiliang, met another Libyan opposition leader in Doha on June 2. Chen Xiaodong, the director general of the West Asian and North African Affairs Department of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said a week later that China would welcome a visit by Libyan opposition envoys.
''China believes that the Libyan opposition National Transitional Council has become an important political force in Libya,'' Mr. Hong said on Tuesday. ''We would like to remain in contact with the N.T.C. and work towards a political solution.''

HEADLINE: Shares Slip as Fed Shaves Growth Forecast

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Stocks declined on Wednesday, halting a four-day rally, after the Federal Reserve lowered its forecast for economic growth and said it planned to end its $600 billion debt-purchase program this month as scheduled.
Adobe Systems, the world's largest maker of graphic design software, retreated 6.3 percent after reporting lower-than-expected sales in Europe. Sprint Nextel fell 2.3 percent as Sanford C. Bernstein & Company said the company faced risks from its strategy for fourth-generation phones. But FedEx, operator of the world's biggest cargo airline and considered a proxy for the economy, advanced 2.6 percent after forecasting earnings that may top analysts' projections.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 8.38 points, or 0.65 percent, to 1,287.14 after rallying 2.4 percent over the previous four days. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 80.34 points, or 0.66 percent, to 12,109.67. The Nasdaq composite average fell 18.07 points, or 0.67 percent, to 2,669.19. 
''The Fed is pretty conscious of the fact that the economy has softened,'' said Liam F. Dalton, president of Axiom Capital Management in New York. ''Even though the economy may stabilize, it's a less exciting picture right now. Stock players are going to be a little more reluctant to take risks.''
The S.& P. 500 has retreated 5.6 percent from this year's high at the end of April amid weaker-than-estimated economic data and concern about Europe's debt crisis. The benchmark gauge for American equities was still up 2.3 percent in 2011 on government stimulus measures and better-than-expected earnings.
Fed officials lowered their forecasts for growth and employment this year and next, projecting the economy will expand 2.7 to 2.9 percent this year, down from forecasts ranging from 3.1 to 3.3 percent in April. The central bankers said inflation, excluding food and energy, would be somewhat higher than previously forecast. They said the pace of recovery was likely to ''pick up over coming quarters.''
Adobe fell 6.3 percent, to $30.01. The company dealt with uneven overseas sales in the second quarter while readying a new version of its flagship Creative Suite software. Europe was weaker than anticipated primarily because customers in Scandinavia and Britain held back purchases, the chief financial officer, Mark Garrett, said in a conference call.
Adobe also said profit for the third quarter may be as low as 50 cents a share, compared with the 54-cent average analyst projection, excluding certain items.
Sprint Nextel declined 2.3 percent to $5.12. Investors are optimistic about a turnaround, according to Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. ''We remain concerned that the stock does not fully discount the financing risks associated with building a 4G network, and that subscriber forecasts remain overly optimistic given deterioration in overall postpaid market trends,'' he wrote in a report.
FedEx climbed 2.6 percent to $91.44. The company is benefiting from a pickup in worldwide shipping and higher pricing. The express unit's overall revenue per package, or yield, added 10 percent to $22.69 in the quarter through May, FedEx said.
CarMax gained 7 percent, the most in the S.& P. 500, to $32.66. The company, largest seller of used cars in the nation, sold more vehicles at higher prices in its first fiscal quarter.
Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note was unchanged at 101 8/32, with its yield at 2.98 percent.

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and HELENE COOPER; Thom Shanker and Mark Mazzetti contributed reporting from Washington, and Alissa J. Rubin from Kabul, Afghanistan.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama declared Wednesday that the United States had largely achieved its goals in Afghanistan, setting in motion a substantial withdrawal of American troops in an acknowledgment of the shifting threat in the region and the fast-changing political and economic landscape in a war-weary America.
Asserting that the country that served as a base for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks no longer represented a terrorist threat to the United States, Mr. Obama declared that the ''tide of war is receding.'' And in a blunt recognition of domestic economic strains, he said, ''America, it is time to focus on nation-building here at home.''
Mr. Obama announced plans to withdraw 10,000 troops from Afghanistan by the end of this year. The remaining 20,000 troops from the 2009 ''surge'' of forces would leave by next summer, amounting to about a third of the 100,000 troops now in the country. He said the drawdown would continue ''at a steady pace'' until the United States handed over security to the Afghan authorities in 2014. 
The troop reductions, which were decided after a short but fierce internal debate, will be both deeper and faster than the recommendations made by Mr. Obama's military commanders, and they will come as the president faces relentless budget pressures, an increasingly restive American public and a re-election campaign next year.
Mr. Obama, speaking in businesslike tones during a 15-minute address from the East Room of the White House, talked of ending America's longest war and of the painful lessons he thought could be taken from it. While justifying the nation's decade-long commitment, he talked of ''ending the war responsibly'' and warned of the perils of overextending the military by sending large numbers of soldiers into combat. He acknowledged that huge challenges remained before an end to the conflict that has cost hundreds of billions of dollars and 1,500 American lives.
The withdrawals would begin winding down the military's counterinsurgency strategy, which Mr. Obama adopted 18 months ago. Administration officials indicated that they now planned to place more emphasis on focused clandestine counterterrorism operations of the kind that killed Osama bin Laden, which the president cited as Exhibit A in the case for a substantial American troop reduction.
''We are starting this drawdown from a position of strength,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Al Qaeda is under more pressure than at any time since 9/11.'' He said that an intense campaign of drone strikes and other covert operations in Pakistan had crippled Al Qaeda's original network in the region, leaving its leaders either dead or pinned down in the rugged border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Of 30 top Qaeda leaders identified by American intelligence, 20 have been killed in the last year and a half, administration officials said.
But the withdrawal of the entire surge force by the end of next summer will significantly change the way that the United States wages war in Afghanistan, analysts said, suggesting that the administration may have concluded it can no longer achieve its loftiest ambitions there.
Mr. Obama acknowledged as much in his remarks. ''We will not try to make Afghanistan a perfect place,'' he said. ''We will not police its streets or patrol its mountains indefinitely. That is the responsibility of the Afghan government.''
Mr. Obama's decision is a victory for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has long argued for curtailing the military operation in Afghanistan. Mr. Obama indicated a willingness to move toward more focused covert operations of the type that the United States is conducting in Pakistan, Yemen and elsewhere. ''When threatened, we must respond with force,'' he said. ''But when that force can be targeted, we need not deploy large armies overseas.''
The pace of the withdrawal is a setback for the president's top commander in Afghanistan, Gen. David H. Petraeus, who has been named director of the Central Intelligence Agency. General Petraeus did not endorse the decision, said another official. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates argued publicly against a too-hasty withdrawal of troops, but he said in a statement on Wednesday that he supported Mr. Obama's decision.
During the internal debate, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton also expressed reservations about the scale of the reductions, officials said.
General Petraeus had recommended limiting withdrawals to 5,000 troops this year and another 5,000 over the winter.
He and other military commanders argued that the 18 months since Mr. Obama announced the troop increase did not allow for enough time for the Americans to consolidate the fragile gains that they had made in Helmand and other provinces.
But troops have succeeded in clearing many towns and cities of insurgents, and then keeping them safe so that markets were able to reopen and girls could go to school, for example.
Military officials say the withdrawal of American troops will impose limits on which areas of the country can be pacified. In particular, plans to pivot extra American troops from south and southwestern Afghanistan to volatile areas in the east, along the Pakistan border, will be curtailed or even canceled, officials said.
The effort to transfer responsibility for security to Afghan forces remains elusive because the Afghan troops are proving unprepared for the job. Corruption in the government of President Hamid Karzai continues to be rampant, sapping the confidence of many Afghans.
Still, the growing disenchantment in the United States with the war, particularly given the ballooning national debt, the country's slow economic recovery and the whopping $120 billion price tag of the Afghan conflict this year alone, were all considerations weighed by the president. ''Over the last decade, we have spent a trillion dollars on war at a time of rising debt and hard economic times,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Now, we must invest in America's greatest resource: our people.''
Republican presidential candidates including Mitt Romney and Jon M. Huntsman Jr. are demanding a swift withdrawal from Afghanistan, while Democrats complain that the cost of the war is siphoning money away from efforts to create jobs in the United States. Representative Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California, called on Mr. Obama to speed the withdrawal. ''If we're going to leave, we should leave,'' he said in a statement. ''The centralized system of government foisted upon the Afghan people is not going to hold after we leave. So let's quit prolonging the agony and the inevitable.''
Highlighting the unusual political splits the war is causing, other Republicans criticized the president for pulling out too soon. Representative Mike Rogers, the Michigan Republican who is chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, suggested that Mr. Obama was playing politics with the troop reduction, saying, ''The president is trying to find a political solution with a military component, when it needs to be the other way around.'' He said the situation in Afghanistan was ''very precarious,'' and that the White House seemed to be panicking about the levels of violence.
Mr. Obama's speech, delivered at dawn on Thursday, Kabul time, is expected to be the subject of a speech by Afghanistan's president, Hamid Karzai, scheduled for later in the day. Senior figures in Mr. Karzai's administration began signaling that they were comfortable with the withdrawal of 10,000 troops by year's end.
Gen. Mohammad Zahir Azimi, a spokesman for the Defense Ministry, said the Afghan National Army ''has this capability and quantity to fill the gap of those places where the foreign troops withdraw and leave Afghanistan.''
''We are ready,'' General Azimi said.
Muhammad Siddique Aziz, an adviser to Mr. Karzai on tribal affairs, said the withdrawal plan was acceptable, but he warned against a complete withdrawal of American troops before the Afghan government was strong enough to administer the country on its own. ''I think they have to concentrate more on the Afghan government so when they leave, the government can stand up on its own,'' Mr. Aziz said.

HEADLINE: Some Greeks Fear Government Is Selling Nation to Help Save It

BYLINE: By RACHEL DONADIO and STEVEN ERLANGER; Rachel Donadio reported from Athens, and Steven Erlanger from Paris.

 BODY:
ATHENS -- They are the crown jewels of Greece's socialist state, and they are now likely to go to the highest bidder: the ports of Piraeus and Thessaloniki; prime Mediterranean real estate; the national lottery; Greek Telecom; the postal bank and the national railway system.
And then comes the mandated deeper round of austerity measures, which will slash the wages of police officers, firefighters and other state workers who are protesting in Athens, and raise the taxes of citizens already inflamed by a recession-plagued economy and soaring joblessness.
After winning a pivotal confidence vote on his new cabinet on Tuesday, Prime Minister George Papandreou now has an even tougher task: to carry out a radical remedy of forced auctions and fiscal austerity for a sickened economy already in a deep slump.
The European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, known as the ''troika,'' say that is the only way out for a heavily indebted Greece, while some economists say the program resembles medieval bloodletting -- a dose of pain highly unlikely to revive the patient. 
Mr. Papandreou's first task is to persuade his governing Socialist Party to pass a bill that would save or raise about $40 billion by 2015, equivalent to 12 percent of Greece's gross domestic product, through wage cuts and tax increases, at a time when the economy is shrinking.
To put that in perspective, spending cuts and tax increases of a similar scale in the United States would amount to $1.75 trillion, considerably more sweeping than even the most far-reaching proposals for reducing the American federal budget deficit. And Greece has promised to generate another $72 billion by selling off prime state assets, which many Greeks consider a fire sale of national patrimony.
While the commitment to austerity will allow Greece access to a fresh infusion of international aid, a growing chorus of economists say that the government's new program will at best delay default and a restructuring of its debt, which is already more than 150 percent of the country's gross domestic product. Steeper budget cuts and tax increases, they say, are the enemy of economic growth, which Greece desperately needs to make its debt burden lighter.
''You cannot keep on milking the cow without feeding it,'' said Konstantinos Mihalos, the president of the Hellenic Chamber of Commerce in Athens.
In fact many economists fear Greece has already entered a ''debt trap,'' where paying the interest on its mound of debt requires more and more loans. ''The Greeks have been told to accept more of the medicine that has already failed to treat the disease,'' said Simon Tilford, chief economist at the Center for European Reform in London.
The Greeks have already reduced their deficit by five percentage points of the gross domestic product, ''unprecedented cuts in a modern economy,'' Mr. Tilford said. ''But the cuts have had a much stronger negative impact on the economy than the troika imagined, and fiscal austerity has pushed the economy deep into recession. Debt can only be paid out of income, and that means growth.''
Greece does not have access to many tools to fight recession, like devaluing its currency or cutting interest rates, at least as long as it remains a member of the euro zone. Its monetary policy is controlled by the European Central Bank.
Some independent economists accept that Greece has no choice but to try a fresh round of cuts. Edwin M. Truman of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington said Greece had to go through more pain because it had run a budget deficit even before making payments on its debt, meaning it needed loans to pay off its loans.
Only after Greece reorganizes its budget, tax collection and labor market and is running a surplus -- not including interest payments on the debt -- can economists begin to calculate how much in debt payments Greece is actually able to afford, and then figure out how big a debt restructuring it needs.
''As long as they're running a primary deficit, they need to keep tightening the belt,'' Mr. Truman said. ''Rescheduling now doesn't relieve Greece of the burden of fixing the economy to create a surplus.''
It is not getting any easier. In the year since its first bailout, Greece has cut $17 billion through across-the-board wage cuts, layoffs and attrition in its bloated state sector, which employs 800,000 people, a quarter of the Greek work force. But given its recession, the economy shrank and tax revenues fell, meaning that Greece did not meet the original target of a government deficit of 9.1 percent of G.D.P. as agreed with its foreign lenders, prompting them to demand more cuts.
European demands have placed Mr. Papandreou in an increasingly untenable position. He must sell the increasingly restive Greek people on more austerity with no clear signs of recovery. And he has to persuade his Socialist Party on reforms that undo almost everything the party has stood for in the past.
At least one Socialist member of Parliament, Alexandros Athanasiadis, has already announced that he will not vote for the new austerity measures, citing his opposition to selling part of the state's stake in the electricity utility whose power plants dominate his district in northeastern Greece.
On Wednesday, members of the public power company union, Genop, occupied the Transport Ministry and orchestrated some power failures to protest the sale, which seeks to reduce the state's stake to 34 percent from 51 percent in the profitable company.
To many Greeks, selling that and many other state-owned companies and assets, even those that currently lose money, is tantamount to a loss of sovereignty -- especially if wealthy investors from Germany and the other big European powers pushing austerity of Greece end up purchasing the assets for a hefty discount.
''We've always been advocates of privatization because the national state cannot play the role of the entrepreneur and has in fact proven to be a complete disaster every time they attempt to do so,'' said Mr. Mihalos of the Athens Chamber of Commerce.
''But at these extremely low levels, especially for those companies quoted on the stock exchange, we have to be very wary,'' he added. ''If we go by today's values, as a result of the recession and the crisis the country finds itself in, it will be really selling the crown jewels at a pittance of their cost.''
Mr. Papandreou's government has not managed to make a convincing case for the sell-off to many Greeks, where the idea of a fire sale has taken hold, setting off a wave of national indignation. ''Imagine if you asked me for my apartment, and I gave you the whole building,'' said Dorothea Ekonomopoulou, a public school teacher in Athens, as she stood among demonstrators in Syntagma Square this week.

HEADLINE: FedEx Credits Its Cost Controls as Profit Rises 33%, Exceeding Forecasts

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The FedEx Corporation's quarterly profit and outlook beat forecasts on Wednesday as higher shipping rates and tight cost controls more than offset a slowing economic recovery and high fuel prices. 
The company said it would spend more on technology and fuel-efficient aircraft, helping to increase revenue per package.
''Our actions to improve yields continue to drive revenue and earnings growth across our transportation segments,'' FedEx's chief financial officer, Alan B. Graf Jr., said.
''Even with higher planned capital spending in fiscal 2012, margins, cash flows and returns are expected to improve year over year.''
FedEx, which ranks No. 2 behind United Parcel Service among package shipping companies, has been able to pass through higher costs via fuel surcharges and still has room to raise prices without widespread retaliation from consumers, many analysts said.
''Pricing and expense control'' drove FedEx earnings up even as it navigated harsh weather, an economic soft patch and supply chain disruptions caused by Japan's earthquake, and lofty fuel costs, said Peter Nesvold, a Jefferies & Company analyst.
FedEx's chief executive, Frederick W. Smith, said the combination of rising fuel prices, the devastation in Japan and consumer sentiment contributed to the slowing of the economic recovery. However, he said he expected a turnaround now that crude oil prices were retreating.
FedEx predicted that consumer spending, industrial production and gross domestic product would improve in the second half of 2011. FedEx said its profit rose 33 percent, to $558 million, or $1.75 a share, from $419 million, or $1.33 a share, a year earlier.
Analysts, on average, forecast a profit of $1.72 a share.
FedEx forecast its fiscal 2012 profit rising to $6.35 to $6.85 a share, allowing for oil's volatility, Mr. Graf said. The midpoint of $6.60 topped analyst forecasts.
Revenue in the period, which ended May 31 and was the fourth quarter of FedEx's fiscal year, rose 12 percent, to $10.55 billion from $9.43 billion.
FedEx Express and the less expensive ground segments, which account for more than 80 percent of the company's revenue, had revenue growth of more than 10 percent in the quarter.
Fast-growing e-commerce drove up FedEx's SmartPost average daily volume 24 percent as revenue per package rose 8 percent. SmartPost involves shipping packages to the United States Postal Service, which in turn delivers to residences.
FedEx's freight division posted a long-awaited return to profitability after two company segments were combined.
Stock in FedEx, which is based in Memphis, rose $2.31, or 2.6 percent, to $91.44 a share.

HEADLINE: Sanctions Are Similar To War, Syria Says

BYLINE: By NADA BAKRI

 BODY:
BEIRUT, Lebanon -- The Syrian foreign minister on Wednesday denounced new European sanctions aimed at top military and government officials, saying in a televised news conference that they were ''targeting the livelihood of the Syrian citizens'' and ''tantamount to war.''
The minister, Walid al-Moallem, spoke the day after the European Union extended sanctions to four Syrian firms linked to the country's armed forces and a number of officials who are believed to be involved in the brutal crackdown against protesters seeking to end four decades of Assad family rule. 
In May, the United States imposed sanctions on President Bashar al-Assad and six other senior Syrian officials, and the European Union followed suit a few days later.
Both the United States and the European Union added other sanctions -- including some focused on Mr. Assad himself -- as the Syrian crackdown grew in intensity. But Syrian officials are thought to be more concerned with steps by Europe, given its proximity to Syria and closer economic ties.
On Monday, Mr. Assad delivered his third speech since the protests erupted in mid-March, calling for a national dialogue and promising somewhat vague reforms. Some opposition figures said there were positive elements in the speech, though many denounced the initiative as coming too late and not going far enough.
Mr. Moallem followed with warnings on Wednesday against foreign meddling and threats to shift Syria's orientation away from the West, reversing initiatives Mr. Assad had planned before the unrest that called for Turkey to serve as the country's gateway to Europe.
''We will forget that Europe is on the map,'' he added. ''And we will turn to the east, to the south and all directions that extend a hand to Syria. The world is not only Europe, and Syria will remain steadfast like always.''
The foreign minister also said that despite mounting foreign pressure on Damascus over the crackdown, from friends like Turkey and foes in Europe and the United States, he was confident that there would be no international military intervention.
Syria has suffered international isolation for years, only to re-emerge as crises subside. But the steps taken by Europe and the United States have made Syria more isolated than it has been in decades. Even Turkey, long reluctant to criticize its southern neighbor, has become sharper in its condemnations, testing the friendship that Mr. Assad has built with its prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
In his speech, Mr. Moallem made several appeals to Turkey to rethink its position. ''I don't want to analyze the Turkish reasons, but I tell some friends to reconsider their decisions,'' he said. ''We want the best relations with Turkey.''
Mr. Moallem also denied that Iran and Hezbollah, the Shiite Lebanese militant group, had intervened militarily to aid Syria in crushing the antigovernment protests. Some opposition figures have contended that foreigners have participated in a crackdown that has stretched across the country. He also accused Al Qaeda of being behind some of the violence, judging by the pattern and style of killings of security personnel and soldiers.
''I cannot hide the fact that some of the practices that we have seen in the killings of security personnel'' indicate that these acts were carried out by Al Qaeda, he said.
Mr. Assad pledged in his Monday speech to introduce reforms and invited Syrians to a dialogue. But political opponents and world leaders dismissed the promises as killings and arrests continued after the speech. Human rights groups have said that at least 1,300 civilians have died since the uprising started, and thousands have been detained without charges.
The European Union barred Mr. Assad and other top Syrian officials from traveling to Europe in May, and European officials said more names were expected to be added to the list.

HEADLINE: As U.S. Pulls Back, Fears Abound Over Toll on Afghan Economy

BYLINE: By ALISSA J. RUBIN

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- While President Obama's announcement of troop reductions is not expected to change much here right away, American and Afghan officials are already worrying about the impact of the eventual withdrawal of international forces on Afghanistan's struggling economy.
Very little will happen immediately. ''What's going to be different 24 hours after the president's speech? Nothing,'' said a senior American official in Kabul. 
Over the next three years, however, as the American military and civilian presence -- and spending -- decrease, thousands of jobs will end for Afghans who work at or around bases and under grants and contracts financed by the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development.
Afghans and American civilian and military planners fear that the country will fall into an economic abyss, sending some Afghans back into the insurgency and deepening the poverty of people throughout the country.
''We've had remarkable achievements, but can they make up the gap with the hit from the withdrawal of the war economy? That would be a stretch,'' said a senior United States official.
The number of American civilians working in the field and the amount of American spending are expected to plunge over the next three and a half years, with much of the shrinkage coming in 2013 and 2014, said American officials and diplomats in Kabul and the provinces.
The hope is that gradually the private sector will begin to create some jobs, but that possibility still seems to be years away.
The provincial reconstruction teams that set up projects and distribute grants in all 34 provinces will end their work by the end of 2014 and relocate to four urban centers: Herat, Mazar-e-Sharif, Kandahar and Jalalabad.
Civilian teams in the districts, which operate in many rural of Afghanistan's rural areas, will leave as well, said a senior American official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to comment publicly on the delicate subject. At least two provincial reconstruction teams -- in Panshir Province and Bamian Province -- will end leave in the next six months.
Over the next three and a half years all programs and projects will be handled by teams based in the four urban areas, and their travel will be determined by the security situation, said United States officials in Kabul. While that is the expectation, the distances they would have to travel and the possibility that once NATO troops leave security will decline in some areas suggests that planners setting up development projects could be far more selective, officials said.
For instance, road building, which has been troubled by corruption and payoffs to security companies that often had links to insurgents, is winding down, but there will continue to be efforts to improve the supply of electricity.
Development spending, which was $4.2 billion in 2010 and was managed by the State Department and the Agency for International Development, has already declined to about $2.5 billion this year and is expected to stay at roughly that level in 2012, officials said this week in Kabul. But after that, spending is likely to decline further ''as Afghanistan becomes a normal country,'' a senior American official said.
Nearly 10 years after the NATO coalition entered the country, officials say that although there are hopeful signs among young Afghans who are working in areas like public health and education, only ''a thin layer'' of people have the potential to move the country forward.
Opium remains the most lucrative crop for Afghanistan's farmers, meaning that despite enormous efforts and millions of dollars spent on alternative crop programs by both Britain and the United States to move farmers into other work, progress is ''very slow,'' said a senior United States official.
All future development plans are based on the assumption that Afghanistan will become more stable and that financing for U.S.A.I.D. projects and the State Department's foreign aid programs will be ''robust,'' officials said. If that turns out to be wrong, all bets are off.

HEADLINE: Fed to Defer New Efforts For Growth

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- And at the end of June, the Federal Reserve finished its work and rested.
The nation's central bank said Wednesday that it would complete the planned purchase of $600 billion in Treasury securities next week, then pause its three-year-old economic rescue campaign, leaving in place existing aid programs, but doing nothing more, for now, to bolster growth.
At the same time, the Fed said the economy was expanding less quickly than it had predicted. It now projects a growth rate of 2.7 percent to 2.9 percent in 2011, and 3.3 percent to 3.7 percent in 2012. Both estimates are markedly below its last forecast in April.
As growth has sputtered this year, economists have pointed to higher oil prices, the Japanese earthquake, bad weather, a lack of confidence. The unifying theme was that spending and investment would surge as these temporary impediments subsided. The Fed's latest forecast, however, reflects the surprising weight of deeper and more intractable problems, including unsustainable public and private debts, the wreckage of the housing market and trade imbalances. 
Roughly 25 million Americans were unable to find full-time work in May, and the central bank projects that most of those people will remain unemployed for years to come.
''We don't have a precise read on why this slower pace of growth is persisting,'' the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said Wednesday at a news conference. ''Some of the headwinds that have been concerning us, like the weakness in the financial sector, problems in the housing sector, balance sheet and deleveraging issues, may be stronger and more persistent than we thought.''
The markets had been up for much of the day but began falling after the news conference started. The Dow Jones industrial average, which was as high as 12,207.99 in the morning, turned sharply lower after 2:30 p.m., ending the day down 80.34 points at 12,109.67.
Mr. Bernanke dismissed for now any possibility that the Fed would extend its efforts to stimulate growth, saying that the economy was moving in the right direction. The slow pace of the recovery justified the Fed in continuing its existing efforts, he said, but not more.
The Fed's policy board, the Federal Open Market Committee, voted unanimously to maintain its two-year-old commitment to hold a benchmark interest rate near zero ''for an extended period.'' Mr. Bernanke said the language meant it would not raise interest rates for ''at least two or three meetings,'' pushing back to November the earliest moment rates could rise. Economists consider it likely that the central bank will hold interest rates near zero well into next year.
The board also voted to maintain the Fed's portfolio of more than $2 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities by reinvesting principal payments. The board did not indicate how long this policy would continue, a decision that Mr. Bernanke described as intentional. Fed officials have said that allowing the portfolio to dwindle is likely to be the first step when the central bank decides to begin the withdrawal of its aid programs.
''The economic recovery is continuing at a moderate pace, though somewhat more slowly than the committee had expected. Also, recent labor market indicators have been weaker than anticipated,'' the Fed said before Mr. Bernanke's news conference. ''However, the committee expects the pace of recovery to pick up over coming quarters and the unemployment rate to resume its gradual decline.''
Automakers, for example, already are planning sharp increases in production to compensate for the disruptions caused by the Japanese earthquake. Prices for new and used cars have climbed sharply in recent months, suggesting that there is considerable pent-up demand.
The Fed has undertaken a series of unprecedented programs since 2008 to arrest the financial crisis and to revive the economy. The central bank first paused its efforts in the spring of 2010, as the economy appeared to be finding its own momentum, only to begin a new round of aid later in the year, as those signs of progress proved to be fleeting.
Now the Fed is standing back again to see if the economy can grow without constant prodding. ''A little bit of time to see what's going to happen is useful in making policy decisions,'' Mr. Bernanke said. He allowed, however, that the Fed could take additional steps, from declaring a longer period of near-zero interest rates to buying even more assets.
''We suspect that the Fed will stay on the sidelines for this year,'' Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients. ''As far as next year is concerned, in an environment where core inflation is falling again and economic growth remains muted, we still think that the Fed is more likely to loosen rather than tighten monetary policy.''
The Fed projected that the unemployment rate would stand between 8.6 percent and 8.9 percent at the end of 2011, down slightly from the current rate of 9.1 percent, and that unemployment would be 7.8 percent to 8.2 percent by the end of 2012.
Ordinarily that would be a clear reason for the Fed to intervene. But the central bank increasingly is concerned about inflation. It aims to keep price increases at a steady rate of about 2 percent a year. The prices of oil and other commodities, which spiked this year, have begun to recede. But broader measures of prices have also climbed, exceeding that 2 percent goal.
The Fed's judgment is that those increases are most likely to taper off. The prices of long-term investments continue to reflect little concern about inflation. But the increases have been sufficient to convince the Fed's board -- even members who generally believe in acting aggressively to create jobs -- that the Fed cannot afford to expand aid programs.
The European debt crisis and the debate in Washington over the federal deficit also pose challenges for the Fed's management of the economy. Mr. Bernanke said that a ''disorderly default'' by Greece or another European country would unsettle financial markets and could have significant consequences for the American economy. He also renewed his warning that short-term cuts in government spending could retard growth, while at the same time urging a long-term deficit reduction plan, which he said could spur short-term growth.
The policy board next meets on Aug. 9.
Online Correction: June 22, 2011, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article understated the size of the Federal Reserve's portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. It is more than $2 trillion, not $2 billion.

HEADLINE: The Indiana Exception? Yes, but...

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL and MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
INDIANAPOLIS -- Gov. Mitch Daniels sits in his grand cave of a Renaissance Revival office and reviews Indiana's economic fortunes, his self-effacing manner not entirely disguising satisfaction. The state's pension funds are relatively healthy, the unemployment rate is dropping slowly and per capita income is ticking up, slowly.
Such bragging rights are steps toward his goal, Mr. Daniels says, of overcoming Indiana's image as a ''nondescript'' state.
''Look, people think fiscal solvency, they think Indiana,'' he says. ''People think great business climate, Indiana comes to mind. People think infrastructure, we're exactly who they think of.'' 
Because recessionary winds have not toppled Indiana's house, this state is often overlooked in the news coverage of budget crises across the nation -- particularly since its next-door neighbor Illinois offers such an outsize example of the financial ills afflicting state and local budgets.
But Indiana is no world apart, even if Mr. Daniels would like to suggest it is. Large cracks have opened in its economic foundation, a sign of just how severe the downturn remains.
Mr. Daniels alone cannot take all credit or shoulder blame for the health of Indiana's economy. But it is his work here -- and his reputation as a cost-cutting, tough-on-labor conservative obsessed with fiscal problems -- that fueled interest in his presidential ambitions before he announced that he would not run because of family considerations.
The state also serves as a case study of the often large tradeoffs required to balance the books when political leaders take the possibility of raising income taxes off the table. Fiscal conservatism, in other words, comes with its own costs.
''Much like the rest of the country, we did not survive unscathed,'' said Jessica Fraser, a research analyst with the Indiana Institute for Working Families.
Hundreds of thousands of Indiana residents are unemployed and underemployed. Although the state's unemployment rate is slightly better than that of its neighboring states, a striking number of people here -- a significantly greater percentage than in Illinois or Ohio -- have simply left the work force altogether since the dawn of the recession.
For the second year in a row, Hoosiers ranked fifth nationally in personal bankruptcies, at 7.1 people per 1,000 residents. (Illinois came in 11th.) Indiana's median family income is just 86 percent of that of the rest of the country.
Property tax caps, put in place over the past few years, offer relief to limping homeowners but have pushed school boards and city leaders, they say, into rounds of budget cutting and layoffs.
The governor has streamlined agencies and privatized services, like prison food, printing operations and the state's toll road -- the last reaping $3.8 billion. But Mr. Daniels has made some notable missteps, as well, as when he first handed out and then revoked a contract worth more than $1 billion to determine eligibility for public assistance.
''The idea that we're an island of prosperity makes for a great image, but I would argue that this is the worst shape the state has been in since the Great Depression,'' said Representative B. Patrick Bauer, the Democratic leader in Indiana's House, which is now controlled, as is the Senate, by Republicans. ''We've seen drastic cuts to education, to social services, to public employees. We face problems we're not admitting.''
A Risk-Averse State
Indiana's history shapes its response to economic crisis. It experienced a vast speculative financial collapse in the 19th century, known as the Failure. In 1851, in the angry aftermath, its leaders were among the first in the nation to enact a balanced-budget requirement.
The state's DNA has remained conservative and cautious ever since.
''Indiana is risk averse; it's in the soil and the air,'' said James H. Madison, a history professor at Indiana University Bloomington. ''You add that to a moderate political orientation, and liberal welfare legislation is not highly regarded.''
Indiana is perhaps best understood through the different path it took from its more free-wheeling neighbor Illinois on two issues. Governors and the Legislature in Illinois have for several years skipped making full pension payments and taken all manner of ill-advised risky investments to cover the shortfalls. But a state transportation worker can retire on a livable $35,000 or so a year.
In Indiana, leaders typically strive to make annual pension payments. But benefits are more modest. An employee earning $30,000 a year retires after 25 years with an annual pension of less than $10,000.
Illinois favors a sturdy social safety net, with kindergarten and pre-kindergarten, and higher Medicaid and unemployment insurance benefits. (Its state work force, however, is one of the smallest, per capita, in the nation.) But legislators are reluctant to pass the taxes needed to underwrite such services. Its flat income tax of 3 percent was among the lowest in the nation. Only this year did it raise this tax to 5 percent.
In Indiana, the state income tax is a flat 3.4 percent, but counties and cities also impose income taxes to make up shortfalls. The state's 7 percent sales tax is among the nation's highest.
Indiana, under Mr. Daniels, slashed the state's work force. After hitting nearly 40,000 workers in 1992, the number of people working full time for the state is now fewer than 29,000.
Such fiscal restraint has helped the state bookkeepers -- Indiana's new budget envisions $1 billion in reserves in two years. Many residents, however, struggle with a different reality.
One in three Hoosiers qualifies as low-income now, compared with one in four a decade earlier. And 58 percent of unemployed Indianans have burned through their benefits.
The Real 'Middletown'
Northeast of Indianapolis, Muncie is perhaps best known as the real location for ''Middletown,'' a seminal sociological study published in 1929 examining the effects of industrialization on a city in Middle America. More recently, its economic spine -- automobile manufacturing -- has disintegrated, and tax revenues have stalled. And now officials in Delaware County, which includes Muncie, are seeing big drops in revenue, in part because of caps the state has imposed on property taxes.
Such caps have proven politically popular; many states already have limits, and legislatures elsewhere are weighing similar measures. Here, lawmakers, Republicans and Democrats alike, approved caps in 2008 amid a public outcry over rising tax bills. Last year residents overwhelmingly voted to add the caps to the State Constitution.
Mr. Daniels said it amounted to the biggest net tax cut in state history. (He has not opposed all taxes. He advocated an income tax increase for the wealthy in 2005, and later signed increases in the sales and cigarette taxes.)
Still, as one Delaware County official put it, when combined with the fallout from the downturn, the caps have ''put us over a barrel.''
''The thing that worries me is that you get what you pay for,'' said the official, Kevin Nemyer, a County Council member and a Democrat. ''Will services get down to a minimum so roads aren't fixed, we don't have animal control out there, people aren't getting what they need?''
Delaware County took in nearly $4 million less in revenue in 2010 because of tax caps, and its various townships, districts and other entities received almost $20 million less under the caps.
Not long ago, the County Council reluctantly set out to slash spending, cutting 21 employees, raising health deductibles and ending an exercise program for public workers.
''We had already cut every paper clip, every supply, everything there was to cut, and it was either cutting employees or not pay our bills,'' Mr. Nemyer said.
The cuts keep coming: $8 million last fall, $2 million more from the current budget, and the Council has been searching for an additional $1 million.
Indiana's property tax caps limit bills to 1 percent of the gross assessed value of owner-occupied homes, 2 percent for farms and rental buildings, and 3 percent for businesses. Local authorities can ask voters to break the caps for projects like new schools and jails; so far, the results are mixed, with rejected resolutions outpacing accepted ones.
The state's Department of Local Government Finance says Indiana's counties, cities and towns collected $215 million less in revenues in 2010 than they would have without the tax caps. Townships, library districts, redevelopment commissions and other special districts lost an additional $71 million.
Not all the news in Delaware County is grim. Officials have announced a new locomotive assembly plant and a facility to make wind turbine gears.
But unemployment remains high. And local governments continue to pare back. Residents balked at a proposal to turn off street lights as a money-saving measure, but the signs of stress are clear: Muncie has closed fire stations and a local sewer district has begun aggressively pursuing those who do not pay their bills.
''The state may look good from way up,'' said Mike Jones, another Delaware County Council member. ''But if you get close, it looks a lot different.''
Even with all the relentless budget cutting, more than a few residents say that vanishing businesses -- not tax caps -- are the real problem, and that local governments need to become leaner and more efficient.
''It's not the state's fault that this is happening,'' said Tom Bennington, a former member of the County Council and former vice chairman of the local Republican Party. ''County officials have needed to make some tough decisions for a long time.''
A Backslide for Workers
Yvonne and Brian Meece have been jobless for the better part of two years. He is a roofer. She spent years as a night auditor at a hotel; then her boss stopped paying overtime, then he cut her pay to $8 an hour from $11, then he laid her off.
''No one wants to hire a 56-year-old,'' she says. ''They'll tell you, 'To be truthful, we prefer someone younger.' ''
Mr. Meece, a trim ex-Marine, gets $14 an hour when he works. A decade ago, he earned multiples of that. ''Nothing is union anymore,'' he says. ''You're just a day laborer.''
They received unemployment checks for nearly two years, but their benefits ran out. Now they live in the Good News Family Shelter in Indianapolis.
Their plight is an Indiana conundrum. Workers here have done a backward slip-slide for more than a decade. Median income is falling -- by 15 percent in the last decade. The so-called real unemployment rate, which includes those too discouraged to look for work, stood at 17.4 percent last year. And the percentage of Indianans who participate in the work force has dropped in the past two years, much faster than in Illinois and Ohio to the east.
''Indiana has touted jobs numbers, the governor has been happy to talk about it, but the reality is that they don't pay nearly as much as the old union manufacturing jobs,'' said John Ketzenberger, president of the Indiana Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonpartisan group. ''People in Indiana are working harder and longer for less.''
Governor Daniels notes that income growth edged up promisingly in the last quarter, though from the lowest floor in the Midwest. He talks of his battle to keep costs low, by cutting bureaucracy and regulations.
In his first days in office, he recalled, he gathered his senior officials in a hotel suite and told them his goal: ''We're here to raise the net disposable income of Hoosiers.''
Mr. Daniels has pursued this goal by cutting taxes and fees for Hoosiers; he has had less success raising wages and adding jobs with benefits.
Leslie Eckerty is a mother of several children, living in Anderson, a factory town east of Indianapolis. She has lived with falling wages and a lack of benefits for much of the last decade. Now she is back in school, studying nursing. The mathematics of her life do not add up.
''How can you afford to commute when you're making $6 an hour?'' she asks. ''I'm working on a backup plan; I'm just not sure what it is yet.''
In the Schools
Public schools in Indiana stand on an especially ferocious firing line in this recession. When property caps were put in place, state government, as part of that deal, took over responsibility for financing public education.
At the time, the math added up on paper. Then tax revenues fell through the floor, sinking $1.4 billion below what officials had expected during the state's 2009 budget year.
In southern Indiana, the New Albany-Floyd school system has closed schools, consolidated classes, pared administrators and imposed a pay freeze on teachers. That is still not enough. Next year will bring layoffs.
Many state officials, and even some local board members, are unsympathetic. Rebecca Gardenour, who serves as vice president of the school board, voted for the property caps, without regrets. She regrets only that she voted to build two big new schools a few years back.
''Do I have buyer's remorse? Yes, I do,'' she said. ''We don't need Taj Mahals.''
Her view is often echoed by Republican state legislators. They portray public education, and the relatively modest pensions for teachers and bus drivers and janitors, as a fatted calf ready for the knife. Federal test scores here are above the national average, but a pervasive sense of dissatisfaction is heard from many Hoosiers about the state of public education.
''There is this notion that Indiana education is in crisis,'' said Walton Robinson, spokesman for the Indiana State Teachers Association. ''Indiana students test higher in math than the U.S. average, and in England and France. But you don't hear a lot of celebration.''
Revenue collection forecasts have improved of late. Mr. Daniels recently announced he would allocate more than $150 million to partly underwrite full-day kindergarten. Still, Indiana school districts are $300 million below 2008 financing levels.
Even top state Education Department leaders paint a mixed picture. Last year, the superintendent of public instruction issued a release noting that federal test scores, while above average, remained mostly flat. And studies persistently show skills shortages in areas like nursing and high-tech factories, no small matter in a state that leans heavily on manufacturing jobs.
The governor seems skeptical about some of the cries of pain. Indiana schools, he says, spend a lot on overhead costs, and they should give sustained thought to merging districts, privatizing janitorial and cafeteria services and bulk buying of energy.
In late April, discussing the economy in his office, he brightened when asked about new legislation expected to encourage more charter schools and to provide state money for vouchers to go to private schools. ''Until yesterday, I would have told you that the huge incomplete on our report card was public education and improving it in a big way,'' Mr. Daniels said. ''We think Indiana has gone from back of the class to front row in this respect.''
Tom Galovic, a barrel-chested former school principal and now chief financial officer for the Greater Clark County Schools near Louisville, shakes his head. He is a fan of Mr. Daniels over all, he said. But he sees a self-fulfilling prophecy taking shape around public education -- the same problem that many others see with Indiana's intent focus on the cost side of fiscal restraint.
''If you cut and cut,'' he said, ''you erode the system to the point that it snaps.''

HEADLINE: Raising School Standards

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''37 Percent of New York Graduates Are College-Ready, Data Show'' (news article, June 15):
Although Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg tries to interpret the recent data on high school graduation rates as progress, the figures suggest some disappointing conclusions. The rising graduation rates and simultaneous falling college-readiness rates suggest rampant grade inflation and granting credit for less and less educational achievement. 
The pressure to pass students along is even greater in small schools because of the limitations on their ability to let students repeat classes or customize schedules according to the students' needs. It is noteworthy that the schools producing a large percentage of college-ready students are large, comprehensive and well-established high schools that offer diverse programs to accommodate the interests of different students.
Until we are ready to set uniformly high standards for all students, discourage the subtle intimidation of teachers through ''passing quotas'' and support local public schools, we will not see the academic results that we seek.
The constant drumbeat of charter schools, vouchers and small schools, largely encouraged by private money, are only a distraction from the hard work of maintaining a good public school system with uniformly high standards.

The writer has been an educator for over 40 years.
To the Editor:
Unlike Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, we are dismayed by the New York State Education Department report showing that even though the high school graduation rate in New York City increased to 61 percent, the percentage of college-ready students was an astonishingly low 21 percent. Worse yet, the persistent racial gap in the college-ready group underscores how little has been accomplished. In neighboring Westchester County, the college-ready percentage in Yonkers (a largely minority-concentrated city) was 15 percent. In predominantly white communities like Chappaqua and Scarsdale, we find college readiness at 88 and 89 percent, respectively. Racial segregation in housing and schools is a primary cause of the disparity in these numbers.
The time is now for federal, state and local government officials to enforce fair housing laws aggressively to ensure integrated communities and schools that will result in quality education for all children, as envisioned by Brown v. Board of Education. Without such a focused commitment, the dismal college-readiness statistics and the racial gap will persist unabated.

HEADLINE: Text of President Obama's Speech on Afghanistan

 BODY:
The following is the prepared text of President Obama's speech regarding the troop pullout in Afghanistan, as provided by the White House:
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Good evening. Nearly 10 years ago, America suffered the worst attack on our shores since Pearl Harbor. This mass murder was planned by Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda network in Afghanistan, and signaled a new threat to our security - one in which the targets were no longer soldiers on a battlefield, but innocent men, women and children going about their daily lives.
In the days that followed, our nation was united as we struck at al Qaeda and routed the Taliban in Afghanistan. Then, our focus shifted. A second war was launched in Iraq, and we spent enormous blood and treasure to support a new government there. By the time I took office, the war in Afghanistan had entered its seventh year. But al Qaeda's leaders had escaped into Pakistan and were plotting new attacks, while the Taliban had regrouped and gone on the offensive. Without a new strategy and decisive action, our military commanders warned that we could face a resurgent al Qaeda and a Taliban taking over large parts of Afghanistan. 
For this reason, in one of the most difficult decisions that I've made as President, I ordered an additional 30,000 American troops into Afghanistan. When I announced this surge at West Point, we set clear objectives: to refocus on al Qaeda, to reverse the Taliban's momentum, and train Afghan security forces to defend their own country. I also made it clear that our commitment would not be open-ended, and that we would begin to draw down our forces this July.
Tonight, I can tell you that we are fulfilling that commitment. Thanks to our extraordinary men and women in uniform, our civilian personnel, and our many coalition partners, we are meeting our goals. As a result, starting next month, we will be able to remove 10,000 of our troops from Afghanistan by the end of this year, and we will bring home a total of 33,000 troops by next summer, fully recovering the surge I announced at West Point. After this initial reduction, our troops will continue coming home at a steady pace as Afghan security forces move into the lead. Our mission will change from combat to support. By 2014, this process of transition will be complete, and the Afghan people will be responsible for their own security.
We're starting this drawdown from a position of strength. Al Qaeda is under more pressure than at any time since 9/11. Together with the Pakistanis, we have taken out more than half of al Qaeda's leadership. And thanks to our intelligence professionals and Special Forces, we killed Osama bin Laden, the only leader that al Qaeda had ever known. This was a victory for all who have served since 9/11. One soldier summed it up well. ''The message,'' he said, ''is we don't forget. You will be held accountable, no matter how long it takes.''
The information that we recovered from bin Laden's compound shows al Qaeda under enormous strain. Bin Laden expressed concern that al Qaeda had been unable to effectively replace senior terrorists that had been killed, and that al Qaeda has failed in its effort to portray America as a nation at war with Islam - thereby draining more widespread support. Al Qaeda remains dangerous, and we must be vigilant against attacks. But we have put al Qaeda on a path to defeat, and we will not relent until the job is done.
In Afghanistan, we've inflicted serious losses on the Taliban and taken a number of its strongholds. Along with our surge, our allies also increased their commitments, which helped stabilize more of the country. Afghan security forces have grown by over 100,000 troops, and in some provinces and municipalities we've already begun to transition responsibility for security to the Afghan people. In the face of violence and intimidation, Afghans are fighting and dying for their country, establishing local police forces, opening markets and schools, creating new opportunities for women and girls, and trying to turn the page on decades of war.
Of course, huge challenges remain. This is the beginning -- but not the end - of our effort to wind down this war. We'll have to do the hard work of keeping the gains that we've made, while we draw down our forces and transition responsibility for security to the Afghan government. And next May, in Chicago, we will host a summit with our NATO allies and partners to shape the next phase of this transition.
We do know that peace cannot come to a land that has known so much war without a political settlement. So as we strengthen the Afghan government and security forces, America will join initiatives that reconcile the Afghan people, including the Taliban. Our position on these talks is clear: They must be led by the Afghan government, and those who want to be a part of a peaceful Afghanistan must break from al Qaeda, abandon violence, and abide by the Afghan constitution. But, in part because of our military effort, we have reason to believe that progress can be made.
The goal that we seek is achievable, and can be expressed simply: No safe haven from which al Qaeda or its affiliates can launch attacks against our homeland or our allies. We won't try to make Afghanistan a perfect place. We will not police its streets or patrol its mountains indefinitely. That is the responsibility of the Afghan government, which must step up its ability to protect its people, and move from an economy shaped by war to one that can sustain a lasting peace. What we can do, and will do, is build a partnership with the Afghan people that endures - one that ensures that we will be able to continue targeting terrorists and supporting a sovereign Afghan government.
Of course, our efforts must also address terrorist safe havens in Pakistan. No country is more endangered by the presence of violent extremists, which is why we will continue to press Pakistan to expand its participation in securing a more peaceful future for this war-torn region. We'll work with the Pakistani government to root out the cancer of violent extremism, and we will insist that it keeps its commitments. For there should be no doubt that so long as I am President, the United States will never tolerate a safe haven for those who aim to kill us. They cannot elude us, nor escape the justice they deserve.
My fellow Americans, this has been a difficult decade for our country. We've learned anew the profound cost of war -- a cost that's been paid by the nearly 4,500 Americans who have given their lives in Iraq, and the over 1,500 who have done so in Afghanistan - men and women who will not live to enjoy the freedom that they defended. Thousands more have been wounded. Some have lost limbs on the battlefield, and others still battle the demons that have followed them home.
Yet tonight, we take comfort in knowing that the tide of war is receding. Fewer of our sons and daughters are serving in harm's way. We've ended our combat mission in Iraq, with 100,000 American troops already out of that country. And even as there will be dark days ahead in Afghanistan, the light of a secure peace can be seen in the distance. These long wars will come to a responsible end.
As they do, we must learn their lessons. Already this decade of war has caused many to question the nature of America's engagement around the world. Some would have America retreat from our responsibility as an anchor of global security, and embrace an isolation that ignores the very real threats that we face. Others would have America over-extended, confronting every evil that can be found abroad.
We must chart a more centered course. Like generations before, we must embrace America's singular role in the course of human events. But we must be as pragmatic as we are passionate; as strategic as we are resolute. When threatened, we must respond with force - but when that force can be targeted, we need not deploy large armies overseas. When innocents are being slaughtered and global security endangered, we don't have to choose between standing idly by or acting on our own. Instead, we must rally international action, which we're doing in Libya, where we do not have a single soldier on the ground, but are supporting allies in protecting the Libyan people and giving them the chance to determine their own destiny.
In all that we do, we must remember that what sets America apart is not solely our power - it is the principles upon which our union was founded. We're a nation that brings our enemies to justice while adhering to the rule of law, and respecting the rights of all our citizens. We protect our own freedom and prosperity by extending it to others. We stand not for empire, but for self-determination. That is why we have a stake in the democratic aspirations that are now washing across the Arab world. We will support those revolutions with fidelity to our ideals, with the power of our example, and with an unwavering belief that all human beings deserve to live with freedom and dignity.
Above all, we are a nation whose strength abroad has been anchored in opportunity for our citizens here at home. Over the last decade, we have spent a trillion dollars on war, at a time of rising debt and hard economic times. Now, we must invest in America's greatest resource - our people. We must unleash innovation that creates new jobs and industries, while living within our means. We must rebuild our infrastructure and find new and clean sources of energy. And most of all, after a decade of passionate debate, we must recapture the common purpose that we shared at the beginning of this time of war. For our nation draws strength from our differences, and when our union is strong no hill is too steep, no horizon is beyond our reach.
America, it is time to focus on nation building here at home.
In this effort, we draw inspiration from our fellow Americans who have sacrificed so much on our behalf. To our troops, our veterans and their families, I speak for all Americans when I say that we will keep our sacred trust with you, and provide you with the care and benefits and opportunity that you deserve.
I met some of these patriotic Americans at Fort Campbell. A while back, I spoke to the 101st Airborne that has fought to turn the tide in Afghanistan, and to the team that took out Osama bin Laden. Standing in front of a model of bin Laden's compound, the Navy SEAL who led that effort paid tribute to those who had been lost - brothers and sisters in arms whose names are now written on bases where our troops stand guard overseas, and on headstones in quiet corners of our country where their memory will never be forgotten. This officer -- like so many others I've met on bases, in Baghdad and Bagram, and at Walter Reed and Bethesda Naval Hospital - spoke with humility about how his unit worked together as one, depending on each other, and trusting one another, as a family might do in a time of peril.
That's a lesson worth remembering - that we are all a part of one American family. Though we have known disagreement and division, we are bound together by the creed that is written into our founding documents, and a conviction that the United States of America is a country that can achieve whatever it sets out to accomplish. Now, let us finish the work at hand. Let us responsibly end these wars, and reclaim the American Dream that is at the center of our story. With confidence in our cause, with faith in our fellow citizens, and with hope in our hearts, let us go about the work of extending the promise of America - for this generation, and the next.
May God bless our troops. And may God bless the United States of America.

HEADLINE: Mortgage Debt, A Lasting Burden

BYLINE: By AGNES T. CRANE and MARTIN HUTCHINSON

 BODY:
The government wants to wind down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. But the task is getting bigger, not smaller. Impaired and hard-to-sell mortgage debt -- more than $900 billion of it so far -- increasingly dominates the two housing finance giants' balance sheets.
The numbers from the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates Fannie and Freddie, are astounding. In a 152-page report shipped to Congress last week, the agency said 65 percent of Fannie's $789 billion balance sheet at the end of last year was accounted for by illiquid holdings, specifically mortgage loans and nonagency mortgage-backed securities. 
Freddie's hard-to-trade assets represented more than half of its $697 billion portfolio. The subcategory of distressed assets increased nearly threefold to $367 billion from a year earlier for the two firms combined as they bought back severely delinquent loans from the pools underlying the mortgage-backed bonds they guarantee.
The regulator expects the proportion of illiquid debt to increase this year. Barclays Capital estimates the two government-sponsored enterprises are yanking about $10 billion of loans a month out of mortgage-backed bonds. Meanwhile, Fannie and Freddie are required by the terms of their government rescue to reduce the overall size of their balance sheets each year. With bad and risky loans piling up, that means they have to sell or run off good assets. The trend could continue until the still queasy housing market stabilizes.
This pattern makes winding down Fannie and Freddie even harder than it otherwise would be. Illiquid investments are difficult to hedge and costly to hold if financing costs rise. And getting rid of their huge holdings -- which the two companies will eventually have to do -- is sure to be a challenge. Consider the Federal Reserve's experience with the much smaller collection of bad assets it bought from the American International Group. The central bank has sold only one-third of the roughly $30 billion of paper it acquired from the insurer, but there are already indications that investors have indigestion.
It's another reminder that Uncle Sam's problem with government-sponsored enterprises is festering. The longer Fannie and Freddie remain sick and their treatment is undecided, the more unpleasant -- or, worse, ineffective -- the results could be.
Ten-Pint Hat
Texas isn't a good proxy for the broader economy. Rick Perry, the Lone Star State's governor, might run for president in 2012. And Texas boasts below-average unemployment and decent growth. But it also has no state income tax, a large energy sector and not too much housing trouble. Washington's bigger problems may not yield to Texan solutions.
Mr. Perry, who has been in charge of the second-largest state for more than a decade, cannot reasonably be called unqualified for the presidency, even though the Texas governorship is fairly weak in terms of its powers. But the attempts of his supporters to use his economic record to promote his candidacy are only partially convincing.
The state's economic record is better than that of the United States as a whole, but only moderately so. Its unemployment rate of 8 percent is more than a percentage point lower than the national average, but has declined only modestly from its peak in March 2010. Growth has also been only a little higher than the national rate.
However, Texas started the recent recession with advantages. It had a huge housing and banking crisis in the 1980s, one reason home prices didn't skyrocket in 2006 as they did in some parts of America. Having avoided a huge bubble, the decline since then has been relatively moderate. The state's economy also benefits from its energy sector, spurred along by high commodity prices. The lack of a state income tax -- which predates Mr. Perry -- has also helped economically, particularly as other states have increased taxes during the recession.
All this has made the Texas governor's fiscal path considerably easier than those of other large states like California and Illinois, while his economic policies have not produced obvious direct additional benefits. Mr. Perry's decent record is mostly a product of structural differences and longstanding policies rather than anything he has enacted. Doing no harm is a good start, but the United States needs more than that. Mr. Perry would find the nation's problems considerably less tractable than those he is used to.

HEADLINE: Michigan Residents Sue Over Law on Emergency Management of Struggling Cities

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
More than two dozen residents of Michigan filed a lawsuit on Wednesday against top officials in the state, contending that a new law broadly expanding the powers of emergency managers in the most financially troubled cities violates Michigan's Constitution.
The lawsuit, filed in Ingham County Circuit Court, contends that the law approved by Michigan lawmakers this year improperly allows the state to place new costs on municipalities without paying for them and, in essence, bars local residents from picking their own elected representatives. 
In March, leaders in Michigan -- whose legislative chambers and governor's office have been controlled by Republicans since last fall's election -- approved the measure granting more control to those sent into local governments and school districts by the state to avoid allowing such places to go bankrupt or fail entirely.
Leaders of labor unions, in particular, were outraged by the provision because it allows such state-appointed emergency managers to, in some cases, undo provisions of the contracts that towns and cities had already agreed to. Some appeared for rallies in opposition in Lansing, the capital, this spring. But others had broader complaints; how, they asked, can a state-assigned official simply step into the role of an elected local leader and do whatever he or she wishes?
''What you're saying is that an emergency manager now controls all, including the right to enact or repeal local ordinances,'' said John Philo, the legal director of the Sugar Law Center in Detroit, one of several groups, including the Center for Constitutional Rights in New York, that is representing the plaintiffs in the suit. ''What you're saying is that one individual now without any sort of legislative process gets to enact a law.''
Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican who is named as a defendant in the suit, along with the state's treasurer, has strongly defended elements of the law in the past. The point is not to take over cities, Mr. Snyder said in an interview this spring, but to spare the state more financial distress and gauge fiscal distress in cities before they wind up in need of an emergency manager.
The increased control by an appointed manager would make rehabilitation of the most miserable places possible, without the crushing, ratings-lowering possibility of bankruptcy.
''It's not an assault on collective bargaining, the way I viewed it,'' Mr. Snyder said in the interview. ''It's about helping communities and municipalities do the best they can to survive during difficult economic times.''
The notion of an emergency manager is not uncommon. States have tried a variety of approaches, including appointed receivers, to step in to spare cities from default, and the results have been mixed.
Only four places in Michigan -- including Detroit's public school system -- are now considered in such grave financial shape as to require oversight by emergency managers. But those numbers are expected to grow, as local budgets shrink further.
Detroit's pension funds had already filed suit challenging the measure, which they say presents emergency managers with ''czarlike powers,'' and more suits have been threatened.
In the suit filed on Wednesday, 28 Michigan residents, including some community activists, expressed dismay, even astonishment, over the reach of the new law.
''We have the right to vote and elect people and hold them accountable,'' said Edith Lee-Payne, a plaintiff who is 59 and an activist who has grandchildren in Detroit's public school system. ''We don't have that right with an emergency manager.''

HEADLINE: As Politics of War Shift, Risks for Obama Ease

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and JACKIE CALMES; Jim Rutenberg contributed reporting from Columbia, S.C.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When President Obama expanded the Afghanistan war a year after taking office, Republicans fiercely criticized his deadline to bring troops home. But his decision on Wednesday to accelerate their withdrawal came with few reprisals, a sign of a remarkable shift in the politics of war.
The president, who addressed the nation in a prime-time speech from the White House, stopped short of declaring victory, but he suggested that the mission had been a success and that it was time to turn to a new foreign policy and to place a greater focus on domestic concerns.
A debate inside the Republican Party over Afghanistan, along with larger questions about American military engagement, has changed the political dynamic facing Mr. Obama as he prepares for re-election. He made clear that he would not be haunted, like many Democrats before him, by being cast as weak on national security. But he pledged to ''chart a more centered course,'' a phrase that could well serve as a metaphor for how he has sought to reset his presidency after Democrats were soundly defeated last fall. 
Mr. Obama is benefiting from a confluence of factors -- a rising strain of Republican isolationism, the killing of Osama bin Laden and deep concerns about spending and the deficit -- which provide unexpected flexibility for dealing with Congress and selling his decision to the nation. He will test whether the post-Sept. 11 politics have changed enough to allow a Democratic president to wind down a war with little or no political peril.
''These long wars will come to a responsible end,'' Mr. Obama said. ''As they do, we must learn their lessons. Already this decade of war has caused many to question the nature of America's engagement around the world.''
As the nation has grown weary over the cost and toll of war, fault lines have emerged among Republicans, with the longstanding isolationist strain regaining its footing after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the adventurism of the George W. Bush era.
The aggressive posture adopted by the president, particularly in pulling out troops faster than Pentagon advisers recommended, could open a discussion in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail. Republicans now hold an array of positions, from the budget-minded focus of the Tea Party movement to the stay-the-course view of the party's 2008 nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, to other internationalist Republicans who fear the party has lost its way.
Mr. McCain has emerged as the leading critic of Mr. Obama's decision on Afghanistan, but his views are muted by the many Republican presidential candidates who have expressed a desire to end the war as soon as possible.
Jon M. Huntsman Jr., a former Utah governor who recently stepped down as the ambassador to China, is trying to build his Republican presidential campaign around his foreign policy experience, which included positions in both Bush administrations. Four years ago, he was Mr. McCain's co-chairman, but now is seeking to distinguish himself on Afghanistan by raising questions about whether the country can afford it.
''It is time we move to a focused counterterror effort, which requires significantly fewer boots on the ground than the president discussed tonight,'' Mr. Huntsman said.
Tim Pawlenty, a former governor of Minnesota, has emerged as one of the party's few candidates who are cautioning against an abrupt withdrawal in Afghanistan. ''I'm concerned about what appears to be a drift toward minimalism and isolationism inside the Republican Party,'' Mr. Pawlenty said Wednesday in an interview. ''But it's really important to make sure that we finish the job correctly in Afghanistan.''
Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster who has conducted focus groups to gauge public opinion of the war, said the multiple messages among Republicans would benefit Mr. Obama.
For Mr. Obama, his prime-time announcement was the latest in a series of defining moments in his presidency. Four years ago, in the early stage of his political rise, he positioned himself as a strong opponent of the Iraq war. After he took office, he began delivering on his pledge to end the war. But he chose to build up efforts in Afghanistan, infuriating many Democrats by sending 30,000 more troops.
On Wednesday night, the president found himself in a position where he could announce what has always been a priority of Democrats -- and of Mr. Obama himself when he first took office: ''America,'' he said, ''it is time to focus on nation-building here at home.'' It is something that is surely going to help him with Democratic base voters who had been concerned that he had strayed too far from his promises since passing a new health care law.
Now the position is harder for Republicans to attack, since they, too, are describing the fighting in Afghanistan as an expense the country can no longer afford.
This week, the nonpartisan Pew Research Center found for the first time that a majority of Americans -- 56 percent -- favored removing troops from Afghanistan as soon as possible, an increase of eight percentage points from a poll taken in May after Bin Laden's death. Two-thirds of Democrats and nearly six in 10 independents support withdrawal, while 53 percent of Republicans favor maintaining troop strength -- 12 percentage points lower than a year ago.
While predicting what will influence a presidential election is dicey more than a year in advance, the slow recovery and persistently high unemployment suggest that the 2012 election will be focused on the economy, not war. But the complicating dynamic for Mr. Obama is that the nearly decade-old war in Afghanistan has become an economic issue for many Americans.
''There are huge economic concerns about where the money is going, a realization that we're basically defending the world and can't show better results for it,'' said former Senator Tom Daschle, who was the Democratic Senate leader after the 2001 terrorist attacks, when Democrats deferred to President Bush for fear of being labeled weak against terrorism. At the time, it was unthinkable in Congress or among the general public to question the war's added cost.
''The whole burden for this has been on a very, very small percentage of people, so no one has really felt the effects of this war,'' Mr. Daschle said.
Barring another major terrorist attack, Democrats say, Mr. Obama has to show at least a significant reduction in troops overseas by Election Day.
''Today's announcement is a start, but not enough. Retaining most of our 100,000 troops in Afghanistan is simply delaying the inevitable,'' said Representative Earl Blumenauer, Democrat of Oregon. ''Given the recent death of Osama bin Laden, our budgetary constraints and the questionable effectiveness of our nation-building efforts in Afghanistan, now is the time to begin a significant withdrawal of U.S. troops.''

HEADLINE: In Battle Over Subsidies, Some Farmers Say No

BYLINE: By RON NIXON

 BODY:
With budget cuts all the rage in government, Craig Lang, a dairyman and president of the Iowa Farm Bureau, proposed something that would have been unthinkable in farm country a few years ago: ending direct payments to farmers for crops.
Mr. Lang, who received more than $25,000 in payments in recent years, had long defended the billions of dollars in government largess, even as farm income and wheat, soybean and cotton prices shot up to records. 
Now, with a weak economy, Mr. Lang and the Iowa agricultural group decided that farmers could not justify taking the money. Instead they proposed a program that would improve crop insurance.
''Everyone has got to share in the pain, including farmers,'' said Mr. Lang, whose state has received more than $22 billion in subsidies since 1995, second to Texas.
A growing number of politicians agree with Mr. Lang, including many from agricultural districts, like Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, whose fiscally conservative proposals have been a centerpiece of House Republican policy. Mr. Ryan's plan calls for huge cuts in agricultural spending.
But Depression-era farm programs do not die easily, even in this political environment. The American Farm Bureau Federation, a farm advocacy group, and several farm state lawmakers are resisting efforts to curtail payments to farmers. In a potential preview of the looming battle over farm subsidies, the House voted last week to cut the agriculture spending bill by more than $7 billion, but stopped short of prohibiting some better-off recipients from getting payments.
One proposal would have halted subsidies to those with more than $250,000 in adjusted gross annual income. Currently farmers can make as much as $750,000 a year and still receive payments. Another proposal, from Representative Earl Blumenauer, an Oregon Democrat with some farming in his district, would have capped payments and was also defeated.
''The notion that we wouldn't put reasonable limitations on these payments is baffling,'' Mr. Blumenauer said.
Representative Frank D. Lucas, Republican of Oklahoma, and Collin C. Peterson, Democrat of Minnesota, the chairman and ranking member, respectively, of the House Agriculture Committee, fought the limits, saying agriculture policy should be left up to it. Farmers in both lawmakers' districts have gotten a total of nearly $7 billion since 1995.
Critics of crop payment programs thought their time had finally come with the election of more fiscally conservative legislators, including several on the Agriculture Committee. Instead, they predict a contentious battle in 2012 as Congress grapples with a new farm bill in an election year.
''This whole budget mess has forced the issue, so there is going to have to be some reform this time,'' said Craig Cox, senior vice president of the Environmental Working Group, a Washington-based research organization that maintains a database of farm subsidies. ''You can't keep sending checks to people regardless of need. It doesn't make any sense, given the number of Americans struggling.''
Each year, the government gives farmers more than $20 billion in payments intended to stabilize crop prices, ensure food supply and guarantee that producers get at least a basic income. About a quarter of that money goes directly to farmers for crops. In 2010, when farm income and profits were at records, the federal government handed out nearly $6 billion in direct payments for crops. Since 1995, about $167 billion has been spent on commodity crops.
Joe Outlaw, a professor and farm economist at Texas A&M University, defends the farm payments as crucial to the rural economy and says eliminating them would be disastrous.
''One of the big reasons the payments are important is that it helps farmers get credit to continue operating, because the lenders know they are going to get their money back,'' he said. ''You take the payments away and it makes it hard for them to get credit, especially small family farms.''
The subsidy database maintained by the Environmental Working Group shows 62 percent of farmers receive no payments. Since 1995, just 10 percent of farmers have gotten 74 percent of all subsidies, the data shows.
The data also shows that payments tend to benefit landowners who live far from rural America, in places like New York City, Phoenix and Chicago. Cities with more than 500,000 people got nearly $100 million in farm payments last year, according to the data. In New York City, about $800,000 in farm payments went to 290 recipients.
Critics say that these payments are hard to justify when there has been record-breaking growth in agricultural exports, farm cash receipts and income. The Agriculture Department estimates that net farm income will be $94.7 billion in 2011, up $15.7 billion, or nearly 20 percent, from 2010. Adjusting for inflation, five of the highest farm income years since 1976 have occurred from 2004 to 2011, according to the department.
But farm advocates say the high prices may not last.
''Long-term forecasts for demand of agricultural commodities are good, but as any market-watcher knows, forecasts are based on the way the world looks today and can be wrong,'' said Mary Kay Thatcher, public policy director at the American Farm Bureau Federation in Washington. While she says the farm lobby wants to reduce spending, ''we just want to make sure we aren't doing more than our fair share.''
The national farm group has spent more than $1.4 million lobbying this year.
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is leading negotiations with Republican lawmakers who aim to cut at least $200 billion from the budget over the next 10 years. About $45 billion could come from agriculture, specifically from the subsidies program. Mr. Ryan, whose southeastern Wisconsin Congressional district has received more than $305 million in subsidies since 1995, recommended cutting $30 billion in the nation's farm programs.
Even the most ardent farm state legislators have been preparing constituents for significant cuts. In a town-hall-style meeting this year, Representative Tim Huelskamp, a freshman Kansas Republican whose district received $250 million in farm payments last year, the second most in the country, told farmers that keeping the payments might be a tough sell.
''Farmers are going to have to make the argument, to Head Start folks and others, that their subsidies are worth borrowing 42 cents for every dollar spent,'' Mr. Huelskamp said, referring to the portion of the federal budget that finances debt payments.
Mr. Lang, the Iowa dairy farmer, said that he expected many groups to continue to fight for payments, but that he thought many farmers would eventually come around to the Iowa position.
''We need to provide some alternatives,'' Mr. Lang said. ''Direct payments are on pretty shaky grounds.''

HEADLINE: Fiscal Contraction Hurts Economic Expansion

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: Finding a way to reduce health care costs and tax reform are more likely to solve America's deficit problems than cutting spending, an economist writes.

 BODY:
Simon Johnson, the former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, is the co-author of "13 Bankers."
The United States has a large budget deficit and a ratio of debt to gross domestic product that, in most projections, continues to rise over time. Some House and Senate Republicans are arguing strongly that this situation calls for big, immediate cuts in government spending -- for example, as part of any agreement to increase the federal government's debt ceiling.
The Joint Economic Committee of Congress held a hearing on Tuesday to discuss whether such spending cuts would be contractionary or expansionary for the economy in the short run. After taking part as a witness at the hearing, I conclude that large immediate spending cuts would tend to slow the economy.
The general presumption is that fiscal contraction -- cutting spending or raising taxes, or both -- will immediately slow the economy relative to the growth it would have had otherwise. (Of course, some lawmakers and candidates call for cutting spending and cutting taxes, too. This would not lower the deficit, and, most likely, in the short term it would also lower growth, because the spending cuts will be more contractionary than the tax cuts are expansionary, in part for the reasons discussed below.)
But some studies have found that in particular instances, fiscal contractions -- meaning deficit-reduction measures -- have been consistent with no deceleration of economic growth. The International Monetary Fund produced the most balanced recent assessment of the available evidence in Chapter 3 of its October 2010 World Economic Outlook, "Will It Hurt? Macroeconomic Effects of Fiscal Consolidation." (I was chief economist at the I.M.F. but left in August 2008 and had nothing to do with this study.)Under four conditions, fiscal contractions can be expansionary. But none of these conditions is likely to apply in the United States today.
First, if there is high perceived sovereign default risk, fiscal contraction can potentially lower long-term interest rates. But the United States is currently among the countries with the lowest perceived risk -- hence the widespread use of the dollar as a reserve asset.
To the extent there is pressure on long-term interest rates in the United States today because of fiscal concerns, these are mostly about the longer-term issues involving health care spending; if this spending were to be credibly constrained (e.g., in plausible projections for 2030 or 2050), long rates should fall.
In contrast, cutting discretionary spending, which is a relatively small part of the federal budget, would have little impact on the market assessment of our longer-term fiscal stability.
Second, it is highly unlikely that short-term spending cuts would directly increase confidence among households or companies, particularly with employment still around 5 percent below its precrisis level. The United States still has a significant "output gap" between actual and potential G.D.P., so unemployment is significantly above the achievable rate. Fiscal contractions rarely inspire confidence in such a situation.
Third, if monetary policy becomes more expansionary while fiscal policy contracts, this can offset to some degree the negative short-run effects of spending cuts on the economy. But in the United States today, short-term interest rates are as low as they can be and the Federal Reserve has already engaged in a substantial amount of "quantitative easing" to bring down interest rates on longer-term debt.
It is unclear that much more monetary policy expansion would be advisable, or possible, in the view of the Fed, even if unemployment increases again -- as it might if fiscal contraction involves laying off government workers.
Fourth, tighter fiscal policy and easier monetary policy can, in small, open economies with flexible exchange rates, push down (that is, depreciate) the relative value of the currency -- thus increasing exports and making it easier for domestic producers to compete against imports. But this is unlikely to happen in the United States, in part because other industrialized countries are also undertaking fiscal policy contraction.
Also, the pre-eminent reserve currency status of the dollar means that it rises and falls in response to world events outside our control -- and at present political and economic instabilities elsewhere seem likely to keep the dollar relatively strong.
The available evidence, including international experience, suggests it is very unlikely that the United States could experience an "expansionary fiscal contraction" as a result of short-term cuts in discretionary domestic federal government spending.
The best way to bring the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio under control is to limit future spending increases and augment revenue while the economy continues to recover. In particular, health care spending needs to be credibly constrained but doing this properly would mean limiting health care costs as a percentage of G.D.P. -- proposals that just push costs from government onto companies and individuals are not appealing.
There is also a pressing need for tax reform -- to reduce complexity, lower distortions and, in particular, roll back the subsidies for household and corporate debt that have crept into the system. Excessive private sector debts pose a significant systemic and fiscal risk to the economy. The major reason government debt surged relative to G.D.P. in the last three years is the deep recession -- the result of a financial crisis brought on by the irresponsible buildup of private debt.

HEADLINE: Feeling Anxious? You're Not Alone

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Reports suggest people worldwide are anxious about their financial futures.

 BODY:
4:48 p.m. | Updated The economic recovery may be stalling, housing prices still haven't bottomed out, and the world is beset by revolutions and natural disasters, from tsunamis to tornadoes.
Feeling a bit anxious?
You're not alone. 
The Index of Consumer Sentiment, produced monthly by the University of Michigan, actually rose a bit in May, to 74.3, from 69.8 in April, but dipped again in the preliminary report for June, to 71.8. Writing in a note accompanying the April index, Richard Curtin, chief economist for the university's surveys of consumers, said consumers seemed to have a negative outlook on their earning potential. "Consumers now give just one chance in three that their income will outpace the inflation rate," he wrote. It's not that people expect inflation to increase, he said. Rather, they don't expect higher incomes in the years ahead.
Depressed yet? Then consider this. Dan Geller, who operates Moneyanxiety.com and markets its research to retail and banking businesses, said his "money anxiety index" was the highest it had been in 30 years. Mr. Geller said he used "structural equation modeling" to crunch various monthly economic data, like inflation and unemployment rates and levels of spending and saving, to create a number that approximates worry about money. He has created index numbers that go as far back as 1959, and he said that people were pretty concerned right now.
"Basically the core reason for the financial anxiety is that consumers don't have any confidence, or they have low confidence, in any prospect of economic recovery," Mr. Geller said.
The Money Anxiety Index for March was 88.9; April, 91.3; and May, 91.9. That's still well below the index's high of 136 during the recession of the early 1980s, but the trend is worrisome. Historically, he said, when the index rises for five or more months in a row, a recession is likely.
How are you feeling about your financial future? Let us know.

HEADLINE: For E.V.'s and Hybrids, a Free-Spinning Alternative to Rare Earths

BYLINE: TUDOR VAN HAMPTON


HIGHLIGHT: Switched-reluctance motors might offer a viable alternative to the expensive and scarce magnetic materials, which are sourced primarily from China.

 BODY:
Most hybrid and electric vehicles rely on motors that contain rare earth metals. The heavily magnetized elements are mined predominantly in China and exported around the world.
Building a car like the Toyota Prius hybrid, for example, requires 20 to 25 pounds of rare earths, about twice as much as a standard automobile. A Prius contains more than two pounds of neodymium, just one of a handful of these metals found all around the vehicle, including the battery pack.
The Chinese government's recent efforts to curb exports of rare earths have sent prices skyward, spurring interest in electric motors that rely less on permanent magnets to create roadworthy propulsion.
One such technology, called switched reluctance, might offer a viable alternative. It uses a steel rotor that spins freely inside a housing of wires. Controlled by complex algorithms and solid-state switchgear, the motor can turn at variable speeds and at high torque levels.
"Essentially, you can get the same type of performance without needing to use rare-earth magnets," said Scott Nieberle, a vice president at Nidec Motor Corporation, a switched-reluctance motor manufacturer based in Japan.
Although switched reluctance motors are not new, their commercial viability has steadily increased in the past 30 years with the improvement in modern electronics. They are commonly found today in large mining machines, water-treatment plants and other industrial applications. Washing machines and other household appliances use reluctance motors. Earlier this year, John Deere introduced two diesel-electric hybrid construction loaders equipped with switched-reluctance motors and generators.
Nidec, which owns nearly 500 patents in this area and has motors running on industrial machines worldwide, hopes to boost its presence in the hybrid automotive space. It would not take much to make these motors cost-competitive with higher-volume magnet motors, they said.
"You could do reasonable economies of scale when you get into the tens of thousands of units, on an annual basis," said Mr. Nieberle. He showed a demonstration car based on a Japanese-market sports car, the Tommykaira ZZ, to investors in May in Dalian, China.
"There was a lot of interest," said Mr. Nieberle.
The car's switched-reluctance motor spins at 11,000 r.p.m., propelling it to highway speeds. Green Lord Motors, a Japanese start-up, plans to market the car this year.
Another company, Belgium-based Punch Powertrain, is developing its own switched-reluctance motor for electric cars. However, this technology is just one of several that automakers are exploring to lighten their rare-earth baggage, experts say.
"There are a number of options on the table," said Philip Gott, the managing director of IHS Automotive, an industry forecasting service based in Lexington, Mass., who added that it could take a decade for automakers to settle on the next-best motor composition for their electric powertrains.
And even if rare earths are dropped from the motors, suppliers still face the challenge of the batteries, whose chemistry is still a moving target.
"We still have significant gains to make," Mr. Gott said.

HEADLINE: Court Says Ex-Wife May Retain Money From Ponzi Scheme

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: New York's highest court ruled that a woman could keep proceeds from a divorce agreement, even if they came from a financial fraud perpetrated by her former husband.

 BODY:
The Ponzi schemes that came to light during the depths of the financial crisis have spawned various lawsuits seeking to claw back money from divorce agreements.
Now, in one case, a court has said: Hands off.
On Thursday, New York's highest court ruled that a woman could keep proceeds from a divorce agreement, even if those proceeds were the ill-gotten gains of a financial fraud perpetrated by her former husband.
The decision is a blow to the federal government, which is seeking to force the woman to disgorge what it says are millions of dollars in stolen money.
"Ex-spouses have a reasonable expectation that, once their marriage has been dissolved and their property divided, they will be free to move on with their lives," said Judge Victoria A. Graffeo, writing for the New York State Court of Appeals.
The federal appeals court in Manhattan, which had asked the New York State court for guidance on the case, is now expected to prevent the federal government from seizing the woman's assets.
Thursday's ruling could also affect other divorce cases, like some involving victims of Bernard L. Madoff's huge Ponzi scheme.
The New York State Court of Appeals is hearing a case brought by a man seeking to rescind his divorce settlement with his ex-wife because a large chunk of the marital proceeds were in a Madoff account.
The husband, Steven Simkin, kept much of his money with Mr. Madoff after the divorce; his wife, Laura Blank, received cash. After losing the bulk of his assets in the Madoff fraud, Mr. Simkin now wants to rewrite their divorce agreement.
In Massachusetts, a Madoff victim has also sued his ex-wife to revise their separation pact. A family court judge dismissed the lawsuit this month, and the plaintiff's lawyer has appealed.
Thursday's ruling in New York involves Janet Schaberg, 55 years old, the former wife of Stephen Walsh, a former executive at WG Trading, a commodities firm in Greenwich, Conn.
In February 2009, federal authorities arrested Mr. Walsh and his business partner, Paul Greenwood, on charges that they had defrauded investors of more than $550 million in a 13-year Ponzi scheme.
Mr. Greenwood pleaded guilty last year; Mr. Walsh is fighting the case.
Although the government did not accuse Ms. Schaberg of having any knowledge or participation in the scheme, lawyers at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission went after her money, saying that much of it was ill-gotten proceeds from her former husband's fraud.
In August 2009, a federal judge agreed with the government, freezing most of Ms. Schaberg's assets, including $7.6 million in cash.
Ms. Schaberg, who divorced Mr. Walsh in 2007 after 25 years of marriage, appealed the judge's order.
Her lawyer, Steven Kessler, argued that once she and Mr. Walsh had divided their marital property and signed a divorce settlement agreement, the government could not force her to disgorge what were her rightful proceeds.
In an unusual request, the federal appeals court asked New York state's highest court for guidance on the divorce-law issues instead of a ruling.
The case, Judge Graffeo wrote, raised "difficult policy questions" that required the court to weigh the competing interests of returning stolen property to its rightful owners against the innocent former spouse of the defrauder.
In ruling for Ms. Schaberg, the court made an analogy between Ms. Schaberg and her divorce settlement proceeds and any person who unknowingly receives tainted money in a business transaction. For instance, the government could not seize stolen money from an architect whom a thief had paid to build his home.
The court said its decision to protect Ms. Schaberg, an innocent recipient of stolen funds, over the victims of the Ponzi scheme, was "rooted in New York's concern for finality in business transactions."
The decision emphasized that fraud victims could try to reclaim their stolen money if the former spouse was aware or participated in the crime.
Representatives for the S.E.C. and C.F.T.C. declined to comment.
New York divorce lawyers are divided on the decision. Michael D. Stutman, a divorce lawyer in Manhattan, is uninvolved in the Schaberg case, but along with three other lawyers, he submitted a brief that sided with the government.
"We disagree with the decision because someone in possession of stolen property should not be able to claim an ownership interest superior to the rightful owner," Mr. Stutman said.
"Here, however, largely because she received 'title' to the ill-gotten gains through the divorce, she trumps the claims of people from whom the money was stolen," he said.
Mr. Stutman also questioned the court's emphasis on what it called New York's "strong public policy of ensuring finality in divorce proceedings."
He said other facets of divorce law - the amount of child and spousal support, as well as child-custody issues - are all subject to change based on newly discovered facts.
"Why is finality all of a sudden so sacred that you're depriving victims of a fraud from access to their assets?" he asked.
Richard Emery, a lawyer for Ms. Blank, who is battling with her former husband in the New York case involving the Madoff fraud, applauded the ruling, calling it "the right result for families and society."
"The appeals court embraced the plight of a spouse who relies on the right to move on with her life after divorce," Mr. Emery said. "This consideration trumps the interest of even the federal government."

HIGHLIGHT: Think declares bankruptcy, Saab fails to make payroll and the production of a onetime best-selling pickup nears its end.

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 For the fourth time in the company's 20-year history, Think Global AS, a builder of electric microcars based in Norway, has suffered a financial collapse, declaring bankruptcy on Wednesday in its home market after failing to raise capital during a restructuring period. Think North America, a wholly owned subsidiary, builds the Think City runabout -- a car recently reviewed in the Automobiles section -- in Indiana, however it is dependent on its corporate parent for financial support. As such, the future of the North American operation also is in doubt. (Automotive News)
 Saab has failed to make payroll, feeding speculation that the Swedish brand was on the brink of collapse. The automaker's most recent lifeline, extended by the Chinese manufacturer Zhejiang Youngman Lotus Automobile to Spyker, the Holland-based parent of Saab, is still subject to investor and regulatory approval. The approval processes for many investments have been lengthy, leading to cash shortages that have caused production lines at the brand's Trollhattan assembly plant to sputter for nearly three months. (The New York Times)
 Production of the Ford Ranger compact pickup truck is expected to end on Dec. 22, according to a letter from the U.A.W. There is no immediate successor known for the truck, which has been assembled for nearly 30 years at the automaker's Twin Cities plant in St. Paul. Ford is marketing a larger pickup under the Ranger name in international markets, but Ford does not intend to build or sell it in North America. (PickupTrucks.com)
 Aston Martin recently announced that it would decrease production of its Rapide by nearly 50 percent. The brand had projected annual sales of 2,000 units for the $200,000 sports sedan, but production targets have been revised to 1,250 units a year. The Rapide is built at the Magna Steyr factory in Austria, but the automaker announced earlier this month that it would bring Rapide production in-house at its Gaydon plant in England because it would have sufficient capacity. (Autocar)
 The American Automobile Association announced this week that it would provide roadside assistance to drivers of electric vehicles who might require a charging top-up. Six mobile charging units, as the association calls them, are to be on the road in California, Florida, Georgia, Oregon, Tennessee and Washington beginning in August. The units will be equipped with connectors carrying 240 volts (Level 2) and up to 500 volts (Level 3) of power, though a lack of a standard plug outlet would mean that not all E.V.'s would be compatible with the AAA charging equipment. (Edmunds)
 A 1:1 scale model of a Volvo XC90 S.U.V., built from more than 200,000 Lego bricks, was recently placed in the parking space of the general manager of Legoland Resort in Carlsbad, Calif. The manager, who drives an XC90, received the model, which was assembled in 2004 by the theme park's model shop, with the requisite dose of good humor. (YouTube)

HIGHLIGHT: "Always-on, multitasking work environments are killing productivity, dampening creativity, and making us unhappy."

 BODY:
Could McKinsey, the consulting firm that became synonymous with "restructuring," finally have stumbled on a truth we all agree on? According to Mother Jones, as quoted in The Awl, McKinsey has come to the conclusion that: "Always-on, multitasking work environments are killing productivity, dampening creativity and making us unhappy."
O.K., they're talking about executives. But still. Could reduced work hours, European-style, be far behind? For a glimpse of what work life might be like if we got our priorities straight (and upped our productivity, of course), it's worth rereading Russell Shorto's piece, "Going Dutch," about toiling in the welfare state, which ran in the magazine at the height of the economic crisis in the United States. My favorite European perk? Getting paid extra to take time off. "In late May of last year an unexpected $4,265 arrived in my account: vakantiegeld. Vacation money. This money materializes in the bank accounts of virtually everyone in the country just before the summer holidays; you get from your employer an amount totaling 8 percent of your annual salary, which is meant to cover plane tickets, surfing lessons, tapas: vacations."
Why didn't McKinsey think of that?

HEADLINE: Wanted: Republicans for Responsible Oil Policy

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: On energy, Republican leaders remain locked into two words and goals -- no (limits) and more (supply).

 BODY:
When President Obama announced the release of oil from the country's Strategic Petroleum Reserve today, the usual suspects weighed in all around.
Iran and other oil exporters, along with the American Petroleum Institute, criticized the move.
Joe Romm, who's directly on his game on such issues, referred readers to his 2008 congressional testimony laying out the logic for such releases if they're coupled with conservation measures. His statement before a House subcommittee (when gas stations ran short of the number 4) is relevant now:[S]elling a relatively modest amount of crude oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve while promoting oil efficiency could pop the speculative oil price bubble and lower pricesHouse Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio, unsurprisingly, had a markedly different reaction, saying that Obama was "using a national security instrument to address his domestic political problems." His statement also reminds voters of the Republican approach to energy, which boils down to one word -- more -- and is only slightly more fleshed out on a Facebook page called the "American Energy Initiative."
The same attitude is echoed by the most vocal cheerleader for fossil fuels in the Senate, James M. Inhofe, the Republican of Oklahoma, who devoted a long speech earlier this year to the untapped riches beneath American soil, with nary a word about conservation. (As I wrote at the time, aren't conservatives supposed to be into conserving things?)
In the end, as long as the Republican Party remains hostage to factions holding to such fossilized notions, my guess is it will be increasingly marginalized, given the reality that Americans of both parties, outside a small bubble, are very enthusiastic about the responsibility, even the patriotic duty, to use a great gift -- oil -- more thriftily. (Let's set aside the tougher coal question for another day.)
This is shown quite vividly in the graph above, from the invaluable ongoing "Six Americas" study of attitudes on global warming science and policy, led by researchers at Yale University and George Mason University. The question was whether respondents would support a very high standard for vehicle fuel efficiency even if it raised the cost of cars and trucks.
The bubbles, which you've seen here before, represent the size of segments of society that have fairly well defined attitudes on science pointing to a rising human influence on the climate. The labels clearly convey who's who.
Even those dismissive of global warming science are close to neutral on sharply raising vehicle performance. Just to be clear, this is from the 2009 survey. Anthony Leiserowitz, the lead Yale researcher on the project, told me today that they haven't asked that question in more recent surveys (unfortunately, to my mind). The "dismissive" bubble is substantially larger now. My guess is attitudes on mileage standards have not changed, given the persistence of high gas prices. (It's worth noting that the survey also shows universal support for increased research on renewable energy alternatives.)
I asked Leiserowitz to weigh in a bit more on the meaning of this graph and related findings, and the message for politicians: This is in line with broad, bipartisan support for clean energy policies. For example, as of just a couple weeks ago, 9 out of 10 of Americans said developing sources of clean energy should be a priority for the president and Congress including 85% of Republicans, 89% of Independents, and 97% of Democrats.
Likewise, more than 8 out of 10 of Americans support funding more research for renewable energy - including 81% of Republicans and Independents, and 90% of Democrats.
When was the last time you saw this kind of public consensus, across party lines?
There's an old saying that "there are many roads to Damascus." In this case, we see that very diverse Americans all support the same energy policies (clean sources, energy efficiency, doing more with less), albeit for different reasons.
The "Alarmed" and "Concerned" support these policies because they care about climate change and the other environmental and health impacts of our continuing dependence on fossil fuels.
The "Doubtful" and "Dismissive", however, don't believe in human-caused global warming, yet they support these policies because they resonate with their own deeply held values - including freedom, self-reliance, security, and economic opportunity.
Note that the reason the IEA and the US decided to release oil from the strategic reserves is because OPEC decided not to increase production, despite the Libya crisis. I suspect they're perfectly happy with high energy prices, thank you very much, more profit for them. I also suspect that nobody in the United States -- liberals or conservatives -- likes being subject to the whims of the OPEC countries.
This is ultimately the art of politics -- developing policies that can attract "strange bedfellows" - support from diverse groups, with different values and different agendas, who nonetheless see that they each, and we all, can benefit from a new direction.
Right now, Americans appear almost unanimous in their desire to move towards a clean energy future. How that plays out in particular places or regarding particular energy technologies (e.g., nuclear) gets more complicated, but nearly everyone seems to agree that it's time to start the transition to a new energy system.Leiserowitz here directly echoes a longstanding refrain of the University of Colorado policy analyst Roger A. Pielke, Jr. -- that politics is the art of getting people who think differently to act alike. 
I know that most members of Republicans for Environmental Protection don't need to absorb what Leiserowitz is saying. Charles Krauthammer, the conservative columnist who hates talk of global warming alarm but has long called for a big rise in the gas tax (with compensating shifts in other taxes), might not need to read it. But there are clearly plenty of Republicans, particularly those running for president, who would do well to listen to Leiserowitz.
On the flip side, all of this illustrates why traditional environmental campaigners might reconsider their longstanding strategy of fighting battles from the edges instead of convening with the "strange bedfellows" described by Leiserowitz to find ways to move forward. This can be done in a way that still (appropriately) marginalizes those seeking no shift in energy policies and norms.
I think Jonathan Foley, the director of the Institute on the Environment at the University of Minnesota, had it right when he wrote this spring that he had become a "climate pragmatist," adding:Meet people where they are. Many of my conservative friends are deeply suspicious of climate change, and they hate carbon taxes and cap and trade. They're not interested in adapting to a supposedly hypothetical future. Fair enough. Everyone is entitled to an opinion.
But these same friends embrace ideas like U.S. energy independence, reducing foreign oil imports, promoting economic growth, protecting our families from harm and improving the U.S. balance of trade. And many of these same friends, while skeptical about climate change, see the wisdom in protecting rain forests and the world's biodiversity.
There's a message in all of this for the president, as well, given how it helps reinforce the notion that there is a great opportunity for a leader, either in office or aspiring to get there, to articulate how a sustained energy quest is the new American imperative.With that in mind, I'll end by reprising some lines from a post last February that are still germane and deserve a bit more airing:[T]he Republican Party has utterly failed to articulate any kind of energy policy despite clear signals that business as usual produces building risks of instability (climatic, economic, strategic) in this century. Review this piece for more:
"Stop Energy Poverty. Great slogan. How?"
The Republicans are little different on science and innovation, despite transitory nods to the need for a sustained push in this arena, including a recent column from George Will, as discussed here:
"'Rev the Scientific Engine.' Great. How?"
To my mind, President Obama, despite dodging the issue in his State of the Union message, still has a chance this year to marginalize polarizing voices and build a new route forward on energy and climate. Let's hope he takes the chance.

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Challenge Derivatives Rules

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The lawmakers, Republicans and Democrats alike, argue that some proposed rules could force Wall Street's derivatives business overseas.

 BODY:
Win Mcnamee/Getty Images Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan and chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee.
A growing number of lawmakers are pressuring regulators to water down a series of new rules for the derivatives industry. 
The lawmakers, Republicans and Democrats alike, argue that some proposed rules could force Wall Street's derivatives business overseas. They also say that regulators are ignoring a crucial exemption to the rules spelled out in the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory law.
 The law excused airlines, oil companies and other nonfinancial firms known as end-users from new restrictions, including a rule that derivatives must be cleared and traded on regulated exchanges. The firms use derivatives to hedge against unforeseen market changes, say a rise in fuel costs or interest rates, rather than to speculate. 
"We are concerned that recent rule proposals may undermine these exemptions, substantially increasing the cost of hedging for end-users, and needlessly tying up capital that would otherwise be used to create jobs and grow the economy," Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan and chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, and Representative Frank D. Lucas, her Republican counterpart in the House, said in a letter this week to regulators. 
Regulators have not promised any changes, although they now are agreeing to slow the pace of their rule-writing.
The Federal Reserve and other regulators announced on Thursday that they would grant the public two additional weeks to weigh in on the controversial new proposals. The comment period, which was supposed to expire on Friday, was extended until July 11. 
The decision comes a week after the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, under pressure from lawmakers, announced a six-month delay for certain derivatives rules. 
Some proposals, unveiled in April, would require banks to collect upfront margin from so-called commercial end-users that enter into derivatives trades. Regulators and consumer groups defend the rules as necessary curbs on the derivatives industry, which played a central role in the financial crisis. 
"The Dodd-Frank Act was intended to and should to bring real change to the derivatives market," Americans for Financial Reform said in a recent letter to the commodities agency. 
But companies like Shell Energy and United Airlines contend that the collateral payments would tie up precious corporate funds. Ms. Stabenow and Mr. Lucas called the proposed rules "overly restrictive." 
Over the last several months, lawmakers have stepped up their attacks on several new derivatives rules. 
Representative Spencer Bachus of Alabama, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, wrote to regulators in December to say that imposing margin "requirements on companies that engage in the hedging of legitimate business risks would therefore defeat the purpose of the end-user exemption and contravene Congressional intent." 
The lawmakers have joined a chorus of complaints from bankers and corporate executives. 
Barry Zubrow, JPMorgan Chase's chief risk officer, told the financial committee last week that the "draconian" margin requirements could "effectively end" Wall Street's overseas derivatives business. 
His boss, JPMorgan's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, has been even harsher. Mr. Dimon said earlier this year that the Commodities Futures Trading Commission's new derivatives rules "would damage America."
The concerns, bankers and lawmakers say, stem from confusion over Dodd-Frank's borders. 
Under Dodd-Frank, derivatives rules do not apply in foreign countries unless there's a "direct and significant connection with activities" in the United States. It remains unclear whether regulators will enforce the rules on United States banks that book a derivatives deal through a foreign subsidiary. 
"There continues to be a lack of clarity regarding the territorial scope of Dodd-Frank," Ms. Stabenow and Mr. Lucas wrote. 
Foreign regulators, meanwhile, have been slower to act. The European Commission, the European Union's executive body, may take until 2012 or later to complete its own derivatives regulations. Until then, bankers say that Dodd-Frank will enable big European banks to poach their business.
"We recommend that all of the agencies implementing Dodd-Frank be mindful of recognized principles of international law," Ms. Stabenow and Mr. Lucas said. "While robust oversight is necessary, this proposal could put U.S. firms at a direct and significant competitive disadvantage outside the United States."

HEADLINE: Debating Whether Businesses Will Continue to Offer Health Insurance

BYLINE: ROBB MANDELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Employers may see an opportunity to shed their insurance burden once 2014 arrives, but the system that's coming is so new and different - and complicated - that it seems foolish to presume this will happen right away.

 BODY:
Two weeks ago, the international consulting firm McKinsey & Company threw itself into the rancorous partisan debate over the 2010 health care overhaul by publishing research that appeared to predict that many employers would dump their health insurance plans when the new law fully took effect in 2014. The new law offers subsidies to help low-income people purchase health insurance from state-run exchanges, and it also penalizes companies with more than 50 employees when they fail to offer those employees affordable coverage. As McKinsey notes, paying the penalty will cost less than providing the insurance, so companies could profit by socializing that cost.
Nonetheless, the finding was surprising, and controversial, because, as The Agenda reported in April 2010 (and also in 2009), most economists say they believe that a mix of market pressures, a tax incentive and the penalty will deter all but a relative handful of employers from casting off their health insurance plans. The Obama administration slammed McKinsey's apparent prediction, and Senate Democrats demanded that the consultants release the proprietary methodology behind it. For several days, McKinsey refused.
I say "appeared to predict" because on Monday, when McKinsey finally released the methodology, it came with a statement insisting that the survey had done no such thing. Rather, "it captured the attitudes of employers and provided an understanding of the factors that could influence decision-making related to employee health benefits." Two paragraphs later, the statement continued, "We understand how the language in the article could lead the reader to think the research was a prediction, but it is not."
The Agenda understands, too: The original article was titled "How U.S. Health Care Reform Will Affect Employee Benefits." Its second sentence declared, "While the pace and timing are difficult to predict, McKinsey research points to a radical restructuring of employer-sponsored health benefits following the 2010 passage of the Affordable Care Act." One word that appears frequently throughout the article is the future-tense "will," not the conditional "could" - as in, "30 percent of employers will definitely or probably stop offering E.S.I." - employer-sponsored insurance - "in the years after 2014." (The Times reported Tuesday that Democrats were not impressed by McKinsey's explanation.)
Still, the distinction between making predictions and capturing present attitudes - or, really, aspirations - is important. It should come as no surprise that employers, given their choice, would rather focus on their business than go through the administrative hassle of arranging health insurance for their work force. Companies probably wouldn't offer it now if their employees didn't demand it and weren't willing to trade away a portion of their wages to have it. (Economists say that, contrary to broad public perception, employers don't pay more to offer health insurance. Instead, insurance is merely a component of total pay - and employers that stopped offering it would have to provide some other, well, compensating compensation.)
Strikingly, the overall impression from the McKinsey article is that employees' views count for little in the coming debate over whether employers will provide health care - or that they'll accept whatever employers choose to offer. Here, for example, are two findings from McKinsey, based on separately conducted consumer research: 85 to 90 percent of employees would still work for their current company even after it dropped health insurance coverage, but only 60 percent would demand increased compensation to make up for it. That may, or may not, be true in 2011 - we'll leave it to others to assess the soundness of McKinsey's survey techniques - when the prospect of an employer dropping health insurance is too abstract for many in the work force to think seriously about what their coverage is worth. But who can say how they'll think in 2014, as the new system is put in place - accompanied, no doubt, by extensive media coverage?
Employers might see an opportunity to shed their insurance burden once 2014 arrives, but the system that's coming is so new and different - and complicated - that it seems foolish to presume this will happen right away, if at all. The new law could ultimately dismantle the underpinnings of workplace-provided insurance, but employees, too, will probably have something to say about this. It could take years, maybe even a generation, for people to grow comfortable with buying insurance on their own, and if they continue to insist on insurance from their employer, or prospective employer, in the meantime, companies are likely to comply. That's what happened in Massachusetts after that state passed its own health care reform in 2006, as health economist Jonathan Gruber told The Agenda the last time we looked at this. There, employer-sponsored coverage actually increased.

HEADLINE: June 23, 1947 | The Taft-Hartley Act

BYLINE: THE LEARNING NETWORK


HIGHLIGHT: On June 23, 1947, the Senate joined the House in overriding President Truman's veto of the Taft-Hartley Labor Bill, making it law.

 BODY:
We're trying something new this week by collaborating with findingDulcinea to bring you a new Historic Headline each day. Read more about the project here, and let us know what you think!
On June 23, 1947, the Senate joined the House in overriding President Harry S. Truman's veto of the Taft-Hartley Labor Bill, making it law.
In a letter to Senator Alben W. Barkley of Kentucky, minority leader, Mr. Truman made his case: "This is a critical period in our history, and any measure which will adversely affect our national unity will render a distinct disservice not only to this nation but to the world. I am convinced that such would be the result if the veto of this bill should be overridden."
Days earlier, Mr. Truman had sent a similar letter to the House, defending his veto. The American Presidency Project offers the full text of this letter.
Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio, co-author of the bill, argued that there was "an unquestioned public demand for labor legislation to end abuses which are apparent to the American people."
The History section of the U.S. Department of Labor' s Web site discusses the strife between management and labor in the United States that led to the Taft-Hartley Act. After year of wartime wage freezes, workers sought raises to offset the effects of postwar inflation on their purchasing power. This led to a large but "peaceful wave of strike." The Taft-Hartley Act banned the "closed shop," permitted the president to order "cooling-off" periods before strikes in critical industries, and reduced the budget of the Department of Labor.
The Taft-Hartley Act remains intact today. In its 64-year history, it has been invoked 33 times. While Truman vetoed the bill originally, he invoked it 10 times in the remaining six years of his presidency, far more than any other president. Interestingly, Democratic presidents have issued approximately two-thirds of all the orders to invoke Taft-Hartley.
The Taft-Hartley Act was last invoked by George W. Bush in October 2002, to avert a shutdown of West Coast ports. The New York Times reported that President Bush sought to keep commerce moving ahead of the Christmas shopping season, while taking on political risk by angering labor unions a month before mid-term elections. The article noted, "a repeated problem with Taft-Hartley injunctions is that they do not guarantee a resolution of the labor dispute. When the cooling-off period ends, unions often resume their walkout."
Connect to Today:
The Taft-Hartley Act's justification for permitting the president to order "cooling-off" periods before strikes in critical industries is that national interests sometimes trump the rights of groups of individuals. Do you agree with this principal? Can you think of other times when individual rights are compromised for the collective good? 
Looking through one day's edition of The Times, how many articles can you find in which this principal is at work?

HEADLINE: Handicapping the Republican Field: Part I, the Top Tier

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Looking at the front-runner and the other three top candidates in the first of three parts that will handicap the Republican field.

 BODY:
It is too soon to apply a purely objective approach to forecasting the outcome of the Republican primaries. But I do not think that it is too soon to start getting specific about the chances that we might assign to each candidate. Most of the crucial candidates have kicked off their campaigns. Debates are being held, the Iowa Straw Poll is only about 50 days away, and one candidate has already begun running commercials in Iowa.
What will follow, in a three-part series, is the way I would handicap the Republican field as of today. In this piece, we'll look at the four top candidates, in my view.
The odds listed below are based on a combination of objective and subjective factors. I'm constantly thinking about the Republican field in this fashion, comparing the odds I'd assign to each candidate with those that are available, for instance, according to betting markets like Intrade. Although I'm reluctant to publish specific numbers without the backing of a formal statistical model, I thought I should be explicit about sharing my thought process with you. This is also a good excuse to touch at least briefly upon each candidate, including some whom I might not have written about for some time.
The Republican contenders currently sort themselves into five relatively neat groups or tiers, although one group consists of a single candidate. That candidate, Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, has broken away from the pack and is the front-runner.
The Front-RunnerMitt Romney, 3-2 odds against (40 percent chance of winning nomination)
Mr. Romney is perceived as having run a slow-and-steady campaign - but he's made the largest gains of any Republican candidate in the last two months, to an average of 26 percent of the vote in polls conducted in June from 18 percent in those conducted in April. Some of this is a result of other Republican candidates dropping from the field. Yet while candidates like Tim Pawlenty and Newt Gingrich have remained flat in polling, Mr. Romney has gained ground.
In fact, when I run Mr. Romney's numbers through our purely objective model - which needs to be taken with ample grains of salt but can, perhaps, provide a useful starting point - it gives him pretty close to a 50-50 chance of being the Republican nominee. Historically, once a candidate's polling gets into the high 20s or the low 30s, he can be thought of as a legitimate front-runner, rather than first among equals.
I list Mr. Romney as having only about a 40 percent chance of winning, however, because of the concerns over how his health care bill might play out once voters become more exposed to it, and his apparent reluctance to fully engage in Iowa.
But Mr. Romney also has some factors working in his favor. He's a former governor, and governors historically outperform their polling. He has run a campaign for president before, something few other Republican candidates have done. He has something of a firewall in New Hampshire, where his polling is very strong. He does well when it comes to raising money.
And Mr. Romney can point toward polls showing him running reasonably well against President Obama - some polls show him roughly tied against Mr. Obama, for instance, something that is not really true for any of the other candidates. Although I don't think these head-to-head polls have much predictive value at this early stage, that doesn't mean they can't make for good talking points. 
Mr. Romney (perhaps along with Jon Huntsman) already seems to be speaking as much to a general-election audience as to Republican voters. That strategy implicitly emphasizes the candidate's "inevitability" and encourages voters to look forward to November. It can backfire: recall what happened to Hillary Rodham Clinton four years ago. But my guess is that the weaker Mr. Obama's position seems to be (and it's weaker now after a month of poor economic numbers), the more those arguments will resonate with Republican voters.
Following Mr. Romney are three candidates who, while not quite sharing his position of strength, have the most control over their electoral destinies.
The First TierTim Pawlenty, 9-2 odds against (18 percent chance of winning nomination)
I've generally considered myself to be somewhat bearish on Mr. Pawlenty's candidacy, mostly out of concern that he lacked the raw political talent to differentiate himself from the pack. In some ways, these concerns might seem to have been validated by the last couple of months. Mr. Pawlenty's polling has barely improved, despite increasing name recognition. He missed an opportunity to attack Mr. Romney during the Republican debate in New Hampshire last week. And he has a potential problem in the form of Rick Perry, who could adopt a somewhat similar strategy and compete for some of the same voters and resources.
Still, at the price being offered at Intrade, which gives Mr. Pawlenty just a 10 percent chance of becoming the nominee, I think he is an attractive buy. Along with Mr. Romney, he's been running a full-fledged campaign from the get-go - really, since the day the 2008 campaign ended - which could pay all sorts of "intangible" dividends down the road, from having a staff capable of weathering speed bumps to doing well in states like Iowa that require a candidate to have a lot of roots in the ground.
His ideological positioning is very close to that of the median Republican voter, and polls find that a very high percentage of the Republican electorate considers him an acceptable (if not necessarily exciting) nominee. He's a former governor and one who has run in a couple of competitive campaigns. And he clearly has a decent chance to win Iowa, particularly if Mr. Romney fails to commit fully.
Rick Perry, 7-1 odds against (12.5 percent chance of winning nomination)
If Mr. Perry were to announce this afternoon that he was running, I'd list him and Mr. Pawlenty at roughly equal odds to win the nomination. Both have traditional credentials and can appeal to a fairly large segment of the Republican electorate. Both have some geographic advantages - Mr. Pawlenty's potential strength in Iowa, and Mr. Perry's in the South.
That isn't to say that the two candidates are identical. Mr. Perry is a little more dynamic on the stump and might prove to be the better fund-raiser, whereas Mr. Pawlenty (even if Mr. Perry enters the race) will benefit from having begun his campaign earlier and may be perceived as being more electable. I'd view these factors as essentially canceling one another out.
But Mr. Perry is not yet fully committed to running -- an adviser told Politico that the chances were closer to 50-50. I suspect the odds are a touch better than that -- Mr. Perry's interest in the campaign is clearly more than casual, and it's not a bad sign that a candidate is doing his due diligence. Still, it's too soon to take for granted that he must be written into the script. Also, if and when Mr. Perry decides to run, he will be subject to more scrutiny than he is receiving currently. It is not obvious, for example, that Republican thought leaders will hold him in the same high regard that they do Mr. Pawlenty.
Michele Bachmann, 15-2 odds against (12 percent chance of winning nomination)
Ms. Bachmann has averaged 7 percent of the vote in polls conducted so far in June - a slight improvement from a couple of months ago, but not a terrific performance. That does not distinguish, however, between polls conducted before and after last week's Republican debate, where she performed very well and announced her candidacy. The only post-debate poll that meets our methodological standards had Ms. Bachmann surging to 19 percent of the vote (although the poll did not include Sarah Palin). Her standing has also improved significantly in some state-level polls.
My view is that if Ms. Bachmann's polling settles into the mid-teens, she will have elevated herself from being a wild card to being a legitimate contender for the Republican nomination. In fact, there is probably some upside in the numbers: her name recognition is not yet universal (62 percent of Republicans could identify her in the most recent round of Gallup polls), and as it grows, she may gain support from low-information voters who had previously expressed a preference for well-known politicians like Sarah Palin or Newt Gingrich.
Of course, her candidacy has its issues. One is that she is a member of the House of Representatives, and members of the House don't have a very good track record in primary campaigns. I don't think this is a major drawback. My analysis suggests that while governors perform better than members of Congress there is little difference between how senators and members of the House perform, relative to their polling. And Ms. Bachmann has essentially been a nationalized figure for several years; she is the leader of the Tea Party Caucus, and her re-election campaigns have drawn tens of millions of dollars in contributions, tantamount to what a Senate or gubernatorial candidate would normally receive.
The more significant barrier is that Republicans might be worried about her chances in a general election. Ms. Bachmann's voting record, according to the objective system DW-Nominate, is roughly as far from the middle of the electorate as George McGovern's was in 1972 - and her red-meat rhetoric does nothing to disguise those positions. If Ms. Bachmann won Iowa, there would be an effort to rally around some more moderate alternative, most likely the candidate who wins New Hampshire.
Ms. Bachmann could get lucky if the establishment vote is stalemated between two or more alternatives - for example, Mr. Romney and Mr. Pawlenty - while she monopolizes votes from the conservative wing. But most likely, she will need to be at the top of her game to survive this.
It's far from out of the question that she might pull it off. Ms. Bachmann's favorability ratings aren't terrible -- in fact, they're basically identical to Mr. Pawlenty's. So the critiques about her electability may not be able to rely on the same hard evidence that they would, for example, in the case of Sarah Palin. In addition, Ms. Bachmann seems to have a strategy to address the arguments. In last week's debate, she spoke confidently about the idea that Mr. Obama would be a one-term president - challenging conservatives to maximize the amount of ideological ground they might gain since he is bound to lose anyway. (Essentially, this is the opposite of the argument that a candidate like Mr. Romney might make, who will cite Mr. Obama's vulnerability as reason to nominate a more moderate candidate.)
Ms. Bachmann has a lot of natural talent, as was on display during the debate. Unlike Ms. Palin, she seems to recognize that it takes a village to run a presidential campaign, having surrounded herself with competent advisers like Ed Rollins, who managed Mike Huckabee's overachieving campaign in 2008. Even those who are skeptical about her candidacy would probably concede that she has a good chance of winning Iowa, where she was born and will devote much of her attention.
It's hard to say exactly how much value Republicans will place on electability. But "extreme" candidates like Mr. McGovern and Barry Goldwater have received their party's nominations before, and the conditions for a repeat of these circumstances are probably better than average. My view is that there is about a 1-in-5 chance that Mr. Obama will benefit from running against such a candidate, with Ms. Bachmann being the most likely of those alternatives.
We'll look at the next tier of Republican candidates in the next part of the series.

HEADLINE: Afghans Imagine a Country Without Foreign Forces

BYLINE: SHARIFULLAH SAHAK


HIGHLIGHT: For some Afghans, who have lived through decades of war, President Obama's planned troop reduction feels like history repeating itself.

 BODY:
For many people in Afghanistan, President Barack Obama's announcement of American troop withdrawals seems like history repeating itself. The Russians left this country, too, and so did the British.
When I listened to Mr. Obama's speech on the radio this morning, I tried to imagine an Afghanistan without foreign forces. I thought about the days when Kabul's roads were empty. Today our roads are filled with luxury cars and the city is full of nice buildings.
Even women are driving, something I never saw before the foreign forces came. Many people fear that once foreign forces are gone, our country will be divided in two, that northern commanders will fight the Taliban and the southern Pashtuns to keep them from returning to power. I think it's a big possibility, too, though I know it's too early to say this.
The last couple of days I talked to people around the country about Mr. Obama's planned announcement. Some believed that foreign leaders are looking for any excuse to pull out their troops, not because they've achieved the goals they set out to reach but because they are tired of the war. Some think the foreigners are leaving because they know they can't win. And many worry that they will leave before our Afghan army and the police are strong enough to defend us.
"The Russians also did the same thing and they were cutting the numbers of their troops step by step, as Barack Obama is going to announce," said Wala Jan, 60, a taxi driver in Nangarhar, an eastern province, before the announcement.
"They are now leaving us in the middle of the war because they can't fight the Taliban. And after they leave Afghanistan I am sure the civil war will begin, because people who were helping the foreigners will face attacks and the Taliban will take their revenge on them."
Mr. Jan added, "The foreigners could not defeat the Taliban so now they are finding an excuse to escape from Afghanistan."
However Gen. Abdul Wahid Taqat, a former Afghan army officer during the time of President Najibullah, believes that it is just a game: they withdraw 10,000 soldiers now, and 15,000 will come from somewhere else.
"Barack Obama is trying to show something before the next Bonn conference, so he can say that at least we did something," he said. "And from the other side, America is facing a big economic crisis. He is under pressure from his own people, so in order to deceive his people he is making this announcement: 'We are bringing our troops home.' "

HEADLINE: Is Fukushima a Roadblock, or Just a Speed Bump?

BYLINE: MATTHEW L. WALD


HIGHLIGHT: Three energy experts suggest that the nuclear accident in Japan will have a more modest impact on reactor construction than some expect.

 BODY:
 Three months after the Fukushima Daiichi accident in Japan, energy experts are moving past analyzing the accident itself and trying to divine what it means for the future of nuclear power. Three experts from Platts, the energy newsletter publishing company, suggested on Thursday that it might be minimal. The three spoke in a webinar sponsored by Westinghouse, the reactor manufacturer. There will certainly be an impact in Japan itself, where 14 new reactors were planned by 2030 but at most four will go forward, predicted Martin Daniel, the senior editor of the Platts newsletter Power in Asia. And, of course, at least four of the six reactors at Fukushima Daiichi will not run again, he said.
But the Platts experts, who also follow coal, natural gas and renewable energy, saw relatively modest impacts elsewhere. They are not alone; the Carnegie Endowment recently reached a similar conclusion. 
China, for example, has announced that it will pause in its nuclear development. But Mr. Daniel said that a list of planned Chinese reactors had included many that "were in places that weren't really suitable for nuclear reactors'' in the first place and that were proposed by local officials, not the central government. The Fukushima accident presents an opportunity to weed those out. China has 120 gigawatts of new capacity on the drawing boards by 2020 but is likely to build only about 70 megawatts, he said. Even that is sevenfold growth over what it has now. 
Thailand at first announced it was scrubbing plans for its first reactor but is now talking about a three-year delay instead, he said. And while the accident has catalyzed opposition to reactors in India, those will probably go forward as well, he predicted. "Asia is really very pragmatic about nuclear power,'' he said. "It needs more power of all kinds; electricity demand is growing very quickly throughout the region.'' 
"Countries like China and India don't have a way to take the high moral ground that more advanced economies can take," and reject new power plants, he said. By contrast, Germany has shelved plans for new plants and closed some existing ones. 
But another expert, Henry Edwardes-Evans, editor of the Platts newsletter Power in Europe, said that Germany's decision not to go forward actually brought that country back to where it had been last year, before the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel reversed itself and decided to build more. 
Italy has decided not to build more reactors, but building big new fossil-fired power plants there will be a challenge, he added. Switzerland has shelved plans to build new reactors, but the ones it has will be running for quite a while, he said. 
In the United States, the so-called "nuclear renaissance" was in trouble even before the Fukushima accident, another expert, Peter Maloney, pointed out, with two of the more promising reactor projects canceled before the disaster. A third in Texas, in which the Tokyo Electric Power Company was a partner, has now also been shelved.

HEADLINE: Modest New Steps on the Food Supply

BYLINE: JUSTIN GILLIS


HIGHLIGHT: In a reflection of growing global concern about shortages, agriculture ministers from the Group of 20 agree to create an information system to shine a brighter light on global grain flows and reserves.

 BODY:
The global food crisis is getting a fresh round of high-level attention. At their first-ever summit meeting on Thursday, agriculture ministers for the Group of 20 major economies agreed on an action plan to tackle food supply problems as well as high and volatile prices for major commodities.
Perhaps the most significant element will be the creation of a new information system designed to shine a brighter light on global grain flows and reserves. In the past some countries, notably China and India, have treated this kind of information as state secrets. Both traders and scientists have long complained about the lack of reliable global statistics, especially regarding stockpiles. 
China and India have committed themselves to taking part in the new system, although it remains to be seen how accurate and timely the information supplied by them and other countries will be. Experts do not expect better information to stop the gyrations of commodity prices but say it could help to ease the extreme volatility of recent years. At a news conference, the World Bank president, Robert B. Zoellick, hailed the overall plan and especially the new information system, which he said would "throw a light on the darkness and secrecy of reserves" and help to "bring some order and some predictability to the international food system."
The plan also includes a small pilot project to develop an emergency global grain reserve under the auspices of the World Food Program.
Advocacy groups complained that Thursday's communique was weak in several respects. For instance, skeptical language about biofuels was watered down at the insistence of the United States and Brazil, two big biofuel producers. 
ActionAid's first analysis of the plan can be found here, another by Oxfam is here, and a coalition of Catholic development agencies weighs in here.
Despite the complaints, the larger significance of the agriculture ministers' meeting may be that it happened at all. It is another sign that food security is a rising issue on the global political agenda, a big change from recent decades. During an era of low food prices that lasted until 2007, budgets for agricultural development were cut with little heed of the long-run consequences. Now they are beginning to recover.

HEADLINE: Romney Waged Political Battle Against Brother of Crime Boss

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney made it his mission to oust Whitey Bulger's brother, William Bulger, from his prestigious post as president of the University of Massachusetts.

 BODY:
The capture of the Boston crime boss Whitey Bulger by the F.B.I. must have been received with great interest in the presidential campaign headquarters of Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts.
It was Mr. Romney, after all, who made it his mission to oust Mr. Bulger's brother, William Bulger, from his prestigious post as president of the University of Massachusetts amid questions about the brothers' relationship. 
James Bulger, known as Whitey, who was nabbed in Los Angeles on Wednesday night, is a legendary mob boss from Boston who has been indicted in 19 murders. He disappeared 16 years ago and was captured Wednesday night. 
William Bulger, his younger brother and a leading figure in the Democratic political machine in Boston, became the target of Mr. Romney after he refused to testify to Congress on questions about his fugitive brother's whereabouts in 2002. Mr. Bulger, the former president of the Massachusetts state senate, invoked his Fifth Amendment rights against self incrimination.
The elder Mr. Bulger eventually did provide testimony, appearing in Washington under a grant of immunity before the House Government Reform Committee. But he continued to deny that he knew how to find his younger brother -- who was by then on the F.B.I.'s most wanted list. 
"I do not know where my brother is," William Bulger said during the hearing. "I do not know where he has been over the past eight years. I have not aided James Bulger in any way while he has been a fugitive. Do I possess information that could to lead to my brother's arrest? The honest answer is no."
Mr. Romney, who had just taken over as governor, said the spectacle of a college president dodging questions brought discredit on the university. His months of effort to force William Bulger out of office helped cement Mr. Romney's reputation as an outsider who was not part of the state's tradition-bound political system.
"The president continues to, in the way he responds to this inquiry, continues to cast a shadow on his leadership and on the university itself and I was very troubled by it," Mr. Romney said at the time.
The Republican governor won that battle, forcing the university president to resign despite a political career that had for years made him politically untouchable. William Bulger resigned in August 2003, accusing Mr. Romney of a "calculated political assault."
In a statement on Thursday morning, Mr. Romney, now a candidate for president, made no mention of the political battle he waged with the university president.
"I hope the capture of Whitey Bulger brings some measure of relief to the families of his numerous victims," Mr. Romney said. "It brings to a close a sad and sordid chapter in recent Massachusetts history."

HEADLINE: Enter Huntsman: Answers From Matt Bai

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Matt Bai took reader questions this week and we've compiled his answers to select questions here.

 BODY:
In his profile of Jon M. Huntsman Jr., who entered the race for the Republican presidential nomination this week, Matt Bai, The New York Times Magazine's chief political correspondent, answered a lot of questions about the relatively unknown former governor of Utah. He took reader questions this week and we've compiled his answers to select questions here.Q.Which high school did he attend? Public or private?
-- Posted by Frank J. Carnabuci IIIA.An excellent question, Frank, and I did not know the answer, so I did some reporting on your behalf. Turns out Mr. Huntsman attended Palo Alto High School, a public school, before dropping out to pursue his dream of becoming the next Freddie Mercury. He later earned a G.E.D. He went on the University of Utah and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, where his father's name adorns a building.Q.Has he made any definitive statements in regards to where he stands on immigration in general ... and illegal immigration in specific?
-- Posted by RCA.I don't know if he's made any definitive statements yet, RC, but I have heard him talk informally about the issue, and he says he thinks it's important for us to help the children of undocumented immigrants assimilate into the country, rather than punishing them for being here. Without divulging conversations I witnessed that were off the record, I can tell you that he is pretty firm on this point, even when challenged by his own supporters.Q.Does Mr. Huntsman gain any advantage in the presidential race from his ties to China (or from his distance from China -- he wasn't the most loved U.S. ambassador after his stumble or deliberate step into the molihua [or jasmine] revolution)?
-- Posted by EmilyA.I could see how his experience in China could be a real strength, because it enables him to talk about global competitiveness firsthand, and about how China is preparing itself for the coming decades in ways that we may not be. But as I asked Mr. Huntsman at one point: How do you talk about what China is doing in infrastructure and education without also making the case that the United States needs public investment in order to keep up?
For what it's worth, this was, in part, his response: "We can only afford large-scale public investment if we get our books balanced and if there's some national desire to move ahead on something like national infrastructure enhancements, which is exactly what the Chinese have done. They can afford to do it. They have $2.4 trillion in the bank. They earned their money first. They earned it by becoming the most powerful export machine the world has ever known. They didn't start with infrastructure enhancements."Q.Mr. Huntsman claims to have built jobs, not bought them. What is his role in his "family" chemicals conglomerate?
-- Posted by J FritzscheA.He worked there as an executive in between government jobs. Near as I can tell, it's the only private sector job Mr. Huntsman has ever held, unless you count clearing dishes at Marie Callendar's. Which raises an interesting point about Mr. Huntsman that I think will arise in the campaign if he gains any traction as a candidate: While he's clearly been able at many jobs and made the most of his opportunities in life, just about all of those opportunities have stemmed in some way from his family's wealth and connections.Q.Will the evangelicals in the Republican Party-base shy away from Mr. Huntsman because of his religious faith? Will the party elders (Rove et al.) shy away from him because of his potential lack of support from the evangelicals? What backroom dealing is going on right now to try and sew the two groups together to be unified?
-- Posted by Randy MA.Good question, Randy, and I think this would be a bigger issue if Mr. Huntsman were the only Mormon in the race. But since the presumed front-runner, Mitt Romney, is also Mormon and has run before, it seems to me a minor consideration. Mr. Huntsman will surely not attract a lot of evangelical followers, but that's much more likely to be because he supports civil unions for gay couples than because of his faith.Q.Does he still stand by his speech at the 2008 G.O.P. convention introducing and endorsing Sarah Palin for V.P. of the United States of America? Would he consider Sarah Palin to be his running mate? Why or why not?
-- Posted by Cowboy A.I wish I'd asked him that question. I didn't.Q.Will the fact that Mr. Huntsman worked for President Obama make him intolerable to the Tea Party?
-- Posted by Mark L.A.Probably, yes.Q.As a progressive who volunteered time and money for Obama's campaign last time around, it's unlikely that in the end my vote could be swayed in 2012. However, I was intrigued a few months ago to read about Mr. Huntsman's intention to be very careful about the campaign donations he accepts. I don't remember the details, but the purported intent was to avoid corporate donors, etc. Is he still intending to do this, and how significant of a step do you think it would be?
-- Posted by Sally LA.I didn't hear him say anything about corporate donors, Sally, and I'd be surprised if he can afford to be very discerning that way. I did ask him about self-financing his campaign, and he flatly said he wouldn't and couldn't do that-wouldn't because he thinks a viable candidate needs to be able to attract investors, and couldn't because he just isn't wealthy enough. (Mr. Huntsman's father has said he intends to give all his billion-plus dollars away to charity.) I suggested he sell his motorcycles. He declined.Q.Matt, I just don't get this candidacy. There's another Mormon with strong Utah ties in the race, and Mr. Huntsman is basically . . . to the left of him. Exactly what constituency, other than Penn graduates, does he hope to appeal to? Or is he simply hoping that Mr. Romney will crash (see Romney, George, 1968) and pick up the pieces?
-- Posted by michael a. livingstonA.I think, Michael, that Mr. Huntsman is betting a lot on authenticity, as he told me in the piece. Mr. Romney has worked hard to win over conservative activists and disavow his more moderate record in Massachusetts. Mr. Huntsman isn't above changing a few positions either (he has, for instance, abandoned his onetime support for cap-and-trade), but he's going to present himself as a guy who doesn't tell you whatever you want to hear and who stays constant in his beliefs.Q.Because of his relations with China, do you think American relations with China will increase and strengthen if he becomes president?
-- Posted by JasonA.I think China would become a very central focus for a President Huntsman, if such a thing were ever to come to pass. He's clearly obsessed with the place and always has been. His eyes light up whenever he so much as sees a Chinese speaker.Q.What kind of beer does he drink? It's important.
-- Posted by RCA.And if he'd invited me out for a beer, I'd know. In five days with Mr. Huntsman, I never personally witnessed him eating or drinking. Maybe he's a droid.Q.Does he believe in God? And, if so, why?
-- Posted by TedSA.I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that he does believe in God. I thought it was interesting that at one point, when we were discussing what it was like to campaign in New Hampshire, Mr. Huntsman described it as "the quintessential end of the refiner's fire." That's a Biblical reference that's popular in the Mormon faith, and what it said to me is that he's pretty comfortable with his religious grounding.Q.Do you think Mr. Huntsman will even run that hard this election cycle? It seems to me his primary gambit is still to establish a name, network, cachet and other assets for 2016. If Mr. Romney or another Republican loses to Obama in 2012 (as I suspect will be the case given the multimonth trend of a slightly improving economy, the incumbent's natural advantage, the killing of Bin Laden and other Obama strengths), then Republicans could relatively quickly cohere around a single candidate in 2016 a la Dole, Bush and McCain with the singular aim of retaking the White House. Mr. Huntsman should be extremely well positioned in 2016 should that happen.
-- Posted by SUA.This is, in fact, a very popular theory of Mr. Huntsman's motives, and I address it in the piece. But I have to tell you that, in my experience, it's just not in the nature of most serious politicians to run for any office - including the presidency - expecting to lose. I don't doubt that 2016 is in the back of Mr. Huntsman's mind, but I'm pretty sure this campaign isn't some clever ploy to set himself up for later. He has convinced himself he can win now.Q.Do you think Florida will be his firewall, much like Rudy planned on. Or does he have a good shot down there, with it being [his wife] Mary Kaye's home state, and his nat'l headquarters in Orlando?
-- Posted by RodgerA.My guess is that if Mr. Huntsman could somehow win or at least run strong in New Hampshire and South Carolina, then he would be competitive in Florida. But I doubt you could get to Florida with no momentum and view it as a firewall. You have to break out in an earlier state, I would think, which is why Mr. Giuliani's strategy failed.

HEADLINE: 6 Candidates Bid for G.O.P. Iowa Straw Poll

BYLINE: JEFF ZELENY


HIGHLIGHT: Six Republican presidential campaigns offered bids for the best real estate at the Aug. 13 Iowa Straw Poll.

 BODY:
The lineup for the Iowa Straw Poll appears to be set.
Six Republican presidential campaigns offered bids on Thursday during an auction for the best real estate at the Aug. 13 event at Iowa State University.
The candidates who intend to participate are Ron Paul, Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, Rick Santorum, Tim Pawlenty and Thaddeus McCotter. Of that group, only Mr. McCotter, a congressman from Michigan, has yet to formally declare his intentions, but he has been eyeing a potential run for weeks.
Newt Gingrich sent representatives to the meeting in Des Moines at the headquarters of the Republican Party of Iowa, which sponsors the straw poll, but participants said his campaign did not bid. Mitt Romney and Jon M. Huntsman Jr. have said that they do not intend to participate. (They do, however, plan to attend a Republican debate in Iowa two days earlier.)
The highest bidder receives the chance to select the best turf outside the Hilton Coliseum in Ames, where the event takes place. This year, the minimum bid was $15,000.
According to participants, Mr. Paul offered $31,000; Mr. McCotter, $18,000; Ms. Bachmann and Mr. Cain, $17,000; Mr. Santorum and Mr. Pawlenty, $15,000.
The bidding simply guaranteed a spot of land to host supporters on the day of the straw poll. All of the declared candidates are expected to be on the ballot. 
The daylong summertime political carnival, which Mr. Romney won four years ago, has long served as a test of a candidate's organization. It is not always a reliable predictor of the outcome of the Iowa caucuses, which take place early next year.
This real estate deal is perhaps one of the few that has not been affected by inflation. In 1999, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas paid $43,500 for his piece of land at the straw poll, which he won handily on his way to becoming the Republican presidential nominee.

HEADLINE: How AARP Can Get Its Groove Back

BYLINE: By FREDERICK R. LYNCH. 
Frederick R. Lynch, an associate professor of government at Claremont McKenna College, is the author of ''One Nation Under AARP: The Fight Over Medicare, Social Security, and America's Future.''

 BODY:
Claremont, Calif.
THE emerging debate over the future of entitlements is forcing an overdue identity crisis at AARP. Last week, leaders of the 37-million-member group issued a vague half-denial after news accounts reported that they were prepared to accept cutbacks in Social Security benefits. It was a wavering, confusing response that reflected mission drift and a loss of organizational focus and identity.
AARP, founded in 1958, needs to get its groove back and narrow a policy agenda that has become too broad, too busy and too ambitious, with multiple and competing identities, interests and constituencies. Over the past decade, under the leadership of the former advertising executive Bill Novelli, it developed a big-tent ideology in response to critics' charges that it had been a lobby for ''greedy geezers.'' 
But that trend has gone too far. Critics within the organization rightly say that what was once known as the American Association of Retired Persons might as well be renamed the ''Association of Persons'' -- a tendency apparent in advertising messages like ''AARP is an organization for people who have birthdays.''
Whose AARP is it?
Too many members -- as evidenced by angry responses from readers of the recent news reports -- would say that AARP has become greedy and self-serving, ready to sacrifice older Americans' political interests to its own economic bottom line, which is no longer dependent just on members' dues, but has broadened to include a range of profit-making activities. The suspicion is partly grounded in AARP's unusual status: it is a giant nonprofit organization that uses dues, as well as sales of consumer services by its profit-making subsidiaries, to finance its policy advocacy and charitable activities and free or low-cost services like tax preparation and driver education.
The image of AARP as a money-making machine was sharpened during Mr. Novelli's tenure, from 2001 to 2009, when the organization greatly enhanced revenues and made a commensurate increase in advertising to sell an ever expanding range of products and services: AARP-branded health, home and auto insurance, credit cards, and cellphone and travel service discounts.
AARP must get back to the basics: it stands for Americans 50 and older and the policies and programs that protect them. Period.
My primary interest in AARP is as a social scientist, but I am also a member, as my parents were. In the course of my research, a former AARP board member told me, ''We own Social Security and Medicare.'' Fine. But in an era of retrenchment, AARP must be prepared to defend those programs with the most aggressive voter education, member mobilization and lobbying campaigns it has ever organized.
Aging boomers need AARP; there is no one with clout left to defend them. They will be as dependent as their parents were on Medicare and Social Security, but in many cases they are far less prepared for retirement. It is worrisome that younger generations fear that they will never collect benefits. But they are not AARP's primary constituency. Other interest groups, and lawmakers in Congress, will cynically use calls for greater generational equity as an ax for deeper cutbacks now.
AARP has adopted a pragmatic, bipartisan approach over the last decade. Using its well-financed lobbying machine, the group was instrumental in obtaining Medicare prescription drug coverage in 2003, blocking George W. Bush's efforts to privatize Social Security in 2005 and getting President Obama's health care plan passed in 2010.
But this time is different.
If AARP's leaders have already agreed to accept limited reductions in Social Security benefits as part of a strategic play to preserve a dominant role in the coming debate over entitlement reform, as has been reported, it is a grave error that will only encourage further concessions and demoralize activist members.
Legendary allies, like Senators Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Claude Pepper of Florida, are gone. A formidable phalanx of key policy players have mobilized to advance proposals for deep cuts or radical restructuring of entitlements. AARP's ambivalence will only embolden politicians who already have challenged the alleged unity of the ''senior vote,'' realizing that it has long been fragmented by differences in income, ideology, education, race, religion, gender and marital status.
But a strong AARP stand on Social Security and Medicare has the potential support of not only 78 million aging boomers but also the general public; polls have found broad majorities opposed to slashing Social Security and converting Medicare into a voucher system.
It might also heal the ideological rifts and mini-mutiny wrought by AARP's support of Mr. Obama's health care plan. That episode cost AARP at least 400,000 members, many of whom wrote angry letters and e-mails accusing it of selling out older Americans and redistributing Medicare funds to other groups (a suspicion that lingers because the Obama health care overhaul projects a reduction in the rate of increase in Medicare spending). Finally, leading a popular political crusade might dispel the stereotype that AARP puts profits over principles.
This could be AARP's finest hour. In surveys, the organization has usually ranked among the most trusted institutions in the nation, along with groups like the American Red Cross and the Consumers Union. AARP knows there is political power in numbers -- and in organization. In the past, however, it had only to activate a small portion of its huge membership base to register political impact. ''All they have to do is whisper,'' one consultant told me.
This time they will have to roar.

HEADLINE: Court Says Ex-Wife May Retain Ponzi Scheme Money

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
The Ponzi schemes that came to light during the depths of the financial crisis have spawned various lawsuits seeking to claw back money from divorce agreements.
Now, in one case, a court has said: Hands off.
On Thursday, New York's highest court ruled that a woman could keep proceeds from a divorce agreement, even if those proceeds were the ill-gotten gains of a financial fraud perpetrated by her former husband.
The decision is a blow to the federal government, which is seeking to force the woman to disgorge what it says are millions of dollars in stolen money. 
''Ex-spouses have a reasonable expectation that, once their marriage has been dissolved and their property divided, they will be free to move on with their lives,'' said Judge Victoria A. Graffeo, writing for the New York State Court of Appeals.
The federal appeals court in Manhattan, which had asked the New York State court for guidance on the case, is now expected to prevent the federal government from seizing the woman's assets.
Thursday's ruling could also affect other divorce cases, like some involving victims of Bernard L. Madoff's huge Ponzi scheme.
The New York State Court of Appeals is hearing a case brought by a man seeking to rescind his divorce settlement with his ex-wife because a large chunk of the marital proceeds were in a Madoff account.
The husband, Steven Simkin, kept much of his money with Mr. Madoff after the divorce; his wife, Laura Blank, received cash. After losing the bulk of his assets in the Madoff fraud, Mr. Simkin now wants to rewrite their divorce agreement.
In Massachusetts, a Madoff victim has also sued his ex-wife to revise their separation pact. A family court judge dismissed the lawsuit this month, and the plaintiff's lawyer has appealed.
Thursday's ruling in New York involves Janet Schaberg, 55 years old, the former wife of Stephen Walsh, a former executive at WG Trading, a commodities firm in Greenwich, Conn.
In February 2009, federal authorities arrested Mr. Walsh and his business partner, Paul Greenwood, on charges that they had defrauded investors of more than $550 million in a 13-year Ponzi scheme.
Mr. Greenwood pleaded guilty last year; Mr. Walsh is fighting the case.
Although the government did not accuse Ms. Schaberg of having any knowledge or participation in the scheme, lawyers at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission went after her money, saying that much of it was ill-gotten proceeds from her former husband's fraud.
In August 2009, a federal judge agreed with the government, freezing most of Ms. Schaberg's assets, including $7.6 million in cash.
Ms. Schaberg, who divorced Mr. Walsh in 2007 after 25 years of marriage, appealed the judge's order.
Her lawyer, Steven Kessler, argued that once she and Mr. Walsh had divided their marital property and signed a divorce settlement agreement, the government could not force her to disgorge what were her rightful proceeds.
In an unusual request, the federal appeals court asked New York state's highest court for guidance on the divorce-law issues instead of a ruling.
The case, Judge Graffeo wrote, raised ''difficult policy questions'' that required the court to weigh the competing interests of returning stolen property to its rightful owners against the innocent former spouse of the defrauder.
In ruling for Ms. Schaberg, the court made an analogy between Ms. Schaberg and her divorce settlement proceeds and any person who unknowingly receives tainted money in a business transaction. For instance, the government could not seize stolen money from an architect whom a thief had paid to build his home.
The court said its decision to protect Ms. Schaberg, an innocent recipient of stolen funds, over the victims of the Ponzi scheme, was ''rooted in New York's concern for finality in business transactions.''
The decision emphasized that fraud victims could try to reclaim their stolen money if the former spouse was aware or participated in the crime.
Representatives for the S.E.C. and C.F.T.C. declined to comment.
New York divorce lawyers are divided on the decision. Michael D. Stutman, a divorce lawyer in Manhattan, is uninvolved in the Schaberg case, but along with three other lawyers, he submitted a brief that sided with the government.
''We disagree with the decision because someone in possession of stolen property should not be able to claim an ownership interest superior to the rightful owner,'' Mr. Stutman said.
''Here, however, largely because she received 'title' to the ill-gotten gains through the divorce, she trumps the claims of people from whom the money was stolen,'' he said.
Mr. Stutman also questioned the court's emphasis on what it called New York's ''strong public policy of ensuring finality in divorce proceedings.''
He said other facets of divorce law - the amount of child and spousal support, as well as child-custody issues - are all subject to change based on newly discovered facts.
''Why is finality all of a sudden so sacred that you're depriving victims of a fraud from access to their assets?'' he asked.
Richard Emery, a lawyer for Ms. Blank, who is battling with her former husband in the New York case involving the Madoff fraud, applauded the ruling, calling it ''the right result for families and society.''
''The appeals court embraced the plight of a spouse who relies on the right to move on with her life after divorce,'' Mr. Emery said. ''This consideration trumps the interest of even the federal government.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: For Many in Britain, Being a Homeowner Is a Fading Dream

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
LONDON -- For a large number of young adults in Britain, homeownership has become increasingly difficult to achieve, viewed as a distant goal attainable only later in life, if at all.
That is a significant shift for a country where owning a home remains deeply rooted in the culture. Owners occupy a higher percentage of homes in Britain than in the United States, France or Germany.
But as the pain of government-imposed austerity sinks in, disposable income has shrunk and loan requirements have toughened, forcing more and more Britons into renting rather than buying. 
The average age of first-time buyers is now 31, up from 28 five years ago, and the number of people renting has increased sharply, signs that the boom in homeownership that began under Margaret Thatcher's government 30 years ago is starting to reverse.
Some economists are concerned that as more people are forced to wait to buy a home, the country's wealth gap could widen, endangering the retirement prospects for a swelling group of young adults they call ''generation rent.''
Charlotte Ashton, 30, has lived in rented accommodations ever since she left her parent's home to attend university. She said she was happy sharing a five-bedroom house in the Shepherds Bush area of London with four other women but was saving for a down payment to buy her own home.
''I do believe in the fundamentals of owning bricks and mortar as security for the future, more than leaving my money in the banks at a low interest rate,'' said Ms. Ashton, who works in public relations. ''Unless you have a very well paid job and are willing to save every penny, it's unfeasible to buy without the help of the bank of Mum and Dad.''
About four years ago, a first-time buyer had to raise an average down payment equal to 41 percent of annual income to buy a property, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders. Now it is more than 87 percent of income, or about $:26,500 ($42,800). And while banks were willing to make mortgage loans for more than the value of the house before the credit crisis, buyers now find they must put up at least 10 percent, and often substantially more. (The average deposit for first-time buyers is 23 percent, according to the price comparison Web site Moneysupermarket).
A study by Halifax, a British mortgage lender, showed last month that while 77 percent of 20 to 45 year-olds who were currently renting would like to buy a home, more than two-thirds believed they had no prospect of doing so. Only 5 percent said they were managing to save toward a deposit.
Those who do save, like Ms. Ashton, who has set aside the equivalent of about $50,000, are unlikely to be able to afford a home in the same area they rent in. ''I would have to look further out of London or for a smaller property,'' she said. So for now, like many, she is staying put.
One reason homeownership remains attractive in Britain is because property values dropped less drastically than in the United States, in part because of a shortage in housing. Prices in some large cities, including London, have even increased recently. People still perceive a home to be a better and safer investment than a pension fund, said Andrew Hull, research fellow at the Institute for Public Policy Research. ''Homeownership is also culturally entrenched,'' he said. ''Owning a home is the main way of showing you made it.''
The big shift toward homeownership came in the 1980s with Mrs. Thatcher's right-to-buy policy, which allowed many in rented government housing to buy their homes. About two million homes were sold, earning the government tens of billions of pounds.
At the same time, the rental market became increasingly unattractive. Unlike Germany and other Continental European countries, Britain's private rental market is highly fragmented, with many landlords, and laws that generally favor the property owner. Most leases are for six months only, with landlords rarely agreeing to commit to longer terms; this makes renting highly insecure.
But the aftermath of the banking crisis and the recession made buying more difficult. Over the last 10 years the number of people who owned homes here dropped to 67 percent from 70 percent. Meanwhile, the number of people in private rented housing rose to 16 percent from 10 percent over the same period, according to the Office for National Statistics.
''A growing number of young would-be buyers are preparing for lifelong renting -- by necessity rather than choice,'' said Jonathan Moore, director of easyroommate.co.uk, a property Web site.
Katherine Fyfe is one of them. Ms. Fyfe, a 42-year-old clinical systems teacher for the National Health Service in Devon, is eager to buy her own place, but her $:15,000 in savings is not enough. ''I've been clawing money together since my divorce in 2008, but it's not been easy as the cost of rent has bitten into most of my pay,'' she said. She pays $:380 a month for a room in a house in Exeter that she shares with two others.
Rising demand has pushed up rents by an average of 4.4 percent over the last year, according to LSL Property Services. In London rents increased 7.8 percent.
Being unable to buy a home is just the latest blow for a British populace already battered by severe austerity and contraction. To reduce debt, the government is cutting pensions, welfare spending and public services, and has said it will eliminate 310,000 public-sector jobs by 2015.
Amid this economic hardship, some analysts warn that a wider shift toward renting could have adverse effects on society as a whole.
''It could open up a widening of the wealth gap that already exists between homeowners and non homeowners, and people in 'generation rent' risk insufficient finances at retirement,'' Alison Blackwell, a research director at the National Center for Social Research and author of the Halifax report, said.
It could also have implications for the cohesion of neighborhoods, she said. Renters tend to be less involved in local communities because they are forced to move more often. And the economy as a whole may suffer because renters tend to curb spending to save for a deposit.
For some, including Ms. Ashton, the prospect of buying in Britain seems so daunting that she even considered buying a property elsewhere. ''I don't rule out buying abroad,'' she said. ''There are many more appealing markets than Britain. Florida, for example.''

Museums
- American Folk Art Museum: 'Quilts: Masterworks from the American Folk Art Museum' (through Oct. 16) This exhibition celebrating quilts from the museum's collection reveals the optical vitality of these eminently pictorial textiles. Ranging across a variety of patterns and techniques and nearly two centuries, the examples here effortlessly combine personal and national histories with rigorous down-home formalism, all the while making brilliant use of available, often humble, fabrics. The various geometric ins and outs, color contrasts and boldly scaled compositions confirm that quilts, like Navajo blankets, are among the earliest abstract art in post-conquest North America. 45 West 53rd Street , (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)20110623
American Folk Art Museum: 'Super Stars: Quilts From the American Folk Art Museum' (through Sept. 25) In conjunction with the exhibition of quilts at the main museum, its branch is featuring 20 quilts in which stars figure in some way, whether as pieced-together geometric forms or as little tufts of thread that suggest a distant galaxy. 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue, at 66th Street , (212) 595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Smith)20110623 
American Folk Art Museum: 'Eugene Von Bruenchenhein: Freelance Artist -- Poet and Sculptor -- Inovator -- Arrow maker and Plant man -- Bone artifacts constructor -- Photographer and Architect -- Philosopher' (through Oct. 9) Whether photographing his wife as a sweetly chaste pinup girl; fashioning plant forms from scrounged clay or little thrones from salvaged turkey bones; or making delicate ballpoint-pen drawings or hallucinatory paintings rife with intimations of exotic undersea or sci-fi worlds, this self-taught, self-proclaimed multitasker (as made clear in the show's subtitle) never wavered in his sense of his own greatness. Mounted 27 years after his death, his first American museum survey doesn't quite do him justice and especially shortchanges the paintings, but it presents the fruits of his ceaseless labors with a clarity that makes them feel of a piece, and like a gift. 45 West 53rd Street , (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Smith)20110623
Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum: 'Set in Style: The Jewelry of Van Cleef & Arpels' (through July 4) Van Cleef & Arpels, the century-old French jewelry firm, is the primary sponsor of this show and has supplied much of its mega-carat menu: some 350 lavish pieces worn by royals, screen sirens and social swans. Although extravagance doesn't seem out of place in this former Carnegie mansion, the show often looks as if it were put together by the company's creative directors and merchandisers. The visitors lining up around the block don't seem to care, as long as they can linger over pieces like a maharani's carved-emerald necklace and large sapphire-and-diamond pendant earrings worn by Elizabeth Taylor. 2 East 91st Street , (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20110623
Guggenheim Museum: 'The Hugo Boss Prize 2010: Hans-Peter Feldmann' (through Nov. 2) Mr. Feldmann, the septuagenarian German artist who was the surprise pick for the Boss Prize honors, has decided to exhibit his prize money -- in the form of 100,000 $1 bills, pinned to the wall of one of the Guggenheim's Tower galleries. What sounds on paper like a conceptual stunt or a riff on Warholian materialism becomes overpoweringly physical in person, thanks to the smell of the used bills and the traces of their circulation. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street , (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Rosenberg)20110623
- International Center of Photography: 'Elliott Erwitt: Personal Best' (through Aug. 28) Like Henri Cartier-Bresson, Mr. Erwitt seeks ''the decisive moment,'' an instant in real time when people, animals or objects appear before the camera in surprising, funny and illuminating ways. The Henny Youngman of photographic one-liners, he delivers visual humor with such economy and grace that it is easy to overlook just how excellent an artist he is. This show presents more than 100 of his favorite images from the past seven decades. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street , (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Ken Johnson)20110623
Jewish Museum: 'Collecting Matisse and Modern Masters: The Cone Sisters of Baltimore' (through Sept. 25) At the Jewish Museum, this exhibition samples the extraordinary trove of European art amassed by two American spinsters in the first half of the 20th century, work now owned by the Baltimore Museum of Art. Although some major collection highlights are absent, the pieces here -- presented in the order of acquisition -- generate a compelling portrait of the Cones as collectors. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street , (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20110623
Jewish Museum: 'Maira Kalman: Various Illuminations (of a Crazy World)' (through July 31) Like her fellow New Yorker magazine contributors Ed Koren and Roz Chast, Ms. Kalman offers gently humorous cartoon commentary on the trials and tribulations of modern metropolitan life. Ranging in style from faux-naive eccentricity to suave realism, the more than two decades worth of drawings and paintings on paper in this career survey make for an entertaining if not deeply provocative experience. With a flea market-like installation of nondescript objects from her personal collection, however, she tries too hard to be amazingly original. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street , (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Johnson)20110623
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Andean Tunic, 400 B.C.E.-1800 C.E.' (through Sept. 18) This small show celebrates the festive yet functional garments woven south of the equator. To the modern eye, they're wearable paintings; lovers of Keith Haring and Elizabeth Murray will find much to admire. So will anyone interested in the complex relationships among art, clothing, ritual and power. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20110623
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Anthony Caro on the Roof' (through Oct. 30) No one in the 1960s produced groovier abstract sculpture than the British artist Anthony Caro, five of whose heavy metal assemblages grace the Met's Rooftop Garden. But only one of these works has that startling, newborn feeling. Sporting a new coat of shiny, taxicab-yellow paint, ''Midday'' (1960) has the look of a jaunty, industrial dinosaur. The others, dating from 1968 to 2010, show a development toward an increasingly conservative, ponderous monumentality. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20110623
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Guitar Heroes: Legendary Craftsmen from Italy to New York' (through July 4) The heroes of this exceptionally interesting show are three craftsmen known for producing some of the most sought-after jazz guitars of the 20th century. Part I surveys a history of Italian luthiers from 17th-century Naples to Italian immigrants producing string instruments in New York in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Part II presents lovingly made archtop guitars and mandolins dating from 1923 to 2008 by inheritors of that tradition: John D'Angelico, James D'Aquisto and John Monteleone. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20110623
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty' (through Aug. 7) A triumph for this British fashion designer -- who died at 40, by his own hand, last year -- and for the curator Andrew Bolton of the Met's Costume Institute, this career retrospective is ethereal and gross, graceful and manipulative, and poised on a line where fashion turns into something else. The operatic spectacle is pushed along by soundtrack of wind, Handel and orgiastic moans, and has a holographic image of Kate Moss spinning like a moth in a flame at the center. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)20110623
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Night Vision: Photography After Dark' (through Sept. 18) It wasn't until the gelatin dry-plate process was introduced in the late 1880s that exposure time was lowered enough for photographs to be taken regularly after dark. Alfred Stieglitz was among the first to photograph New York at night. His work is shown alongside Berenice Abbott's spectral ''Nightview, New York'' from 1932, taken from the window of a skyscraper; Brassai's nocturnal views of Paris; and Weegee's high-contrast picture of a crime scene. Diane Arbus, Bill Brandt, Robert Frank, Garry Winogrand and Kohei Yoshiyuki are among the other artists included in this modest, lovely show of 40 black-and-white photographs drawn from the museum's collection, which stops a couple of decades short of the present. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)20110623
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Poetry in Clay: Korean Buncheong Ceramics from Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art' (through Aug. 14) This beautiful exhibition presents bottles, vases, bowls and dishes made by 15th- and 16th-century Korean artisans. In shades of gray, from creamy and opalescent off-whites to deep, warm blacks, the anonymous craftsmen covered vessels with loosely rendered images of flora and fauna and fine-grained patterns of dots and tiny blossoms. These infectiously lively works look as if they'd been made not centuries but only decades ago. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20110623
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Rooms with a View: The Open Window in the 19th Century' (through July 4) This compact, quietly splendid exhibition explores the window as luminous light source, as semi-abstract compositional element and as the focal point for a certain poignant, implicitly Romantic yearning. The images -- mostly by German, French and Scandinavian artists before 1830 -- depict both domestic settings and artists' studios and are passively subversive in their avoidance of large-scale, historic themes and formal portraiture. They show us a world on the verge of electricity, photography and industrialization, a moment of irretrievable, partly fictive calm that incites some yearning of its own. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20110623
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Richard Serra Drawing: A Retrospective' (through Aug. 28) Few artists have pushed drawing to such sculptural and even architectural extremes as Mr. Serra, so it makes sense that his adamantine pursuit of the medium, surveyed in an installation that he largely designed himself, is not quite like anything seen at the Met before. There are moments of off-putting starkness on Mr. Serra's side and some of the usual architectural infelicities on the Met's, but as a demonstration of this august institution's willingness to engage with genuinely radical, physically unsettling art of recent vintage, the show is cause for hope. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20110623
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Tibetan Arms and Armor From the Permanent Collection' (through fall) The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Met's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Later Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, created this follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including five acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense; examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20110623
MoMA PS 1: 'Laurel Nakadate: Only the Lonely' (through Aug. 8) Laurel Nakadate might be on the cusp of a great new career. She is known for disconcerting, sad and sexually provocative videos that she enlisted older, worse-for-wear men to participate in, but in the past three years she has made two feature-length films. Included in this enthralling survey of her 10-year career, they focus with lingering, heart-aching care on adolescent girls, lost souls looking for love and only getting into trouble. MoMA P.S. 1, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)20110623
Morgan Library & Museum: 'The Age of Elegance: The Joan Taub Ades Collection' (through Aug. 28) This small but engrossing exhibition presents about three dozen works dating from the mid 17th to the late 19th centuries by European artists, each in his own way a draftsman of consummate skill. Some names, like Boucher and Millais, are familiar; most will be known only to art historical specialists. Ranging from postcard to laptop size, including portraiture, still-life and mythological scenes, they exemplify the fine but now endangered art of drawing at its best. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street , (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Johnson)20110623
Morgan Library & Museum: 'Illuminating Fashion: Dress in the Art of Medieval France and the Netherlands' (through Sept. 4) Medieval illuminations -- so rich in narrative, embellishment and religious expression -- can display sartorial trends that can help experts date manuscripts and discern the subtleties of a figure's status or character. There are many examples here, as well as mannequins in full-scale model attire -- say, a splendid hunting ensemble of gold-embroidered blue velvet and lilac wool felt for the men, and for the women, a princessy gown of yellow silk trimmed in black crushed velvet, accessorized by a turret. This lively show will teach you to scrutinize centuries-old manuscripts as you would a style magazine. 225 Madison, at 36th Street , (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)20110623
- El Museo del Barrio: 'El Museo's Bienal: The (S) Files 2011' (through Jan. 8) Because of a long renovation of El Museo del Barrio's Fifth Avenue building, four years have passed since the museum's last biannual survey of new Latino, Caribbean and Latin American art. As if to make up for lost time, the new edition is the biggest so far, including work by 75 artists spread over seven shows in four boroughs, with the main event at El Museo itself. The ''S'' this year is for ''Street,'' which covers everything from graffiti to junk sculpture to painted cityscapes, and some of the work has problems with focus. Yet taking the street as a subject opens the possibility to at least think about other subjects, like money for artists, and the lack of it. Other segments of the show now on display are at Socrates Sculpture Park in Long Island City, Queens, and Lehman College Art Gallery in the Bronx; a Brooklyn show is scheduled to start in November. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem , (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Cotter)20110623
Museum of Arts and Design: 'Otherworldly: Optical Delusions and Small Realities' (through Sept. 18) In the age of the flat screen, a show about the diorama sounds charmingly naive. Yet ''Otherworldly'' circles back to the two-dimensional image in ways that feel very sophisticated. A good number of the show's more than 40 artists build model homes, cities and landscapes mainly to photograph them. At times the exhibition feels like a Hollywood film-studio tour in miniature. 2 Columbus Circle , (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20110623
Museum of Modern Art: 'Access to Tools: Publications From the Whole Earth Catalog, 1968-1974' (through July 26) Brainchild of the visionary techno-hippie artist Steward Brand, the Whole Earth Catalog did for counterculture youth in the '60s what the Sears catalog did for children of the Great Depression and what Google does for people of the Internet age: provide a way for ordinary citizens to connect with and make use of the global economy. This modest but stirring time capsule of an exhibition presents various editions of the catalog, along with a mind-expanding array of books, magazines and ephemera that influenced or exemplified its holistic mission. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)20110623
Museum of Modern Art: 'Francis Als: A Story of Deception' (through Aug. 1) This possibly premature, hit-and-miss survey of the quixotic, politically aware, yet obstinately poetic art of this Belgian artist, who has lived in Mexico since 1986, whipsaws a visitor between engagement and boredom, serious consideration and dismissal. In the show, at MoMA and its P.S. 1 site in Queens (closes Sept. 12), the best works are videos, but the split exhibition is garnished, you might say, with sometimes appealing paintings and sculptures and also dulled with extensive backup materials: studies, notes, texts and newspaper clippings pertaining to most of the works on view. Too often the result confirms this museum's blind faith in the wan, cerebral machinations of late-late-late Conceptualism. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20110623
- Museum of Modern Art: 'German Expressionism: The Graphic Impulse' (through July 11) MoMA's largest survey of Germany's first Modern art movement is infused with an urgent, crackling energy, by turns joyful, satiric, grim and tragic. Presenting some 250 works -- most of them little-seen prints -- it celebrates one of the 20th century's most brutally effective, socially responsive unions of medium and message and shakes up the (understandable) conventional wisdom that the museum is almost terminally Francophile. While lavish, the show reveals but a fraction of the museum's 3,200 Expressionist works on paper, all of which are newly available for digital viewing at moma.org/explore/multimedia/interactives/161. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20110623
Museum of Modern Art: 'I Am Still Alive: Politics and Everyday Life in Contemporary Drawing' (through Sept. 19) This show of contemporary drawings (most acquired since 2005) is anchored by a group of telegrams sent by the Japanese artist On Kawara to friends and associates; each one bears the message ''I am still alive.'' The artists seem to be in a permanent state of wariness and suspicion, which is sometimes the result of political instability and at other times more innate. But their efforts to process matters of life and death in short bursts of creative activity feel very of the moment. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)20110623
Museum of Modern Art: 'Boris Mikhailov: Case History' (through Sept. 5) This exhibition's visceral photographs of homeless people in Ukraine are not for the squeamish. The 19 photos, large-format examples from a series of more than 400 images produced in the late 1990s, portray people in grungy rooms or in wintery outdoor sites naked or pulling aside their clothes to expose parts of their bodies. Thus Mr. Mikhailov protests a society that allows people to fall into such substandard states and conditions. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)20110623
Neue Galerie: 'Vienna 1900: Style and Identity' (through Aug. 8) One of history's more fraught fin-de-siecle efflorescences of art and thought is recounted in a shifting kaleidoscope of paintings, drawings, architectural models, posters and several species of decorative arts. Among paintings by Gustav Klimt, Oskar Kokoschka and Egon Schiele, there is also a re-creation of Freud's psychoanalytic couch, an eye-popping tribute to the Vienna Secession and a crowded face-off between the designer-theoreticians Josef Hoffmann and Adolf Loos. Over all, it resembles a tasting menu with enough rich and disparate flavors that the gaps and omissions can be overlooked. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street , (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.com. (Smith)20110623
New Museum: 'Gustav Metzger: Historic Photographs' (through July 3) Politically heavy-handed hybrids of photography and sculpture in this British artist's first solo museum exhibition in the United States are a lugubrious downer. Old, broken bricks are piled in front of a blown-up picture of a woman and a young boy with upraised arms watched by rifle-toting German soldiers. A pair of photomurals juxtaposing goose-stepping Nazis and regimented concentration camp internees is titled ''Terror and Oppression.'' Mr. Metzger's lessons about photographic and moral vision are less than subtle. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side , (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Johnson)20110623
New Museum: 'Apichatpong Weerasethakul: Primitive' (through July 3) Focusing on teenage boys in rural Thailand, the celebrated Thai filmmaker Apichatpong Weerasethakul has produced an expansive, multiscreen video installation that is, by turns, beautiful, tedious, opaque and affectingly poetic. With the patience-testing style we've come to expect of avant-garde moviemaking, ''Primitive'' revolves around the playful construction of a time-traveling spaceship by village youths. The obliquely invoked background is a half-century of war and civil strife that has taken the lives of countless young men in Southeast Asia. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side , (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Johnson)20110623
Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian: 'A Song for the Horse Nation' (through July 7) Including saddles, riding blankets, clothing, beaded bags and much more, this exhibition brings to light a fascinating and ultimately sad chapter in American history: the hundred-year period during which horses were central to the lives of the Plains Indians. A highly efficient form of transportation, horses enabled Navajo, Crow, Comanche, Pawnee and others to expand their territories and flourish more than they otherwise would have. It also enabled them to make war more effectively, though ultimately not effectively enough. George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan , (212) 514-3700, americanindian.si.edu. (Johnson)20110623
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Cory Arcangel: Pro Tools' (through Sept. 11) This solo turn from Mr. Arcangel, the digital wunderkind, artist-musician and inveterate hacker, seems a trifle scrubbed clean, sanitized and austere. Containing work almost entirely from 2011, it tells us little of his funkier early digital efforts or artistic development. A few pieces reflect his longstanding interest in television and video games; in others he tries too hard to establish his formalist bona fides with wry riffs on abstract painting and sculpture. Mr. Arcangel seems guided by a somewhat callow faith in the avant-garde, striving to perpetuate its tradition, dating from Duchamp, of laying claim to new areas of nonart for art's sake. Sometimes he succeeds, but not always. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)20110623
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Breaking Ground: The Whitney's Founding Collection' (through Sept. 18) In anticipation of its move to a new home in 2015, the Whitney is cooking up a series of six back-to-back experimental permanent collection shows at its present location. The first of them is a sampler of the earliest work in the holdings, and as a summary of the institution's initial view of American Modernism, what a curious thing it is. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)20110623
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Singular Visions' (continuing) With its ''one artwork per room'' rule, ''Singular Visions'' is a refreshing departure from the typical collection sampler. The show's work includes pieces by A A Bronson, Sarah Charlesworth, Robert Grosvenor, Eva Hesse, Edward Kienholz and Georgia O'Keeffe; some rooms are more intriguing than others, but on the whole the show feels like a necessary experiment.

Bill Rice: 'Paintings and Works on Paper' (through July 1) Bill Rice (1932-2006) was best known to many people as a stage and film actor who work with Gary Indiana, Jim Jarmusch, Richard Kern and Jim Neu. But he came to New York City as a painter in the 1950s, and a painter he remained. This show of 11 glowing Lower East Side cityscapes gives a good idea of the kind of artist he was: a constructivist, a sensualist, and a nocturnalist. Steven Harvey Fine Art Project, 24 East 73rd Street, near Madison Avenue , (212) 281-2281, shfap.com. (Cotter)20110623
Galleries: 57th Street
Willem de Kooning: 'The Figure: Movement and Gesture' (through July 29) This artist's own words -- brilliant as usual -- set the stage for this riveting show: ''The figure is nothing unless you twist it around like a strange miracle.'' The 32 mutually illuminating paintings, drawings and sculptures ranging from the late 1960s through the '70s are full of such twists and miracles, emerging from and then slipping back into extravagantly lush, unstable masses of brushwork. The capacity of these marks to read alternately as real -- even anatomically correct -- and malformed and abstract is one reason for the continuing relevance of de Kooning's art. Pace Gallery, 32 East 57th Street , (212) 421-3292, thepacegallery.com. (Smith)20110623
Leo Villareal: 'Volume' (through Aug. 19) You might just want to sit and gaze in blissful stupefaction at ''Cylinder,'' the single-light sculpture featured here. It consists of 160 12-foot-long lengths of shiny stainless steel, each with 140 light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, along one edge, hanging in five concentric circles to create a cylindrical volume nine feet in diameter. The thousands of computer-controlled lights flicker in the darkness, generating all kinds of patterns and a fascinating beauty.

- John Chamberlain: 'New Sculpture' (through July 8) In some of the largest works of his career, this venerable American sculptor uses his signature materials -- crushed car bodies and fenders -- with tremendous compositional variety, verve and his usual unerring color sense. Variously comical, stately, architectural and gestural, these pieces erupt from the gallery's expansive concrete floors like unusually well-shaped mesas, creating an exhilarating indoor landscape. Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street , (212) 741-1111, gagosian.com. (Smith)20110623
- Jasper Johns: 'New Sculpture and Works on Paper' (through July 1) The centerpiece of this pleasantly miscellaneous show is a large cast-aluminum relief and six smaller two-sided ones in cast bronze and silver, which put grids of the numbers zero through nine through elaborate variations in texture, legibility and suggestion. Among the artist's first cast-metal objects in some years, they exemplify his trenchant recycling of motifs and clarify his tendency to conflate aspects of printing, painting and sculpture (and collage). Their mesmerizing combination of lapidary detail and casual process reveals the intensity of Mr. Johns's mind with unusual clarity. Matthew Marks Gallery, 522 West 22nd Street , (212) 243-0200, matthewmarks.com. (Smith)20110623
Sol LeWitt: 'Arcs and Lines' (through July 1) This extraordinary show features three gridded wall drawings by the eminent Conceptual-Minimalist Sol LeWitt (1928-2007), most prominently the airy and ebullient ''Wall Drawing #122'' from 1972, a spare work in blue crayon that wraps almost perfectly around the gallery's large central space. Featuring combinations of two straight, wavy, curved or broken lines in each compartment of the grid, its vaulting composition evokes Matisse's blue nudes, brisk Alpine views and even the blinking sweep of a radar screen, exemplifying both the economy and rich suggestiveness of LeWitt's art. Paula Cooper Gallery, 534 West 21st Street , (212) 255-1105, paulacoopergallery.com. (Smith)20110623
- Picasso and Marie-Therese: 'L'Amour Fou' (through July 15) While falling short of the exhibition of late Picasso paintings and prints that filled this space two years ago, the latest Gagosian exegesis into Picasso land is a wonderfully motley, almost scattershot affair, brilliantly installed. It presents works, in all mediums and several styles, that Picasso made during the late 1920s and '30s, when he was under the spell of the voluptuous, Roman-nosed, level-eyed, full-limbed Marie-Therese Walter, arguably the love of his life. Anchored by this single if perpetually mutating subject, the art on hand confirms that when Picasso told Walter she had saved his life, he meant that she had also saved his art.

- Jo Ractliffe: 'Terras do Fim do Mundo (The Lands of the End of the World)' (through July 15) At first glance, this South African photographer's black-and-white shots of sun-baked Angolan landscapes look random and bland: rocks, dirt, scrubby trees; some handwritten signs but no people. Only when you read some of the titles -- ''Mass Grave at Cassinga,'' ''Minefield Near Mupa''-- do you learn where people are, or once were, and the pictures snap into expressive focus. The Walther Collection Project Space, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 718 , (212) 352-0683, walthercollection.com. (Cotter)20110623
Tyson Reeder (through July 15) Mr. Reeder, an art-world multitasker in Milwaukee who paints and organizes special events, is back in Chelsea for his first New York solo show in five years. He brings some of that peripatetic energy to his new paintings of heads and landscapes, which dart from Picabia to Fautrier to the Post-Impressionists. The heads in particular are richly varied. A natty bow-tied figure with masklike features, shaped with firm strokes of the palette knife, builds on Dubuffet; a loosely contoured cranium, with its pastel palette and palm trees, suggests Polke in Key West, Fla. Daniel Reich Gallery, 537A West 23rd Street , (212) 924-4949, danielreichgallery.com. (Rosenberg)20110623
- Vladimir Tatlin: 'Monument to the Third International' (through July 30) Concocted by a founder of Russian Constructivism between 1915 and 1920, following close encounters with the Eiffel Tower and Picasso's guitar constructions in Paris, this tilting, spiraling, viaduct-like structure is one of early Modernism's most ambitious and best-known works of unrealized architecture, embodied by one of its biggest architectural models. Shown in the United States for the first time -- the oldest (1967) remake of the original model, which disappeared around 1932 -- it is dense with portents of 20th-century sculpture to come, from LeWitt's grids to Smithson's jetty. Tony Shafrazi, 544 West 26th Street , (212) 274-9300, tonyshafrazigallery.com. (Smith)20110623
Richard Tuttle: 'What's the Wind' (through July 22) Working quite a bit larger than usual, this Post-Minimalist master of seeming trifles presents a series of deftly cobbled-together thingamajigs that charm and challenge. Each presents a kind of stage-set-like open volume of sculptural events patched together from colorful, lightweight materials and objects. The result is a somewhat slovenly, art-supplies Constructivism that is characteristically light, ephemeral and full of joy. Pace Gallery, 510 West 25th Street , (212) 255-4044, thepacegallery.com. (Smith)20110623
Galleries: Other
- Tom Fairs: 'Drawings' (through July 15) You might mistake the small, town-and-country drawings in this lovely show for the works of an early 20th-century follower of Pierre Bonnard. The truth is that the British painter Tom Fairs (1925-2007) did not begin producing art full time until after his retirement from teaching at age 60. Working with soft pencils, he drew the outdoor world with an almost shocking avidity. This show, the first solo ever devoted to Fairs's work, is inspiring. KS Art, 73 Leonard Street, TriBeCa , (212) 219-9918, kerryschuss.com. (Johnson)20110623
John Storrs: 'Machine-Age Modernist' (through July 9) The Chicago-born artist John Storrs (1885-1956) compacted utopian, machine-age dreaming into Cubist-Art Deco-style sculptures resembling pieces of architectural ornament and models of skyscrapers. There is nothing quite like his dense, carefully wrought stone and metal sculptures in early American -- or European, for that matter -- Modernism, and this finely tuned show gives a good account of his progress from the late '10s to the early '30s. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East , (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart. (Johnson)20110623

'Mark di Suvero at Governors Island: Presented by Storm King Art Center' (through Sept. 25) With 11 works spanning more than three decades, this show organized by Storm King Art Center, the 500-acre sculpture park in the Hudson Valley, is Mark di Suvero's biggest New York City survey since 1975. The all-outdoor exhibition works alongside the island's packed calendar of activities and festivals, offering bike riders and picnickers culture by osmosis. Plan to spend some time along the island's southern end, where four of Mr. di Suvero's best sculptures engage the waterfront and one another in invigorating ways. Governors Island , govisland.com. (Rosenberg)20110623
Eva Rothschild: 'Empire' (through Aug. 28) At the southeast entrance to Central Park stands a colorful, tubular structure resembling a swing-set frame designed by spiders on LSD. Touching ground at 10 points on the cobbled plaza, its red, green and black striped posts rise at different angles into an airy web over 18 feet at its highest point. A playful riff on the ancient form of the triumphal arch, ''Empire'' will be a required photo-op for tourists and other visitors. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, Central Park, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, Public Art Fund , (212) 223-7800, publicartfund.org. (Cotter)20110623
Out of Town
- Anacostia Community Museum: 'Word, Shout, Song: Lorenzo Dow Turner, Connecting Communities Through Language' (through July 24) Housed in a converted movie theater in a predominantly African-American neighborhood that is a cab ride's distance from the National Mall, the Anacostia Community Museum is one of Washington's cultural secrets. Its exhibition on the scholar Lorenzo Dow Turner (1890-1972), who documented surviving traces of African languages and customs in modern African-American culture, is both an archival homage and a well-paced drama of ideas. Smithsonian Institution, 1901 Fort Place SE, Washington, D.C. , (202) 633-4820, anacostia.si.edu. (Cotter)20110623
- The Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery, Skidmore College: 'Environment and Object: Recent African Art' (through July 31) Contemporary African art can mean many things: art made in Africa, or by someone from Africa living elsewhere, or by someone not from Africa but of African descent. All definitions apply in this stimulating show, as do variant readings of the rest of exhibition title. This is very much a show of objects, with several environments or installations. At the same time, the environment itself, meaning the natural world, under dire threat, is the subject of much of the art. 815 North Broadway, Saratoga Springs, N.Y. , (518) 580-8080, tang.skidmore.edu. (Cotter)20110623
Last Chance
Cao Fei: 'Play Time' (closes on Friday) In the last couple of years the Beijing-based artist Cao Fei has been building eerie simulacrums of modern Chinese society within virtual-reality games. But in her latest show she works in real space, with all its complexities and restrictions, and engages older forms of entertainment and fantasy. Her photographs and videos are now populated by shadow puppets, skateboarders and children's television characters instead of avatars. In the context of China's crackdown on cultural expression, Ms. Cao's juvenilia seems to express a longing for some basic adult freedoms. Lombard Freid Projects, 518 West 19th Street, Chelsea , (212) 967-8040, lombard-freid.com. (Rosenberg)20110623
'Decadence and Decay: Max Beckmann, Otto Dix, George Grosz' (closes on Friday) This seductively titled show of 65 works by these three Weimar-era luminaries complements the Museum of Modern Art's current show of German Expressionist prints. Dix is the standout, with Neue Sachlichkeit portrait drawings that make figures look both vulnerable and monstrous. Also here are prints from his 1924 cycle ''The War,'' which can be seen at MoMA in its terrifying entirety. Galerie St. Etienne, 24 West 57th Street , (212) 245-6734, gseart.com. (Rosenberg)20110623
- 'Drawing and Its Double: Selections From the Istituto Nazionale per la Grafica' (closes on Friday) The drawings in this show take an unusual form: they are the designs etched by artists, using burins and acid, on metal plates from which prints (the ''double'' of the title) are made. The selection begins on a grand note with a set of 10 oddly shaped copper plates made for a 16th-century print version of Michelangelo's ''Last Judgment'' and concludes with expressionistic illustrations by the contemporary artist Paolo Canevari on the Ten Commandments. Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo , (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org. (Cotter)20110623
- 'Ethiopian Magic Scrolls: Talismanic Art of Ethiopia' (closes on Thursday) In 2005 the London dealer Sam Fogg blew us away with an exhibition of Ethiopian Christian liturgical art. Now, in association with Milos Simovic of Elizabeth Street Fine Arts, he follows up with a show of 18th- and 19th-century painted and written scrolls that emerged from Ethiopian popular religion. And they are equally, if very differently, wondrous. Figures of warrior-saints and archangels rub shoulders with demons; talismanic designs mingle with New Testament quotations. They're all tucked away like a hidden trove in the back of a shop specializing mostly in Coney Island antiques. Elizabeth Street Fine Arts, 209 Elizabeth Street, Nolita , (212) 274-9400, elizabethstreetfinearts.com. (Cotter)20110623
Jean-Pierre Gauthier: 'Recent Work' (closes on Friday) Kinetic sound-sculptures -- made primarily of tangles of wire, metal tubing and tiny mechanisms, amplifiers and speakers affixed to the wall -- create a strange zoolike environment of delicate chirping, blinking, alien life forms while also generating an encompassing audio environment of alternately natural, synthetic and aggressively electronic sounds. Sorting out the relationship between what you hear and what you see is a challenging perceptual conundrum. Jack Shainman Gallery, 513 West 20th Street, Chelsea , (212) 645-1701, jackshainman.com. (Smith)20110623
- Mark Grotjahn: 'Nine Faces' (closes on Saturday) Full of thatches of thrashing, live-wire lines made with a surprisingly methodical palette-knife technique, Mr. Grotjahn's newest paintings are harsh, elegant things that enthrall the eye and splinter the mind. Ellipses and circles tumble about among the lines, intimating fractured features and calling attention to the nominal masklike faces of early Picasso and Matisse, Jawlensky and Brancusi. Altogether, they emphasize painting as a psychic and bodily process, fueled in part by the devouring and digesting of previous art to formulate a new synthesis. Anton Kern Gallery, 532 West 20th Street, Chelsea , (212) 367-9663, antonkerngallery.com. (Smith)20110623
- 'Donald Judd' (closes on Saturday) Nine large silvery, seemingly identical floor boxes, all open at the top, turn out to have markedly different and expansive interiors, articulated by various vertical divisions and planes of colors. These wells of space and color exemplify Judd's frequent use of surprise to create suspense and clarity; they also reflect his origins in painting and his lifelong admiration for the simple forms and strong colors of painters like Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko and Josef Albers. David Zwirner, 525 and 533 West 19th Street, Chelsea , (212) 727-2070, davidzwirner.com. (Smith)20110623
Sean Landers: 'Around the World Alone' (closes on Friday) Mr. Landers's latest paintings avoid both his confessional texts and art-historical style-mongering, opting for sea captains in full clown makeup (red noses, hair and beards) at the wheels of old sailing ships. A flinty, restrained realism and startling immediacy distinguishes both the figures and the expanses of rolling seas and dramatic skies. The lonely-clown-as-man-against-the-elements theme may amount to a double and thus self-canceling triteness. In any event, Mr. Landers's recurring theme -- the bane of maleness -- gains in maturity here, along with a marvelous sense of light and space. Friedrich Petzel Gallery, 537 West 22nd Street, Chelsea , (212) 680-9467, petzel.com. (Smith)20110623
- Toyin Odutola: '(MAPS)' (closes on Saturday) Using ballpoint pens and other drawing utensils, this young artist, born in Nigeria and living in San Francisco, makes a polished New York solo debut with small portraits. Each one, derived from photographs of friends but incorporating Ms. Odutola's features, looks to have been weaved from strips of dark, ductile, sinewy material, then finished with hair-fine details. Jack Shainman Gallery, 513 West 20th Street, Chelsea , (212) 645-1701, jackshainman.com. (Cotter)20110623
- Princeton University Art Museum: 'Kurt Schwitters: Color and Collage' (closes on Sunday) The German artist Kurt Schwitters, who died in 1948, is one of Modernism's true delights, though seen far less often than he deserves to be. This smallish show, his first substantial survey since the 1985 Museum of Modern Art retrospective, is made up primarily of wonderful collages spanning his career, from garrulous early examples made from the odds and ends of urban life -- tram tickets, stamps, receipts -- to the light-and-shadow late ones, done when he was in wartime exile in England and living, as he loved to be, surrounded by nature. From very first to very last, he's golden, and worth the trip to see. Princeton, N.J. , (609) 258-3788, artmuseum.princeton.edu. (Cotter)20110623
Tobias Putrih: 'When Language Goes on a Holiday' (closes on Saturday) The latest from this Slovenian artist is a flexible system of thin, mostly hexagonal, perforated sheets of black aluminum that can be bolted together any number of ways. Here they yield abstract sculpture, partitions (some used for displaying chair designs by the early modern Swedish designer Erik Gunnar Asplund) and furniture. A mordant yet genuine utopianism results. Meulensteen, 511 West 22nd Street, Chelsea , (212) 633-6999, meulensteen.com. (Smith)20110623
- Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture: 'Soulful Stitching: Patchwork Quilts by Africans (Siddis) of India' (closes on Thursday) The 15 brilliant contemporary quilts in this show were made by women of the Siddi ethnic group, descendants of early African migrants to South Asia, including slaves brought by Portuguese colonists in the 16th century. Strips and patches of recycled cloth -- solid-colored, patterned or shot through with glittery threads -- are the basic components. Together the results look like a spring garden in bloom. New York Public Library, 515 Lenox Avenue, at 135th Street, Hamilton Heights , nypl.org. (Cotter)20110623
'John Storrs' (closes on Thursday) This exhibition, by emphasizing relatively realistic works, complements the illuminating survey of the American sculptor John Storrs (1885-1956) -- best known for his Deco-ish evocations of abstracted skyscrapers -- at New York University's Grey Art Gallery. The works here include figures, portrait busts and terra cotta reliefs, as well as an array of wood-cuts, drawings and a few paintings; they present a softer, more personal side of Storrs's sensibility. Meredith Ward Fine Art, 44 East 74th Street , (212) 744-7306, meredithwardfineart.com. (Smith)20110623
- Gillian Wearing: 'People' (closes on Friday) This British artist's first New York show in eight years more than makes up for lost time. In three very different video works, she relentlessly tests the limits of what might be called narrated portraiture, coaxing forth unstated feelings and scarring experiences or, in one instance, reviewing several decades of snapshot styles to recast a demurely resentful life story. She also eerily re-enacts three famous portraits of famous photographers using her signature custom-made rubber masks and ventures into three dimensions with two small statues that pay tribute to everyday heroes. Life daunts, but the living persist. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, Chelsea , (212) 414-4144, tanyabonakdargallery.com. (Smith)20110623

HEADLINE: Casino Bill's True Believer Enters the Final Stretch

BYLINE: By KRISTEN McQUEARY. 
Kristen McQueary covers state politics for The Chicago News Cooperative and Chicago Public Media. kmcqueary@chicagonews coop.org

 BODY:
It took 20 years for State Representative Lou Lang, one of Illinois' most outspoken politicians, to convince his colleagues to support more gambling in Illinois.
Now he faces a tougher challenge: convincing Gov. Pat Quinn, who campaigned against any large-scale expansion of gambling.
''I have a very good relationship with the governor,'' Mr. Lang said. ''Long ago when he was state treasurer, I handled a lot of his bills at a time when he was thought of as a person outside the mainstream of politics. Lots of people didn't want to be helpful to him. I was.''
Mr. Lang, 61, hopes his relationship with Mr. Quinn will tip the balance in his favor, even though the governor described the bill authorizing a Chicago-owned casino and four other statewide bills as ''excessive.'' The legislation would allow slot machines at horse racing tracks and at Chicago airports, and create a racing facility in Springfield.
But the left-leaning Mr. Lang, a Democrat from Skokie who also supports medical marijuana use, does not view the bill as overly expansive. 
''We wouldn't say 'no' to Starbucks because we have too many Starbucks and too many people are drinking coffee,'' Mr. Lang said. ''We would never say to an auto dealer, 'Don't expand your business. Go to Indiana.' This is a business like any other.''
For years, Mr. Lang has listened to concerns of anticasino forces who believe gambling preys on vulnerable populations, triggers addictions that bankrupt families and fails to fulfill promises of revitalized communities. Those arguments have not changed his mind.
''I believe in this concept,'' he said during an interview in his Skokie office, tucked in a strip mall a few miles from his house. ''It doesn't matter to me if it's gaming or widgets. If the only place to buy a widget is in Indiana, people would figure out a way to sell widgets in Illinois. It seems to me as a person interested in job creation and economic development, we would do all we can to keep people in Illinois to spend their money.''
He was appointed to the Legislature as a young lawyer representing Niles Township government. Soon after, he began working on a gambling bill under former Gov. Jim Edgar. Mr. Lang said he views casino development as economic development. Mr. Lang, who is not a regular gambler but enjoys betting occasionally, dismissed moral arguments against casinos. Gambling is here, and it is legal, he said.
But Anita Bedell, the executive director of Illinois Church Action on Alcohol and Addiction Problems, scoffed at Mr. Lang's contention that his casino bill is about economic development.
''The public would laugh out loud if they heard that,'' she said. ''How else could this be but about gambling? Five new casinos and two airports with slot machines? It's all about gambling.''
Lawmakers, she said, are focused on the revenue casinos generate without considering the pockets from which it flows.
Mr. Lang described his political philosophy as progressive. Unlike some voters who become more conservative as they age, he went in the opposite direction. Weekly dinners with a conservative uncle shaped his early beliefs.
''Until his middle 50s, my uncle was single, so he came to our house every Sunday,'' Mr. Lang said. ''He was a very, very conservative person and my father, not so much. I would listen to them argue about the things they were hearing on television.''
Mr. Quinn has not indicated whether he will sign, amend or veto the gambling bill, which passed the Legislature on May 31. Mr. Lang expects to meet with him again in the next couple of weeks to press him to sign it.
While the governor is known to change his mind, Mr. Lang is known for his predictability. Capitol lobbyists visit Mr. Lang's Springfield office only sporadically, he said. They know where he stands.
A 24-year House veteran representing a solid Democratic district, Mr. Lang is direct in his approach to politics. When two colleagues surprised him by voting against his bill legalizing medical marijuana, Mr. Lang ''got them back where they're supposed to be. I reminded them of their commitment, and they remember their commitment now.''
But opponents to his gambling bill are mobilizing, and the state's top gambling regulator, Aaron Jaffe, chairman of the Illinois Gaming Board, described the bill recently as ''garbage.'' The gaming board, he said, would need to double its resources to regulate the new facilities.
Mr. Lang said any concerns from the governor's concerns could be addressed in a follow-up bill. Mr. Lang said he would not accept changes, even dropping one casino from the legislation, and he would file a motion to override the governor's action.
His seniority -- only six House members outrank him, as the No. 7 license plate on his red Lincoln sedan reinforces -- and his safe district allow him to be one of Springfield's most fearless politicians. His controversial marijuana bill failed in the House, but Mr. Lang intends to bring it back.
''There are a lot of people who are sick and hurting and nauseous, and some who are dying and only want a better quality of life and their doctor can't provide it,'' Mr. Lang said.
As one of the House's strongest gambling proponents, Mr. Lang has received hundreds of campaign contributions from the industry. His political fund remains one of the House's most robust with nearly $750,000 in donations and investments as of March 31. Harrah's Operating Company has donated at least $35,000 to Mr. Lang since 1999. Neil Bluhm, a developer who is opening a Des Plaines casino this summer, has donated at least $16,000. Mr. Lang said he uses the money to support Democratic House members during tough elections.
Mr. Lang is one of the chamber's most vocal members. As deputy majority leader and floor leader, he is responsible for stating the party's position. His voice regularly hollers through the Capitol intercom system that broadcasts live debate.
''Sometimes I'm acting and sometimes I'm not acting, but it's fair to say if you see me get really passionate on the floor, it's coming from my gut,'' he said. ''If my face gets red and the vein pops out on my forehead, which people make fun of, that's when I'm serious.''
He is also approachable, according to his colleagues, often dining with Republicans at his favorite Springfield steakhouse.
''He'll listen,'' said Representative Roger Eddy, Republican of Hutsonville, one of Mr. Lang's regular dinner companions. ''At the end of the conversation he'll say, 'I can't do that, but let me tell you what I can do.' He's likeable.''

HEADLINE: Used Gas Sippers, Keeping That New-Car Value

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
Cars are not supposed to be a good investment. But Spencer Hunter, an Oregon patent lawyer, recently turned a small profit selling his 13-month-old Toyota Prius.
''I drove a brand-new car for free for a year,'' said Mr. Hunter, who now rides a motorcycle.
The rule of thumb says that a car loses at least 10 percent of its value the moment it leaves the dealership. But soaring used-car values are turning that formula on its head for many fuel-efficient vehicles, which are suddenly in high demand as Americans fret about escalating gas prices and do not want to pay for a new car.
Used cars over all are retaining a higher percentage of their original value than ever before, according to auto analysts who track prices. Compact cars that are one to five years old are worth, on average, about 30 percent more on the wholesale market now than just six months ago, the National Auto Auction Association reports. 
''You're not going to find a better return than that on anything,'' said Jonathan Banks, executive auto analyst for the used-car guide published by the National Automobile Dealers Association.
The value, for example, of a 2008 Honda Civic LX (highway mileage: 34 miles per gallon) has increased by $2,098 since January, and the value of a 2010 Chevrolet Aveo LS (highway mileage: 35 m.p.g.) by $3,448. A three-year-old Ford Focus (highway mileage: 35 m.p.g.) is worth about two-thirds of its original sticker price, according to Kelley Blue Book, another widely used vehicle valuation source; in 2009, a three-year-old Focus retained just a third of its original value, a difference of more than $5,000. A year-old Prius actually can command about as much as the list price of a new Prius because the new ones are in such short supply that many dealers are selling them for several thousand dollars more than the sticker price.
An unusual confluence of factors creating low supplies and high demand is behind the unprecedented prices.
Many consumers seeking a higher-mileage vehicle consider a used car as more affordable than a new one. But the plunge in new-vehicle sales in 2008 and 2009 has meant that significantly fewer late-model cars are available for the used-car market. And because the tight credit markets during the recession led to a sharp cutback in leasing, the usually steady stream of leased vehicles has also slowed to a trickle.
On top of all that, there are shortages of Japanese models at many new-car dealerships because of the March earthquake and tsunami, prompting some shoppers to check used-car lots instead.
''There's just so many things hitting the market all at once,'' said Alec Gutierrez, manager of used-car pricing at Kelley Blue Book. ''For those really hot, in-demand cars, we're seeing one- and two-year-old vehicles that are selling for very close to'' sticker price.
Some of the biggest gainers are hybrid cars, which were offered at big discounts last year but regained popularity as gas prices climbed. Toyota's Prius is in particular demand because the Japanese factory that builds it closed for a month after the earthquake and tsunami.
A 2008 Prius, with a Blue Book value of $13,600 a year ago, can command $18,250 today. A three-year-old Prius is worth 77 percent of its sticker price today, versus 48 percent a year ago, according to Kelley Blue Book. Mr. Hunter, the Oregon lawyer, sold his Prius less than 72 hours after he posted an ad on Craigslist. The car turned out to be a more fortunate investment than the three houses he owned when the real estate bubble burst. ''I got soaked pretty bad,'' he said.
Over the 13 months he leased his 2010 Prius, Mr. Hunter spent $3,860 on the car, not including gas. Last month, after buying out the lease and selling the car, he ended up with a check for $3,900 -- a profit of $40.
Dealers are trying to capitalize, too.
The Patrick Auto Group, which operates dealerships selling Hyundai, Mini and other brands in suburban Chicago, has been buying up used-car inventories around the country and calling past customers to see if they are interested in trading up for something newer.
The dealerships have been leaving tags in the cars that customers bring in for service, asking if the owner wants to trade in the vehicle and offering an approximate value. ''It will probably never ever be worth more than it is now,'' said John Leanardi, the general manager of the group.
As a result, used-car sales at the Patrick dealerships have risen 20 percent this year, and new-vehicle sales are up because people traded in their current cars while values were high.
''It's helped us really gain some momentum,'' Mr. Leanardi said.
Analysts say used cars are likely to spend the rest of the year shedding some of the value they have gained in recent months, but even if the cost of gas drops sharply, used-car prices are expected to remain high. The blue book value of the average vehicle from the 2008 to 2010 model years has risen more than $1,000 this year. (Not every vehicle's worth has gone up. Full-size sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks have each declined more than $900.)
The higher prices are welcome news for automakers. Some used vehicles are worth so much that consumers might decide they would rather pay a little more and get a new car. In addition, people who are able to sell their car for more than they expected are more likely to stick with the same brand as they shop for a replacement.
''Perception of a brand is really driven a lot by trade-in values,'' Mr. Banks, the guide analyst at the dealer's association, said. ''People were angry at Ford and at General Motors'' when resale values for those companies' products were much less than import brands, he said.
''It really promotes a healthier attitude by the consumer and gives the dealers a lot more to work with.''
John Shen, who lives in Los Angeles, definitely is feeling good about Toyota after selling his year-old Prius. The sale price was higher than the going price for an equivalent car from the 2011 model year.
Mr. Shen, 30, found a buyer who paid $25,500 for his 2010 Prius II. He had to spend $1,000 on repairs and pay a fee to the dealer because the car had been leased. Even so, his net take on the deal was $121 more than he paid for a 2011 Prius II -- and the new car came with hands-free Bluetooth phone connectivity, a feature his old car did not have.
''I think it'll be the only time I ever make money on owning a car,'' Mr. Shen said.

HEADLINE: Proposed Power Plant Near Bay City Stirs Emotions

BYLINE: By KATE GALBRAITH. 
kgalbraith@texastribune.org

 BODY:
BAY CITY -- Behind a locked gate, on a flat, 1,200-acre parcel of land beside the Colorado River, cows graze and maize crops grow.
Four years from now, developers hope to begin operating a giant power plant here that will burn coal and petroleum coke. The $2.5 billion White Stallion Energy Center, they say, will help meet Texas' growing need for electricity and also provide jobs in a county with an 11.5 percent unemployment rate.
But the plans have stirred considerable controversy both locally and around the Colorado River basin. Texas is more welcoming of new coal plants than many other states, but nonetheless, plenty of people worry about air pollution and the huge amounts of water needed to operate a power plant. 
''This is the beginning of the end of Matagorda County if that goes through,'' said Robert Malina, who with his wife, Eva, retired eight years ago to a home a few miles from the proposed site. A yellow sign near their property entrance reads, ''Stop White Stallion Coal Plant.''
This week the City of San Antonio announced it would close a 1970s-era coal plant it operates, a rare occurrence for Texas. But a handful of proposed coal plants have air-quality permits, a crucial go-ahead from Texas environmental regulators.
In the face of strong opposition, White Stallion's plans have recently encountered problems. Last week the board of the Lower Colorado River Authority, a state organization that controls substantial amounts of water along the river, postponed a decision on whether to grant a 40-year water-purchase contract to the plant. L.C.R.A. officials say there is enough water for the plant, which would contribute $55 million up front to finance construction of a downstream reservoir off the main Colorado River.
''We don't want to take any water out of the Highland Lakes,'' said Randy Bird, the chief operating officer of White Stallion and one of the plant's backers, referring to two upriver reservoirs that are crucial water sources for cities like Austin and for rice farmers downstream.
But many L.C.R.A. customers, as well as people living around the Highland Lakes, are wary of a large new water user along the river, especially in light of the severity of the current drought, which has caused lake levels to fall well below normal.
White Stallion officials say they still hope to start construction by early fall, and the L.C.R.A. board will reconsider the water contract on Aug. 10.
But the plant hit another snag last month, when a Travis County judge ordered further review of the air-quality permit that Texas regulators had awarded it in December. Mr. Bird said he was considering how to respond to the judge's order, but retained construction authority. Meanwhile, the controversy continues.
''There could hardly be a worse position for a coal-fired power plant for Houston air quality,'' said Matthew Tejada, executive director of Air Alliance Houston.
The summer air blowing toward Houston from the Gulf of Mexico is currently fairly clean, Mr. Tejada said, and the plant would worsen it, just as federal environmental regulators are tightening air-quality standards.
Mr. Bird said Houston's ozone status would not be affected, and White Stallions officials say the plant would be built with the newest commercially viable emissions technology possible. But they do not plan to sequester the carbon or use ''coal gasification'' techniques that would make the plant cleaner, though at significant cost.
Residents near the plant worry about its impact on human health and animal habitats. Matagorda County has huge numbers of birds -- its Christmas bird count often includes more species than other locations across the nation. The Malinas and other plant opponents fear that emissions of mercury and other chemicals will harm the birds, and keep away the tourists.
This is the fifth of a five-part series on Lower Colorado River Authority water that ran this week in The Texas Tribune and on KUT 90.5 FM, Austin's NPR affiliate.

HEADLINE: Suddenly, Lalique Is Back in Vogue

BYLINE: By EVE M. KAHN

 BODY:
The French luxury-glass maker Lalique has gone through three different owners in the past two decades, and its collection of design drawings and products, some dating back more than a century, ended up somewhat neglected in the shuffle. They have rarely been kept on regular view at the factory or the corporate offices.
Lalique's current owner, Art & Fragrance, a Swiss company headed by the perfume magnate Silvio Denz, has helped create an all-Lalique museum that opens on July 2. French government agencies worked with Art & Fragrance to set up the Musee Lalique, with a dozen galleries built atop a ruined 18th-century glassworks in Wingen-sur-Moder, France, a village in Alsace near Lalique's manufacturing plant. 
About 650 artifacts are arranged by form and function, including vases, enameled floral jewelry and church windows molded with translucent saints.
Mr. Denz has lent about 230 of his own perfume bottles, including an 1890s teardrop-shaped vessel that the company's founder, Rene Lalique, molded at the kitchen stove of his Paris apartment. His experiments caused a fire that devastated his home, but he was able to salvage the bottle.
The museum has recreated a 1930s glass fountain with leaping fish, and the roof beams have been reinforced to support a spiky chandelier from the 1950s that weighs about two tons.
Some of the material on display came from a 2005 Paris auction of the estate of Marie-Claude Lalique, Rene's granddaughter, who died in 2003. (She had sold her share of the company to a French corporation about a decade earlier.)
Other recent sales of Lalique material have been held at Christie's in London, which has organized all-Lalique auctions twice a year for two decades, and at Heritage Auctions in New York, which started annual art glass sales in 2009.
Prices reach six figures for the more imposing pieces. Last week at Sotheby's in New York, a five-foot-long 1920s ceiling fixture molded with pineapples and pomegranates brought $254,500. (The estimate was $150,000 to $250,000.) A milky rectangle, the piece hangs from cylinders shaped like bamboo stalks; Rene Lalique created the design for the dining room of a prince's palace in Tokyo.
The ranks of Lalique buyers have been growing lately, particularly in China and Korea, said Nicholas Dawes, Heritage's vice president for special collections. ''There are very few French collectors, oddly enough,'' he added.
Many American collectors have donated their Lalique to museums in recent years and have financed acquisitions, and a handful of institutions keep their holdings on long-term view. At the Chrysler Museum of Art in Norfolk, Va., a few dozen vessels are on the gallery shelves, including vases with fish, feather and mermaid patterns. In October a new wing at the Chazen Museum of Art at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, will display about 30 Lalique objects. The Chazen goblets, vases and perfume bottles are molded with pine needles, grapes, butterflies, scarabs, parakeets and grasshoppers.
CEREMONIAL SNUFFBOXES
In the 18th century European diplomats gave one another porcelain snuffboxes with jeweled gold rims as rewards for loyalty in political alliances. The givers knew that the boxes were more likely to be put on display than filled with snuff, and that the jewels might well be removed and sold in hard economic times.
''This was a ceremonial gesture more than something for use,'' said Nette Megens, a European ceramics specialist at Bonhams in London.
On July 5 the auction house will offer about 75 snuffboxes made in the 18th and 19th centuries, some with plain metal frames added later to replace originals encrusted with garnets and rubies.
The 20th-century owners of the Bonhams lots were Alfred Joseph, a German wine distributor who immigrated to London before World War II, and his son Helmut, a British electronics magnate who died in 2002. They favored detailed scenery and portraits on their snuffbox lids and walls, which feature harbors, ruins, sheep pastures, assorted royals, dwarfs and pugs.
A third of the Joseph boxes were produced at the Meissen factory in Germany, and the rest were made by manufacturers across Europe. Estimates range from about $650 for a 1750s French box in the form of a white bedroom dresser to about $240,000 for a 1750s Meissen box painted with Augustus III's Saxon and Polish palaces.
A few boxes that the Josephs believed were made in the 18th century have turned out to be Victorian; by the early 1800s, a market for reproductions had already sprung up. Snuffbox demand has held fairly steady ever since.
''It's a fashion that's never really passed,'' Ms. Megens said.
SOVIET FILM POSTERS
A collection of Soviet film posters that spent years in storage is on display at the Tony Shafrazi Gallery on West 26th Street in Chelsea. Susan Pack, a graphics historian in California, amassed about 280 of the posters in the 1990s, focusing on sheets printed in the 1920s and '30s. She put the collection on the market two years ago, and the new owner has lent about 100 for Shafrazi's main summer exhibition.
In the show, ''Revolutionary Film Posters: Aesthetic Experiments of Russian Constructivism, 1920-1933'' (through July 30), the framed images are hung between video screens playing footage from black-and-white Soviet movies. The posters promote titles ranging from Eisenstein's ''Battleship Potemkin'' to relatively obscure dramas, documentaries and comedies, like ''Strength and Beauty'' and ''Song of the Tundra.''
The gallery has grouped the posters largely by motif. Spotlights, checkerboards, eyeglasses and movie cameras are layered and collaged with slashes of typography.
Nothing on the walls is for sale, but Shafrazi does have about 30 vintage posters from the collection in stock, priced from $8,000 to around $200,000. They are duplicates of pieces that the owner already has. The gallery declined to identify him but did give tantalizing clues.
''He has residences all over the world,'' said Elizabeth Wallace, the assistant to Mr. Shafrazi.
Ms. Pack, the author of ''Film Posters of the Russian Avant-Garde'' (Taschen), previously collected Art Deco works by the French graphic artist Cassandre. She is now delving into Japanese avant-garde ads from the 1960s to the '80s.

HEADLINE: Harvard-Educated Technocrat Chosen as Somalia Premier

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN

 BODY:
NAIROBI, Kenya -- The president of Somalia's transitional government on Thursday appointed a Harvard-educated prime minister who said he would try to revive Somalia's war-wrecked economy and establish better security in a country that has been virtually lawless for 20 years. 
The president, Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed, seemed to be continuing with his preference for Western-educated technocrats by naming Abdiweli Mohamed Ali as prime minister. Mr. Ali's resume reads like the itinerary on a tour of prominent American universities: it says he holds a master's degree in public administration from Harvard, a master's degree in economics from Vanderbilt and a Ph.D. in economics from George Mason University. In recent years, he has been teaching economics at Niagara University in upstate New York.
He is Somali-American, and his profile is similar to that of Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, the previous prime minister, who also is an American citizen. He was abruptly pushed out of Somalia's transitional government this month as part of a United Nations-backed deal to resolve an internal political dispute. Mr. Ali was a deputy prime minister and had been the acting prime minister since Mr. Mohamed resigned.
At a news conference on Thursday in Mogadishu, Somalia's capital, Sheik Sharif praised Mr. Ali, whose academic focus has been international trade, public finance and public choice.
''He is a good man,'' the president said. ''I hope he will improve the situation of Somalia.''
Few would argue that Somalia needs it. The Transitional Federal Government has been paralyzed by infighting and accusations of corruption over the past several months, and it controls only a small patch of the capital. Much of the rest of the country, which is nearly the size of Texas, is ruled by clan militias and Islamist insurgents. Somalia's seas are plagued by pirates, whose ransoms keep going up, to about $10 million per hijacked ship.
African Union peacekeepers have recently uprooted insurgents from several neighborhoods in Mogadishu, but without a functioning government most analysts predict the insurgents will be back.
''Somalia is in a difficult situation; there is an economic crisis and insecurity,'' Reuters quoted Mr. Ali as saying. ''I hope I will succeed in overcoming all these problems. I urge the entire government and Somalis to help me achieve this.''
The transitional government's Parliament, an often fickle and unpredictable group, must approve Mr. Ali's appointment. Sheik Sharif said he was urging the lawmakers to act fast, because the mandate for the transitional government expires in August 2012. Somalia has cycled through more than a dozen transitional governments since the central government collapsed in 1991.

HEADLINE: Failing Like G.M., Not Like Lehman

BYLINE: By ROB COX and RICHARD BEALES

 BODY:
Investors fixated on the possibility that a Greek default would deliver a shock akin to the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008 might want to consider another analogy. A restructuring of Greece's obligations could more closely resemble the orderly wind-down of General Motors. The carmaker's bankruptcy filing didn't cause the market or economic Armageddon that followed Lehman's demise.
So if that's the case, what would it take to bring about a G.M. moment for Greece? Preparation, an orderly mechanism and financial support. 
The main difference between the two huge bankruptcies of Lehman and G.M. was the level of preparedness of all parties involved. Though G.M. filed for creditor protection in June 2009, its excessive debt and the rich promises it extended to retired employees had made its solvency questionable since at least 2005, when the Detroit carmaker's credit rating was lowered to junk. That episode gave investors time to reduce their exposure.
So when G.M. did finally fail, the fallout was limited. By then, G.M. had around $170 billion of debt. And participants in the credit-default swap market had just $35 billion of gross exposure to deal with, according to the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation. G.M.'s tidy bankruptcy process was also made possible by the American and Canadian governments agreeing to provide the equivalent of debtor-in-possession financing, so that the company didn't have a cash squeeze through its relatively brief period of restructuring.
Lehman was a whole different story. It wasn't just the company's hapless management, led by Richard S. Fuld Jr., that expected to emerge from the second weekend of September 2008 with a deal to sell or rescue the firm. That was also the expectation of the then Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., and many in the financial markets. When it filed for bankruptcy protection early on the following Monday morning, its $600 billion balance sheet, interlinked as it was with financial institutions and hedge funds across the globe, caused mayhem.
If European policy makers want a Greek bankruptcy to end up like a G.M. nonevent rather than a Lehman-style catastrophe, the main lesson is they need to prepare. They've certainly had lots of time. The snag is that they've squandered it.
Greece's debt of around 350 billion euros ($504 billion) is widely held across the European banking system, including the country's own banks. But most of them have not penciled in a default. So even a methodical haircut would need to be preceded by a mechanism that shores up banks' capital and reinforces their financing lines; otherwise there might indeed be a post-Lehman style banking panic.
And, of course, a messy default that catches everybody by surprise over a weekend would be even worse. Here again, G.M. offers a clue about how to proceed. Make it orderly and ensure there continues to be the equivalent of debtor-in-possession financing to tide over Greece through what would still be a long restructuring process.
Admittedly, restructuring G.M. was an easier task because only two governments (one, the United States, with an empowered ''car czar'' in Steven Rattner) needed to agree on continued financial support. Greece would need the unanimous support of 17 euro zone countries as well as the International Monetary Fund. But that just underlines the need for Greece not to fall out with its financial benefactors.
Even a controlled default would risk contagion to the other weak euro zone nations like Ireland and Portugal. But G.M.'s move toward bankruptcy made Chrysler's debt restructuring inevitable and nearly took down Ford Motor and an entire supply chain of component manufacturers -- and that didn't cause panic.
Indeed, it's common in industry that once one competitor cleans up its balance sheet, others do too. If Greece got a breathing space through a controlled restructuring, other stretched governments would be tempted to follow suit. Again, provided the banking systems had been previously shored up and there was an orderly process, this needn't be drastically disruptive to global capital markets or the economy.
Greece is a sovereign nation, of course, not a corporation. Its stakeholders go beyond the constituencies of a public company. But the market and economic impacts of two of the biggest American corporate failures in history may nonetheless be instructive.
The power is firmly with policy makers to ensure that the outcome in Greece has a G.M.-like, contained impact rather than the global shock of Lehman.

HEADLINE: Protecting Medicaid

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It is a hopeful sign that 41 senators have spoken out in favor of sustaining the Medicaid program (''Signs of Life Spotted in the Senate,'' editorial, June 19). 
The middle class should not be lured into thinking that Medicaid is a program for the poor. Medicaid provides an important safety net for middle-class families when parents and grandparents need long-term services and supports.
At a cost of as much as $100,000 a year, it doesn't take long to wipe out a lifetime's worth of savings. Without Medicaid, adult children would have to take on these costs -- often just at the time they are digging deeper to pay for college for their children.
And severely cutting Medicaid will most certainly hurt our nation's ability to provide health coverage to America's poor -- including low-wage, direct-care workers who provide long-term services and supports but ironically often do not have health coverage themselves.
Protecting Medicaid is essential to the economic security of the vast majority of Americans.

HEADLINE: A Nosedive Eases a Bit In Volatile U.S. Trading

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Julia Werdigier contributed reporting from London.

 BODY:
It was another day of gyrations on Wall Street.
European debt troubles and signs of a sluggish economy in the United States have unsettled investors for months, and Thursday was no different. Stocks fell sharply early, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average down nearly 2 percent before it rallied on new hopes for a Greek austerity plan.
The seesaw session and small drop in stocks at the close pointed to generally gloomy investors hopping from headline to headline as they sought clarity. The volatility also signals further fluctuations in sentiment, with stocks headed for an unclear direction on Friday. After posting losses for six of the last seven weeks, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was showing a weekly gain of nearly 1 percent at Thursday's close. It has fallen just nearly 6 percent since the end of April. 
''The Greece situation has been a threatening dark cloud hanging over the markets,'' said Lawrence R. Creatura, portfolio manager at Federated Investors.
''We are in uncertain times, everybody knows it and that creates volatility, but also opportunity.''
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 59.67 points, or 0.49 percent, to 12,050 on Thursday. The S.& P. 500 declined 3.64 points, or 0.28 percent, to 1,283.50, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 17.56 points, or 0.66 percent, to 2,686.75.
Greek debt problems have battered markets for weeks with concerns about contagion to other countries in the euro zone and its effect on banks.
At the same time, the latest economic data has served as reminders of the challenges to the United States economy, including a slowdown in hiring in May and a housing sector that is still trying to recover.
The seesaw in stocks started shortly after the open, when the Dow, less than two hours into trading, fell 234.73 points, or 1.9 percent, to its intraday low of 11,874.94.
Analysts offered a range of reasons for the slump, starting with the Federal Reserve saying on Wednesday that the economy was not expanding as quickly as predicted and that it would complete the purchase of $600 billion in Treasury securities next week, then pause.
Late Wednesday, Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, said that the link between the Greek debt problem and banks was ''the most serious threat'' to financial stability in the European Union, according to Bloomberg News.
On Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for unemployment were up 9,000, to 429,000 last week, according to seasonally adjusted figures. The four-week moving average was unchanged at 426,000.
Stanley A. Nabi, the chief strategist at Silvercrest Asset Management Group, said the debt troubles in Europe were only one of the factors affecting the market on Thursday. ''I think the decline is substantially connected to the Fed having lowered economic expectations for the next several quarters,'' he said. ''And then the employment data that came out this morning was not particularly robust.''
Adding to the uncertainty, some analysts said, was the International Energy Agency announcement that the United States would provide half of the 60 million barrels of petroleum reserves being released to world markets, with other nations releasing the rest. The action is meant to replace some of the oil production lost because of the conflict in Libya.
''It shocked the market,'' said Doug Cote, the chief market strategist for ING Investment Management. ''This looks like thinly veiled stimulus,'' he said. ''The big question weighing on the market is why now?''
But other analysts said the oil announcement suggested consumers could get relief at the gas pump, and that mostly sovereign debt and economic issues, including the faltering United States federal budget talks, were to blame for pushing stocks lower.
News at the end of the day that Greece had reached some approval for austerity measures helped the indexes recover.
''It was kind of a rocky ride over the last hour,'' said Stephen J. Carl, head equity trader at the Williams Capital Group.
''It was almost an 11th-hour save,'' said Mr. Creatura.
European markets were down. The FTSE 100 in London fell 1.71 percent on Thursday, while the CAC 40 in Paris declined 2.16 percent and the DAX index in Germany dropped 1.77 percent.
''Investors are worried about the same things that have been worrying them for some months,'' said Adrian Darley, head of European equities at Ignis Asset Management in London. ''It's the weak U.S. data, a consensus of overheating in China and concerns about Europe. The Greek situation is still unsolved and markets are going to remain very nervous.''
The Treasury's 10-year note rose 18/32, to 101 26/32. The yield fell to 2.91 percent, from 2.98 percent late Wednesday.
Energy and bank stocks in the were down nearly 2 percent. Airline stocks, sensitive to oil prices, rose. Exxon Mobil was down 1.73 percent, to $78.44. Chevron fell 1.69 percent, to $99.36. Marathon Oil declined 2.22 percent, to $51.62.

HEADLINE: Ford's High-Tech Control System Hurts Ranking for Quality

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- As sales of Ford Motor vehicles took off in the past year, executives pointed to high-tech options as a major selling point. But now the Detroit automaker is learning that advanced technology like touch screens and high-mileage engines can also cause headaches -- and a consumer reaction. 
The Ford brand fell to 23rd place in the 2011 initial quality study released Thursday by J.D. Power and Associates, an influential survey of buyers that ranked Ford fifth a year ago. The ratio of problems reported per 100 Ford vehicles increased to 116 -- worse than the industry average of 107 and all but nine other brands -- from 93 in 2010, when it was the top-performing mass-market brand.
Ford's premium line, Lincoln, slid from eighth place to 17th.
The survey is based on feedback from nearly 74,000 people who bought a new vehicle from November through February. Most of the decline at Ford is related to the introduction of a system called MyFord Touch, which replaces many of the traditional knobs and buttons in a vehicle with touch screens, steering wheel-mounted controls and spoken commands.
Ford said the technology has proved popular, with 92 percent of people buying a Ford Explorer sport utility vehicle electing to include it. But some survey respondents found the system to be ''too complicated'' and reported their difficulties as problems with the vehicles, said David Sargent, J.D. Power's vice president for global vehicle research.
''Ford made the decision to be the leader in this area, so they're also in a more vulnerable position,'' Mr. Sargent told reporters after speaking to the Automotive Press Association. ''Anything that the industry is discovering about this technology, they're going to discover on Ford vehicles.''
The poor ranking is a rare blemish for Ford, whose sales and profits have been surging amid a product renaissance that has greatly improved its reputation.
Ford officials said they were not surprised by the results, having warned analysts this year that the company was addressing some quality issues with some new models, and insisted that much of what dragged down its rating had already been addressed.
Some of the issues with MyFord Touch were actual defects, such as occasions when the system would reboot itself, that have been addressed through software upgrades. To help drivers understand the system better, Ford has allocated money to dealers so that they can have employees spend more time explaining it to buyers. The company said this week that it would make lettering on screens larger and bolder so it would be more legible while driving.
Ford also said it had received some negative feedback from customers because some of its new engine-and-transmission combinations aimed at increasing fuel economy can feel different from what drivers are used to in a vehicle.
''We expected mixed quality results this year, after closely listening to our customers,'' Mark Fields, Ford's president of the Americas, said in a statement. ''This same feedback now shows that we are largely back on track after addressing near-term quality issues with MyFord Touch and a few of our power trains.''

HEADLINE: DealBook Online

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS and JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
CHALLENGING RULES A growing number of lawmakers argue that some proposed rules could force Wall Street's derivatives business overseas. 
They also say that regulators are ignoring a crucial exemption to the rules spelled out in the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory law, which excused airlines, oil companies and other nonfinancial firms known as end-users from new restrictions.
''We are concerned that recent rule proposals may undermine these exemptions, substantially increasing the cost of hedging for end-users, and needlessly tying up capital that would otherwise be used to create jobs and grow the economy,'' Senator Debbie Stabenow, above, Democrat of Michigan and chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, and Representative Frank D. Lucas, her Republican counterpart in the House, said in a letter this week to regulators. BEN PROTESS
RIVAL OFFER Gaz Metro of Canada offered $35.25 a share for Central Vermont Public Service on Thursday, trumping a bid by Fortis last month.
The deal would expand Gaz Metro's presence in Vermont. It already owns Green Mountain Power, another Vermont utility, through its subsidiary, Northern New England Energy. Gaz Metro's said it would combine the two businesses, creating the largest electricity distributor in Vermont, with 250,000 customers.
OFFICE DRONES Nomura in London has a way to sweeten its client negotiations.
The Japanese bank, which bought the European business of Lehman Brothers in 2008, said it was installing two beehives on the roof of its European headquarters in London. About 80,000 bees are to start producing honey there next month.
Nomura plans to brand the honey with the bank logo and serve it at client breakfast meetings and other events, a spokeswoman said. JULIA WERDIGIER

HEADLINE: Consumer Agency Asks for Definitions of Nonbanks

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said on Thursday that it was seeking public comment on how much regulation to impose on consumer finance companies like debt collectors, check-cashing agencies and consumer credit companies. 
The Dodd-Frank financial regulation law, which became effective last July, specifically allows the new consumer bureau to regulate nonbank mortgage companies, private education lenders and payday lenders. But the law allows the bureau to regulate only ''larger participants'' in a host of other consumer finance markets.
By July 21, 2012, one year after the bureau's start-up date, it must define what other services will fall under its jurisdiction and what it means to be a ''larger participant'' in those markets.
In its notice and request for comment, the bureau has proposed six markets that might be included: debt collection; consumer reporting; consumer credit and related activities; money transmitting, check cashing and related activities; prepaid cards; and debt relief services.
But it also asks for comment on additional service areas that should be included in its jurisdiction, and whether the services need to be national in scope or if regional markets should be considered.
''Consumers deserve the peace of mind that financial companies, both banks and nonbanks, are following the rules,'' said Elizabeth Warren, a special adviser to the Treasury secretary who is overseeing the agency's start-up.
''The C.F.P.B. will be able to examine companies that have never been subject to federal oversight to ensure that no one is gaining an unfair advantage by breaking the law,'' Ms. Warren said. ''This will ultimately create fair competition, better product offerings and more transparent markets for consumers.''
Although the bureau is scheduled to begin operations next month, it is not allowed to begin oversight of previously unregulated entities until it has a director in place. Ms. Warren has been widely talked about as a potential director but President Obama has not yet nominated anyone to fill the post.
A nomination is subject to Senate confirmation, but 44 Republican senators have said they will not consider any nominee until structural changes are made in the bureau, including replacing its single director with a five-member commission.
Banks, credit unions and savings and loan companies have long been subject to regular examinations by federal regulators to ensure that they comply with consumer financial laws. The Dodd-Frank law expanded federal regulation to a host of financial service companies that previously had not been regulated but that some legislators felt had contributed to the instability that worsened the 2008 financial crisis.
The questions on which the bureau is seeking public input also include what criteria to use to measure a market participant, how to set the threshold for ''larger participant,'' whether to use a single test for all markets or specific market-related tests and over what time period a participant's activities should be measured.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims and Home Sales Reflect Slowdown in Economy

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
More Americans than forecast filed applications for first-time jobless benefits last week and new-home sales fell in May, highlighting the Federal Reserve chairman Ben S. Bernanke's concern that the slowdown in the economy might persist. 
Claims for unemployment benefits increased 9,000, to 429,000, in the week ended June 18, Labor Department figures showed on Thursday.
Purchases of new homes dropped 2.1 percent in May to a 319,000 annual rate, figures from the Commerce Department and Census Bureau showed. The median price of new properties sold declined from a year earlier.
''Things are still going to be weak for a while,'' said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla. ''We need to see much better job growth and more confidence in general,'' he said, adding that new-home sales were ''bouncing around the bottom.''
Estimates for first-time jobless claims ranged from 400,000 to 425,000 in the Bloomberg survey of 47 economists. The claims data coincided with the week the government surveyed employers for the monthly jobs report. The Labor Department will issue the June employment data on July 8.
The four-week moving average, a less volatile measure of initial claims, held at 426,250.
The number of people continuing to collect jobless benefits dropped by 1,000 in the week ended June 11, to 3.7 million. The figure does not include the number of workers receiving extended benefits under federal programs.
Those who have used up their traditional benefits and are now collecting emergency and extended payments increased by about 68,000 to 3.95 million in the week ended June 4.
Initial jobless claims tend to fall as job growth accelerates. After improving at the beginning of the year, labor market conditions have deteriorated. Payrolls grew by 54,000 workers last month, the smallest gain in eight months, after increasing by 232,000 in April.
The jobless rate rose to 9.1 percent, the highest since December, from 9 percent.

HEADLINE: 2 G.O.P. Leaders Quit Discussions On Debt Ceiling

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Congressional Republicans on Thursday abandoned budget talks aimed at clearing the way for a federal debt limit increase, leaving the outcome in doubt as they vowed not to give in to a Democratic push for new tax revenues as part of any compromise.
The breakdown was set off by the surprise decision of Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader and one of two Republicans participating in sessions led by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., to quit the negotiations. 
This week's talks were considered to be crucial as the Aug. 2 deadline for an increase in federal borrowing authority nears.
Mr. Cantor had previously expressed optimism that the sessions could produce a deal. But he announced he would not be attending Thursday's scheduled meeting because Democrats continued to press for part of the more than $2 trillion savings target to come from moves like phasing out tax breaks.
''As it stands, the Democrats continue to insist that any deal must include tax increases,'' Mr. Cantor said in a statement. ''There is not support in the House for a tax increase, and I don't believe now is the time to raise taxes in light of our current economic situation. Regardless of the progress that has been made, the tax issue must be resolved before discussions can continue.''
Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the No. 2 Senate Republican and the party's other representative in the talks, said later Thursday that he would also skip the next negotiating session as he and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, turned up the pressure on President Obama to play a larger role in the push for a debt limit deal.
''President Obama needs to decide between his goal of higher taxes, or a bipartisan plan to address our deficit,'' Mr. McConnell and Mr. Kyl said in a joint statement. ''He can't have both. But we need to hear from him.''
The Republican maneuvering threw the talks into disarray in a week when those taking part had hoped an accelerated schedule of meetings could produce a breakthrough that would persuade members of both parties to support a debt ceiling increase in the coming weeks.
As events unfolded Thursday, a White House spokesman, Jay Carney, said the negotiations led by the vice president were now ''in abeyance,'' and he tried to play down the development by suggesting that the White House had expected that at some point the president would take charge of the talks. Exactly when that would happen was not clear, and Mr. Carney did not elaborate.
Senator Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat and Senate majority leader, also said he expected that the talks would resume at a higher level, though he provided no timetable.
''With what Kyl and Cantor's done, I think it's in the hands of the speaker and the president and, sadly, probably me,'' he told reporters.
While it had been assumed that the Congressional leaders and Mr. Obama would ultimately have to strike the final deal, the Biden talks were expected to extend at least through the end of the month. The Republican withdrawal was an unexpected and sudden interruption.
Congressional Democrats expressed disappointment at Mr. Cantor's decision and maintained that revenues must be part of any agreement.
''We cannot balance the budget solely on the backs of the middle class,'' said Representative James E. Clyburn, Democrat of South Carolina, a member of the House leadership taking part in the talks. ''We simply must forge a bipartisan agreement. Failure is not an option, and I hope a bipartisan resolution will be achieved.''
Democrats have repeatedly said that they could not support a budget deal that relies solely on spending cuts and other program changes to produce the more than $2 trillion in savings. Officials said Wednesday's negotiating session was unusually tense as Democrats sought to get Republicans to commit to some revenue increases in exchange for Democratic concessions on spending cuts.
Republicans knowledgeable about the events said Mr. Cantor decided to withdraw from the discussions because of the continuing emphasis by Democrats on potential new revenues. They said that he, Speaker John A. Boehner, Mr. McConnell and Mr. Kyl had previously discussed their discontent with the Democratic push for revenues and that some action was necessary to change the dynamic of the talks and show that Republicans were serious about not accepting what amounted to a tax increase.
''I know the frustration that he feels when Democrat members continue to want to bring tax hikes into this conversation, and insist that we've got to raise taxes on the American people,'' Mr. Boehner told reporters.
According to officials, Mr. Cantor, who disclosed his decision to The Wall Street Journal on Thursday morning, also informed his leadership colleagues about the same time. Mr. Boehner, who had a private visit with the president at the White House on Wednesday night, evidently was unaware of Mr. Cantor's plans at that time.
Democrats suggested that Mr. Cantor's decision also reflected an internal Republican Party political determination to avoid being tagged as an author of an agreement that broached the idea of added revenues.
Republicans indicated that talks could resume if Democrats agreed to take any tax increases off the bargaining table. And negotiating setbacks like the decision by Mr. Cantor and Mr. Kyl to walk away are not unusual in serious Congressional bargaining sessions, where talks often then get back on track. But time is running short, and the House and the Senate have only a few weeks left in the summer when both will be in session before running up against the debt limit in early August.
Though Mr. Cantor and others have suggested that the Biden group has already identified $2 trillion or more in savings, others say that the firm amounts are much lower and that significant work must be done to reach even that level.
At the same time, Senator Kent Conrad, the North Dakota Democrat who is chairman of the Budget Committee, said this week that he did not believe the $2 trillion deal that has so far eluded budget negotiators is sufficient, given the nation's deficit and debt trajectory.
''This is not just about numbers on a page,'' Mr. Conrad said Thursday. ''This is about the future economic prospects of our nation.''

HEADLINE: Republican Challenges Administration on Plans to Override Education Law

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
In a sharp rebuke to the Obama administration, the Republican chairman of the House education committee on Thursday challenged plans by the education secretary to override provisions of the federal No Child Left Behind Law, and he said he would use a House rewrite of it this year to rein in the secretary's influence on America's schools.
Responding to Education Secretary Arne Duncan's promise to grant states waivers to the education law's most onerous provisions if Congress failed to rewrite it, the committee chairman, Representative John Kline of Minnesota, sent Mr. Duncan a letter on Thursday demanding that he explain by July 1 the legal authority that he believed he had to issue the waivers. 
Mr. Kline went further in a conference call with reporters, criticizing the administration's use of the $5 billion Race to the Top grant competition to get states to adopt its reform agenda.
''He's not the nation's superintendent,'' Mr. Kline said of Mr. Duncan, who assumed powers greater than any of his predecessors when, in 2009, Congress voted $100 billion in economic stimulus money for the nation's school systems and allowed the secretary to decide how much of it should be spent.
''Unquestionably, Congress gave the secretary way too much authority in the stimulus bill when it said, 'Here's $5 billion, go do good things for education,' '' Mr. Kline said.
Also, Mr. Kline for the first time outlined publicly a timetable for rewriting the sprawling school accountability law, President George W. Bush's signature education initiative, saying he would move five bills to the House floor by year's end.
A bill stripping several dozen federal educational programs from the No Child law, and another tweaking its provisions on charter schools, moved out of the education committee recently. A third bill, which would allow school districts new flexibility in how they spend federal education dollars, could be approved by Mr. Kline's committee before Congress's summer break, he said.
The fourth and fifth bills -- one outlining new federal teacher effectiveness requirements and another rewriting the law's school accountability provisions -- will dominate the committee's fall agenda, Mr. Kline said.
The Senate, led by Democrats, is working to rewrite the law with a single comprehensive bill, and experts said profound partisan disagreements could make a single rewrite difficult.
Still, Mr. Kline defended his legislative timetable and sought to undercut the argument underpinning Mr. Duncan's waiver plans: that Congressional inaction had forced the administration to give states immediate relief from provisions like its accountability system, which requires that all students be proficient in reading and math by 2014.
Mr. Duncan has predicted that unless the law is rewritten quickly, 80,000 of the nation's 100,000 public schools could be declared failing this fall, demoralizing educators and paralyzing administrators with red tape. This month, Mr. Duncan said that if Congress failed to rewrite these and other provisions by September, he would use his executive powers to waive them -- but only for states that agreed to embrace the administration's education priorities. He used that formula in the Race to the Top grant competition, awarding money to states that opened new space for charter schools, for instance.
In his letter, Mr. Kline asked Mr. Duncan to explain how the Department of Education had the authority to grant waivers ''in exchange for reforms not authorized by Congress.''
Justin Hamilton, a spokesman for Mr. Duncan, reiterated the administration's plan to negotiate with states over waivers. ''The best way to fix this broken law is for Congress to send a bipartisan bill for the president to sign by the start of the school year,'' Mr. Hamilton said. ''As a Plan B, we'll be prepared to use the authority Congress has given us to grant relief in exchange for reforms that boost student achievement.''
The law itself clearly empowers Mr. Duncan to grant states waivers, but several experts have challenged his plan to demand that states undertake policies he favors to get the waivers.
''If you read the waiver language in the law, the secretary absolutely does not have the right to arbitrarily think up good reform ideas and require that states do them in return for waivers,'' said Frederick Hess, a director at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group. ''That's a violation of constitutional design.''
Meanwhile, some states are taking matters into their own hands. On Tuesday, Idaho's superintendent, Tom Luna, said his state would not lift its mandated testing targets this year, as required under the federal law. ''If Congress and the administration will not act, states like Idaho will,'' Mr. Luna wrote.

HEADLINE: Oil Reserves Are Tapped To Offset Libyan Loss

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and CLIFFORD KRAUSS; John M. Broder reported from Washington and Clifford Krauss from Houston. Jackie Calmes contributed reporting from Washington, Christine Hauser from New York and Matthew Saltmarsh from Paris..

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The United States and its allies will release 60 million barrels of emergency oil reserves to replace lost Libyan oil production and assure adequate supplies for the summer, officials announced on Thursday.
The action accelerated the drop in oil prices that began in late April, taking them to levels not seen since Libyan oil exports were virtually halted by political turmoil four months ago.
Italy in particular was dependent on Libyan crude, taking nearly a third of the 1.3 million barrels a day that Libya was exporting before hostilities began. Other European nations like France, Germany and Spain were also large buyers of oil from Libya. 
Of the total amount of oil to be released, about half would come from reserves in the United States, with the rest to be provided by the other 27 industrialized nations who belong to the International Energy Agency. Negotiations for the coordinated response have been going on in secret for weeks, American officials said. Similar unified action was taken in 1991 at the outbreak of the first Persian Gulf War.
''We are taking this action in response to the ongoing loss of crude oil due to supply disruptions in Libya and other countries and their impact on the global economic recovery,'' Steven Chu, the secretary of energy, said in a statement. ''As we move forward, we will continue to monitor the situation and stand ready to take additional steps if necessary.''
The total amount of oil to be released -- 60 million barrels over the next 30 days -- is relatively trivial, representing about two-thirds of a single day's global oil consumption. But it sends a number of signals to markets and countries that are facing particular distress because of supply disruptions in Libya and Yemen and falling production in the North Sea.
The release will ease American demand for Nigerian and Algerian light sweet crude, which can go to the Europeans instead.
The move also allows President Obama to say that he is acting aggressively to deal with high gasoline prices as the summer driving season begins. Republicans have hammered him over high gas prices in recent months, charging that his policies limiting domestic oil drilling were at fault.
An Obama administration official maintained that the release was not about politics. ''This is about addressing supply disruption and its potential impact on global economic growth, and that's the driving factor,'' the official said, speaking anonymously to describe global discussions.
He said the release represented less than 5 percent of the nation's strategic oil reserve.
The action is also a response to market uncertainties after the June 8 meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which failed to reach an agreement on increasing production quotas. After the meeting, Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf states agreed to pump as many as 1.5 million more barrels of crude per day, but those countries cannot produce sufficient supplies of the high-quality crude that Libya normally exports.
News of the release sent oil prices sharply down. West Texas Intermediate, the United States benchmark crude, fell $4.39 a barrel to $91.02. The European benchmark, Brent crude, fell even more.
Even before Thursday's announcement, the average price of a gallon of regular gasoline had fallen to $3.61, from $3.83 a month ago, according to the AAA Daily Fuel Gauge Report. A year ago, the price was $2.74 a gallon.
Some in the oil industry said the move was unnecessary.
''Releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve today, when gasoline prices are falling and there is no supply shortage, makes no sense and weakens our economic and national security,'' said Charles T. Drevna, president of the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association.
The 727-million-barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve was established by the United States after the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo to provide presidents with an emergency response to similar disruptions in commercial supplies that threaten the economy and national security.
In addition to the 1991 release, in September 2005 President George W. Bush ordered a drawdown after Hurricane Katrina disrupted oil supplies from the Gulf Coast region. The 1991 release was about 17 million barrels; the 2005 hurricane release was 21 million barrels.
The coordinated move came after more than two months of quiet diplomacy involving major industrialized countries, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. American officials visited Saudi Arabia in May to consult about the anticipated action and to seek assurances that the Saudis would also increase production to help fill the gap left by the Libyan disruption. The White House said that President Obama spoke with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia at least twice about the issue since the end of April.
David Goldwyn, a consultant who until January was the international energy policy coordinator at the State Department, said the current release was clearly timed to smooth any possible supply disruptions during the summer driving season, when oil and gasoline stocks typically tighten and prices go up.
He said the administration was probably hoping that the release of oil would provide a cushion until the fall, when the situation in Libya might have improved enough to resume exports.
In addition to helping to make up for the lost Libyan production, the move was intended to send a signal to market traders that governments would react when they believed there was excessive speculation in oil markets. Officials made clear they would review the effects of the release after 30 days and continue intervening if warranted.
The release of light sweet crude from the reserves will probably help Europe more than the United States, experts said. American refineries have more capacity to refine heavier crudes than European refineries because the United States imports so much heavy crude from Canada, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia.
Across the Middle East and North Africa, oil supplies have been tightening. Aside from Libya, fighting and labor strikes in Yemen have taken about 250,000 barrels of sweet crude a day off world markets as global demand has been rising. China's demand alone is up nearly a million barrels a day from last year.
Some experts say the oil release will have only a very short-term impact.
''Other than bringing the pump price down temporarily, it accomplishes almost nothing else,'' said Lawrence J. Goldstein, a director of the Energy Policy Research Foundation, which is partly financed by the oil industry.

HEADLINE: Their Temper Tantrum: Republican hard-liners walk out of the debt talks, bringing the nation closer to a credit crisis

 BODY:
Congressional Republicans, who played a major role in piling up the government's unsustainable debt in the first place, have thrown a tantrum and walked out of the debt limit talks. This bit of grandstanding has brought the nation closer to the financial crisis that Republicans have been threatening for weeks. But, at least now, their real goals are in sharp focus. 
The two Republicans in the talks, Representative Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, and Senator Jon Kyl, the minority whip, had no intention of actually negotiating. Negotiations require listening to those on the other side and giving them something they want in exchange for some of your goals.
It has been obvious all along that cutting government services alone is not a solution to either the budget deficit or the mounting national debt. The Democrats, at least, acknowledged that reality at the bargaining table by saying that along with the cuts the Republicans cherish, there would have to be increases in revenue -- an end to unnecessary tax loopholes for corporations or the rich.
Those demands were modest -- too modest -- and Vice President Joseph Biden Jr., who is leading the talks, said they were making progress. But any compromise at all proved too much for the Republicans.
Mr. Cantor said that because he and the House would not support a tax increase, he was walking out of the talks until President Obama ''resolved'' the tax issue himself with House Speaker John Boehner. In other words, Mr. Cantor and Mr. Kyl preferred striking a Tea Party pose to the hard work of reaching a deal.
The negotiators say they have essentially agreed on about $2 trillion in spending cuts over the next 10 years, which could be acceptable if they are phased in gradually and exempt the nation's most vulnerable. But Democrats in the talks say that in exchange for agreeing to those cuts, they asked for some balancing increases in revenues. Their proposals were not to raise tax rates, but rather to end credits like those for oil and gas companies. One Democratic negotiator, Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, said they also want to curb tax deductions for the very rich.
It was inevitable that Mr. Obama, Mr. Boehner and Senate leaders would have to write the final chapter of these talks, and Republicans were at least correct in asking for a more public role from the president, who has shied away from leadership here. Mr. Boehner has, so far, limited his opposition to tax rate increases, and he may prove more willing to accept reality and the need for revenue than Mr. Cantor.
But at least 11 hard-line Senate Republicans have already said they will oppose any deal that does not include a balanced-budget amendment -- a nonstarter for Democrats -- and Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, said this week that all revenue increases are the same as raising taxes and are unacceptable.
The deadline for raising the debt limit or facing a default is Aug. 2. Republicans cannot walk away from their responsibility to pay the bills and keep the economy out of further crisis.

HEADLINE: Bragging About Rainy Day Fund? Some Say Money Has Already Been Used.

BYLINE: By MORGAN SMITH. 
msmith@texastribune.org

 BODY:
About 10 minutes into his speech in New Orleans last week, Gov. Rick Perry geared up for one of the afternoon's many applause lines.
Taking a moment to praise his state, he told the audience at the Republican Leadership Conference that the Legislature had just balanced the budget -- without raising taxes and while maintaining essential government services. ''I might add that new budget leaves $6 billion in a Rainy Day Fund,'' he said, to the delight of the crowd.
Mr. Perry hit the same refrain the week before in a speech in New York City. 
The country's longest-serving governor naturally depends on the accomplishments of the State Legislature to bolster his presidential bona fides. But Mr. Perry's neon-light promotion of the robust reserve account on the national stage exposes a disconnect with the conservative lawmakers battling for his principles at home, where at the state level his party is working to divert negative public sentiment about the deep budget reductions.
Just ask a Republican state legislator why $6 billion of taxpayer money sits in the bank as teachers lose their jobs. The likely answer? Because it's already accounted for.
Heading into the legislative session, the governor made keeping the fund under lock during the forthcoming budget battle the 11th commandment for fiscal conservatives. The Legislature, flush with a newly obtained supermajority in the House, followed his lead.
Both chambers employed two core arguments to swat down proposal after proposal from Democrats to use the money to shore up government services: that the governor would veto any bill using the Rainy Day Fund in the forthcoming budget and that the money was already obligated.
''We've got to get the message right. There's been a lot of misinformation out there that there's $6 billion in the fund that's not been used. It's been used,'' said Representative Charles Perry, Republican of Lubbock and no relation to the governor.
But what about the governor's remarks in New Orleans?
''That's the governor's message,'' said Charles Perry, a Tea Party-anointed lawmaker who defeated the nearly three decade long legislative veteran Delwin Jones in the 2010 primary, mounting a grassroots attack from the right. ''That's not Charles Perry the legislator's message.''
Here's where Charles Perry the legislator is coming from. Lawmakers have already drawn down $3.1 billion of the fund's projected $9.5 billion reserve to cover a deficit in the current budget. Then, to make the 2012-13 budget balance, the state's projected share of expected Medicaid costs is underestimated by $4.8 billion -- for many, a conservative estimate.
That means when lawmakers come back in two years, without a change in federal law diminishing the state's obligation to Medicaid or an increase in Rainy Day revenue from an improved economy. they will need most of the remaining $6 billion to pay another past-due bill.
''Effectively they've used it,'' said Bill Hammond, president of the Texas Association of Business and a former state lawmaker. ''They just aren't going to fess up until January of 2013.''
Mr. Hammond's organization is the largest business lobby in the state. Early in the session, he called on the Legislature to siphon $6 billion from the fund's roughly $9.5 billion to soften cuts to public education and health and human services.
When he realized the ''till could easily be empty'' for the next budget cycle because of current and upcoming deficits, he stopped. ''They have used the entirety, depending on how Medicaid finally shakes out,'' Mr. Hammond said, adding that of the $9.5 billion, about $9 billion has been committed.
A rare public intraparty battle during this month's special legislative session further revealed the Republican split over the fund, when a tempting loophole presented itself during debate on Senate Bill 2, a fiscal-matters bill critical to balancing the budget. Representative Donna Howard, Democrat of Austin, offered an amendment to direct any unexpected increase in the Rainy Day Fund over the next two years above the fund's current balance to finance enrollment growth in public schools.
''This is not some far-out thing. This is talking about a contingency,'' Ms. Howard said, describing her amendment on June 10 in an effort to sway Republicans who had pledged not to drain the Rainy Day Fund. ''I'm offering something that allows you to remain faithful to what you've committed, to not touch the current Rainy Day Fund.''
In essence, her Republican colleagues could support it without casting a vote to deplete the corpus of the fund. The amendment, which under some projections could put $2 billion more into public education, passed without a hiccup.
The outcry from the right was immediate. Still, the next day, 17 members (who were later nicknamed the Rainy Day Republicans) bucked party orthodoxy to vote against a measure to drop the amendment.
A majority of the House ultimately voted in favor of removing it, but because the measure lacked the requisite two-thirds support of the chamber, it remained. If it survives conference committee -- the House passed a nonbinding resolution to instruct its conferees to strip it -- two-thirds of both the House and Senate must approve it.
The Howard amendment is unlikely to make it to the governor's desk. It may never prove its effectiveness as law. But Democrats can hope that as political strategy, it throws into relief the struggle of Republicans butting up against the take-no-prisoners fiscal conservatism and the anti-federal agenda that carried so many of them into the state house.
''Texas is not Washington D.C.,'' said Representative Lanham Lyne of Wichita Falls, a freshman Republican who voted to keep Ms. Howard's measure.
Mr. Lyne said the governor's position on the Rainy Day Fund factored ''immensely'' into the dialogue in the House throughout the session.
''If you don't have the governor on board,'' he said, ''It's not going to happen.''

HEADLINE: Finally, Nurses Are Set To Vote On Unionizing

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN. 
jwarren@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
It's easier to be elected president than to win a union representation election these days.
I'm looking at a 2004 photo of a little-known state senator, Barack Obama, addressing a rally at a West Side Chicago church on behalf of an organizing campaign at Resurrection Health Care, a nonprofit, church-run group of hospitals.
The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees is still at it and will finally get a representation election next Wednesday and Thursday among about 270 registered nurses at one of the group's locations, Our Lady of the Resurrection Medical Center. 
It's a drawn-out, nearly decade-long tussle fit for the times. The union has met resistance and filed 50 complaints about unfair labor practices with the National Labor Relations Board. The company voluntarily settled 18 of the 50 complaints brought against its various properties before any federal hearing.
No such Chicago community hospital has been unionized, and the national backdrop is clear: distinctly anti-union sentiment; laws that make organizing tougher and employer penalties for breaking those laws modest; a frequent refusal of employers to bargain a contract even after a union wins an election; self-inflicted wounds by a few corrupt unions; citizen ignorance about the positive history of organized labor; and the virtual disappearance of labor reporting in mainstream journalism.
And of course there's the curiosity of this employer's being a Roman Catholic nonprofit and relying on a prominent Chicago management law firm, Seyfarth Shaw, which often drives unions batty. The church, especially at headquarters in Italy, has often stoutly defended worker rights.
The targeted group, registered nurses, earn $25 to $35 an hour, or annual pay in the $50,000 to $70,000 range. They're far from, say, the exploited undocumented workers one finds in apparel sweatshops. But they're in an industry fixated on cost-cutting, bringing ample stresses as patient-to-staff ratios rise.
''Patient loads are heavier. There's less time to help teach new nurses and more time spent on things like our monitoring new medication drips,'' said Rachelle Vardon, a nurse at Our Lady of the Resurrection.
Ms. Vardon, 33, is the child of Filipino immigrants. She has worked at Resurrection for eight years, loves her job and is bothered by what she perceives as pressure from some doctors who contend the hospital may have to close if the union wins.
Maggie Nielsen, 52, an emergency-room nurse who is pro-union, also feels such pressure. ''Some staff are terrified and run away when they see me,'' she said. Ms. Nielsen, too, is proud of her work --''We're still giving the best patient care in a superior emergency room'' -- but is also bothered by an increased workload and the threats to cut staffing if the union wins.
The women spoke at the labor federation's office. The National Labor Relations Board asserts that the hospital illegally forbade nurses to talk about unionization in break rooms or the cafeteria when off the clock and barred union literature on bulletin boards in break rooms. A hearing is set for Aug. 3.
Any illegal behavior is denied by Brian Crawford, the company's vice president for public affairs. The accusations include pressure by doctors or any hospital involvement in anti-union T-shirts briefly worn by some employees.
Support for union representation isn't completely along hospital party lines. Pre-election ''yes'' and ''no'' buttons are being worn by doctors and nurses.
''We are encouraging all employees to vote their conscience,'' Mr. Crawford said.
Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, voiced frustration with Resurrection in a letter to the company's chief executive. Several priests are chagrined, including the Rev. Lawrence Dowling of St. Agatha Catholic Church in North Lawndale, who argues that health care executives have ''hijacked'' Catholic hospitals' original missions.
And Thomas Geoghegan, a Chicago labor lawyer , who is Catholic, said, ''Name the pope: Leo XIII, Pius XI, John XXIII, Paul V, John Paul II and Benedict XVI. Each one has thumped for the right to join a union.'' ''The Catholic Church's solution to every labor and just about every economic question is 'Bring in the union!' But it's the one papal teaching that American Catholics are allowed to ignore.''
Mr. Geoghegan clearly understands stiff challenges. His clients include the Chicago Teachers Union, which is itself facing a formidable force: Mayor Rahm Emanuel.

HEADLINE: Let's Make a Deal, Amazon Tells Texas

BYLINE: By ROSS RAMSEY. 
rramsey@texastribune.org

 BODY:
In the middle of a fight with Texas tax collectors over book sales in the state, Amazon offered Thursday to invest $300 million in five or six warehouse and distribution centers in the state, employing 6,000 people, if lawmakers would let the company operate for four-and-a-half years without collecting sales taxes.
Texas has granted sales tax rebates to companies on goods and services they buy, but has apparently never allowed one to stop collecting taxes from its own customers. The Texas Retailers Association blasted the proposed Amazon deal as a carve-out that would leave the state's brick-and-mortar stores at a disadvantage to the giant Internet retailer. 
Gov. Rick Perry wants the deal and has contacted lawmakers to promote it, a spokesman said. And the statutory change that it would require is in the hands of House and Senate negotiators who are putting the last touches on a piece of legislation critical to balancing the state budget.
Lawmakers have balked, and what might have been a team effort between the governor and the state's top tax collector, Comptroller Susan Combs, is complicated by an earlier skirmish over Amazon and Mr. Perry's veto of legislation that would have moved technology procurements into Ms. Combs's shop.
Last year, Ms. Combs hit Amazon with a $269 million tax bill, saying its distribution center in Irving establishes a legal footprint that requires it to collect sales taxes from Texas customers. The company disagrees, and Mr. Perry, asked about the case earlier this year, took Amazon's side and said he wouldn't have billed the company.
Online, mail order and other direct sellers without physical operations in the state, or ''nexus,'' don't have to collect sales taxes from their Texas customers. During the regular legislative session, lawmakers approved a change to the sales tax laws that would have established nexus for any company owning more than 50 percent of an affiliate or subsidiary in the state. It wouldn't even have to be related to the company's main business. An out-of-state mail order company with nothing in Texas but a bait shop on the coast would be on the hook for collecting sales taxes.
Mr. Perry vetoed the bill, saying the state should wait until there had been more talk ''about interstate commerce and the structure of state sales taxes in the 21st century'' before changing the law.
Lawmakers were already in special session when he announced his veto. Representative John Otto, Republican of Dayton, responded by adding the sales-tax provision to a critical fiscal bill needed to balance the 2012-13 state budget. That raises the question of whether Mr. Perry will veto the fiscal bill to kill the provision.
In the meantime, Amazon made its tax proposition. Mr. Perry likes it because it would, in the words of Mark Miner, his spokesman, ''create more jobs than the Caterpillar deal or Toyota'' -- two earlier headline-grabbing economic deals in Texas.
Amazon made a similar deal, under similar circumstances, with South Carolina last month. In Texas, in its latest iteration of the proposal, the company agreed to create 6,000 full-time jobs with full health care benefits over the next three years and to invest $300 million in new warehouse and distribution centers over that same period.
In return, the state would agree to let Amazon go four and one-half years without collecting sales taxes from its customers in Texas. ''Collecting'' is the key word, because Amazon's customers still owe the money whether the company collects it or not. Under state law, sales taxes are collected from customers by sellers and turned over to the state. In the proposed deal, Amazon agreed to print the amount of tax due on customer invoices and e-mail confirmations, but it would be up to the customers to then, of their own volition, pay the state what they owed. The deal, as proposed, would expire at the beginning of 2016.
Curiously, Ms. Combs said the Amazon deal would cost the state nothing. On the one hand, she has got a pending tax case against the company that says its failure to remit sales taxes costs the state about $70 million annually. And Mr. Otto's bill would have brought in $16 million over the next two years, by Ms. Combs's official estimate. But giving the company a break for the next two years is a freebie, apparently.
''Our current revenue estimate does not assume that Amazon will either voluntarily or be compelled to collect taxes during the 2012-13 biennium, so there is no loss to the estimate from the agreement,'' a Combs spokesman said via e-mail.
He left out whether the deal would make it harder to collect the $269 million in back taxes.

HEADLINE: Panel to Scrutinize Causes Behind Weak State Budgets

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Americans who have wondered whether Illinois, California and other troubled states are slouching toward the fate of Greece may get their answer in the coming months.
Richard Ravitch, who won an emergency appointment as New York's lieutenant governor during the 2009 budget impasse, announced a high-level new project Thursday to untangle the finances of the states and shine a light on their hidden debts.
''Whereas there is enormous public attention to the federal deficit, the problems of the states are very serious and nowhere near very well understood,'' he said in an interview. ''People have to understand this, and address it with the same degree of gravitas as the federal deficit problem.'' 
Mr. Ravitch will lead the project together with Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman who is credited with wringing double-digit inflation out of the United States economy in the 1980s.
The project will look into the causes of the current fiscal problems of the states, to what extent they are the result of the 2008 financial crisis, and to what extent they are structural. The difference is important because structural problems will not necessarily go away as soon as the economy picks up again.
In his 17 months as lieutenant governor, Mr. Ravitch expressed concern that New York State's annual budget dramas had become a self-sustaining chain reaction, with each year's batch of accounting gimmicks and one-offs feeding an even bigger deficit the following year. Weaknesses in governmental accounting were making the accumulating shortfalls hard to see.
The new research team will also look at the way states are carrying out ''mandates,'' the services they are required to provide under America's federalist system, like health care for the indigent. Since the 2008 crisis, the states have complained that they are legally bound by mandates they no longer have the resources to carry out. With the Obama administration's fiscal stimulus running out this summer, the stage is being set for a major challenge of federalism.
In addition to studying the cause of the states' problems, the research team will explore possible solutions, but not prescribe any course of action. States are considered sovereigns under law, and imposing new requirements on them is difficult, as the Obama administration has learned through the current court battle over the health care overhaul.
To keep the research from becoming unwieldy, the group will start by studying just five states: New York, Illinois, California, Texas and Virginia. Texas was chosen because it is prosperous but still has a significant budget deficit. Virginia was added to the mix because many observers believe it has the best fiscal practices. Illinois and California are on the list because of their low credit ratings.
New York State is on the agenda because of the size and complexity of its system of public authorities, which operate enterprises like hospital systems and toll roads, and are not bound by the rules that limit the amount of debt the state itself can issue.
Mr. Ravitch became interested in tracking state indebtedness during his abbreviated term as lieutenant governor. Known as a skilled negotiator who helped New York City avert bankruptcy in the mid-1970s, he was brought in to help with a budgeting process that had broken down. He dug into the state's finances, saw that years of budget sleight-of-hand had papered over a major imbalance, and drafted a broad fiscal reform proposal.
His approach was to allow limited borrowing to cover operating expenses only if the state broke with the accounting skullduggery of the past. But his ideas were rejected by Gov. David A. Paterson and then by Andrew M. Cuomo, who was attorney general before becoming governor.
Sidelined, Mr. Ravitch continued to investigate New York State's finances and to look for parallels with other states. He discovered an array of unsound practices, like using long-term debt to pay for short-term expenditures. In some cases, officials were violating conventional accounting practices, like selling public assets and treating the proceeds as found money.
In other cases, special accounting rules for governments were themselves at fault, making it possible for states to promise valuable retirement benefits to their workers without recording the true cost. (The accounting rule-making board for governments is slowly working on changes.)
Mr. Ravitch was surprised at how little uniform, accurate data existed, and eventually he decided to compile a database himself. Since completing his term as lieutenant governor in December, he has been raising the money from nonprofit foundations.
He and Mr. Volcker have assembled an advisory board from both political parties that includes several former cabinet members, Nicholas F. Brady, Joseph A. Califano Jr. and George P. Schulz, and the creator of revenue-sharing, Richard Nathan, among others.
The project will be led by Donald J. Boyd, currently a senior fellow at the Rockefeller Institute of Government in Albany.
Mr. Ravitch unveiled the research initiative in a speech Thursday at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, which is holding a conference on the issue of fiscal sustainability.

HEADLINE: A Conservative's Case for a Gas Tax

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A conservative pundit who has blasted climate campaigners continues to press for a gas tax.

 BODY:
Awhile back, I had a brief e-chat with the conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer, a self-described "global warming agnostic," about his longstanding push for a gas tax (with payroll taxes cut to compensate). 
Following up on my piece exploring the bipartisan consensus -- hidden by polarized Republican-Democrat battles -- on moving to smarter, more sustainable energy choices, I thought it worth posting the short Q&A here. I reached Krauthammer yesterday and he said his passion for a gas tax has not ebbed. (He did add that it would have been easier to get agreement years ago, when gasoline prices were lower.)
Here's Krauthammer discussing his views in 2009:
Charles Krauthammer Proposes an Unusual Gasoline... by FORAtv
Here's our exchange: 
Q. Just to be sure readers are up to date on your proposal for a gas tax, has your conception changed at all or is it still basically revenue neutral, compensated by payroll tax reduction? 
A. There's been no change in my views whatsoever. My only regret is that it wasn't instituted when I proposed it, when gasoline prices were a dollar less than they are now. That dollar could have by now been going back into the U.S. economy as a net zero gas tax instead of going overseas -- as that dollar is now.
Q. Do you see any need or sense in doing the same with other fossil or finite energy sources (e.g., coal)? A. No. We don't import coal.
 Q. There are other proposals to use a very modest tweak in fuel taxes to boost basic research and development funding aimed at expanding nonpolluting energy options (nuclear, solar, storage, etc) -- an arena that has been unbelievably underfunded for decades (see graph at link) compared to other areas of scientific inquiry. Could you see a tax where a small portion of funding was dedicated to such inquiry (and insulated from congressional earmarking)? 
A. No. The point of gasoline taxes is to reduce consumption/demand -- with all of the attendant beneficial side effects -- not to fund other projects, however lovely they sound. Once you break the discipline of having every penny of the tax go back to the taxpayer immediately through the payroll tax reduction, you've turned the gas tax into a slush fund where politicians pick winners and losers, play favorites and dole out patronage. Q. The most important question: Do you see any real-world path to overcoming congressional resistance to any gas tax (even though polls have long shown voters would support such a tax if the funds were dedicated to energy advancements)? Is this something that could only occur under a Republican administration (I mused on this not long ago)? 
A. Only a Republican could do it, and even then it would be difficult. The most prominent support of my idea when I published the article was from Senator Lugar. 
While Krauthammer's views on other issues, including global warming, differ with mine, his views on at least this energy tax (setting aside coal) provide a starting point for building some kind of consensus amid the more heated shouting on energy policy. 
There are other opportunities for building bipartisan support on energy issues and, potentially, taking the conversation back from polarizing partisans -- one being moving toward a clean slate on energy subsidies. 
The shouting will continue, of course. The last time a rise in the gas tax came up on Dot Earth, Rush Limbaugh dived in with zeal. 
But I'll keep sifting for starting points. (Heck, I once found overlap between the positions of Joe Romm and Bjorn Lomborg.) It's an ingrained habit given my familial status as a middle child.

HEADLINE: The Human-Capital Approach to Occupational Choice

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: Modest increases in the amounts that primary-care doctors are paid would go a long way toward closing the gap between them and specialists, an economist writes.

 BODY:
Uwe E. Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton. He has some financial interests in the health care field.
My previous post, on the shortage of primary-care doctors, brought forth a set of illuminating comments. As many readers pointed out correctly, the issue has many facets, not only an economic one. 
Although economists are fully aware of the complexity of career choices, in their Op-Ed piece on the subject that inspired my initial post, Drs. Peter Bach and Robert Kocher used what economists call the human-capital approach to occupational choice. 
That approach styles a career choice as an ordinary investment project, focused mainly on alternative cash flows or, in their more sophisticated forms, monetary equivalents of costs and benefits. Drs. Bach and Kocher focus purely on cash flows.
To recap their proposal, they would make attending medical school free of tuition for all students and pay that substantial cost by eliminating the salaries currently paid to residents not in a primary-care residency. 
Making tuition free will not increase the overall number of medical school graduates -- because their number is constrained by the limited supply of medical-school places in the United States. 
There is already huge excess demand for medical education in the United States, which denies access to thousands of qualified American college graduates every year, then covers the resulting physician shortage by importing large numbers of medical graduates from abroad. 
Drs. Bach and Kocher believe that eliminating the salaries of residents in the specialties will drive many among an artificially limited supply of medical school graduates into primary care. Frankly, I doubt it. 
To follow my reasoning, let us build the human-capital model that economists would use in the classroom to this end.
The Baseline Human-Capital ModelTo illustrate the human-capital approach, I begin with what I shall call the baseline case, using numbers from Drs. Bach and Kocher. Currently, residents in both primary care and in a non-primary-care specialty (hereafter just "specialty") are paid salaries starting at $50,000 and assumed here to be rising at an annual rate of 3 percent.
We imagine a 26-year-old medical-school graduate who is choosing between a career in primary care and a higher-paying medical specialty that does, however, require two added years of residency. We assume that primary-care physicians serve a three-year residency and residents in the non-primary specialty serve a five-year residency.
Upon completion of their residencies, we assume that primary-care physicians will start practice at a pretax income of $190,000 and specialty physicians will earn 70 percent more in every year of their career, as suggested by Drs. Bach and Kocher. Thus, we assume that specialists start at an annual income of $323,000. Our assumption, as noted, is that specialists start practice two years later than primary-care physicians.
Finally, we assume that the incomes of both categories of physicians grow at 5 percent a year until age 55 and a bit more slowly thereafter. That rate may be higher than current growth rates in annual physician incomes; the higher rate reflects an impending overall shortage of physicians in the United States, as is now widely anticipated by the experts. In fact, a rate of 5 percent may turn out to be low. 
Many physicians may not recognize their own experience in this hypothetical example, because there is considerable variance among physician incomes. I merely seek to be illustrative here with reasonably realistic central tendencies.
The chart below illustrates the alternative future cash flows that our hypothetical baseline case implies over the physicians' careers, starting with their first year of residency. For ease of calculation, we make the assumption that all salaries and incomes are received by the physician at the end of the year in one lump sum. 
The red line in the chart represents our hypothetical primary-care physicians and the blue line the specialist. Let us now look at the purely financial investment implied by a medical-school graduate's decision to train for a specialty rather than pursue a primary-care career, other things being equal. 
Basically, the investment here is the primary-care income that the specialists forgo during the extra two years of residency, minus the residency salary they will earn in those two years. The return on that investment is the much higher income the specialist earns thereafter.
The next chart depicts the differential cash flow implied by this investment decision. From a monetary perspective, training for a specialty tends to bring a large payoff on a relatively small investment outlay, certainly for the higher-paying specialties.
The two most widely used metrics in the classroom and in modern business practice to evaluate future cash flows from investments are the net present value of the cash flow, known as N.P.V., and the internal rate of return on the decision, known as I.R.R. (This is not the place to explain these two economic concepts in detail. For readers who would like to know a bit more about them, see the lecture notes from my freshman economics course.)
In a nutshell, the net present value of an investment is the algebraic sum of the future periodic cash flows it yields, with each future year's cash flow converted to present-value terms. In this case "present" means the beginning of the first year of residency. 
The idea is that if one can earn, say, 6 percent on $1,000 invested for one year, one would end up with $1,060 at the end of the year. The $1,000 is thus the present value of the $1,060 receivable one year hence. By the same reasoning, at an interest rate (also called discount rate) of 6 percent, a $350,000 receivable, say, 12 years hence would have a present value of only $173,939 = $350,000/(1.06)12. 
Practically, we can think of the N.P.V. as the amount by which the investor's (here the specialist's) wealth is expected to increase, as of the moment when the investment decision is made, by choosing the investment rather than forgoing it. Think of it as instant wealth creation, but wealth measured in N.P.V. terms.
The I.R.R. is a more difficult concept. It can be thought of as the rate of return the investment project yields, in any given year, on the amount invested in the project and not yet returned by past cash inflows as of the beginning of that year. 
In their textbooks on corporate finance, economists regularly warn against relying on the I.R.R. to evaluate investment decisions, because that metric can be quite treacherous. Ironically, when applying the human-capital model to occupational choice in their theoretical or empirical work, economists have focused mainly on the I.R.R.
In what follows, I shall focus mainly on the N.P.V. criterion. 
For our baseline case -- in the absence of the Bach-Kocher proposal -- where both types of physicians are paid salaries during their residencies, the net present value of an investment in becoming a specialist rather than a primary-care physician, calculated at an annual discount rate of 6 percent, is $2.1 million. (If we had looked just as the algebraic, undiscounted sum of the differential cash flow in the second chart it would be $9.3 million, but because $1 received 40 years hence is not the same as $1 received one year from now, the algebraic sum of long-term future cash flows has no useful meaning).
I note in passing that the corresponding I.R.R. to this investment is 39.22 percent. That rate of return may strike readers as very high, but even higher rates have been found in the empirical literature (see, for example, Pages 4-8 in this paper by Sean Nicholson, now of Cornell University, and Slide 18 in another of his papers).
The Bach-Kocher ProposalUnder this proposal, no medical student would pay tuition. Therefore we can disregard tuition altogether, because there is no difference between the two types of physicians.
In fact, the only small difference between this proposal and the current baseline is that specialty residents would not be paid a salary during their five years of residency. The algebraic sum of the foregone salaries is a mere $265,457. Its present value is $222,872, not even as much as the specialist's first-year income. It represents a decline of about 3.3 percent in the $6.8 million N.P.V. of the specialist's lifetime cash flow. 
Put another way, the Bach-Kocher proposal would shrink the difference between the N.P.V.'s of the two physicians' lifetime earnings to about $1.88 million, from $2.1 million.
If I were the medical school graduate and had to choose between a specialty career or a primary-care career, these small declines in the N.P.V. of my expected lifetime earnings certainly would not drive me into primary care. 
An Alternative ProposalAn alternative proposal would be not to force specialists to forgo their residency salaries. Instead, we would alter the baseline case simply by raising the primary-care physician's income by X percent in each year of practice, leaving the cash flow of specialists unchanged. In that case, one would not make medical school tuition-free, sparing the taxpayer the need to bear that cost.
For starters, let us ask how large X would have to be to achieve the same result as the Bach-Kocher proposal, in terms of a decline of the N.P.V. of the specialist's cash flow relative to the primary-care physician's.
The answer is that a 2.21 percent increase in every year of the primary-care physician's income would have the same overall effect as withholding the salaries of the specialists during residency. That may seem a small increase, but it would, of course, be applied every year, and that will add up. 
While the Bach-Kocher proposal is imaginary and novel, I conclude that is too timid to move the mountain. 
If there really is a shortage of primary-care physicians in America -- and one could have a debate on that issue -- then more powerful policy tools must come into play, going beyond mere financial return, which is but one of many factors driving specialty choice. 
Part of a better policy solution would be to inquire more deeply how medical graduates responds to income differentials in practice. Do they use the concepts taught in economics? Or do they just observe prevailing income differentials among the various specialties and base their choices on that information?"

HEADLINE: Preferring Boys to Girls

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: China isn't the only country where parents have a distinct preference for baby boys rather than girls -- so is the United States, according to Gallup poll data from the last 70 years.

 BODY:
China isn't the only country where parents have a distinct preference for baby boys rather than baby girls. Americans prefers XY to XX in their offspring, too - and have wanted boys rather than girls for the last 70 years.
A recent Gallup poll asked Americans which sex they would prefer if they could have only one child. About 40 percent said they would prefer a boy and 28 percent would prefer a girl, with the rest saying they had no preference or opinion on the question.
Gallup has asked some version of this question 10 times since 1941, and the results always indicated a preference for boys:Not all adults are equally likely to want boys rather than girls, though. 
According to Gallup's findings, men are the primary drivers of this tilt toward boys; women, on the other hand, generally show no preference either way. Younger adults - those 18 to 29 - are also much more likely than their older counterparts to say they prefer a boy.Less education attainment is also associated with a greater preference for boys:It's not clear why Americans would overwhelmingly prefer boys.
In many East Asian countries, having boys can provide greater economic security, since in their old age parents are more likely to live with, and be financially supported by, their sons. But, as Nancy Folbre has written, the opposite is true in America: in the United States, daughters are much more likely to be caring for their elderly parents than sons are.
Then again, women may do more unpaid work than men in the United States (as well as just about everywhere else), but men still have much higher earnings. Perhaps there is a perception that having a son will guarantee greater financial stability.
Or maybe some other risks that come with having a daughter - such as unplanned pregnancies - weigh heavier in Americans' minds when thinking about this question.
Any other theories, readers?

HEADLINE: Podcast: Creating Jobs, and Juggling Them

BYLINE: JEFF SOMMER


HIGHLIGHT: A look at the latest Weekend Business podcast, and a listen.

 BODY:
The budget deficit has been grabbing many of the headlines and much of the attention in Washington. But it's a distraction. There's a more immediate economic problem.So says Robert Frank, the Cornell economist, in the new Weekend Business podcast. Mr. Frank, who elaborates on this position in the Economic View column in Sunday Business, says that trimming the deficit is indeed necessary and important, but that it's a long-term problem. For the short term, with the unemployment rate still stuck at 9.1 percent, putting people back to work is far more crucial, he says. And because increased employment would generate more national income and more government revenue, he says, failing to take action now is like setting a national bonfire and burning hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods and services. 
He suggests instituting a payroll tax holiday through 2012 as a politically acceptable way to stimulate the economy and create more jobs. 
Juggling multiple jobs has always been a skill that writers, artists, actors and other creative people have had to master just to make ends meet, but in the weak American economy, many other people have had to learn this art, too. In a conversation in the podcast, Hannah Seligson tells Phyllis Korkki that this is particularly true for recent college graduates, many of whom have had great difficulty landing appropriate full-time employment. In a cover article in the Sunday Business section, Ms. Seligson says that while holding several part-time jobs simultaneously may be needed to bring in enough income now, it often results in diminished earnings over the course of a long career. And part-time jobs rarely provide benefits like health care coverage, adding to the difficulties of those who manage to hold down more than one of them. 
The global economy is still reeling from the effects of the subprime mortgage problems of 2006 and 2007, as Gretchen Morgenson says in a separate podcast conversation. When those mortgages began to go sour, the downturn in mortgage and asset-backed securities markets blossomed into both a full-blown housing crisis in the United States and a financial crisis throughout much of the world. 
As Ms. Morgenson writes in her column in Sunday Business, a settlement has now been reached involving Morgan Keegan, a company with mutual funds that held securities based on these troubled mortgages but that failed to tell investors how risky those funds actually were, according to regulators.
Morgan Keegan, based in Memphis, reached the $200 million settlement with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, state securities regulators and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors lost more than $1 billion in the funds, though, and arbitration cases are continuing, Ms. Morgenson says in separate conversation in the podcast. Morgan Keegan neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing in the settlement. 
But she says that regulators described a detailed pattern of misleading investors and of changing fund valuations in order to prevent losses by the fund company.
In the news section of the podcast, I also discuss several other big developments. They include the decision of the United States and its allies to release strategic oil reserves into the global market, and the continuing efforts to contain the debt crisis in Greece. 
You can find specific segments of the podcast at these junctures: Gretchen Morgenson on Morgan Keegan (30:11); news headlines (22:16); Hannah Seligson on multiple jobs (17:56); Robert Frank on unemployment (11:45); the week ahead (2:35).

HEADLINE: If It Walks Like an Insurer ...

BYLINE: REED ABELSON


HIGHLIGHT: The Massachusetts health care system takes another turn.

 BODY:
Why do insurers need to charge so much in premiums? One reason they cite is the need to have sufficient reserves to pay for those customers who prove to be sicker and more expensive than they thought.
Because of the new payment models being discussed, some hospitals are starting to make the same argument, according to an interesting item appearing Friday in the Incidental Economist blog, entitled, appropriately enough, "Give Us More Money."
Massachusetts hospitals are defending their pricing practices in the wake of a report by the state attorney general, which warns that the state's powerful health systems can charge pretty much what they want and raises the idea of temporary price controls.
The Massachusetts Hospital Association disagreed and offered a familiar-sounding reason for why hospitals should be allowed to charge high prices, according to the blog. It they didn't, the association argued, hospitals would be at financial risk because of patients that turn out to be sicker and more expensive than they thought. Therefore, it said, perhaps hospitals should get some of those reserves now being held by insurers.
"The much more surprising part of the M.H.A. press release came at the end, essentially asking for hundreds of millions of dollars from Blue Cross and other health plans," said Kevin Outterson, an associate professor at Boston University, who wrote the blog item.
If the hospitals are serious, "Expect a fight on this one," Mr. Outterson predicts.

HIGHLIGHT: For those contending that the economic recovery has merely hit some bumps on the way to renewed growth, the auto industry may offer evidence.

 BODY:
From our colleagues at Economix:
For those who believe that the economic recovery has merely hit some bumps and that growth will accelerate during the second half of the year, the automobile industry may offer the most persuasive evidence.
Sales of cars and light trucks plunged after the Japanese earthquake from an annual rate of 13.1 million vehicles in April to an annual rate of 11.8 million vehicles in May. That's slightly better than last year, but 2009 and 2010 were the first years since 1982 in which Americans bought fewer than 12 million vehicles.
The decline, it seems clear, was driven by a lack of supply. The flow of vehicles from Japan came to a standstill. The 150-acre Toyota parking lot in Long Beach, Calif., where imported cars usually sit in long white rows, is as empty as the blacktop around a football stadium in springtime.
American factories also were disrupted. Most Toyotas sold in America are built in America, but many of the parts come from Japan. Companies based in the United States like Ford and General Motors also rely on Japanese parts. North American factories made 4 percent fewer cars and light trucks in May than in the same month last year, according to the trade publication Ward's, which covers the auto industry.

HEADLINE: Leasing a Car? It May Have Hidden Value

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Leased cars may have hidden value in their residual prices.

 BODY:
From our colleagues at Bucks, an article about how the recent rise in used-car prices may provide a lucrative opportunity for lessees to come out ahead of the game. Residual values are lower than the current market values of many cars, meaning that people whose leases are ending now -- or who want to exit their leases early -- can expect a good deal if they buy their cars, or can even turn a profit by selling their cars themselves and pocketing the difference.

HEADLINE: Brooklyn Museum Names New Chairman

BYLINE: RANDY KENNEDY


HIGHLIGHT: The Brooklyn Museum announced Thursday that it had elected a new chairman, John S. Tamagni, an investment banker who has served on the board for more than 30 years.

 BODY:
The Brooklyn Museum announced Thursday that it had elected a new chairman, John S. Tamagni, an investment banker who has served on the board for more than 30 years. He will succeed Norman M. Feinberg, who has led the museum's board since 2006.
Born and raised in Brooklyn, Mr. Tamagni, is also a trustee of the Orchestra of St. Luke's and an overseer of the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College, where he is an alumnus. He takes over at a time when the museum continues to contend with the lingering effects of the economic downturn; citing a lack of money, it recently canceled plans to mount a New York version of "Art in the Streets," a show of graffiti and street art now underway at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles.

HEADLINE: Big Deal | Sloane Mansion Sold to Fertilizer Tycoon

BYLINE: SARAH KERSHAW


HIGHLIGHT: The lone bidder for the troubled Henry T. Sloane mansion won the property for about $40 million at a foreclosure auction on Wednesday.

 BODY:
The lone bidder for the troubled Henry T. Sloane mansion won the property for about $40 million at a foreclosure auction on Wednesday.
The last owners of the house, at 18 East 68th Street, had paid $20 million in 2007 and tried to sell it for $64 million in early 2008, before the housing crash. The last asking price before the auction was $37.9 million; the owners were in default on more than $28 million in loans.
The new owner of the six-story, 18,267-square-foot Beaux-Arts house, designed by C. P. H. Gilbert and completed around 1905, is Alexander Rovt, a Ukrainian-born businessman who is the president of IBE Trade Corporation, an American company that makes fertilizers. He plans to renovate the vacant property, now configured as apartments on six floors, according to his broker, Matthew Lesser of Leslie J. Garfield & Company, and restore it to a single-family residence, where he will live with his wife and children.

HEADLINE: How Gay Marriage Will Change Couples' Financial Lives

BYLINE: TARA SIEGEL BERNARD


HIGHLIGHT: Now that New York has become the sixth state to perform same-sex marriages, couples will gain access to a wide array of benefits. Here's what it all means. 

 BODY:
Updated | June 27, 2011
 Couples may marry for love, but the partnership is also an economic one. And now that New York has become the sixth state to perform same-sex marriage, couples who tie the knot here will gain a variety of financial benefits and legal rights.
Some of the changes will be significant. While New York had already recognized same-sex marriages performed elsewhere, that recognition didn't extend to state income taxes. Now, couples who marry and live in New York will be able to file their state tax returns jointly. Wealthier couples may end up paying more in taxes, but families with lower incomes may owe less.
Couples who decide to marry will also be first in line to inherit their spouses' assets, even in the absence of a will. They'll gain an array of smaller benefits as well, down to the ability to transfer a lobstering license.
"There are hundreds of different protections and benefits under New York law," said Susan Sommer, director of constitutional litigation at Lambda Legal, a legal advocacy organization for the gay community.
Of course, there's still a long list of federal benefits that will remain out of reach. Since the federal Defense of Marriage Act -- which defines marriage as between a man and a woman -- is still being enforced, gay couples in New York will still need to file separate federal tax returns. They will not be eligible for Social Security spousal or survivor benefits. And they will continue to owe extra income taxes on their spouse's health insurance benefits -- a cost that opposite-sex married couples don't have to pay.
So how will life change for same-sex couples who decide to marry? Here are some of the highlights (some of these items already apply to New Yorkers who live here but were married out of state):
Income Taxes Married couples will be able to file their state tax returns jointly, though they will still need to file separate federal tax returns (either as single or head of household). Some couples who jointly earn less than $65,000 may end up paying less in state income taxes than if they filed individual tax returns because they will get what known as a marriage bonus. But some couples with higher income may be end up in a higher tax bracket by filing jointly. In other words, they would owe less if they remained single and filed separate returns, said Tina Salandra, a New York accountant with expertise in planning for same-sex couples.
Filing joint state returns is also likely to complicate matters for federal tax purposes, and it's likely to cost the couple more in tax preparation fees (or time, if they fill out their own returns).
Here's why: Even though the couple must file separate federal tax returns (as single or head of household), they must still prepare a dummy federal tax return using a married filing status, so that they can use that data for filing their joint state return.
Otherwise, nothing changes on the federal tax front since they must file separately. (Generally speaking, couples with similar incomes or really high incomes save money by filing individual tax returns, Adding their income together often pushes them into a higher tax bracket. But couples with a stay-at-home parent or a couple with disparate incomes would typically pay less if they could file joint returns).
Estate and Gift Taxes Individuals with large estates will benefit because New York State allows spouses to transfer an unlimited amount of assets at their death. Everyone else must pay state estate taxes on estates that exceed $1 million.
But same-sex married couples will continue to be subject to federal gift taxes and estate taxes, unlike their opposite-sex counterparts.
Health Insurance People who work for companies that offer domestic partner insurance must pay income taxes on the value of their partner's benefits, unless they are considered a dependent. Heterosexual married couples aren't subject to the tax since the federal government recognizes them as an economic unit. Now that same-sex couples have the ability to marry in New York, they won't owe those taxes at the state level, but they will still owe the taxes at the federal level, experts said.
Inheritance Rights It's always wise to have a basic will outlining your wishes. If you don't, your estate will be divided according to New York State law, which puts spouses first in line of inheritance. But if the deceased spouse has children, the spouse will get $50,000 plus one half of the estate, while the children share the rest. Surviving spouses can also determine what they want to do with their spouse's remains.
State Employee Benefits The spouses of gay people who work for the state in some capacity -- whether they're governmental office workers or professors at the State University of New York -- will be able to treat their spouses as just that. That means they'll be eligible for health insurance, pension survivor benefits and any other benefits normally extended to spouses.
Parentage When a married lesbian gives birth to a child in New York, the woman who did not give birth, but who is recognized as a parent, will be automatically put on the child's birth certificate (even if she doesn't have biological ties to the child or hasn't adopted the child). Even so, it may be wise to adopt.
"Having a birth certificate reflect the child's parentage from the start is a big help for the family," Ms. Sommer said. For instance, it allows the nonbiological parent to easily put the child on her health insurance, as well as make health care decisions for the child. "But an adoption is the best way to secure the child's legal relationship to both of the child's parents not just in New York, but everywhere."
For two married men, however, the situation remains a bit more complicated. If two men are using a surrogate to carry their child, only the biological father can be automatically listed on the birth certificate. Because of New York State law, the surrogate must first relinquish her rights to the child, at which point the nonbiological father can adopt the child. (Also keep in mind that surrogacy contracts are not legal in New York, so two men who want their own biological children typically enter into such a contract with a woman in a state where surrogacy contracts are enforceable, said Allen Drexel, a family lawyer in New York with expertise in same-sex family issues). 
Other Rights If a person dies from a work-related injury or illness, their spouse may be entitled to worker's compensation benefits. Spouses also have the ability to bring wrongful death claims on behalf of their significant other.
Potential future benefits If the Defense of Marriage Act, known as DOMA, is ultimately struck down, being able to marry in New York will open the door to the many federal benefits that come with marriage.
"New York opens the door for couples who get married to be in a position to get those federal rights and protections when the day comes, in the not distant future, that DOMA falls," Ms. Sommer said. "Marriage in New York brings the upside of access to these federal protections."
Of course, for many couples, just being able to describe their status with one easy word -- marriage -- is the biggest benefit of all. "The big gain here is going to be in the security, clarity and dignity that comes with being able to say, 'We are married,' said Evan Wolfson, president of Freedom to Marry, an advocacy group in New York. "This is above love and commitment, more than the legal and economic matters."

HEADLINE: Cars as a Harbinger of an Upturn

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: For those contending that the economic recovery has merely hit some bumps on the way to renewed growth, the auto industry may offer evidence.

 BODY:
For those who believe that the economic recovery has merely hit some bumps, and that growth will accelerate during the second half of the year, the automobile industry may offer the most persuasive evidence.
Sales of cars and light trucks plunged after the Japanese earthquake from an annual rate of 13.1 million vehicles in April to an annual rate of 11.8 million vehicles in May. That's slightly better than last year, but 2009 and 2010 were the first years since 1982 in which Americans bought fewer than 12 million vehicles.
The decline, it seems clear, was driven by a lack of supply. The flow of vehicles from Japan came to a standstill. The 150-acre Toyota parking lot in Long Beach, Calif., where imported cars usually sit in long white rows, is as empty as the blacktop around a football stadium in springtime.
American factories also were disrupted. Most Toyotas sold in America are built in America, but many of the parts come from Japan. Companies based in the United States like Ford and General Motors also rely on Japanese parts. North American factories made 4 percent fewer cars and light trucks in May than in the same month last year, according to the trade publication Ward's, which covers the auto industry.
The results can be seen most clearly in the dwindling inventory of vehicles available for sale. The standard metric compares vehicles sold on an average day with those available for sale. Ward's reported that inventories would last 54 days at the end of April, but only 49 days by the end of May. And this ratio was buoyed by the declining pace of sales -- actual inventories fell by an even larger increment.With demand outstripping supply, automakers and dealers cut back on incentives. Edmunds.com reported that incentives on new cars fell 20 percent in April compared to the previous year. The average incentive of $2,118 on a new car was the lowest in seven years. It then dropped again in May.
This chain reaction -- lower supply, higher prices, lower demand -- is a key reason the economy is falling short of forecasts in the second quarter. It also has helped to drive up inflation indexes.
But there is a silver lining: By all indications, it is a problem that already appears to be fading away.
The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, included it Wednesday on a list of "factors that are likely to be temporary" in predicting that the pace of growth will increase in the third quarter.
Car companies outside Japan are ramping up production, hoping to lure away customers. And the Japanese automakers are racing to respond.
Toyota, the world's largest automaker before the earthquake, said its Japanese factories will not resume full production until November. But its American factories, which produce most of the models sold in the United States, will return to full production by September, much earlier than expected. 
The company told the trade publication Automotive News earlier this week that it was resuming its advertising campaigns and increasing its offers of sales incentives.
"There's a perception that there's no cars around, but we have good supply and got the pipeline going, so we are shifting focus to marketing," Bob Carter, a Toyota executive, told Automotive News. "We have deals, and dealers have the vehicles."

HEADLINE: The President's Debt-Ceiling Strategy

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Is he a clever moderate, or a lousy negotiator?

 BODY:
There's been a lot of discussion on liberal blogs (see Matt Yglesias, Jonathan Chait, Kevin Drum, Greg Sargent, and Chait again) about whether President Obama's decision to go along with the Republican insistence on tying a deficit reduction package to the debt ceiling vote constitutes a blunder or a deliberate strategy - whether he's a "bad negotiator" who's let the Republicans hold him (and the American economy) hostage to their demands for spending cuts, or a "clever moderate" who's using the debt ceiling to force his own base to live with painful deficit choices.
Put me in the "clever moderate" camp. My (limited) contact with prominent Democrats suggests that people in the White House share the Republican premise that we need to do something about the deficit this year in order to reassure markets and creditors that we aren't just going to keep sailing toward the waterfall. (This is not the consensus in the liberal blogosphere, of course, which explains a lot of progressive disgruntlement with the president.) Tying that "something" to the debt ceiling vote probably isn't the White House's ideal scenario, but it has two advantages: In the run-up to the vote, the president can use the specter of Tea Party extremism ("these crazies want to throw the American economy off a cliff!") to sell reluctant Democrats on spending cuts, and in the event that the impasse can't be broken and the government actually has to start choose which obligations it fulfills, the politics of "prioritization" will almost certainly favor the White House rather than the G.O.P., for the reasons Yglesias and Josh Barro lay out. There are economic risks here, obviously, but I think the administration has good reason to be confident that they can get a deal worked out.
And if they do work out a deal - and this is the crucial part - it doesn't have to include nearly as much in the way of revenue increases as a liberal president would normally prefer, because taxes are already scheduled to go up. Republicans are being intransigent on taxes in these negotiations for ideological reasons, but also because they know that if Obama is re-elected (which is more likely than not), they won't be able to block tax increases: With a non-stroke of the pen, he can just let the Bush tax cuts expire - for the rich, or even for the middle class as well.
This is the trump card that liberals carry into all these negotiations. If we just do nothing on taxes except let the "current law baseline" run its course, their preferred vision wins.

HEADLINE: The Early Word: No Deal

BYLINE: EMMARIE HUETTEMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Two congressional Republicans walked out of budget negotiations Thursday, putting the future of the talks in limbo.

 BODY:
From Today's Times:
 Two key Republicans put the chances of a debt-limit deal in doubt on Thursday, abandoning negotiations about which Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, had expressed optimism. Mr. Cantor and Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona said they could not go along with the Democrats' push for new tax revenues. The Times's Carl Hulse reports that the development puts pressure on President Obama to play a larger role in the showdown. Gen. David H. Petraeus, the top United States commander in Afghanistan, said that Mr. Obama's timetable for withdrawing troops is "more aggressive" than he had recommended. The general was asked to share his personal opinion at a Congressional hearing on his nomination to be the director of central intelligence. He also said he had not considered suggestions that he resign over the disagreement, The Times's Mark Mazzetti and Scott Shane report. Drug companies won big at the Supreme Court on Thursday, with the justices handing them two significant victories. The court limited the ability of people to sue manufacturers if they are harmed by generic prescription medications, and it eliminated a ban on some uses of prescription information, The Times's Adam Liptak reports. In an effort to replace oil supplies cut off by the crisis in Libya, the United States and its allies plan to release 60 million barrels from emergency reserves. It is a move that officials hope will maintain a stable global supply and keep gasoline prices under control, though an administration official said the move was not about politics, The Times's John M. Broder and Clifford Krauss report.Around the Web:
 The United States is not prepared to handle an attack involving weapons of mass destruction, according to a new report by the Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism. The House Homeland Security Committee discussed the report on Thursday, and The Hill reports that two lawmakers will reintroduce a bill on Friday to address their concerns about such weapons.Washington Happenings: While visiting Carnegie Mellon University and its National Robotics Engineering Center in Pittsburgh on Friday, Mr. Obama will emphasize the importance of a competitive manufacturing industry. The Commerce Department will release figures on the gross domestic product for the first quarter of the year. Walter Reed Army Medical Center will hold one its last formal ceremonies, during which a soldier who was injured in Afghanistan will receive the Purple Heart. The hospital is scheduled to close this year.

HEADLINE: Obama Seeks to Restart Budget Talks

BYLINE: JACKIE CALMES


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will meet separately on Monday with the Democratic and Republican Senate leaders in an opening bid to restart budget talks.

 BODY:
President Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will meet separately on Monday with the Democratic and Republican Senate leaders in an opening bid to restart budget talks on addressing long-term debt reduction and clear the way for a necessary vote on raising the nation's debt limit.
The White House press secretary, Jay Carney, announced that Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden would meet first with the Democratic majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, in the morning and then with the Republican minority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, in the early evening "to discuss the status of the negotiations to find common ground on a balanced approach to deficit reduction."
By the administration's definition, a "balanced approach" means one that reduces the next 10 years' projected debt by at least $2 trillion through a combination of spending cuts and tax increases on the highest-income Americans. Republicans' refusal to consider tax increases led their chief negotiator, Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, to abandon the bipartisan budget talks that Mr. Biden had been leading for weeks.
In a statement, Mr. McConnell said, "The president needs to decide between his goal of massive tax hikes and a bipartisan plan to address our deficit. But he can't have both."
"What Republicans want is simple: We want to cut spending now, we want to cap runaway spending in the future and we want to save our entitlements and our country from bankruptcy. We want to finally get our economy growing again. Sadly, the Democrats' response has been a mystifying call for more stimulus spending and huge tax hikes on American job creators. That's not serious, and it is my hope that the president will take those off the table on Monday so that we can have a serious discussion about our country's economic future."

HEADLINE: Conservative Group Rolls Out Major Ad Campaign

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Crossroads GPS, the conservative independent group, will spend $20 million on a national television advertising campaign focused on jobs and the national debt.

 BODY:
Crossroads GPS, the conservative independent group founded by Karl Rove, will spend $20 million on a national television advertising campaign aimed at framing "the national debate on jobs, the economy and the national debt," a spokesman said.
The organization will spend $5 million on a television ad that will run on broadcast stations and cable outlets in 10 states starting Monday. In the ad, titled "Shovel Ready," the group criticizes President Obama's management of the economy. 
"These are the facts about the Obama record," the ad says. "Unemployment up 25 percent. The national debt up 35 percent. The price of gas up 104 percent."
The ad closes with an announcer saying: "14 million out of work. America drowning in debt. It's time to take away Obama's blank check." The screen shows the words: "Tell Congress: No More Blank Checks."
Jonathan Collegio, a spokesman for the group, said the ad would run for two weeks in key states including Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, New Mexico, Nevada, and Virginia. The organization, a nonprofit, is required to spend more than 50 percent of its money each year on issue ads that do not directly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate.
But such groups are allowed make sweeping arguments about issues. Steven Law, president of the group, said in a statement that "President Obama may have inherited a recession, but his policies have made things worse for everyday Americans by running up the debt and causing economic uncertainty."
Mr. Collegio did not disclose how the group intended to spend the remaining $15 million, but said plans call for the money to be dispersed during the next two months, making it one of the largest political ad campaigns of the year.

HEADLINE: Economic Doldrums Look Persistent, Bloomberg Says

BYLINE: JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ


HIGHLIGHT: During his weekly radio appearance, the mayor said the slow economy would mean steep reductions in governmental services in New York City and beyond for several years to come.

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg on Friday said the national economy showed "no signs of really improving," and he criticized federal officials for failing to come together to address it.
Mr. Bloomberg, during his weekly appearance on WOR-AM (710), said the slow economy would mean steep reductions in governmental services in New York City and beyond for several years to come.
"This country is not pulling together," he said. "There is a real possibility of the economy getting worse and not better." 
On Thursday, budget negotiations in Washington broke down as Congressional Republicans vowed to resist a push by Democrats for new tax revenue. 
In New York, budget talks have also stalled, with Mr. Bloomberg and union leaders unable to agree on the details of a financial rescue package to avert layoffs of thousands of teachers. The plan would involve moving money from a health care reserve fund, overseen by the city and the unions, into the city budget.
On Friday, Mr. Bloomberg said he was optimistic that a budget would be passed by the City Council before the start of the fiscal year on July 1, but he compared the task of winning over union leaders to "herding cats." 
"They have asked for some things that we could just not possibly agree to," Mr. Bloomberg said.
Mr. Bloomberg seemed unbothered by the scores of protesters who have descended on City Hall to protest his budget cuts, saying many of them were city workers who simply wanted to hold on to their jobs. 
"They yell and scream," he said. "They try to vilify any elected official who faces reality."

HEADLINE: Brooklyn Museum Names New Chairman

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
The Brooklyn Museum announced Thursday that it had elected a new chairman, John S. Tamagni, an investment banker who has served on the board for more than 30 years. He will succeed Norman M. Feinberg, who has led the museum's board since 2006. 
Born and raised in Brooklyn, Mr. Tamagni, is also a trustee of the Orchestra of St. Luke's and an overseer of the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College, where he is an alumnus. He takes over at a time when the museum continues to contend with the lingering effects of the economic downturn; citing a lack of money, it recently canceled plans to mount a New York version of ''Art in the Streets,'' a show of graffiti and street art now under way at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: If It's Players vs. Owners, What About Fans?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN. 
E-mail: wcr@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The N.B.A. got younger this week; what remains to been seen is whether the league got any wiser.
On Thursday, dozens of N.B.A. players met in New York with Billy Hunter, the executive director of their union, then addressed reporters in a calculated show of strength.
A few hours later in Newark, incoming N.B.A. rookies celebrated the happiest day of their lives as they walked across a stage to shake hands with smiling, affable David Stern, the N.B.A. commissioner. 
As the veterans spoke somberly on a rain-swept afternoon in Manhattan and young players gushed in Newark, Ron Artest, the Lakers' unpredictable forward, announced in Los Angeles that he was planning a name change -- to Metta World Peace.
And players wonder why the public is hard pressed to take their so-called plight seriously.
Earlier this month, the N.B.A. was bathed in light and good will. The league had completed one of its most successful seasons and celebrated one of its most compelling finals as Dallas defeated Miami in six games.
Two weeks later, well-compensated players and billionaire owners are locked in a dispute primarily over money at a time when much of the nation is suffocating with debt and unemployment. Hope, for many, is in short supply, and two primary outlets for diversion -- the N.F.L. and the N.B.A. -- are either shut down or about to be.
The N.F.L. players have been locked out for more than 100 days, and N.B.A. players may not be far behind. On Friday, dozens of them attended the latest bargaining session in Manhattan while wearing identical gray T-shirts that proclaimed ''Stand.'' It looked impressive, but there was no apparent progress during the talks between the two sides with just a week to go before the current labor deal expires.
Professional athletes are often puzzled by the general public's attitude toward them when they become embroiled in labor disputes with team owners. That attitude seems to range from apathy to contempt; few seem to identify with the players at all.
Hunter tried to make the case this week that union workers are union workers, and that they face the same assault from management whether they are well-paid athletes or not.
''It's part of the overall climate that one sees around the country,'' Hunter said. ''True, our players may earn a few more dollars than the average person, but they're still confronted by the same issues.''
Hunter has a point, although we're talking more than a few dollars here. The average N.B.A. salary dwarfs an average worker's. But the disparity in compensation may not be the only reason fans don't identify with players when labor disputes arise. Fans thrive on passion and hard-fought competition. Labor negotiations, while certainly heated, are, at their essence, a day at the office.
Players can have all the shows of unity they want. T-shirts and otherwise. Removed from stadiums and arenas, the magic wears off, and their battle over a labor contract is far less compelling. Sports leagues manufacture fantasy and escape, unscripted interactive drama. Labor negotiations offer none of that for a fan looking to take a timeout from the rest of his life.
On Wednesday, Hunter was asked if he trusted Stern. He used a boxing analogy to make the point that the bargaining was not personal.
''The atmosphere within the room, there's not a lot of acrimony,'' he said. ''We're polite, we laugh, and we shake hands and pat each other on the back.
''That's how it is,'' he added. ''It's not about whether we like, dislike, trust, don't trust.''
But therein lies a fundamental disconnect. For fans, everything is personal, and not necessarily rational. You don't mess with people's joy, and that's what postponing a season would do.
From the wealthiest to the poorest, fans lose themselves in stadiums and arenas. When the games are over, players step out of their in-game character, but fans continue to rejoice or smolder as they take these wins and losses to heart.
This is the phenomenon that LeBron James clumsily, but perceptively, touched on in his remarks after Game 6 of the N.B.A. finals, when he said that no matter how much fans hated him, they'd have to go back to living their lives when the games were over, when the day was done.
Professional sports are a gift for those who can play and a refuge for many of those who cannot. From the draft to the regular season to the playoff finals, the promise of a dream is what keeps fans coming back for more. The public squabbling between players and owners over money pushes fans away.
On Thursday, the N.B.A. received its annual infusion of youth; what players and owners need now is an infusion of wisdom.
In addition to exchanging intricate formulas for sharing revenue, the two sides had better find a way to prevent the good will they've re-established from being destroyed, perhaps for good.

HEADLINE: Deal Will Avert Plan to Lay Off City Teachers

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS; Javier C. Hernandez contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The threatened layoffs of 4,100 teachers in New York's public schools were averted under a deal that the Bloomberg administration, the City Council and the teachers' union reached on Friday night. 
Details were still being worked out, but the agreement calls for concessions from the United Federation of Teachers and money from the Council.
Under the deal, the union would agree to suspend teacher sabbaticals for a year and permit teachers without a permanent assignment to be used more regularly as classroom substitutes. In addition, the Bloomberg administration would concede that 2,600 teachers would be lost to attrition, 600 more than estimated, saving additional jobs. On one hand, the resolution spares Mr. Bloomberg from becoming the first mayor in nearly 40 years to impose mass teacher layoffs. On the other hand, though, it threatens to undermine his credibility, given that he has declared for two consecutive years that layoffs were inevitable, only to see them averted in a budget deal.
The budget plan also allows the Council to keep open 20 fire companies that the mayor had ordered closed, and it may be able to restore at least some of the cuts he planned for day care services and librarians.
Still, it appeared that up to 1,000 city workers -- many of them in health care jobs -- would be laid off.
In a news conference at the Education Department headquarters in Lower Manhattan on Friday night, Mr. Bloomberg said he was disappointed he could not avoid all layoffs. Still, he said, ''this is a budget that will keep our city strong, but it is also a budget that faces fiscal reality.''
Asked whether he thought his credibility had been hurt, the mayor defended his approach, saying the city faced extremely bleak and unpredictable economic circumstances.
The City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, standing by the mayor's side, praised the deal. ''New Yorkers can rest easy tonight knowing that our children will still have great teachers,'' she said.
Mr. Bloomberg had taken an aggressive posture during the negotiations, emboldened over the past days by the victories scored in Albany and Trenton against public-sector unions and becoming more emphatic about his demands. But in the end, he and the teachers' union, one of his most vociferous opponents, had to reach an agreement, helping to balance a $66 billion budget that had a $4.6 billion gap.
A different rescue proposal fell apart on Thursday, after the city rejected an offer from the Municipal Labor Committee, a group representing roughly 100 municipal unions, for $262 million to be taken from a health care reserve fund they jointly manage. By then, Ms. Quinn and the teachers' union president, Michael Mulgrew, had been secretly meeting for days.
Once the other deal collapsed, talks between Ms. Quinn and Mr. Mulgrew moved into overdrive.
On Friday morning, officials of the city's Education Department made their way to the union's headquarters to determine what would and would not be on the table. By late afternoon, the two sides had come to an agreement.
Ms. Quinn, meanwhile, worked to sell the plan to Mr. Bloomberg, emerging as the crucial figure in the process.
The budget must be approved by the full Council by Thursday.

HEADLINE: All of His Crops Flourished. Too Bad They Were in a Park.

BYLINE: By MATT FLEGENHEIMER

 BODY:
If they squint, neighbors say, the farm tilled by David Abreu begins to look a little like home -- his cilantro is as green, his bean supply as tidy. And then there is the man himself: clutching his machete handle, pant legs stained black, surveying the soil like any farmer who takes pride in his land. ''He could be my father,'' said one neighbor, Jose Rodriguez, 52, originally from Santiago, Dominican Republic.
But Mr. Abreu is not home, and his farm, alas, is on public property -- namely Highbridge Park in Upper Manhattan. 
Or rather, it was.
In a city that is thinking more and more about being green, Mr. Abreu, 65, is one of a small number of immigrant gardeners who have plunged their shovels into what little surface soil there is. For about three years, Mr. Abreu says, his vegetable garden has thrived behind a playground on two plots near 193rd Street and St. Nicholas Avenue in Washington Heights.
Last week, a parks department crew uprooted Mr. Abreu's crops, piling the leafy detritus in the back of a green garbage truck. A district supervisor, according to William T. Castro, the Manhattan borough commissioner for parks, stumbled upon the garden about three weeks ago. ''It's an illegal farm,'' Mr. Castro said. ''Most people have common sense and know you don't plant your own vegetable garden in a public park.''
Though Mr. Abreu has tended roughly a half-acre of land, it represents a small fraction of the soil lined with beans, corn and, occasionally, tomatoes, that has been tilled in Highbridge Park by area residents. When a visitor stopped by several times in recent days, however, the other farmers were nowhere to be found.
The parks department is aware of the additional gardens, Mr. Castro said -- and some of Mr. Abreu's less visible beans and cilantro were spared. Park employees may soon remove what is left, Mr. Castro added.
''I don't see the problem,'' Mr. Abreu said through an interpreter. ''I clean it. I take care of it.''
Before digging up Mr. Abreu's plots, parks department officials informed Ydanis Rodriguez, the local councilman, that years of herbicide spraying in the area had exposed the soil to contamination, the councilman said. But the soil has never been tested, Mr. Castro said, and the absence of a permit, not health concerns, was the primary reason the crops were torn out.
Mr. Abreu insisted neither he nor any friends or family members had ever gotten sick from eating the crops.
''Try it,'' Mr. Abreu suggested Monday, raising a fistful of cilantro. Mr. Abreu, like many in the neighborhood, immigrated from the Dominican Republic. Both Mr. Abreu and Councilman Rodriguez were raised on family farms, they say, in Santo Domingo and Santiago, respectively. Like many in the community, they have come to see the local gardens as extensions of their former homes.
''Look how beautiful this is,'' said Councilman Rodriguez, swatting away a tree limb as he cradled a bean pod. ''It brings me back.''
Before the loss of his plants, Mr. Abreu spent as many as six hours a day looking after his plots. He and the other farmers share their crops with one another, Mr. Abreu said, and often offer some of their harvests to community members who request a taste. While he describes his motivation as ''somewhat economic,'' Mr. Abreu says his main interest is sustaining a lifelong hobby. His fight with the city was first reported on the Web site, DNA.info.
Dragging his leather satchel of tools down Fort George Avenue, grinning through his wrinkles, Mr. Abreu is known endearingly in the neighborhood as el viejo: the old man.
''Agriculture is the main thing in our culture,'' Jose Rodriguez said, shouting over a fiercely argued game of dominoes outside the park. ''I can bring my little girls to come water the plants. At school, they learn American history. But this is their background, their culture.''
Parks department employees who pulled up the crops last week noted the precision with which the plot was arranged. ''It was all lined up, very neat, one row after another,'' said one of the workers, Clifford Motley.
The councilman's office said it had arranged a meeting between Mr. Abreu and parks department officials, and hoped the sides would meet soon to discuss alternative farming sites.
''If he had come to us, we would have found a location for him that made sense,'' Mr. Castro said. ''We have hundreds of free community gardens exactly for this purpose.''
According to Mr. Castro, members of his staff last year confronted a man they believe may have been Mr. Abreu about his garden.
Mr. Abreu says a park employee did approach him last year, but only to request he remove the wooden fence he had built around his beans. When he first decided to plant seeds three years ago, he said, he told a department official of his plans.
''All they told me was I couldn't cut down any trees.''
Since the uprooting, Mr. Abreu said, he has lost the desire to keep his regular farming hours, though he does maintain another garden in the courtyard of his apartment building, across the street from Highbridge Park.
The circumstances have also produced consequences on the home front with his wife, Irene.
''She loves it when I garden,'' Mr. Abreu said, holstering his machete. ''It keeps me out of the house.''

HEADLINE: In N.B.A. Talks, a Show Of Unity on Players' Shirts

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK

 BODY:
Two dozen men, all taller than average, dressed in matching gray T-shirts, filed out of a Midtown Manhattan hotel and into a waiting bus on Friday afternoon, their message conveyed in their uniformity.
With six days left to strike a deal and avoid a costly shutdown, N.B.A. players attended the latest collective bargaining session en masse, wearing shirts that proclaimed, in large letters, ''Stand.'' They left after four hours without a deal, but with some hope that the show of solidarity had an impact.
Yet there was no movement on the economic issues that divided owners and players, and no indication that they could bridge the gap before the current labor deal expires next Thursday. 
Owners are meeting Tuesday in Dallas to discuss a range of issues and could move to authorize a lockout then. Bargaining talks are scheduled to resume Wednesday or Thursday in Manhattan.
''We think we'll have one more shot at it,'' said Billy Hunter, the executive director of the players union, adding that the parties would know then ''whether there's a chance to make a deal or whether there isn't.''
Both sides struck a civil tone on Friday, after a tense week in which Commissioner David Stern angered the union by divulging details of the N.B.A.'s proposal and Hunter accused owners of trying to ''break the union.''
Stern said everyone agreed to refrain from discussing publicly the substance of Friday's talks, although he defended his earlier decision to publicize the league's latest proposal, which included a so-called ''flex cap'' and $2 billion in annual salaries for players.
''I thought it was appropriate, as the time in negotiations wound down, to sort of say after the last meeting what the position of the parties were,'' Stern said.
That decision sparked two straight days of criticism from the players, with Derek Fisher, the union president, accusing the owners of arrogance in their bargaining position.
On Friday, Stern repeatedly stopped himself midsentence to avoid saying too much, conceding that there was ''a sense on both sides that rhetoric is not helpful, if it's incendiary; and we're not interested in incendiary rhetoric on either side.''
The players offered Tuesday to accept a $500 million pay reduction over the next five years, a proposal that Stern dismissed as ''modest.'' The owners are pushing for cuts, according to union estimates, of more than $8 billion over 10 years.
No new proposals were offered by either side Friday, making the session more of a discussion than a negotiation. One player who attended, the Phoenix Suns' Jared Dudley, said that Stern was ''a little disappointed'' that the union did not make a new offer. ''I think the same thing goes for the players' side,'' Dudley said.
Union officials continue to believe that the owners will vote to authorize a lockout at Tuesday's meeting. Neither Stern nor Adam Silver, the deputy commissioner, would specifically address that issue. However, league officials indicated that a lockout authorization, if needed, could be done anytime via electronic voting.
''It's not about the formality of a meeting,'' Stern said.
Asked if there was enough progress to justify delaying the lockout and continuing negotiations past July 1, Stern said: ''I'm not going to comment on that. I don't want to prejudge anything. I just would say the one thing that I will divulge is that we're ready to negotiate over everything.''
Player representatives from all 30 teams attended Friday's session, along with the union's executive board and a handful of other players who were in town. The roster included Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett of the Boston Celtics, Andre Iguodala of the Philadelphia 76ers, Richard Jefferson of the San Antonio Spurs and Jason Terry of the Dallas Mavericks, who won the championship last week.
Most of them wore the ''Stand'' T-shirt, which had been designed for the union's annual meeting. The idea to wear the shirts to the bargaining session came from Pierce and Garnett.
''Just basically being united, staying together,'' Dudley explained.
Pierce and Garnett were the biggest stars in the room Friday, and Pierce was among the most vocal players in the meeting. Fisher said it was important for players to hear the owners' proposals for themselves -- and for the owners to hear the players' arguments for retaining the current soft-salary cap system.
''We, just by bringing a large group of guys, want to express to our owners and to everyone that our players do understand the issue,'' Fisher said.
Stern praised the players for their participation, saying, ''We were hoping that more players would come, and we were actually cheered by the fact that they were there.''
And the T-shirts? ''They were nicely done,'' he said.

HEADLINE: German E.Coli Sickens 8 in France

BYLINE: By SCOTT SAYARE and WILLIAM NEUMAN; Scott Sayare reported from Paris, and William Neuman from New York.

 BODY:
PARIS -- The deadly German E. coli strain that killed at least 45 people has resurfaced in France, where officials said a cluster of eight people have fallen ill, apparently from eating contaminated sprouts grown in France.
Sprouts were also identified as the source of the German outbreak. French officials have not yet determined if the two episodes are connected.
But public health experts in the United States said the new outbreak raised concerns that contaminated seeds from a common supplier might be the ultimate source of the E. coli bacteria. If those seeds are still in circulation, other outbreaks could occur. 
The French health authorities said that seven of those who had become sick attended a charity event at a children's play center in Begles, a suburb of Bordeaux, on June 8. Most of the people who became ill recalled eating gazpacho garnished with sprouts.
French investigators traced the sprouts served at the event to seeds bought at a garden store chain, Jardiland, according to a news release from Frederic Lefebvre, a secretary of state attached to the economy ministry.
Mr. Lefebvre said the seeds were supplied by a British company, Thompson & Morgan. Although the link between the seeds and the illness had not been definitively established, he called on French retailers to pull the company's seeds for fenugreek, mustard and arugula from shelves.
Efforts to contact Thompson & Morgan on Friday were not successful. The company also distributes seeds in the United States. The German outbreak began in early May and has sickened more than 3,800 people, nearly 900 of them with a serious complication involving acute kidney failure. Nearly all the cases involved people who lived or had traveled in Germany.
German authorities have blamed the outbreak on bean sprouts grown by a German commercial sprouter, which shut down on June 5. American health experts said the French outbreak was worrisome because it suggested that the ultimate source of the deadly bacteria -- a rare and highly virulent E. coli strain known as O104:H4 -- had not been found and contained.
''If there's no linear connection from the first outbreak, then the simplest and the most ominous explanation is there's an upstream source and that's very concerning because that stuff could still be being distributed,'' said Dr. Phillip Tarr, a professor of microbiology at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.
Dr. Tarr said it was still too early to draw firm conclusions about the cause of the latest round of illnesses. He said it was possible, although unlikely, that someone sickened in the earlier outbreak had prepared food served at the event in France and so passed on the infection.
''Traceback here is absolutely critical because that killer organism could be sitting around viable and not contained,'' he said.
William E. Keene, a senior epidemiologist at the Oregon Public Health Division, said it was urgent to find out if the seeds used by the German grower had come from the same source as the seeds linked to the French cases.
At least five of the French cases involved kidney failure, and tests on two of those people showed they were infected with the O104:H4 strain. The eight people infected in the Begles area were adults, age 31 to 78. In addition, two children were sickened in another town and they were presumed also to have E. coli infections, although it was not clear if they had the same strain.

HEADLINE: Equities Skid Again on European Debt Fears

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Stocks retreated on Friday, sending the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lower for a third consecutive day, as concern about the European debt crisis intensified and Oracle dragged down technology shares. 
Technology companies in the S.& P. 500 fell 1.8 percent as a group. Oracle, the largest maker of database software, sank 4.1 percent after reporting lower hardware sales on Thursday. Micron Technology, a maker of computer-memory chips, tumbled 14 percent after reporting sales and profit that missed estimates. Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase slumped at least 1.5 percent, following losses in European lenders.
The S.& P. 500 fell 15.05 points, or 1.17 percent, to 1,268.45, extending its decline in June to 5.7 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 115.42 points, or 0.96 percent, to 11,934.58. The Nasdaq composite index fell 33.86 points, or 1.26 percent, to 2,652.89.
''The market has been in a correction mode for the month of June,'' said Timothy Ghriskey, chief investment officer at the Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, N.Y. ''The focus really has been on the European debt crisis, on Greece and on the potential for contagion.''
The S.& P. 500 has retreated 7 percent from this year's high at the end of April amid weaker-than-estimated economic data and concern about Europe's debt crisis. The index is still up 0.9 percent in 2011 on government stimulus measures and better-than-expected earnings.
Stocks fell as banks dragged on Europe's benchmark index after Moody's Investors Service said it might downgrade 13 Italian lenders because they would be vulnerable to a cut in the government's credit rating. The euro dropped for a third day and bond yields rose in Spain and Italy.
Declines in the financial and technology companies overshadowed faster-than-forecast growth in durable goods orders in the United States and a pledge by European leaders to support Greece if the nation approved austerity measures.
Equity futures rose earlier after the Commerce Department said orders for durable goods, or equipment meant to last at least three years, rose 1.9 percent, beating the median forecast of 1.5 percent. Demand for nonmilitary capital equipment also beat expectations after revised April readings showed a smaller decline than previously reported.
A gauge of technology companies in the S.& P. 500 dropped 1.8 percent as most of its components retreated.
Oracle, which bought Sun Microsystems to capitalize on demand for the servers and databases used in data centers, slumped 4.1 percent to $31.14. While the hardware results may reflect Oracle's effort to pare less profitable machines from its lineup, they were disappointing enough to overshadow better-than-predicted profit and sales of new software licenses.
Micron Technology tumbled 14 percent to $7.21. The price of dynamic random-access memory for personal computers fell as supplies increased and demand from makers of consumer laptops and desktop PCs remained sluggish, the company said.
Bank of America retreated 1.8 percent to $10.52. JPMorgan declined 1.5 percent to $39.49.
Interest rates fell. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 12/32 to 102 6/32, and the yield fell to 2.87 percent from 2.91 percent late Thursday.

HEADLINE: Picking the Brains of the Super-Rich, and Picking Up Tips

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
THIS week, I received five different surveys and analyses purporting to offer insights into the thinking of the rich, the really rich and the super-rich. And those were on top of the dozen or so others so far this year.
The most startling statistic came from the World Wealth Report, the granddaddy of analyses of the rich, conducted by Capgemini and Merrill Lynch. In 2010, the report estimated, a mere 103,000 people of the nearly seven billion people on the planet controlled 36.1 percent of the world's wealth. (This was up from 35.5 percent in 2009.) North America, the report went on, had the largest number of so-called ultrahigh-net-worth individuals, with 40,000 people worth more than $30 million.
But not all the reports were this revelatory -- or scientific. One study, from an online ''dating marketplace,'' rated cities based on how generous men were in paying for first dates. Denver ranked first for expensive nights out, Cincinnati last.
Then there was the report from Barclays Wealth that found that many high-net-worth individuals wished they had more self-control over their finances. 
All of this time and money being put to surveying the rich, particularly at a time when most people are feeling anything but wealthy, prompted me to wonder about the value of this information. Can anything be gleaned from the reports for everyone else? Or are they, at best, sources of trivia? So I sifted through them to see what I could find. Here are some of the highlights.
THE FUN STUFF The World Wealth Report, released Wednesday, found that last year was not just a good year for the really wealthy. It was also a good year for the merely rich. The number of people with more than $1 million to invest was 10.9 million, up 8.3 percent, while the amount of money they had, $42.7 trillion, had risen by 9.7 percent. (The wealth of this group excludes the value of their primary residences, collectible items and consumable goods.)
''The wealth is growing around the world, but it doesn't seem that way,'' said John W. Thiel, head of United States wealth management and the private banking and investment group at Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management.
One consensus is not surprising -- that Asians continue to gain on the rest of the world. A report released in May by the Boston Consulting Group said that the United States still led the world in the number of families worth more than $100 million, 2,692. But it said that China experienced the fastest growth rate, with a one-year jump of 30 percent, to 393 families.
The Merrill report noted that the number of high-net-worth people in Asia, 3.3 million, surpassed the number in Europe, 3.1 million, for the first time. China ranks fourth behind the United States, Japan and Germany for the number of high-net-worth citizens.
PricewaterhouseCoopers's Global Private Banking and Wealth Management Survey of people who work at wealth management firms, which came out this week as well, predicted that fees from managing money in Asia would grow by about 18 percent in 2011, as against a growth rate of 6 percent in the Americas.
While most reports are pointing to the growing wealth in China, an analysis from Deloitte noted that South Korea was set to join the top 10 list of countries with the most wealthy people by 2020.
ADVICE FOR EVERYONE ELSE These reports also offered some practical insight for those who are not super-rich.
For one thing, the wealthiest people around the world put more money into equities last year and plan to continue to do so. The World Wealth Report said the wealthy increased their percentage in equities in 2010 to 33 percent, from 29 percent, and the report expected them to increase that to 38 percent by 2012.
The Boston Consulting Group report said people in North America had the highest percentage of their wealth in equities, with 44 percent, up from 41 percent in 2009.
Regardless of what they were investing in, the wealthiest indicated that they were spreading their investments around the world to reduce the risk from political, economic and financial uncertainty. The Institute for Private Investors' Family Performance Tracking survey, which looks at how its members invest, said the wealthiest people had at least a third of their portfolios outside their home countries. One in five had 50 percent of their money invested internationally.
The wealthy in Latin America had the least amount of their money tied up in their own region, according to the World Wealth Report. Those in North America had the most.
But identifying that safe place is more difficult. The rich generally agreed that they were concerned about the American economy and the potential for political and economic unrest elsewhere.
A study due for release next month from Zogby and Insite Security of people with more than $3 million found that most had a negative view of the global economy and many were worried that the United States would not be able to improve its fiscal situation anytime soon.
And the World Wealth Report found that wealthy Asians were the only ones confident in investing in their own region. The report estimated that Asians would maintain the current percentage of their money invested in the region in 2012, while the wealthy in Europe, North America and Latin America indicated that they planned to reduce their allocations to their own regions.
While there is little that anyone can do about the state of the world, the wealthiest are asking more from their financial advisers, and that is something anyone can emulate.
The PricewaterhouseCoopers analysis found that most investors had less trust and were less loyal to their advisers and were demanding more service than they were a couple of years ago.
''Two years ago, I would have said people would take performance over less than stellar service as long as they're getting a good return,'' said Steven Crosby, the Americas leader for PricewaterhouseCoopers's private banking and wealth management leadership team. ''Now it's, 'I want quality service or I'm leaving.' ''
But the World Wealth Report (remember that Merrill Lynch is one of its sponsors) said that advisers had regained client trust. And now is the time, it said, to sell those clients on other products and services that large financial services firms offer, like unique investments through an investment bank and preferred financing for entrepreneurs.
U.S. Trust, meanwhile, which like Merrill Lynch is part of Bank of America, found that many people with at least $3 million had not given any real thought to leaving an inheritance to their children. More worryingly, hardly any entrepreneurs said they had a succession plan in place for their businesses.
That said, Barclays found that the United States ranked fifth out of 20 countries in how satisfied its people were about their financial plans.
Contradictions are inevitable in these various analyses. And all of this attention to the thoughts and strategies of the very rich may seem to be a bit much to some readers. The rich are still getting richer, while everyone else is not. But knowing how the very rich think about their investments and diversification in an uncertain world can be useful to everyone else. Or it could provide some cocktail party tidbits.

HEADLINE: 'Safety Myth' Left Japan Ripe for Nuclear Crisis

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI; Kantaro Suzuki contributed reporting.

 BODY:
SHIKA, Japan -- Near a nuclear power plant facing the Sea of Japan, a series of exhibitions in a large public relations building here extols the virtues of the energy source with some help from ''Alice in Wonderland.''
''It's terrible, just terrible,'' the White Rabbit says in the first exhibit. ''We're running out of energy, Alice.''
A Dodo robot figure, swiveling to address Alice and the visitors to the building, declares that there is an ''ace'' form of energy called nuclear power. It is clean, safe and renewable if you reprocess uranium and plutonium, the Dodo says.
''Wow, you can even do that!'' Alice says of nuclear power. ''You could say that it's optimal for resource-poor Japan!'' 
Over several decades, Japan's nuclear establishment has devoted vast resources to persuade the Japanese public of the safety and necessity of nuclear power. Plant operators built lavish, fantasy-filled public relations buildings that became tourist attractions. Bureaucrats spun elaborate advertising campaigns through a multitude of organizations established solely to advertise the safety of nuclear plants. Politicians pushed through the adoption of government-mandated school textbooks with friendly views of nuclear power.
The result was the widespread adoption of the belief -- called the ''safety myth'' -- that Japan's nuclear power plants were absolutely safe. Japan single-mindedly pursued nuclear power even as Western nations distanced themselves from it.
The belief helps explains why in the only nation to have been attacked with atomic bombs, the Japanese acceptance of nuclear power was so strong that the accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl barely registered. Even with the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, the reaction against nuclear power has been much stronger in Europe and the United States than in Japan itself.
As the Japanese continue to search for answers to the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, some are digging deep into the national psyche and examining a national propensity to embrace a belief now widely seen as irrational. Because of this widespread belief in Japanese plants' absolute safety, plant operators and nuclear regulators failed to adopt proper safety measures and advances in technology, like emergency robots, experts and government officials acknowledge.
''In Japan, we have something called the 'safety myth,' '' Banri Kaieda, who runs the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, which oversees the nuclear industry, said at a news conference at an International Atomic Energy Agency meeting in Vienna on Monday. ''It's a fact that there was an unreasonable overconfidence in the technology of Japan's nuclear power generation.''
As a result, he said, the nuclear industry's ''thinking about safety had a poor foundation.''
Japan's government has concentrated its propaganda and educational efforts on creating such national beliefs in the past, most notably during World War II. The push for nuclear power underpinned postwar Japan's focus on economic growth and its dream of greater energy independence. But as the carefully fostered belief in nuclear safety has dissipated in the three months after the March 11 disaster, Japanese are increasingly blaming the nuclear establishment for Fukushima. In a politically apathetic country, tens of thousands have regularly held protests against nuclear power. Young Japanese have used social media to organize and publicize demonstrations that have been virtually ignored by major newspapers and television networks.
A song, ''It Was Always a Lie,'' has become an anthem at the protests and a vehicle for Japanese anger on the Internet. Its author, a famous singer named Kazuyoshi Saito, wrote it by changing the lyrics of a love ballad, ''I Always Liked You,'' that he composed last year for a commercial for Shiseido, the cosmetics giant. Mr. Saito's performance of the song, surreptitiously uploaded on YouTube and other sites, has gone viral.
''If you walk across this country, you'll find 54 nuclear reactors/School textbooks and commercials told us they were safe,'' the song goes.
''It was always a lie, it's been exposed after all/It was really a lie that nuclear power is safe.''
Caught Unprepared
In the days after a giant tsunami knocked out Fukushima Daiichi's cooling system, the prime minister's office and the Tokyo Electric Power Company, or Tepco, the plant's operator, wrestled over whether to inject cooling seawater into the reactor buildings to prevent catastrophic meltdowns, and then over how to do it.
With radiation levels too high for workers to approach the reactors, the Japanese authorities floundered. They sent police trucks mounted with water cannons -- equipment designed to disperse rioters -- to spray water into the reactor buildings. Military helicopters flew over the buildings, dropping water that was scattered off course by strong winds, in a ''performance, a kind of circus'' that was aimed more at reassuring an increasingly alarmed Japanese population and American government, said Kenichi Matsumoto, an aide to Prime Minister Naoto Kan.
What became clear was that Japan lacked some of the basic hardware to respond to a nuclear crisis and, after initial resistance, had to look abroad for help. For a country proud of its technology, the low point occurred on March 31 when it had to use a 203-foot-long water pump -- shipped from China, an export market for Japanese nuclear technology -- to inject 90 tons of fresh water into the No. 1 reactor building. But perhaps more than anything else, the absence of one particular technology was deeply puzzling: emergency robots.
Japan, after all, is the world's leader in robotics. It has the world's largest force of mechanized workers. Its humanoid robots can walk and run on two feet, sing and dance, and even play the violin. But where were the emergency robots at Fukushima?
The answer is that the operators and nuclear regulators, believing that accidents would never occur, steadfastly opposed the introduction of what they regarded as unnecessary technology.
''The plant operators said that robots, which would premise an accident, were not needed,'' said Hiroyuki Yoshikawa, 77, an engineer and a former president of the University of Tokyo, Japan's most prestigious academic institution. ''Instead, introducing them would inspire fear, they said. That's why they said that robots couldn't be introduced.''
Even before the accident at Three Mile Island in 1979, Mr. Yoshikawa, a robotics expert, and other researchers began building emergency robots capable of responding to a nuclear accident, eventually producing a prototype called Mooty. The robots were resistant to high levels of radiation and capable of surmounting mounds of rubble.
But the robots never made it into production, forcing Japan, in the aftermath of Fukushima, to rely on an emergency shipment of robots from iRobot, a company in Bedford, Mass., more famous for manufacturing the Roomba vacuum. On Friday, Tepco deployed the first Japanese-made robot, which was retrofitted recently to handle nuclear accidents, but workers had to retrieve it after it malfunctioned.
The rejection of robots, Mr. Yoshikawa said, was part of the industry's overall reluctance to improve maintenance and invest in new technologies.
''That's why the safety myth wasn't just an empty slogan,'' said Mr. Yoshikawa, now the director general of the Center for Research and Development Strategy at the Japan Science and Technology Agency. ''It was a kind of mind-set that rejected progress through the introduction of new technology.''
Entering a New Age
The deliberate effort to rally Japanese behind nuclear power can be traced to the beginning of the atomic age, scholars and experts say.
In August 1945, Yasuhiro Nakasone, a young naval officer who would become one of postwar Japan's most powerful prime ministers, was stationed in western Japan.
''I saw the nuclear mushroom cloud over Hiroshima,'' Mr. Nakasone wrote in an essay in the 1960s. ''At that moment, I sensed that the next age was the nuclear age.''
For many Japanese like Mr. Nakasone, nuclear power became a holy grail -- a way for Japan, whose lack of oil and other natural resources had led to World War II and defeat, to become more energy independent. The mastery of nuclear power would also open the possibility of eventually developing nuclear weapons, a subject that Japan secretly studied when Mr. Nakasone was defense minister in 1970.
It was precisely because of nuclear power's possible link to nuclear arms and its close ties to the United States that left-leaning politicians, academics and intellectuals became fierce opponents. As a countermeasure, proponents of nuclear power stressed its absolute safety, so that each side struck extreme positions, a standoff that lasts to this day.
The nuclear establishment -- led by Tepco among the utilities and the Ministry of Economy -- spent hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising and educational programs emphasizing the safety of nuclear plants. The ministry's division responsible for nuclear power has budgeted $12 million this year for those programs, said Takanobu Sugimoto, a division spokesman. Mr. Sugimoto said he ''regretted'' that the ministry might have ''stressed only'' the plants' safety.
The government and the utilities encouraged the creation of many organizations that propagated the message of safety. One of the oldest, the Japan Atomic Energy Relations Organization, receives 40 percent of its financing from two ministries that oversee nuclear power and 60 percent from Japan's plant operators. In addition to producing information promoting nuclear power, the organization sends nuclear power experts to speak at secondary schools and colleges, at no cost.
Mitsuhiro Yokote, 67, the executive managing director of the organization and a former nuclear engineer at the Kansai Electric Power Company, acknowledged that the experts conveyed the message that nuclear plants were absolutely safe. Mr. Yokote said he ''regretted'' that his organization had contributed to the safety myth.
In a country where people tend to reflexively trust the government, assurances about the safety of Japan's plants were enough to reassure even those at greatest risk. In Oma, a fishing town in northern Japan where a plant is currently under construction, Chernobyl made no impression on local residents considering the plant back in the 1980s.
''What could we do but believe what the government told us?'' said Masaru Takahashi, 67, a member of a fishing union in Oma. ''We were told that they were absolutely safe.''
A Public Relations Drive
After Chernobyl, the nuclear establishment made sure that Japanese kept believing in safety.
The plant operators built or renovated the public relations buildings -- called ''P.R. buildings'' -- attached to their plants. Before Chernobyl, the buildings were simple facilities intended to appeal to ''adult men interested in technical matters,'' said Noriya Sumihara, an anthropologist at Tenri University who has researched the facilities. Male guides wearing industrial uniforms took visitors around exhibits consisting mostly of wall panels.
But after Chernobyl, the facilities were transformed into elaborate theme parks geared toward young mothers, the group that research showed was most worried about nuclear plants and radiation, Mr. Sumihara said. Women of childbearing age, whose presence alone was meant to reassure the visitors, were hired as guides.
In Higashidori, a town in northern Japan, one of the country's newest P.R. buildings is built on the theme of Tonttu, a forest with resident dwarfs. The buildings also holds events with anime characters to attract children and young parents, said Yoshiki Oikawa, a spokesman for the Tohoku Electric Power Company, which manages the site with Tepco.
Here in Shika, more than 100,000 guests last year visited the P.R. building where Alice discovers the wonders of nuclear power. The Caterpillar reassures Alice about radiation and the Cheshire Cat helps her learn about the energy source. Instead of going down a rabbit hole, Alice shrinks after eating a candy and enters a 1:25 scale model of the Shika nuclear plant nearby.
Since the Fukushima disaster, visitors have started questioning the safety of nuclear power, said Asuka Honda, 27, a guide here. Many were pregnant women worried about the effects of radiation on their unborn children. But the presence of Ms. Honda and other guides, mostly women in their late 20s, seemed to reassure them.
The nuclear establishment also made sure that government-mandated school textbooks underemphasized information that could cast doubt on the safety of nuclear power. In Parliament, the campaign was led by Tokio Kano, a Tepco vice president who became a lawmaker in 1998. Mr. Kano, who declined to be interviewed for this article, returned to Tepco as an adviser after retiring from Parliament last year.
In 2004, under the influence of Mr. Kano and other proponents of nuclear power, education officials ordered revisions to textbooks before endorsing them. In one junior high school social studies textbook, a reference to the growing antinuclear movement in Europe was deleted. In another, a reference to Chernobyl was relegated to a footnote.
The effect could be seen in opinion polls that even after Fukushima have indicated that young Japanese are the strongest proponents of nuclear power.
The nuclear establishment itself came to believe its own safety myth and ''became entangled in its own net,'' said Hitoshi Yoshioka, an author of a book on the history of Japan's nuclear power and a member of a panel established by the prime minister to investigate the causes of the Fukushima disaster.
He said that helped explain why, at Fukushima, Tepco failed to carry out emergency measures in case of a complete loss of power, which is what happened when the tsunami hit in March. Others have said that the nuclear establishment's embrace of the safety myth also makes it possible to understand what, in hindsight, was the most glaring hole in the safety measures at Japan's nuclear plants. In the country that gave the world the word tsunami, few measures were taken at Fukushima Daiichi or elsewhere to protect plants against the giant waves. Neither the Dodo nor the Caterpillar makes any mention of tsunamis to Alice.

HEADLINE: Worsening Debt in Europe Is Called Major Threat to British Banks

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER. 
Floyd Norris, whose Off the Charts column normally appears on this page, is on vacation.

 BODY:
LONDON -- The Bank of England governor, Mervyn A. King, said on Friday that the worsening debt crisis in Greece and other European countries was the biggest threat to Britain's financial system.
Mr. King urged British banks to be especially diligent and clear in disclosing their exposure to European sovereign debt, to avoid a collapse of confidence among investors. He also called on banks to set aside more capital when earnings were strong instead of distributing it to shareholders or employees.
''The most serious and immediate risk to the U.K. financial system stems from the worsening sovereign debt crisis in several euro area countries,'' Mr. King said during a briefing on financial stability by the interim Financial Policy Committee, of which he is chairman. 
The new committee, which includes executives from the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority, is a result of Prime Minister David Cameron's revamp of the country's financial regulation after the banking crisis.
Mr. King's comments came as European Union leaders met in Brussels to discuss a second bailout for Greece and ways to stabilize the euro zone area. Greece has until the end of the month to meet conditions for its next aid payment of 12 billion euros, or $17 billion, ahead of a finance ministers' meeting on July 3.
Some investors remain concerned that the Greek prime minister, George A. Papandreou, could struggle to gather enough support to push through the necessary budget cuts, which has pushed down the euro and weighed on European stock markets. Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, warned earlier this week that the sovereign debt crisis posed a serious threat to the financial stability of Europe.
The Financial Policy Committee warned that ''any escalation of stresses could also be transmitted via interconnected global markets, including via the United States, leading to a tightening of bank funding conditions.'' It said ''such contagion could be amplified if bank creditors were unsure about the resilience of their counterparties.''
Mr. King said he was less worried about British banks' direct exposure to Greek debt, which he said was ''very small,'' than the chances that a lack of transparency and increased risk awareness could paralyze financial markets.
''If there's uncertainty about exposures and a lack of transparency, there's always the risk that people may feel it's just not worth continuing the rollover funding to institutions,'' Mr. King said. ''Greater clarity about the extent of these exposures would help to limit the transmission of problems to U.K. banks.''
The European Banking Authority said Friday that it had adjusted its stress tests of European banks to better account for potential trading losses on sovereign debt from troubled economies, including Greece. The results are due next month.
''It's necessary that stress tests are credible,'' Mr. King said. The hope is that detailed data on the banks' capital and government debt exposure would calm those investors who fear a Greek default.
The committee also warned that British banks should improve their provisioning for real estate loans that are in arrears or had breached some covenants. The committee implied that some banks were not diligent enough in setting aside money to cover such loans, which were mainly for commercial real estate.
The committee also said it was increasingly mindful of risks linked to exchange-traded funds, which were now worth $300 billion in Europe, and asked the Financial Services Authority to monitor the industry more closely.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Expected to Veto Bill Allowing Schools to Borrow More for Pensions

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
ALBANY -- State lawmakers on Friday approved a bill that would allow school districts to borrow as much as $1 billion without voter approval, but a spokesman for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said the measure would most likely be vetoed. 
Without advance notice and with little debate, the bill won Senate approval late Thursday night, several days after the legislative session had been scheduled to end. The Assembly passed the measure Friday afternoon, and the governor's office then took the unusual step of publicly opposing the legislation moments after its passage, effectively dooming it.
Elizabeth Lynam, deputy research director at the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-backed group that generally favors lower spending, described the bill as one of the worst things the Legislature had done this session.
But supporters said it would give school districts breathing room as pension costs soar. The measure would allow school districts to borrow as much as $1 billion to pay pension and operating costs over the next two years, in the process circumventing existing requirements for public approval of new debt.
The bill would weaken one of the governor's central proposals, to cap property tax increases at 2 percent, by allowing schools to raise money through a debt offering.
The money school districts borrowed would not count against the tax cap, but would have to be paid back by taxpayers in up to 15 years.
The legislation would also change the rules for taking on new debt. Currently, school districts outside of New York City vote on their budgets, including any planned borrowing. The legislation would allow that requirement to be circumvented.
Assemblyman Peter J. Abbate Jr., a Brooklyn Democrat, said in an interview that he sponsored the bill on behalf of urban school districts. The measure was also strongly backed by the New York State United Teachers union.
''Some of the localities, and the schools boards, are looking for a way, for some help,'' Mr. Abbate said. ''I see nothing wrong.''
And Richard C. Iannuzzi, president of New York State United Teachers, said, ''Obviously, when you take into consideration the cuts in school aid and what seems likely to be a pretty onerous property tax cap, the ability for school districts to deal with expenses in some kind of rational way is important.''
''By smoothing out pension costs, you don't have to deal with the tremendous spikes up and down in the rates that they have to pay,'' he added.
But Assemblyman Michael J. Fitzpatrick, a Long Island Republican, said during the Assembly debate, ''This bill is being passed because the teachers' unions does not want to contribute to the economic well-being of this state.''
''This is an organization that wants unfettered access to every wallet and pocketbook of every taxpayer in this state,'' he added.
Support for the bill was not purely partisan. It was sponsored in the Senate by Martin J. Golden, a Brooklyn Republican, and it was the Republican-led Senate that first approved the bill, demonstrating the influence on both parties that is wielded by the teachers' union in Albany.
The bill had much in common with legislation signed last year by Gov. David A. Paterson that allowed the state and municipalities to borrow billions of dollars to help make required annual payments to the state pension fund.

HEADLINE: Saving Social Security

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Get Radical: Raise Social Security,'' by Thomas Geoghegan (Op-Ed, June 20): 
Based on my research over many years on the need and feasibility of raising Social Security benefits, I agree with Mr. Geoghegan. It is becoming increasingly obvious, because of the failure of employer retirement plans and employee savings plans, that workers are well on the way to facing their retirement years at some level of poverty that will require humiliating dependence on children and welfare.
My own recommendation is that the benefit level be set at 70 percent of pay for the average worker, not 50 percent. There will be adequate resources to finance this level. For example, the public has been misled by the too-conservative actuarial projections of the Social Security actuaries; the program is in much better shape than we have been led to believe.
DAVID LANGER New York, June 20, 2011
The writer is a consulting actuary.
To the Editor:
Thomas Geoghegan approached the topic of Social Security in a way that others have avoided. Excluding even the recommendation to increase Social Security, if we only lift the cap on high earners, the current Social Security program becomes a win-win solution.
Social Security is put right back into the economy; it is not saved, it is spent. It becomes a monthly stimulus, and perhaps it can take some of the pressure off institutions (emergency rooms, food banks and so on) that are turned to when money runs out.
Lifting the cap will keep Social Security moving forward, as was its original intention.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Budget Is Upended As Unions Reject Labor Savings

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME; Robert Davey contributed reporting from Bridgeport, Conn.

 BODY:
HARTFORD -- Connecticut's state workers, in voting results announced on Friday, rejected a deal meant to produce $1.6 billion in labor savings over two years, blowing a gaping hole in the state budget, raising the likelihood of thousands of layoffs and threatening chaos in a state that has largely avoided the rancorous labor issues seen elsewhere.
The rejection was an emphatic slap to both the union leadership and Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, a Democrat who was elected in November with enthusiastic support from labor.
The governor has called the legislature into special session next week to balance the budget, which had been passed under the assumption that union members would approve the deal. Mr. Malloy said Friday that the state would start sending layoff notices almost immediately and that 7,500 or more workers could lose their jobs. 
''I'm sure they will be devastating to the state's economy,'' Mr. Malloy said of the layoffs. ''That's why I fought so robustly to avoid them.''
Some attempt to revive the agreement or seek a revote seemed likely, but the chances of success remained unclear. Union spokesmen said that no revote was being pursued now, but that leaders would meet on Monday to certify the results and discuss how to proceed.
The agreement called for wage freezes for two years, followed by 3 percent annual raises for three years and a guarantee of no layoffs for four years, as well as concessions on pensions and health care.
It had been hailed as a harmonious resolution, in contrast with the strife in states like New Jersey, Ohio and Wisconsin, where legislatures have reduced benefits or curbed bargaining rights in the face of vehement labor protests.
The defeat also came the same week that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo wrung major concessions from New York's largest public employees' union, in a deal that appeared even less generous than Connecticut's, and that also must be ratified by union members.
The results of the voting in Connecticut exasperated and infuriated even longtime allies of state workers.
''The failure to ratify by state employees does more harm to them and the cause of labor than anything their enemies could possibly achieve,'' Donald E. Williams Jr., a Democrat who is president pro tem of the State Senate, wrote colleagues in a message announcing the special session. ''It's unbelievable that they don't understand that.''
But the rejection reflected a complicated whirl of factors, not least of them the approval process itself, in which about 60 percent of workers voted in favor of the agreement only to have it fail.
Under longstanding collective bargaining rules, the agreement needed to be approved by 14 of the 15 unions in the State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition, with the bargaining units voting in favor representing 80 percent of the 45,000 state workers covered by the deal.
What doomed the package was its rejection by two unions -- including, notably, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 4, which covers about one-third of all unionized state employees.
The opposition centered on suspicions about the health care provisions, particularly fears that the deal would eventually place employees in a new state insurance program, called SustiNet. Union and state officials said health care could not be changed again without employee approval until 2022.
It also reflected the beliefs among some members that they could win a better package if they rejected this one and that the layoff threats were more posturing than reality. Mr. Malloy has insisted that there will be no renegotiation and that large-scale layoffs will be swift and certain.
The process reflected the information blizzard of the new media age, with union officials saying misinformation spread by right-wing groups, particularly the Yankee Institute for Public Policy, a conservative research organization, helped to torpedo the agreement. The institute called the claim of meddling ''delusional.''
Michele Higgins, 63, a supervisor in the audit division of the Bridgeport office of the State Labor Department, noted that two years ago, workers agreed to furloughs and to increased payments for health insurance. She voted against the new deal.
''I don't think that it's a bad agreement,'' Ms. Higgins said, ''but a contract has no meaning anymore, because I think the state will be back in two years looking for more.''
Emma Brooks, a 44-year-old state social worker, said employees were being asked to shoulder too much of the burden and were being taken for granted in the process. ''The unions do not really want to hear our thoughts and answer our questions,'' she said. ''They want to skim over the deal and tell us to vote for it.''
Ms. Brooks said she was not concerned about the possibility of losing her job. ''If I do lose my job,'' she said, ''I won't lose my integrity.''
But Fred V. Carstensen, who is a professor of economics at the University of Connecticut, the director of its Connecticut Center for Economic Analysis and a state employee, said workers made a catastrophic mistake, voting down a relatively generous and thoughtful agreement. He said rejection would throw the state into ''a double-dip recession'' and wreck chances of addressing the state's long-term fiscal needs.
''The result will inflict significant damage on taxpayers, ourselves, and the state's economic future,'' he wrote in an essay published Friday in The Hartford Courant.
And Lynne Langella, who works in academic support services at Housatonic Community College in Bridgeport, said she did not like the package but voted for it because the alternative was so much worse.
''I can't imagine having layoff notices go to 7,500 people,'' she said.
Among those with much to lose are Mr. Malloy, who had taken the politically risky step of enacting the largest tax increase in state history as part of what he called a balanced approach, including the concessions, to the state's short-term and long-term budget needs.
Largely because of the tax increases, a Quinnipiac University poll last week showed his approval rating at just 38 percent. The governor has ruled out any further tax increases to balance the state's two-year, $40.1 billion budget.
''We don't understand the system where a majority of workers vote for an outcome, a majority of bargaining units vote for an outcome, and the majority is held up by minority rule,'' said Mayor John DeStefano Jr. of New Haven, who was one of five big-city mayors to meet with the governor on Friday.
''We're counting on people doing the right and the smart thing,'' Mr. DeStefano said, ''not just for themselves but for everybody else.''

HEADLINE: Luxury Brands Following the Wealth to Asia

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Shoppers like Chen Zhuhang and Lin Xing are the reason that Prada, Samsonite and L'Occitane have chosen to stage stock market listings in Hong Kong.
Neither of the two men professed much interest in investing in the Italian luxury fashion house Prada, whose shares began trading amid much fanfare on the Hong Kong stock exchange Friday. But both were out shopping on the luxury-store-studded Canton Road in Hong Kong a few days ago.
''My favorite brands are Prada and Gucci,'' said Mr. Lin, who comes from Fujian Province, on the southeastern coast of China, and was visiting Hong Kong. ''Today, I bought a pair of shoes and a bag for myself from Gucci.''
His friend Mr. Chen was carrying a Gucci shopping bag containing a light brown leather purse that he had bought for his girlfriend for about 9,000 Hong Kong dollars, or $1,155. 
Consumers like these have been flocking to shops all over Asia.
Their spending power and tastes, and their willingness to show off their increasing wealth, are behind a sea change that has taken place in the global luxury industry over the past few years.
With the West struggling with weak economies, Paris, Milan, London and New York are no longer the dominant centers of global luxury spending. Increasingly, that center is shifting eastward, to booming cities like Seoul, Shanghai, Mumbai and Hong Kong, whose glitzy malls now easily rival Bond Street, the Champs Elysees or Fifth Avenue in terms of high-end shopping opportunities.
''We are positive that the Greater China region is going to be one of the most interesting markets for the future of the luxury industry,'' Patrizio Bertelli, the chief executive of Prada, said amid a blizzard of camera flashes and jostling journalists and bankers at a ceremony for the listing of the company in Hong Kong on Friday. ''This is a very important moment for our company, and it's an accomplishment after many years.''
Prada's decision to list in Hong Kong, rather than in Milan, where it has been based for nearly 100 years, is in part the result of a desire to tap into a deep-pocketed group of Asian investors -- funds and wealthy individuals -- who feel more comfortable putting their money in stocks listed here, and not in faraway Europe.
But it also reflects a desire to be closer to an area that is fast gaining significance for the luxury industry as a whole. For some luxury and consumer goods companies, the region now contributes a third or even half of global sales and earnings, a sharp increase from just a decade or two ago.
Many brands have responded with a rapid expansion of their store networks, turning what were once economic and fashion backwaters in China and South-East Asia into high-end shopping havens.
Take LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the biggest luxury group in the world. Last year it generated about 6.9 billion, or $9.7 billion, in revenue in Asia, where it operates more than 800 stores. That compares with 4.6 billion and 570 stores in the United States.
Ermenegildo Zegna, the Italian menswear company, which opened its first shop in Beijing in 1991, has more than 70 stores in Greater China -- mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan -- now Zegna's biggest international market.
Prada has lagged behind others somewhat in terms of expansion in mainland China in recent years. But about half the company's 319 outlets around the world are in the Asia-Pacific region, more than a dozen of them in Hong Kong.
Prada, whose handbags and Miu Miu dresses can set shoppers back more than $1,000, plans to open dozens more, using some of the proceeds from its $2.1 billion stock market debut.
Market nervousness about the protracted debt crisis in Greece and the world's economic growth prospects meant that Prada's debut, and that of the luggage maker Samsonite earlier this month, did not raise as much money as those companies had hoped for.
Prada shares edged up 0.3 percent, closing at 39.6 Hong Kong dollars, or $5.08, on their first trading day Friday. The modest rise contrasts with the drastic jumps in share prices of Internet companies that recently have listed in New York.
Industry watchers believe that recent market nervousness is unlikely to deter other Western luxury and consumer goods companies from following in the footsteps of Prada, Samsonite and the French cosmetics maker L'Occitane, which made its debut in the region last year by seeking listings in Hong Kong.
It will be a handful, rather than a stampede, said Pradeep Rao, head of Asia-Pacific consumer and health care investment banking at Citigroup. ''But long term, there is definitely an appetite from investors here for such companies.''
By far the biggest driver of all this activity is the increasing affluence of emerging Asian economies, which has catapulted millions of people into the ranks of the wealthy.
Traditional luxury markets like the United States, Japan and Europe remain important. But these regions are mature and, for the most part, still recovering only feebly from the blow dealt by the global financial crisis.
In Asia, by contrast, the number of people who can purchase top-of-the-range dresses, shoes or jewels continues to soar.
For example, a study by Merrill Lynch and Cap Gemini, published Thursday, estimated that the population of dollar-millionaires in North America and Europe remained more or less unchanged in recent years, at 3.4 million and 3.1 million, respectively.
In the Asia-Pacific region, the number of millionaires grew from 2.8 million in 2007 to 3.3 million last year and has now overtaken that in Europe. With growth rates like these -- and despite recent worries that China's economic prospects are not as rosy as they once were -- Asia's population of millionaires is likely to top that in North America ''very soon,'' said Wilson So of the Merrill Lynch wealth management division.
The expansion in the 170-billion-a-year luxury goods market has mirrored this trend closely. In 2008, Europe accounted for 38 percent of the global luxury market, according to Bain & Co. That figure slipped to about 37 percent last year.
During the same period, Asia, including Japan, rose from 25 percent in 2008 to 28 percent in 2010. The consulting firm McKinsey estimates that China alone could account for one-fifth of the global luxury market by 2015.
In addition, said Yuval Atsmon, a partner and expert on the luxury industry at McKinsey's Shanghai office, shoppers in China, for example, have become more comfortable treating themselves to luxury goods.
They are on average significantly younger than their counterparts in the West, and they are more prone to make purchasing decisions based on word of mouth.
This means that expanding into Asia is more easily said than done: Western companies cannot simply take the approaches and products they have in their home markets and replicate them in Asia, industry experts caution.
''It's very important for companies to get their stores and service right and not to rush headlong into expansion,'' Mr. Atsmon said.
Still, he said, many Western brands may double the number of stores they have in China in the next few years, in a bid to tap into the country's enormous growth potential.
And a stock market listing, for some, may be an additional way to raise their visibility and to get extra serious about the region.
''China is where the main battleground for the global luxury industry is,'' Mr. Atsmon said. ''The center of gravity is shifting.''
Prada, for one, seems to be getting plenty of uptake already, judging by shoppers like Kevin Chen. Visiting Hong Kong last week, Mr. Chen bought a Prada handbag for a friend's wedding.
He said it was not the first time that he had bought a Prada bag as a wedding gift.
''I've done this many, many times now. My friend in Shenzhen said they would like a Prada bag or maybe some shoes as a wedding gift, so I picked a bag for them.''
Alice Woodhouse contributed reporting.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Public or Private, It's Work

BYLINE: By GARRET KEIZER. 
Garret Keizer is the author, most recently, of ''The Unwanted Sound of Everything We Want: A Book About Noise.''

 BODY:
Sutton, Vt.
AS New Jersey throws its weight behind Wisconsin and Ohio in rolling back the collective bargaining rights of public sector employees, we are once again going to hear the argument that public sector unions ought not to be confused with their private sector counterparts. They're two different animals entirely.
Private sector workers, so the argument goes, have historically organized to win better working conditions and a bigger piece of the pie from profit-making entities like railroads and coal mines. But public sector employees work for ''us,'' the ultimate nonprofit, and therefore are not entitled to the same protections. 
This is a fond notion at best. Yes, public school teachers were never gunned down by Pinkerton guards; municipal firefighters were never housed in company-owned shanties by the side of the tracks. But none of this cancels their rights as organized workers. No ancestor of mine voted to ratify the Constitution, either, but I have the same claim on the Bill of Rights as any Daughter of the American Revolution. Collective bargaining is an inheritance and we are all named in the will.
The two-labors fallacy rests on an even shakier proposition: that profits exist only where there is an accountant to tally them. This is economics reduced to the code of a shoplifter -- whatever the security guard doesn't see the store won't miss. If my wife and I have young children but are still able to enjoy the double-income advantages of a childless couple, isn't that partly because our children are being watched at school? If I needn't invest some of my household's savings in elaborate surveillance systems, isn't that partly because I have a patrol car circling the block? The so-called ''public sector'' is a profit-making entity; it profits me.
Denying this profitability has an obvious appeal to conservatives. It allows a union-busting agenda to hide behind nice distinctions. ''We're not anti-union, we're just against certain kinds of unions.'' But the denial isn't exclusive to conservatives; in fact, it informs the delusional innocence of many liberals. I mean the idea that exploitation is the exclusive province of oil tycoons and other wicked types. If you own a yoga center or direct an M.F.A. program, you can't possibly be implicated in the more scandalous aspects of capitalism -- just as you can't possibly be to blame for racism if you've never grown cotton or owned a slave.
The fact is that our entire economic system rests on the principle of paying someone less than his or her labor is worth. The principle applies in the public sector no less than the private. The purpose of most labor unions has never been to eliminate the profit margin (the tragedy of the American labor movement) but rather to keep it within reasonable bounds.
But what about those school superintendents and police chiefs with their fabulous pensions, with salaries and benefits far beyond the average worker's dreams?
Tell me about it. This past school year, I worked as a public high school teacher in northeastern Vermont. At 58 years of age, with a master's degree and 16 years of teaching experience, I earned less than $50,000. By the standards of the Ohio school superintendent or the Wisconsin police chief, my pension can only be described as pitiful, though the dairy farmer who lives down the road from me would be happy to have it.
He should have it, at the least, and he could. If fiscal conservatives truly want to ''bring salaries into line'' they should commit to a model similar to the one proposed by George Orwell 70 years ago, with the nation's highest income exceeding the lowest by no more than a factor of 10. They should establish that model in the public sector and enforce it with equal rigor and truly progressive taxation in the private.
Right now C.E.O.'s of multinational corporations earn salaries as much as a thousand times those of their lowest-paid employees. In such a context complaining about ''lavish'' public sector salaries is like shushing the foul language of children playing near the set of a snuff film. Whom are we kidding? More to the point, who's getting snuffed?

HEADLINE: Them That's Not Shall Lose

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW. 
Joe Nocera will appear tomorrow in the debut of the Sunday Review.; Gail Collins is on book leave.

 BODY:
''Anyone who has ever struggled with poverty knows how extremely expensive it is to be poor.''
James Baldwin penned that line more than 50 years ago, but it seems particularly prescient today, if in a different manner than its original intent. 
Baldwin was referring to the poor being consistently overcharged for inferior goods. But I've always considered that sentence in the context of the extreme psychological toll of poverty, for it is in that way that I, too, know well how expensive it is to be poor.
I know the feel of thick calluses on the bottom of shoeless feet. I know the bite of the cold breeze that slithers through a drafty house. I know the weight of constant worry over not having enough to fill a belly or fight an illness.
It is in that context that I am forced to assume that if Washington politicians ever knew the sting of poverty then they have long since vanquished the memory. How else to qualify their positions? In fact, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, nearly half of all members of Congress are millionaires, and between 2008 and 2009, when most Americans were feeling the brunt of the recession, the personal wealth of members of Congress collectively increased by more than 16 percent. Must be nice.
Poverty is brutal, consuming and unforgiving. It strikes at the soul.
You defend yourself with hope, hard work and, for some, a helping hand. But these weapons grow dull in an economy on the verge of atrophy, in a job market tilting ever more toward the top and in a political environment that would sacrifice the weak to the wealthy.
On Thursday, the Pew Research Center released a poll that showed how disillusioned low-income people have become. Those making less than $30,000 were the most likely to expect to be laid off or be asked to take a pay cut. Furthermore, they were the most likely to say that they had trouble getting or paying for medical care and paying the rent or mortgage.
But at least those numbers include people with incomes. A vast subset is chronically unemployed and desperately searching for work. According to the Consumer Reports Employment Index, ''In 23 of the past 24 months, lower-income Americans have lost more jobs than they have gained.'' It continues, ''Meanwhile, more affluent Americans seem to be gaining more jobs than they are losing.''
And the current election-cycle obsession to balance the books with a pound of flesh, which is being pushed by pitiless Republicans and accommodated by pitiful Democrats, will only multiply the pain.
Until more politicians understand -- or remember -- what it means to be poor in this country, we are destined to fail the least among us, and all of us will pay a heavy price for that failure.

HEADLINE: Credit Scores and Car Insurance

BYLINE: By ANN CARRNS

 BODY:
Everyone knows that having a good credit score qualifies you for lower interest rates on loans and better terms on credit cards. But it can also affect the rates you pay for car insurance - sometimes quite significantly, when the savings are measured over time. 
The most important factors in setting rates generally are your age, where you live and driving record, says Des Toups, senior managing editor of CarInsurance.com, a rate-quoting Web site. But most insurers also check your credit when quoting a rate, because there's a correlation between your score and the likelihood you will file an insurance claim. The higher the score, the less likely you are to file one.
While the practice of checking credit scores for auto insurance quotes is widespread, it's still somewhat controversial. One company, Cure Insurance, markets itself as one that specifically does not check credit scores. ''Think about it,'' the round blue ''spokes head'' that functions as the company's logo, says on its Web site. ''What does credit history have to do with your driving skills?'' A handful of states, including California and Massachusetts, forbid the practice of checking credit scores for auto insurance quotes. But efforts to ban it nationally through federal legislation have failed.
An analysis from Carinsurance.com finds that drivers with credit scores over 750 - typically considered very good credit -- pay considerably less than a driver in the same age bracket with merely average scores.
The study compared the lowest rates offered for nearly 43,000 single-driver policies insuring one car with liability, comprehensive and collision coverage, when the driver reports no violations or accidents. The credit score used was calculated using data from TransUnion, one of the three major credit bureaus; it isn't a true FICO score, which is the number a lender typically uses. Rather, it's a version of the so-called insurance score that insurers check when you apply for coverage. The insurance version uses the same information as a traditional credit score, but gives more weight to factors deemed to reflect risk, like bankruptcy filings and maxed-out credit cards, Mr. Toups says.
The analysis found that young adults ages 25 to 34 with clean driving records, for instance, pay an average of $1,938 a year for full auto coverage. But those same drivers with a credit score over 750 pay an average of $1,155 - a 40 percent savings.
Drivers in that same age group with credit scores of 650 to 749 pay an average of $1,658, a savings of $280 compared with the overall average; those with lower scores, of 500 to 649, pay an average of $2,023, or $85 more. (Drivers with no credit file are penalized the most; they pay an average of $2,182, or $244 more than the overall average.)
The benefit continues through subsequent age brackets as well. Premiums tend to drop as drivers age, but high credit scores still mean you'll pay less. If you kept a good credit score until retirement, you'd save nearly $23,000 over the average premium paid by people with similar driving records, Mr. Toups says.
Do you think it's fair that your credit history affects your car insurance rates?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Forecasts for Growth Drop, Some Sharply

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
A drumbeat of disappointing data about consumer behavior, factory sales and weak hiring in recent weeks has prompted economists to ratchet down their 2011 economic forecasts to as little as half what they expected at the beginning of the year.
Two months ago, Goldman Sachs projected that the economy would grow at a 4 percent annual rate in the quarter ending in June. The company now expects the government to report no more than 2 percent growth when data for the second quarter is released in a few weeks. Macroeconomic Advisers, a research firm, projected 3.5 percent growth back in April and is now down to just 2.1 percent for this quarter.
Both these firms, well respected in their analysis, have cut their forecasts for the second half of the year as well. Then this week, the Federal Reserve downgraded its projections for the full year, to under 3 percent growth. It started the year with guidance as high as 3.9 percent.
Two years into the official recovery, the economy is still behaving like a plane taxiing indefinitely on the runway. Few economists are predicting an out-and-out return to recession, but the risk has increased, with the health of the American economy depending in part on what is really ''transitory.'' 
During the first press conference in the central bank's history two months ago, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke used the word to describe factors -- including supply chain disruptions after the earthquake and tsunami in Japan and rising oil prices -- that were restraining economic growth in the first half of the year. Earlier this week, Mr. Bernanke confessed that ''some of these headwinds may be stronger and more persistent than we thought,'' adding, ''we don't have a precise read on why this slower pace of growth is persisting.''
Economists say the unexpected shocks from Japan and the Middle East in the first half of the year go only partway toward explaining the deceleration. Many worries remain: housing prices have continued to fall, hiring is weak, wages are flat, growth in emerging economies like China and India is slowing and the debt crisis in Europe could have ripple effects.
What's more, government stimulants like the payroll tax cut and the extension of unemployment benefits are scheduled to expire at the end of this year. With the underlying economy undeniably tepid, economists are concerned that further shocks to the system could knock the country off its slow upward trajectory.
''The likelihood of a negative surprise is bigger than the likelihood of a positive surprise,'' said Jerry A. Webman, chief economist at OppenheimerFunds.
There was a glimmer of hope on Friday when the government reported that orders for appliances and other equipment from manufacturers were higher than expected in May. And the Commerce Department edged up its estimate of growth in the first three months of the year to 1.9 percent, from 1.8 percent.
The slow place of the economy's expansion is not entirely surprising, though it is clearly painful for those who are out of work and whose homes are worth far less than a few years ago. Many economists, most prominently Kenneth S. Rogoff and Carmen M. Reinhart, have emphasized that recovering from a financial crisis takes much longer than from a normal cyclical recession.
Jan Hatzius, the chief United States economist at Goldman Sachs, said that in fact, households appeared to be paying down debt largely as expected. ''Most of the things that looked like they were improving six months ago still look like they are improving,'' he said.
Analysts generally expect the economy to pick up in the second half as supplies from Japan come back and car production resumes at some temporarily idled plants. ''Parts producers are getting back online a lot quicker than anybody had thought,'' said Ben Herzon, a senior economist at Macroeconomic Advisers. The firm is forecasting 3.5 percent overall economic growth in the second half of the year, though that is down from its projection at the beginning of the year of 4 to 4.5 percent.
Consumer spending has been lukewarm as people have cut back elsewhere to cover for higher prices at the pump. Although gas prices have eased in the wake of the International Energy Agency's announcement that it would release some emergency stockpiles of oil, there is no guarantee prices won't climb again as turmoil in the Middle East continues. In the meantime, customers remain wary.
''A lot of the factors that will give us a boost in the second half are largely temporary and will run their course at some point,'' said David Greenlaw, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley.
At Young Ford, a car dealership in Charlotte, N.C., David McKinney, operations manager, said that while sales had perked up in the spring, buyers were now holding back. ''The psychology is going to take a little while to work through,'' he said. He added that consumers were having a hard time obtaining satisfactory loan terms.
Many consumers, he said, were simply afraid to make big commitments while uncertainty hung like a haze over the economy. ''We need to let the middle class catch the rabbit,'' he said. ''Tell them they can go to work 50 hours a week, go to the beach and send their kids to the college and they'll just keep chasing the rabbit. But now they're not even sure their job will be there.''
Economists are waiting to see whether the disappointing Labor Department report of hiring in May -- which showed that employers added just 54,000 jobs, hardly enough to keep up with normal population growth, much less dent the unemployment rate -- was an anomaly or the sign of a significant stall.
Companies have given mixed signs of hiring plans. At United Parcel Service, the package delivery giant, volumes declined slightly in the first quarter, and the company is now hiring only seasonal workers or filling in jobs as people leave, not adding new positions. ''Our business model is very simple,'' said Norman Black, a company spokesman. ''Packages equals jobs.''
Caterpillar, the large equipment manufacturer, has added 7,300 jobs in this country over the last year. With new factories in Muncie, Ind.; Winston-Salem, N.C.; and Texas, the company will continue to hire in the second half, said Jim Dugan, a company spokesman. But he declined to say how many workers would be added.
Given the clouded outlook on hiring and the potential for further shocks, Mr. Hatzius of Goldman Sachs said that he could not rule out another recession. ''We're still a reasonable way off from that,'' he said. ''But I'm not as confident as I would like to be.''

HEADLINE: Nuclear Agency Workers Denounce Project's Halt

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In an unusual public dissent, staff members of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission told a House subcommittee on Friday that they were frustrated by a boss's decision to halt their evaluation of a site in Nevada as a future repository for the nation's nuclear waste.
Four staff members told the Subcommittee on Environment and the Economy that they disagreed with instructions from the regulatory commission's chairman, Gregory B. Jaczko, to suspend their work on an Energy Department application involving the site, which followed a decision by top officials in the Obama administration to kill the project. 
''Staff would have willingly followed any outcome from a faithfully executed legitimate process,'' one staff member, Lawrence E. Kokajko, the acting deputy office director of the commission's Office of Nuclear Materials, Safety and Safeguards, told the subcommittee. ''The nation paid for this review, and the nation should get it.''
Another witness, N. Kingman Stablein, chief of the project management branch in the high-level waste division, said staff members, some of whom had worked for 20 years on the project, went through ''agony'' upon seeing it killed. And Janet P. Kotra, senior project manager, said she was instructed to follow ''a highly irregular process'' in closing out the evaluation.
The proposed waste storage site, at Yucca Mountain in the Nevada desert, was approved by Congress in the 1980s. But Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate majority leader, vowed in recent years to block the project, and President Obama pledged in 2008 to shelve it if elected. Mr. Jaczko, a political appointee, is a former aide to Mr. Reid.
Friday's hearing was a rare instance of career civil servants' challenging a move by the head of a federal agency who was appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.
Some of the testimony was sharply bitter. ''Apparently, the N.R.C.'s senior leadership is ineffective in upholding the integrity of this agency,'' said Aby Mohseni, acting director of the commission's division for high-level waste repository safety.
He suggested that Mr. Jaczko, the commission's chairman, had broken the law by not keeping the other four commissioners regularly informed, although a report this month by the agency's inspector general said no law had been broken.
The inspector general's report said that Mr. Jaczko's decision to halt the Yucca review was based on politics, however, not on a consideration of the acceptability of the site for long-term storage. It also criticized Mr. Jaczko's management style, saying he had used his powers to carry out the president's wishes while running roughshod over his fellow commissioners.
A memo sent by Mr. Mohseni to the commission members, released by the House subcommittee on Friday, said that top staff members at the commission were suppressing information that should have gone to the commission, and that there was ''a pattern of rewarding senior managers for supporting and contributing to politicized decisions.''
In a statement issued after the hearing, the regulatory commission defended Mr. Jaczko's decision to halt the commission's work on Yucca Mountain. ''One of the hallmarks of the N.R.C. is its open work environment, where employees are empowered to raise issues they consider important,'' it said. ''The chairman listened to a wide range of views, made the proper decision and has moved on to focus on the many important safety issues before the agency.''
Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, the ranking Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, argued Friday that Mr. Jaczko had no choice in shutting down the commission's evaluation.
The Energy Department had applied for a license to build and operate the repository but then withdrew the application, he noted. And Congress approved a budget with no money for evaluating the application, only $10 million to shut down the investigation.
''N.R.C.'s options are limited,'' Mr. Waxman said. ''Continuing its review risks squandering millions of taxpayer dollars.''
Representative John Shimkus, Republican of Illinois, chairman of the Subcommittee on Environment and the Economy, which held the hearing Friday, said the Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff had ''labored tirelessly, outside the public spotlight, in good faith.'' He asserted that the commission was ''dysfunctional'' as a result of its leadership, however, and was squandering public trust.
Many members of Congress, mostly Republicans, are trying hard to maintain the political consensus established in the 1980s to eventually place the waste at Yucca, a volcanic structure about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas. The site became a candidate partly because it was already owned by the government, and it became the lead candidate because the other possible sites, in Washington State and Texas, had more powerful delegations in Congress.
The question before the regulatory commission was never whether Yucca was the best place to bury the waste. Several staff members said what they had wanted was publication of their work.
Online Correction: June 24, 2011, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A previous version of this article misidentified Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, as a senator.

HEADLINE: Wariness On ING Sale

BYLINE: By ANN CARRNS

 BODY:
ING Direct USA account holders are reacting to the sale of the online bank about as well as they would if Capital One's famous television barbarians had battered down the doors of their homes.
Social media sites, including ING Direct's own Facebook page, and banking blogs have erupted with customer antipathy for the deal, which was announced last week. A sale was required by European regulators as a condition of financial assistance given to ING's Dutch parent bank during the banking crisis. ING Direct, headquartered in Wilmington, Del., offers savings accounts, checking accounts, mortgages and brokerage services to 7.7 million customers.
The main theme of the rants - er, posts -- seems to be the concern that ING's brand of low-fee, low-maintenance banking, combined with responsive customer service, would soon be a thing of the past under the new ownership. 
ING became popular offering no frills accounts, a savings account with competitive rates but no minimum balance, for instance, and no monthly fee. Users also especially like a feature that lets them easily establish subsavings accounts for specific purposes, like vacations or taxes, and have money transferred automatically from other accounts.
''TERRIBLE NEWS,'' said a typical entry, from someone called Red Broad on the Facebook page.
''I've been really happy with ING, but C1 have a horrible reputation for fees and customer support, quite the opposite to ING's business model. I'm really sad to see it go this way. I'm willing to bet that ING will lose at least 50% or more of its account holders due to this takeover. What a shame to see a truly customer oriented bank fall into the hands of a bank with probably the worst customer relations out there. I REALLY DON'T want to change banks, I LOVE my banking experience with ING, I can't see me staying with C1 though so I guess I'll just have to start looking around...sigh...''
And this one, from Steve Bush: ''I feel betrayed by a trusted friend. What a shame.''
Many of the posts used language that can't be used in a newspaper, although a few optimistic comments dismissed the predictions of banking apocalypse. ''A lot of you people seem to be taking this a little too hard,'' said Matt Cannon on Facebook. ''No one has any idea yet what's going to happen, but I severely doubt ING Direct will see any significant change in the way they do business, no need to run for the hills yet.''
We here at Bucks wondered if this outpouring of emotion gave the folks at Capital One pause, so we asked them some questions that seem to be on customers' minds. The bank declined to provide ''yes or no'' answers to queries about specific changes, saying it was too soon to do so. But the spokeswoman Tatiana Stead did offer the following responses via e-mail.
To us, it looks like they're at least leaving open the option of adding fees and minimum balances and subsuming the ING Direct brand altogether. Do you feel reassured by the responses below?
Q: Why are customers of ING so upset about the sale of their bank to Capital One?
ING has developed a unique connection with its customers. There are millions of ''happy savers'' across the country who are incredibly loyal and value their relationship with ING. We truly appreciate that, and we intend to do everything we can to maintain that trust and their enthusiasm.
We deeply understand and respect the value and the loyalty ING has created. Together with the ING team, we have the capabilities and insights to sustain and build the power of that franchise to better serve customers and create great value for our shareholders and associates.
Q: What changes are you planning to make to ING Direct's account offerings? Will subaccounts for specific savings goals remain?
We have no plans to make any significant changes. ING customers should expect the same great customer experience and the ''status quo'' from ING for the foreseeable future.
Q. Are you planning any new fees or minimum balance requirements?
ING Direct has built a large and valuable franchise of engaged customers by focusing on a few simple proconsumer products. We deeply understand the value of the loyalty and advocacy ING Direct has been able to build with its customers. Everything we do as we integrate our businesses will be thoughtful and surefooted with a focus on sustaining and building that customer loyalty. We will focus on the customers, channels, products, and pricing strategies that build the best long-term customer relationships and deliver the best cost of funds.
Q: Does the reaction suggest Capital One might need to enhance customer service? How might this be done?
ING was a pioneer in direct banking and has built an incredibly successful, customer-centric model focused on building and sustaining long-term relationships. One of our primary objectives will be to ensure that we sustain and, where we can, enhance the exceptional customer experience ING delivers today. We want to reassure the current customers of ING Direct that the great products and experience they've come to expect will continue and, in fact, expand over time.
Q. Will ING Direct be operated separately or integrated into Capital One's operations?
ING Direct and Capital One share a heritage of innovation, a strong focus on building customer franchise and an unwavering commitment to find, empower and unleash extremely talented people. We have been impressed with the management team of ING Direct and what they have accomplished.
As I am sure you will appreciate, over the upcoming weeks we want to get to know ING Direct's management team and associates even better as we determine how best to organize to deliver the customer experience as well as the financial and strategic results we have been discussing.
Capital One will work closely with the leadership team at ING Direct team to establish a management structure designed to ensure that the combined company achieves the highest quality integration and has the best leadership in place to carry on and build upon ING Direct's great customer franchise.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: An Unfair Burden: Any deal to cut the deficit must shield the most vulnerable Americans

 BODY:
For all of the economic hardship of the last several years, there was reason to hope that the nation could avoid a crushing increase in the number of Americans living in poverty. That hope is fading fast.
In 2008, amid a deepening recession, a Census Bureau measure showed that the number of poor Americans rose by 1.7 million to nearly 47.5 million. In 2009, thanks in large part to the Obama stimulus, the rise in poverty was halted -- a significant accomplishment at a time of worsening unemployment. When data for 2010 are released in the fall, poverty is expected to have stayed in check because the stimulus, including aid to states and bolstered unemployment benefits, was still in effect last year.
This year and next are a different story. The stimulus is waning and Republicans are targeting poverty-fighting programs for deep cuts. Obama officials have said that low-income programs will not be automatically cut to fit a preconceived target from the debt-limit talks, but there is no guarantee they will stick to that position. 
Exempting low-income programs has been a major feature of deficit deals going back to 1985. Both sides should publicly commit to that now, and take steps to strengthen the safety net. The alternative is unconscionable harm:
MEDICAID Federal stimulus funds for Medicaid -- an additional $102 billion to the states over the past three years -- run out at the end of June. Long-term deficit reduction will require controlling health care costs. But with the economy weak, there is no excuse for immediate cuts to the joint federal and state health program that is a lifeline for 68 million low-income Americans.
UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS In 2010, Congress allocated $56.5 billion to renew expiring federal jobless benefits through 2011 but dropped a $25-a-week supplement that had been added under the stimulus. That reduction could push an estimated 175,000 people into poverty this year.
Another threat is that jobless benefits won't be renewed -- or will be watered down -- when they expire at the end of 2011. A recent bill from some House Republicans would let states use federal jobless money for other purposes, denying unemployed workers the cash they need to get by.
FOOD AID Some 44.6 million Americans use food stamps at a cost, this year, of $71.5 billion. House Republicans want to turn the program into a block grant, which would end the guarantee of food aid to all who qualify. The federal Women, Infants and Children assistance program, which helps some nine million low-income people, is also being targeted. Earlier this month, the Republican-controlled House voted to cut $733 million from the $6.7 billion program. That would force WIC to turn away an estimated 300,000 to 450,000 eligible applicants next year.
TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE FOR NEEDY FAMILIES This $16.6 billion block grant, known as TANF, helps states provide cash to two million poor families, as well as child care and other services. This year, an estimated 700,000 recipients will face reduced benefits, in part because a TANF contingency fund for use during downturns has not been replenished. A $5 billion infusion from the stimulus -- used, in large part, to subsidize jobs for TANF recipients -- also ended in 2010. Congress did not extend it, cutting off funds for 250,000 jobs.
Much of the real money for deficit reduction will inevitably have to come from popular programs, like reducing payments to Medicare providers, and reining in defense spending. And it must come from tax increases, no matter how much Republicans may wish it otherwise.
Making the poor carry a heavy part of the deficit burden is intolerable.

HEADLINE: Obama's Growing Trust in Biden Is Reflected in His Call on Troops

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As President Obama began mulling his next big decision on troop levels in Afghanistan last January, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. quietly flew to Kabul to meet with President Hamid Karzai and tour the battlefield with the top American commander, Gen. David H. Petraeus.
At a military base in Wardak Province, where the Taliban continue to pose a security threat, Mr. Biden listened with bewilderment as an American civilian told him about plans to dig a well in a nearby village. ''Why do they need a well?'' he asked, according to a person who was there.
Convinced he was seeing mission creep, Mr. Biden came home and pressed the president on a point he had making since the first troop debate in 2009: the United States needed to stop nation-building in Afghanistan. The military, he argued, was going beyond Mr. Obama's goals of defeating Al Qaeda, preventing the Taliban from toppling the Afghan government and improving security. 
In ordering the withdrawal of 30,000 troops by next summer, Mr. Obama finally sided with Mr. Biden. While the decision has drawn criticism from those who say it is a rush for the exits, it shows the growing trust the president has placed in his vice president -- an outcome many would not have predicted when Mr. Obama chose the garrulous senator, now 68, as his running mate.
''They began as friendly rivals,'' said David Axelrod, a longtime adviser to Mr. Obama, recalling the primary. ''But the relationship has been forged in the fires of many tests. There's a real bond between them.''
The two men often spend several hours a day together when both are in town, in addition to a weekly one-on-one lunch, and officials say Mr. Biden is almost always the last person in the room with the president.
Mr. Biden's decision not to ask for a dedicated portfolio of issues, as Vice President Al Gore did under President Bill Clinton, prompted skeptics to predict he would lack influence. But Mr. Biden has become the president's chief troubleshooter, shepherding a stalled arms-reduction treaty with Russia through the Senate, for example. He has also been his point person on issues ranging from Iraq to budget negotiations with Congress, which collapsed this week over disagreements about taxes and spending cuts.
As the budget impasse shows, Mr. Biden's role has limits. After Republican negotiators pulled out of the talks, party leaders suggestedthat Mr. Biden could no longer function as Mr. Obama's proxy. On Friday, the White House announced that the president would join him in discussions with Congressional leaders next week.
While Mr. Biden has overcome his reputation for gaffes and administration officials no longer roll their eyes at his loquaciousness, his public statements still go further than those of his buttoned-down boss.
The vice president declined to be interviewed for this article. But some officials worried that the perception of a Biden victory on the Afghanistan strategy could worsen tensions in an administration that prefers to present a united front.
Both Pentagon and State Department officials had warned that a swift troop reduction could jeopardize gains in stabilizing parts of the country and prevent the military from securing other volatile regions. And the plan has already prompted NATO allies to hasten their own exit.
Moreover, some question the viability of Mr. Biden's ultimate vision for Afghanistan, in which the United States would leave behind only a force large enough to secure American bases for counterterrorism operations there and in Pakistan.
''Biden is calling for a clear transition to Fortress Kabul,'' said Bruce O. Riedel, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who led the administration's initial Afghan review in early 2009. ''But that perspective has never gotten any traction with the Pentagon. They view it as an unending mission with no chance of success.''
The last time Mr. Obama deliberated over troop levels, in late 2009, the vice president argued just as vociferously for a minimalist approach. The president, though, sided with Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, both of whom favored sending at least 30,000 additional troops.
Mr. Obama, however, attached a deadline of 18 to 24 months, and Mr. Biden paid close watch. ''He's an aggressive enforcer of the president's goals and vision,'' said Tom Donilon, the national security adviser.
While the vice president energetically promoted the administration's policy, he also privately kept voicing his deep skepticism of attempts to transform Afghanistan, several officials said. During recent debates over the withdrawal timetable, he pushed to bring back the troops at the earliest possible date, next April, according to officials, and countered arguments by Mr. Gates and Mrs. Clinton to leave a large part of the additional troops in place until the end of 2012.
Mr. Biden's hand was strengthened by other factors, including chronic tensions with the government of President Karzai and the Navy Seal raid that killed Osama bin Laden, which lent support to his argument that the United States could combat Al Qaeda with focused covert operations rather than a major troop deployment.
A devout Catholic, Mr. Biden fingered a rosary ring in the White House Situation Room during the raid. When he tucked it away in his wallet, Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, jokingly suggested that might be premature, gesturing to the rosary ring that he had pulled out of his own pocket, according to an aide.
In internal debates, officials said, Mr. Biden has consistently expressed doubts about the public's appetite for an endless war. ''The vice president always does a good job of bringing America into the room,'' said David Plouffe, a senior political adviser.
With Americans struggling in a still-weak economy, Congress worried about the huge deficit and the president facing a re-election campaign, Mr. Biden is being tapped to reassure the country that the military commitment is limited.
On Thursday, the White House released a video in which he talked about the need to shift to the home front.
''By winding down these wars and bringing home these troops, we will free up significant resources -- resources we can reinvest at home,'' he declared.
With 68,000 troops remaining in Afghanistan, even after next year, Mr. Biden dismisses the argument that the United States is rushing for the exits, officials familiar with his thinking said. He also believes that American troops can conduct counterterrorism operations from there ''indefinitely.''
Such a calculation is risky. Ron Klain, Mr. Biden's former chief of staff, recalling the vice president's recommendation to push for the passage of an arms treaty through a hostile Senate, against the advice of other White House officials, said: ''He has this quality where he is willing to take chances.''

HEADLINE: Boehner Must Navigate Rocky Road to a Budget

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE; Jackie Calmes contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The morning after Republicans claimed the House on Nov. 2, John A. Boehner, the soon-to-be speaker, was asked how he was ever going to get a multitrillion-dollar increase in the federal debt ceiling through his new Tea Party-infused majority.
''We'll be working that out over the next couple of months,'' Mr. Boehner said in a comment that understated just how difficult that job was going to be. 
Six months after becoming speaker and six weeks before the government runs out of borrowing power, Mr. Boehner will now be one of the people ''working that out'' directly with President Obama and his fellow Congressional leaders. Bipartisan budget talks imploded on Thursday when Representative Eric Cantor, the majority leader, took a walk.
The speaker faces quite a predicament. He has to navigate his own party's internal politics, cut a deal with his cagey counterparts in the Senate and Mr. Obama, and steer any agreement through the House where many Republicans are sure to oppose it -- all while trying not to sink the entire economy in the process.
The challenges might explain why Mr. Cantor, after a contentious negotiating session on Wednesday, evidently decided the job was above his pay grade and passed the debt-limit baton to Mr. Boehner.
Trying to get the negotiations back on track on Friday, Mr. Obama invited Senators Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat and majority leader, and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, to the White House on Monday for separate sessions to talk about the debt limit.
Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said the meetings would be an effort to ''find common ground on a balanced approach to deficit reduction.''
The crucial phrase there is the reference to a balanced approach. On Friday, Democrats emphasized anew that they could not accept any compromise tied to a debt-limit increase that relied solely on spending cuts and that did not provide some new federal revenue from taxes on businesses and the most affluent Americans.
''The simple message that Republicans sent yesterday by walking out of the talks was that unless we take their lopsided approach to reducing the deficit, they are prepared to tank the economy,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Budget Committee and a participant in the negotiations. Mr. Van Hollen said Mr. Cantor and Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the other Republican who had been in on the negotiations, refused to consider such revenue sources as eliminating a tax benefit for owners of corporate jets.
Mr. Cantor cited persistent Democratic insistence on raising tax revenues as the main reason for his decision to abandon the talks. Mr. Boehner and Mr. McConnell have been equally crystal clear that they are opposed to including anything that even resembles a tax increase in a budget compromise. So it remains to be seen how Mr. Obama clears that hurdle after Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who was leading the first round of talks, was unable to do.
Other factors contributed to the abrupt end of the Biden negotiations as well. Democrats and some Republicans viewed Mr. Cantor's departure as a reaction to his learning that Mr. Boehner, with whom he has a sometimes competitive relationship, was at the White House on Wednesday for a meeting with Mr. Obama that had not been publicly announced. Their thinking was that Mr. Cantor was miffed that the speaker, without informing him, was already engaged in sidebar negotiations with the White House.
A Cantor aide dismissed such reasoning as silly and said the talks were always going to move to the presidential-speaker-Senate leader level.
''The bottom line is that the proposals pushed by Democrats would increase taxes by hundreds of billions of dollars on individuals, small businesses, and employers at a time when we need to focus on job growth,'' said Brad Dayspring, a spokesman for Mr. Cantor.
Officials said that in what turned out to be a final negotiating session on Wednesday, Mr. Cantor was pushing for more reductions in annual federal spending while refusing to consider cuts in the Pentagon budget -- a sore point with Democrats. The impasse over the spending total -- and the gulf between Democrats and Republicans on any new tax revenues -- scuttled the talks for now.
But participants and aides said the Biden sessions did produce a lot of budget material that will be useful in the meetings between Congressional leaders and the White House.
White House officials started laying out their argument for new revenues on Friday by trying to define the choices to the administration's advantage. They described the tax increases as closing loopholes for ''millionaires and billionaires,'' while saying the deep spending cuts that the Republicans' approach would force would hamper essential government services while driving up health costs for Medicare recipients.
Speaking at a fund-raiser in New York on Thursday night, Mr. Obama offered his view of the standoff, saying: ''This is not just a budget question, this is a values question.''
White House officials say the ideal balance in a package to reduce the deficit by about $2 trillion over a decade would be $1 of new tax revenues for every $3 in spending reductions, including lower interest on the debt that would be automatic if projected deficits are reduced.
The next phase of the talks promises to be difficult. But the spending agreement negotiated earlier this year showed that the president, Mr. Boehner and Mr. Reid can seal a deal. Still, Mr. Boehner made clear on Friday that he would not be part of an agreement that raised taxes or did not enact budget overhauls and cut spending by at least as much as the debt ceiling was raised.
''If the president and his allies want the debt limit increased,'' he said, ''it is only going to happen via a measure that meets these tests.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Hopefuls Press Romney on Abortion Rights

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Seeking to distinguish themselves from Mitt Romney, the presumed Republican front-runner in the 2012 presidential race, challengers exploited a bit of daylight that opened between him and other candidates this week over abortion.
''This is not the time for the Republican Party to put up a candidate who is weak on the pro-life issue or has a history of flip-flopping over it,'' Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota told the National Right to Life convention here on Friday.
She pressed the attack after another primary contender, Rick Santorum, declared last weekend that he was ''stunned'' by Mr. Romney's refusal to sign a sweeping anti-abortion pledge. 
The issue dredged up Mr. Romney's awkward history on abortion rights -- he was for them while running for Massachusetts governor in 2002 before becoming an opponent -- a record that damaged him with conservative voters in his failed bid for the Republican nomination in 2008.
This year his campaign is premised on the conviction that what voters care most about is the economy, and that Mr. Romney's resume as a business executive will trump concern over his credentials as a social conservative.
So far the strategy seems successful, with Mr. Romney leading in early polls.
Mrs. Bachmann's and Mr. Santorum's jabs on the abortion issue raise the question of whether it can still be a decisive point for Republican primary voters, who are more conservative in some early-voting states.
Mrs. Bachmann sought to push that advantage. ''There are indeed major problems in our country, that goes without saying,'' she told the convention audience, speaking by a Skype connection over the Internet. ''The importance of these issues does not for a moment mean the life issues should take a back seat.''
A spokesman for Mr. Romney declined to comment, seeking to portray the dispute as a minor one that had already played out in the news media.
But some political analysts said evangelical Christians already skeptical of Mr. Romney's Mormon faith could be driven further away by the abortion issue.
Ted G. Jelen, a political science professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who has written about abortion politics, said: ''It's something to hang your hat on: 'How do I oppose a Mormon without seeming to be a bigot?' Well, he's not solid on abortion.''
Mr. Romney's distancing himself from abortion-rights groups, however, could also play in his favor in early-voting New Hampshire, where the Republican primary is open to independents. Many have a libertarian streak and want government out of people's personal lives, said Dean Spiliotis, a political scientist at Southern New Hampshire University. ''I think it's a clear attempt to play well in New Hampshire,'' he said.
It is unclear how strongly abortion might affect voters' decisions in 2012. Less than 1 percent told a New York Times/CBS News poll this year and last that abortion was the top problem facing the country.
But the issue retains its power to stir passions on both sides. Anti-abortion activists and their elected supporters have chipped away at abortion's availability in many states. Republicans in the House almost succeeded in blocking a budget compromise in April over federal financing for Planned Parenthood.
That issue is sure to resurface in the general election next year.
Mr. Romney, in laying out his anti-abortion credentials in an essay for National Review Online on June 18, wrote that he agreed with ending government grants to Planned Parenthood (which is barred already from using the money to pay for abortions).
He clarified why he would not sign the ''Pro-Life Leadership Presidential Pledge'' from the Susan B. Anthony List, a group that raises money for anti-abortion candidates. Five other primary candidates have signed: Mrs. Bachmann, Mr. Santorum, Tim Pawlenty, Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul.
Mr. Romney objected to the pledge's requirement of a litmus test on the issue for key presidential appointees overseeing health agencies and the Department of Justice. He also said that its call to end support for all institutions that perform abortions could have unintended consequences.
''It is one thing to end federal funding for an organization like Planned Parenthood,'' he wrote. ''It is entirely another to end all federal funding for thousands of hospitals across America.''
The president of the Susan B. Anthony List, Marjorie Dannenfelser, responded that Mr. Romney misinterpreted the pledge.
Another candidate who did not sign, Herman Cain, a former pizza-chain executive, said he thought it infringed on the separation of government powers.
Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former Utah governor who entered the primary race on Tuesday, said that day that he disagreed with signing pledges on principle.
Mr. Santorum spoke passionately here of his commitment to the anti-abortion cause, telling several hundred activists, ''You are the warriors out there on an unpopular front.''
In a brief interview after leaving the stage, Mr. Santorum criticized Mr. Romney for being unwilling to pledge that he would give authority over health and law enforcement agencies to foes of abortion.
''When you do not follow through and put people in key positions that reflect the position you hold, I think it's legitimate to question whether you really hold those positions deeply,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Obama Announces Plan For Technology Partnership

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
LAWRENCEVILLE, Pa. -- President Obama visited a university research center outside Pittsburgh on Friday to announce a new partnership between the government, industries and leading universities to speed the movement of technological advances to commercial users. The trip was the latest of his increasingly frequent travels to battleground states to showcase administration efforts to create manufacturing jobs. 
After touring the National Robotics Engineering Center at Carnegie Mellon University, a high-technology facility adjacent to a rusted factory symbolic of the area's industrial past, Mr. Obama said federal agencies would invest more than $500 million to seed the initiative. Of that, $70 million is to go to robotics projects like one he viewed at the center: a boom-box-size robot that inspects sewer pipelines, made by a company started by a Carnegie Mellon professor.
''We've launched an all-hands-on-deck effort between our brightest academic minds, some of our boldest business leaders and our most dedicated public servants from science and technology agencies, all with one big goal, and that is a renaissance of American manufacturing,'' Mr. Obama said in remarks to about 150 people, including the partnership's co-chairmen, Andrew N. Liveris, the chief executive of the Dow Chemical Company, and Susan Hockfield, president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Administration officials said the initiative would be overseen by federal agencies already active in public-private partnerships, like the Department of Energy, and would rely on both existing federal financing and money that Mr. Obama has requested from Congress. The new sum, however, reflects a small fraction of what the government already spends on research and innovation, and that has led to some of the mass-market products Mr. Obama cited here, like the Internet, cellphones and GPS navigation devices.
''What we're trying to do is provide more focus and direction to this spending,'' Ron Bloom, Mr. Obama's adviser on manufacturing policy, told reporters. He called the new Advanced Manufacturing Partnership an ''umbrella'' for government innovation programs.
Mr. Obama's new packaging for the government's existing public-private efforts also allowed him to underscore his commitment to manufacturing jobs as the economy continues to sputter, and in a swing state for presidential elections.
Mr. Obama was careful not to declare complete victory over the economic downturn he inherited. ''We've made some tough decisions that have turned our economy in a positive direction over the past two years,'' he said.
Other universities in the partnership include Georgia Tech, Stanford, the University of Michigan and the University of California, Berkeley. Other manufacturers include Allegheny Technologies, Caterpillar, Corning, Ford, Honeywell, Intel, Johnson & Johnson, Northrop Grumman and Procter & Gamble.

OBAMA'S TRUST IN BIDEN
REFLECTED IN WAR DECISION
As President Obama began mulling his next big decision on troop levels in Afghanistan last January, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. quietly flew to Kabul to meet with President Hamid Karzai and tour the battlefield with the top American commander, Gen. David H. Petraeus. Convinced he was seeing mission creep, Mr. Biden said the United States needed to stop nation-building in Afghanistan. PAGE A4
FREE DISSIDENT STILL PUNISHED
The government of Azerbaijan has freed Emin Milli, a blogger and opposition activist, but his old life is gone. Under an oil-rich and tightly controlled state, international organizations that once employed him as a translator will no longer hire him for official events, for fear of angering the government.

PALESTINIAN PROTESTS PAY OFF
Residents of the tiny Palestinian village of Bilin, along with Israeli and foreign supporters, held what organizers billed as the last of their trademark weekly demonstrations against the Bilin section of Israel's West Bank barrier. The six-year campaign is winding down because the Israeli military has begun to dismantle the fence that separated the village from about two-thirds of its agricultural land. PAGE A9
MIDEAST TALKS MAY RESUME
Intensive efforts are under way to stave off a Palestinian bid for United Nations membership in September, with diplomats trying to lure Israeli and Palestinian leaders back to negotiations on the basis of President Obama's formula of a state based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed land swaps. Israeli and Palestinian leaders have repeatedly told American and European officials who visited in recent weeks that they want to return to talks. PAGE A9

HEADLINE: Cuomo's Presidential Moment Forms Contrast With Obama

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: It's hard not to be impressed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's ability to get the same-sex marriage bill passed in New York.

 BODY:
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York had help in securing passage of the bill that will provide for equal treatment of same-sex couples under New York's marriage law. Public opinion on the issue is shifting rapidly: 58 percent of New Yorkers support same-sex marriage today compared with 37 percent in 2004. Many allies were at work on the cause, from gay rights groups to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to the pop star Lady Gaga, who at a concert in Buffalo urged her fans to lobby the freshman State Senator Mark J. Grisanti, a Republican, to vote for the bill. (Mr. Gristani, initially considered a strong "no" vote, was one of four Republicans to support the measure.)
A more subtle factor: addition by subtraction. Among the 14 senators who have been replaced in the chamber since the New York State Senate last voted on marriage in 2009 were 4 Democrats who had voted against it. This time around, every first-term Democrat -- and one rookie Republican, Mr. Grisanti -- voted for the bill.
It's hard not to be impressed by the accomplishment, particularly after reading my colleague Michael Barbaro's article on the work Mr. Cuomo did behind the scenes. Six senators who had voted against the bill in 2009 voted for it on Friday night, including three Republicans. Black and Hispanic members of the Senate, whose constituents sometimes have more tepid feelings toward gay rights, voted for the bill by a 13-1 margin despite the vocal opposition of Senator Ruben Diaz Sr. of the Bronx. The Republican majority leader, Dean G. Skelos, decided to bring the bill to the floor, something he did not have to do.
I'm generally of the view that individual politicians receive both more credit and more blame than they deserve, with legislative and electoral outcomes usually determined by broad cultural, economic and political undercurrents. But the type of leadership that Mr. Cuomo exercised -- setting a lofty goal, refusing to take no for an answer and using every tool at his disposal to achieve it -- is reminiscent of the stories sometimes told about with President Lyndon B. Johnson, who had perhaps the most impressive record of legislative accomplishment of any recent president.
It's also a brand of leadership that many Democrats I speak with feel is lacking in President Obama.
Mr. Obama has some considerable achievements, including his health care bill and the reversal of the military's ban on openly gay and lesbian soldiers. But he often seems to achieve them by outsourcing much of the work to Democrats in Congress or to his various lieutenants. And his considerable speaking abilities sometimes seem to be directed more toward healing the country in times of crisis than toward persuading it to move in a new direction.
It's a strategy that Mr. Obama's critics and admirers have sometimes characterized as "leading from behind." One could rightly argue that being president of the United States is an order of magnitude more difficult than being governor of New York, and that Mr. Obama's performance has been fair to good under the circumstances. But his seemingly risk-averse approach roils many Democrats, even as most of them approve of his overall performance.
That Mr. Cuomo's accomplishment pertains to same-sex marriage, an issue on which Mr. Obama has adopted an indecipherable position born of a cynical-seeming political calculus, makes the contrast sharper. And that it involved achieving cooperation from Republicans, something Mr. Obama has rarely received, makes it seem as though Mr. Cuomo has more effectively executed upon Mr. Obama's "theory of change" than the president himself, demonstrating that articulating clear and unapologetic goals is not incompatible with persuading votes on the margins.
Whoever is the Democratic nominee in 2016, he or she will almost certainly endorse same-sex marriage, as about two-thirds of Democratic voters already do. But it's unlikely that any of them will be able to better Mr. Cuomo's accomplishment. Particularly if Mr. Obama loses next year, his approach toward leadership is one that many Democratic voters will have an appetite for.

HEADLINE: The Weekend Word: Rejection

BYLINE: JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington.

 BODY:
Today's Times After weeks of tension between Congress and the White House, lawmakers dealt a symbolic blow to President Obama on Friday by resoundingly rejecting a bill that would authorize United States operations in Libya. But the House also defeated a measure that would have limited financing to support those efforts, sending mixed messages to the Obama administration and the rest of Washington, The Times's Jennifer Steinhauer reports. While former Gov. Mitt Romney has based his campaign on the conviction that voters care more about the perilous economy than social issues, other candidates in his party are jabbing at his awkward history on abortion with hopes that it can still be a decisive issue with conservative primary voters. Although Mr. Romney's campaign has tried to diminish the issue by focusing primarily on his business acumen instead of defending his stance on the subject, some political analysts said that evangelical Christians already skeptical of his Mormon faith could be driven further away by the abortion issue, The Times's Trip Gabriel reports. President Obama went to Lawrenceville, Pa., on Friday showcasing administration efforts to create manufacturing jobs in battleground-states. At Carnegie-Mellon University's National Robotics Engineering Center, he laid out a plan for a new alliance of the government, industries and leading universities to speed the movement of technology advances to commercial users for "a renaissance of American manufacturing," The Times's Jackie Calmes reports. Mr. Obama also delivered his weekly address from the robotics center, saying he wanted "to help make sure America remains in this century what we were in the last - a country that makes things. A country that out-builds and out-innovates the rest of the world."
 The Times's Mark Landler explores how Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has grown into a trusted and influential presence in the White House - an outcome many would not have predicted when President Obama chose the garrulous senator as his running mate. Mr. Biden has long argued that nation-building needs to stop in Afghanistan, and that the military is going beyond Mr. Obama's goals of defeating Al Qaeda, thwarting the Taliban and improving security. In ordering to withdraw 30,000 troops by next summer, the president has finally sided with his No. 2.Around the Web Former Mayor Kwame M. Kilpatrick of Detroit, who pleaded guilty to felony charges in 2008, will be released from prison on or after July 24, Politico reports. Hundreds of thousands of dollars have poured into a new Democratic political action committee, mainly from a host of wealthy liberals hoping to blunt the impact of well-funded conservative groups, Politico reports.Happenings around Washington A Belgian economic mission to Washington will commence on Sunday, with Prince Philippe and Princess Mathilde leading the way. First stop: Arlington National Cemetery to participate in a formal wreath-laying ceremony. A remembrance ceremony will be held to honor the 19 United States airmen who died in the Khobar Towers terrorist bombing in Saudi Arabia. The ceremony will mark the 15th anniversary of the attack. Residents of the District of Columbia will flex their one Congressional muscle on Saturday by joining Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton to rally the White House to "end taxation without representation."

HEADLINE: Sunday Breakfast Menu, June 26

BYLINE: JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: This week the Sunday talk shows will briefly address recent developments in the 2012 campaign before delving into the planned troop drawdown in Afghanistan.

 BODY:
This week the Sunday talk shows will briefly address recent developments in the 2012 campaign before delving into the planned troop drawdown in Afghanistan. Guests will also discuss how Congress can address the debt ceiling before it's too late, while salvaging the weakened economy in the meantime.
Representative Michele Bachmann is in the 2012 spotlight this week, making the rounds with appearances on CBS' "Face the Nation" and FOX's "Fox News Sunday." She will speak on the G.O.P. debate and her presidential candidacy, which will be official once she announces from Waterloo, Iowa, on Monday. Later on the Fox program, Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, will share his thoughts on why the talks over whether to raise the nation's debt limit have fallen apart.
Although he promised not to run for president, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey still has some thoughts on the matter. He will sit down with NBC's "Meet the Press" to discuss the developing pool of candidates in the Republican Party and offer suggestions to help quicken the economic recovery. Later in the program, Senators Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, and Jim Webb, Democrat of Virginia, will expose their party's differing views with a debate on the future of the United States's role in Afghanistan.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, and House Assistant Minority Leader James Clyburn, Democrat of South Carolina, will sit down with ABC's "This Week" to discuss whether the two parties can reach an agreement on extending the debt ceiling before the United States winds up defaulting on its loans.
The same will be discussed on CNN's "State of the Union": House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senator Jim Demint, Republican of South Carolina, will speak about how Congress can address the deficit issue. But first, Representative Mike Rogers, Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, will tell CNN why he remains a dissenting voice on troop withdrawal in Afghanistan.
Representative Adam Smith, Democrat of Washington, will appear on C-SPAN's "Newsmakers" to talk about a little of everything: Afghanistan, the operations in Libya, Pakistan and the change from Secretary Robert M. Gates to Leon Panetta as head of the Department of Defense.
On Univision's "Al Punto," Mike Hammer, acting assistant secretary of state for public affairs, will discuss how American aid can help overcome the violence in Guatemala that lingers from the presence of gangs and drug traffickers. He will also talk about President Obama's strategy to withdraw troops from Afghanistan and address the State Department's plans to fix the problem of those who were affected by a visa lottery glitch.
Later, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, the Puerto Rican Senator and gubernatorial candidate, will speak exclusively to Univision about his candidacy and recent lunch with Mr. Obama.
TV One's "Washington Watch" focuses on personal finance and features Kelvin Boston, financial journalist and host of "Moneywise" on PBS. Michelle Singletary, author and syndicated columnist, will also sit for an interview alongside Rodney Anderson, the financial wellness expert.

HEADLINE: Oil Oozes Through Your Life

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD. 
A business reporter for The New York Times.

 BODY:
WHEN whales were an important energy source back in the 18th and 19th centuries, whalers made sure to use every last part of each one, given how difficult they were to kill. The blubber was boiled into oil for heat and light; the bones refashioned into women's corsets; the teeth sold for scrimshaw carvings; the sperm reserved for cosmetics and other uses. ''Such a sweetener! Such a softener! Such a delicious molifier!'' -- as Herman Melville's narrator puts it in ''Moby Dick.''
Since petroleum replaced whale oil as a main fuel source more than a century ago, chemical companies and refineries have found a startling range of uses for it, from asphalt to vanilla flavoring in ice cream to pills from the drugstore. It has oozed into everyday life, so reducing dependency is a more complicated proposition than some might think. 
''It just turns out to be a very abundant product that is easy to manipulate chemically, so you can turn it into many different products,'' said Dr. Benny Freeman, past chairman of the American Chemical Society's polymeric materials division.
Take a typical barrel of oil. About 46 percent of it is refined into gasoline, and another 40 percent or so is turned into jet and fuel oil. Only about 2 percent becomes petrochemicals like polyethylene and benzene for everyday products (with the rest going to other uses).
Yet that 2 percent has a pervasive reach, as suggested by the accompanying chart. ''Oil, no pun intended, seeps into just about everything in the economy,'' said David Garfield, a managing director at the consultancy AlixPartners. And though petrochemicals usually aren't burned for fuel, they share in the environmental impact of petroleum when extracted and refined using energy-intensive methods.
When oil prices go up, as they have markedly in the past year, companies reassess how they transport items, try to cut down on energy costs, and look for alternatives to petroleum-based materials. For example, some are replacing the hard-to-open plastic clamshell packaging that many consumers find so annoying. But, said Michael Pishko, head of the department of chemical engineering at Texas A & M, there are only a few alternatives to petroleum-based chemicals (one is natural gas as a base for polyethylene). ''Beyond that, it becomes very difficult to compete with petroleum, even petroleum at $100 a barrel,'' Dr. Pishko said.
Michael Watts, a professor of geography and development studies at the University of California at Berkeley, agreed. ''The complexity of these hydrocarbons is sort of remarkable,'' he said. Even as a critic of oil dependency, he concedes that petroleum's versatility is impressive: Not only does the American farm and grocery network rely on cheap fuel for low-cost shipping between the coasts, but food itself is grown using petroleum-based fertilizer. (Oil byproducts for food typically fall under federal regulation, although that doesn't satisfy critics of petroleum-derived food colorings, for example.)
What will it take to wean us off oil? Professor Watts says the question forces scrutiny of ''a very complicated set of connections in which what we're confronting, because of this dependency, is not just, 'Let's develop a Prius.' ''
Correction: July 3, 2011, Sunday
A news analysis article on June 26 about the pervasive reach of petroleum into everyday life misstated a substance used in the 18th and 19th centuries to make cosmetics. It was spermaceti, a waxy solid obtained from the oil of cetaceans and from the heads of sperm whales; it was not whale sperm.

HEADLINE: Is This Our Future?

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
THE moment I realized that driving the new Chevrolet Volt was fundamentally a new experience was not when I first turned it on and went around the block. Yes, it was whisper-quiet, powered by its 16-kilowatt-hour, 400-pound battery, but it still felt like a ''normal'' automobile. And it wasn't when I drove the 100 or so miles from Manhattan to Southampton, N.Y., either. Although the battery's range is only about 40 miles, the car kept going even after the battery was drained; it just switched to its gasoline engine, in a transition so seamless I barely noticed it. It wasn't even when I arrived in Southampton that evening and plugged a special cord into an electrical outlet in the garage, to recharge the battery overnight.
No, what made the experience truly different -- and what got me thinking about the Volt's potential to change the way we think about gas consumption -- was what happened after that. 
You know the story of the Volt, don't you? As the General Motors entry in the race to build a viable electric car -- a race that includes the all-electric Nissan Leaf, a raft of Fords in various stages of development and an electric sedan that Tesla will soon begin selling -- it may well be the most hyped American automobile since Lee Iacocca rolled out the Chrysler minivan. Begun four years ago, and championed by the legendary auto executive Bob Lutz, the Volt project managed to survive G.M.'s descent into bankruptcy, and emerge as the company's great, shining hope, a symbol of what American car manufacturers could accomplish. Or so it's been claimed.
Cars like the Leaf and the original Tesla -- a Roadster that cost more than $100,000 -- are ''pure'' electric vehicles powered solely by their batteries. Classic hybrids like the Toyota Prius use a battery as a kind of add-on, to boost the gas mileage of a combustion engine. The Volt, however, is engineered differently. As long as the battery has juice, the car acts like an electric vehicle. When the battery dies, the combustion engine takes over, and it becomes an old-fashioned gas-consuming car. Once you recharge the battery, electricity takes over again.
The experience of driving it meshes with the way we think about using a car. There is no need to plan ahead, for instance, to make sure the car won't run out of battery life before we can recharge it. And the gas engine eliminates the dreaded ''range anxiety'' that prevents most people from embracing an electric vehicle. Indeed, G.M. likes to call the Volt an ''extended range vehicle.'' Motor Trend, the car enthusiasts' bible, was so impressed that it named the Volt its 2011 car of the year.
The Volt went on sale last December. But because Chevrolet has been so cautious in rolling it out -- dealers in only seven states have gotten cars so far, with fewer than 2,500 sold -- it can sometimes seem like the world's most publicized invisible car. (A bigger rollout is planned for next year.) Which is why I asked G.M. if I could test-drive it over the Memorial Day holiday. I wanted to see for myself what all the fuss was about.
For four days, I drove it around town, used it to pick up the groceries, took it to visit friends. Sometimes, when I walked out of a store, someone would be standing next to ''my'' Volt, wanting to ask me questions about it. Though I am no automotive expert, I was pleasantly surprised by the car's power, pickup and handling. ''People think it's going to be a dorkmobile,'' said Mr. Lutz, who retired last year. ''But it's fun to drive.''
Here's what really got me, though: on the dashboard, alongside the gauge that measures the battery life, the Volt has another gauge that calculates the vehicle's miles per gallon. During the two-hour drive to Southampton, I used two gallons of gas, a quarter of the tank. Thus, when I drove into the driveway, it read 50 miles per gallon.
The next day, after the overnight charge, I didn't use any gas. After driving around 30 miles in the morning, I recharged it for a few hours while I puttered around the house. (It takes 10 hours to fully recharge, unless you buy a special 240-volt recharging unit.) That gave the battery 10 miles, more than enough to get me where I needed to go that evening on battery power alone. Before I knew it, my miles per gallon for that tankful of gas had hit 80. By the next day it had topped 100. I soon found myself obsessed with increasing my miles per gallon -- and avoiding having to buy more gas. Whenever I got home from an errand, I would recharge it, even for a few hours, just to grab a few more miles of range. I was actually in control of how much gas I consumed, and it was a powerful feeling. By the time I gave the car back to General Motors, I had driven 300 miles, without using another drop of gas beyond the original two gallons. I'm not what you'd call a Sierra Club kind of guy, but I have to tell you: I was kind of proud of myself.
When I began to describe for Mr. Lutz the psychological effect the Volt had had on me, he chuckled. ''Yeah,'' he said, ''it's like playing a video game that is constantly giving you back your score.''
PEOPLE who follow the car business like to say that this particular moment in automotive history is the closest we'll ever come to seeing what the industry was like a century ago. Back then, there were dozens of auto companies, all experimenting with different ways to power a car, a race ultimately won by the gasoline-powered combustion engine. For good reason: nothing else provided more power, more efficiently.
Now the race is on to come up with an affordable, mass-market electric car. Everybody in the game has a different theory about how to go about it. Elon Musk, the PayPal co-founder who is the driving force behind Tesla, built his original Roadster by strapping together nearly 7,000 lithium ion cells -- essentially laptop batteries -- that consume the bulk of the car's mass. (It's a two-seater in part because there is no room for anything else but batteries.) Although his Roadster will never be a mass-market car -- in fact, it's being phased out in favor of Tesla's new Model S Sedan -- Mr. Musk has claimed victory because, he says, the car, with a range of well over 100 miles, offers ''proof of concept'' that an electric vehicle can be built to go long distances between charges. Starting at $57,400, the Model S is about half the price of the original sports car.
Carlos Ghosn, the flamboyant chief executive of Nissan, has made a different kind of bet, placing his chips -- billions of them -- on the $32,780 Leaf, which has a 24-kilowatt-hour battery pack that can get 73 miles to the charge. Mr. Ghosn is said to believe that range anxiety is overblown, and that once people become accustomed to an electric car, 73 miles per charge won't be an issue. Well, maybe in Europe and Japan, but most analysts I spoke to think he's likely to get his head handed to him in America, and I tend to agree.
''We've had 120 years of gasoline dominance,'' said Lindsay Brooke, a senior editor of Automotive Engineering International Magazine. ''The habits and expectations that have been engendered -- How far will the car go? How quickly can you get it refueled? -- aren't going to go away overnight.'' Americans like the idea that they can get in their cars and drive halfway across the country -- even if they never actually do it.
Besides, nobody yet knows what kind of infrastructure will develop around the electric car. Is lithium ion ultimately the right battery chemistry? How quickly will the cost of the battery -- which is the most expensive feature in an electric car -- come down? When will the battery size shrink, and its power increase?
ONE of the reasons there is so much experimentation right now is that no one knows how this is all going to play out. Until some answers begin to emerge, it is highly unlikely that any electric car will gain mass acceptance. Early adopters may be willing to give an electric car a chance, but the rest of us won't. Most people want to drive proven technologies, not roll-of-the-dice bets.
Which is also why the Volt is such an appealing alternative -- ''the right answer for right now,'' said Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst with the automotive Web site edmunds.com. It gives people a taste of the electric car experience without sacrificing any of the things we expect in a gas-powered car. In fact, the Volt's engineering is a direct byproduct of G.M.'s dismal experience with its original electric car, the legendary EV1, which had more or less the same range as the Leaf. Between 1996 and 1999, G.M. leased 800 EV1's, but faced with mounting costs, they were all repossessed at the end of production.
Chris Paine directed a scathing documentary about G.M.'s decision to kill the EV1, called ''Who Killed The Electric Car?,'' which blamed the failure on the automaker's perfidy, but G.M. has always been convinced that the real culprit was range anxiety. ''People just weren't willing to make the compromises you had to make,'' said Andrew Farah, the Volt's chief engineer, ''starting with the range.''
Mr. Farah, who worked on the EV1, recalled that G.M. used to attach rolling generators to the outside of the car so that the engineers could keep using it even after the battery died; that became the kernel of the idea behind the Volt. For his part, Mr. Lutz was the one who kept insisting that the battery had to be able to achieve 40 miles per charge, a figure he based on the many studies that showed that the vast majority of Americans drove 40 miles or fewer per day.
(The government officially puts the Volt's battery range at 35 miles, but in the right conditions -- warm weather, flat terrain -- the range can go as high as 50 miles. During the time I drove the Volt, the battery range was consistently in the low 40s.)
That insistence gave rise to some inevitable compromises. The battery can't be under the hood because a combustion engine is still there. So G.M. had to eliminate the middle seat in the back to make space for the big T-shaped battery the Volt required. Its small body, originally modeled on the Camaro, had to be made more aerodynamic because that was the only way to hit the 40 mile-per-charge mark.
And for a car intended for the mass market, it's awfully expensive. The Volt retails for around $41,000; from what I hear, that's pretty much what it costs to build. G.M.'s profits on this first iteration of the Volt, in other words, are essentially zero. Though there is currently a $7,500 tax credit on electric car purchases -- the first tax incentive for hybrid gas-electric cars was introduced during the presidency of George W. Bush, in case you were wondering -- it won't last forever. Consumer Reports has advised readers to avoid the Volt because it costs too much. G.M. badly needs battery technology to keep improving, both so that it can lower the cost of its electric cars, and begin making Volt-like vehicles in other sizes and shapes, including wagons and S.U.V.'s that will attract families. That's the only way it will finally reach the mass market.
Having said all that, driving it did convince me of two things. The first is that, Consumer Reports notwithstanding, the Volt has a better chance of success than anything else on the market. Yes, G.M.'s track record for making cars people want has not exactly been inspiring in recent years. But the company has been through hell and back, and a good number of the institutional impediments that prevented it from making good cars are now gone.
Though the Volt has its share of flaws, it is unquestionably a good car. More to the point, as I discovered when I drove it, the Volt makes sense for the economic and cultural moment we're in now. The psychological grip it held me in, the smugness I felt as I drove past gas stations, the way it implicitly encouraged me to stick with battery power as much as I could -- others are going to feel that as well. Somewhat to my surprise, I actually felt a pang of enviro-guilt when I gave the car back and returned to my gas-guzzling ways. Mr. Farah told me that Volt owners often drove 1,000 miles or more before they needed to buy gasoline. I believe it. It has extremely high word-of-mouth potential.
The second thing it convinced me of is that the electric car is no longer some environmental pipe dream. Several years ago, I drove the Tesla, and though it was a wonderful experience, its high price and limited utility did not give me confidence that electric cars were ready for prime time. The Volt has made a believer out of me. At this moment of maximum uncertainty about how the future will play out, the Volt is comforting in its combination of new technology and old. Eventually, we'll have batteries that can get 300 miles per charge, and an infrastructure solution that will replace gas stations. Eventually.
In the meantime, we've got the Volt. It's a start.
Correction: July 3, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The cover article on June 26 about the future of the electric car described incorrectly the batteries for the Chevrolet Volt and the Nissan Leaf. The Volt has a 16-kilowatt-hour battery, not a 16-kilowatt. The Leaf has a 24-kilowatt-hour battery pack, not a 24- kilowatt.The article also referred incorrectly to the engine that won the race in automotive innovation a century ago. It was the gasoline-powered combustion engine, not a combustible engine.
A chart with the continuation of the article, comparing four car models, misstated the electricity- only range of the Toyota Prius. It is one mile, not 13. (A plug-in version, which is to go on sale next year, will have a 13-mile electric-only range.) The chart also referred imprecisely to the charging time of the Nissan Leaf. It is 8 hours with a 240-volt charger, and 21 hours with a 120-volt charger. Finally, the chart omitted the eligibility of two of the models for a tax credit; like the Chevrolet Volt, the Tesla Roadster and the Nissan Leaf are eligible for a $7,500 federal tax credit.

HEADLINE: Even for Cashiers, College Pays Off

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
David Leonhardt is a columnist for the business section of The New York Times.

 BODY:
ALMOST a century ago, the United States decided to make high school nearly universal. Around the same time, much of Europe decided that universal high school was a waste. Not everybody, European intellectuals argued, should go to high school.
It's clear who made the right decision. The educated American masses helped create the American century, as the economists Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz have written. The new ranks of high school graduates made factories more efficient and new industries possible.
Today, we are having an updated version of the same debate. Television, newspapers and blogs are filled with the case against college for the masses: It saddles students with debt; it does not guarantee a good job; it isn't necessary for many jobs. Not everybody, the skeptics say, should go to college. 
The argument has the lure of counterintuition and does have grains of truth. Too many teenagers aren't ready to do college-level work. Ultimately, though, the case against mass education is no better than it was a century ago.
The evidence is overwhelming that college is a better investment for most graduates than in the past. A new study even shows that a bachelor's degree pays off for jobs that don't require one: secretaries, plumbers and cashiers. And, beyond money, education seems to make people happier and healthier.
''Sending more young Americans to college is not a panacea,'' says David Autor, an M.I.T. economist who studies the labor market. ''Not sending them to college would be a disaster.''
The most unfortunate part of the case against college is that it encourages children, parents and schools to aim low. For those families on the fence -- often deciding whether a student will be the first to attend -- the skepticism becomes one more reason to stop at high school. Only about 33 percent of young adults get a four-year degree today, while another 10 percent receive a two-year degree.
So it's important to dissect the anti-college argument, piece by piece. It obviously starts with money. Tuition numbers can be eye-popping, and student debt has increased significantly. But there are two main reasons college costs aren't usually a problem for those who graduate.
First, many colleges are not very expensive, once financial aid is taken into account. Average net tuition and fees at public four-year colleges this past year were only about $2,000 (though Congress may soon cut federal financial aid).
Second, the returns from a degree have soared. Three decades ago, full-time workers with a bachelor's degree made 40 percent more than those with only a high-school diploma. Last year, the gap reached 83 percent. College graduates, though hardly immune from the downturn, are also far less likely to be unemployed than non-graduates.
Skeptics like to point out that the income gap isn't rising as fast as it once was, especially for college graduates who don't get an advanced degree. But the gap remains enormous -- and bigger than ever. Skipping college because the pace of gains has slowed is akin to skipping your heart medications because the pace of medical improvement isn't what it used to be.
The Hamilton Project, a research group in Washington, has just finished a comparison of college with other investments. It found that college tuition in recent decades has delivered an inflation-adjusted annual return of more than 15 percent. For stocks, the historical return is 7 percent. For real estate, it's less than 1 percent.
Another study being released this weekend -- by Anthony Carnevale and Stephen J. Rose of Georgetown -- breaks down the college premium by occupations and shows that college has big benefits even in many fields where a degree is not crucial.
Construction workers, police officers, plumbers, retail salespeople and secretaries, among others, make significantly more with a degree than without one. Why? Education helps people do higher-skilled work, get jobs with better-paying companies or open their own businesses.
This follows the pattern of the early 20th century, when blue- and white-collar workers alike benefited from having a high-school diploma.
When confronted with such data, skeptics sometimes reply that colleges are mostly a way station for smart people. But that's not right either. Various natural experiments -- like teenagers' proximity to a campus, which affects whether they enroll -- have shown that people do acquire skills in college.
Even a much-quoted recent study casting doubt on college education, by an N.Y.U. sociologist and two other researchers, was not so simple. It found that only 55 percent of freshmen and sophomores made statistically significant progress on an academic test. But the margin of error was large enough that many more may have made progress. Either way, the general skills that colleges teach, like discipline and persistence, may be more important than academics anyway.
None of this means colleges are perfect. Many have abysmal graduation rates. Yet the answer is to improve colleges, not abandon them. Given how much the economy changes, why would a high-school diploma forever satisfy most citizens' educational needs?
Or think about it this way: People tend to be clear-eyed about this debate in their own lives. For instance, when researchers asked low-income teenagers how much more college graduates made than non-graduates, the teenagers made excellent estimates. And in a national survey, 94 percent of parents said they expected their child to go to college.
Then there are the skeptics themselves, the professors, journalists and others who say college is overrated. They, of course, have degrees and often spend tens of thousands of dollars sending their children to expensive colleges.
I don't doubt that the skeptics are well meaning. But, in the end, their case against college is an elitist one -- for me and not for thee. And that's rarely good advice.

HEADLINE: Face to Face With a Mother's Pain

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
SAY, Niger
A CHANCE encounter in a village here between an American medical student traveling with me and a starving African mother was almost too wrenching to handle.
The winners of my annual win-a-trip contest, Saumya Dave of Atlanta, the medical student, and Noreen Connolly, a teacher from Newark, traveled with me to a remote village here in southern Niger. We came across a young mother who was quietly starving beside her thatch-roof hut, along with her two surviving children (two others had already died).
The mother, Miero Finiba, told us that she was eight months pregnant (confirmed by a health card) and had nothing at all to eat in the house (confirmed by her husband). She and her children had last eaten a day earlier, when neighbors -- themselves impossibly poor -- shared some of their food. 
Ms. Finiba was also afflicted with a leg infection that looked gangrenous. That meant that if she didn't starve, she might soon lose her leg -- or, more realistically in a village with no medical clinic, simply die of the infection.
Her two small children, ages 5 and 2, would then be at great risk of dying without their mother to look after them. The father is blind, from a disease called river blindness, which is transmitted by black flies, and cannot cultivate the fields.
It was at that point in the conversation that Ms. Dave choked and teared up. ''Is there anything we can do?'' she asked.
That was exactly the right response. Journalists should keep a certain distance, yes, but that doesn't mean that we dispassionately chronicle the death of a starving mother and her children. Ms. Dave was embarrassed that she had lost her composure, but I wish more people would feel the same distress as a food crisis spreads around the developing world.
Global food prices are spiking, not yet reaching their peak of July 2008 but heading there. The World Bank calculates that rising food prices pushed 44 million more people into poverty in the latter half of 2010.
What normally happens is that we wait for a famine, and then rush in with emergency rations. But that's extremely expensive, and it also comes too late -- even for survivors.
Research in recent years has established that hunger in the prenatal period and in infancy deprives a child of the nourishment the brain needs to grow properly. For example, babies who were in the uterus during the 1944 ''Dutch famine'' of World War II did worse on mental tests than those of similar ages -- even 60 years later.
So what can we do, particularly in an era when we face our own severe spending constraints?
There are inexpensive steps that can help avert this kind of hunger. I talked about one low-tech solution in my last column: greater encouragement of breast-feeding, which one study says could save 1.4 million lives a year.
We can also insist that governments in the developing world reduce suffocating corruption that raises transit costs. On both the Mauritania/Senegal and Niger/Burkina Faso borders, we saw huge numbers of trucks lined up, waiting to be ''inspected'' by customs officials -- which in Africa often means paying a bribe. That's disgraceful and adds to food prices.
In Niger, we also visited a village savings-and-loan project established by CARE that helps women start small businesses. Essentially, it's a microsavings project, so that women have a nest egg when it's needed to buy food.
One woman we talked to had started in such penury that four of her children had died of starvation or disease. But with CARE's help, she started preparing black-eyed peas for sale, branched into growing peanuts and fattening sheep, and with her profits bought a motorcycle that is rented out as a taxi.
And in eastern Burkina Faso, we visited a project of Helen Keller International, financed by the United States aid agency, that shows village women how to grow gardens of high-nutrition vegetables. These gardens create a safety net and ensure that babies get vitamin A and other nutrients.
The Obama administration has promoted aid programs that boost agricultural output to fight malnutrition and poverty. That's not as catchy as setting up emergency feeding clinics in a famine-devastated land, but it's far cheaper to avert the crisis than to wait for it.
Another crucial need is family planning, which some of the women I talked to hadn't even heard of. That would reduce the pressure on the land and the number of mouths to feed.
And Ms. Finiba, eight months pregnant and starving? With the help of Helen Keller International we were able to get her food and, it seems, medical care. But rising food prices may put millions more into Ms. Finiba's sandals, just as donor countries' budgets are under pressure.
We need more people raising Ms. Dave's teary question: Is there anything we can do?
The answer is: Yes, definitely!

HEADLINE: Bridge Comes to San Francisco With a Made-in-China Label

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA; Xu Yan contributed research.

 BODY:
SHANGHAI -- Talk about outsourcing.
At a sprawling manufacturing complex here, hundreds of Chinese laborers are now completing work on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.
Next month, the last four of more than two dozen giant steel modules -- each with a roadbed segment about half the size of a football field -- will be loaded onto a huge ship and transported 6,500 miles to Oakland. There, they will be assembled to fit into the eastern span of the new Bay Bridge.
The project is part of China's continual move up the global economic value chain -- from cheap toys to Apple iPads to commercial jetliners -- as it aims to become the world's civil engineer.
The assembly work in California, and the pouring of the concrete road surface, will be done by Americans. But construction of the bridge decks and the materials that went into them are a Made in China affair. California officials say the state saved hundreds of millions of dollars by turning to China. 
''They've produced a pretty impressive bridge for us,'' Tony Anziano, a program manager at the California Department of Transportation, said a few weeks ago. He was touring the 1.2-square-mile manufacturing site that the Chinese company created to do the bridge work. ''Four years ago, there were just steel plates here and lots of orange groves.''
On the reputation of showcase projects like Beijing's Olympic-size airport terminal and the mammoth hydroelectric Three Gorges Dam, Chinese companies have been hired to build copper mines in the Congo, high-speed rail lines in Brazil and huge apartment complexes in Saudi Arabia.
In New York City alone, Chinese companies have won contracts to help renovate the subway system, refurbish the Alexander Hamilton Bridge over the Harlem River and build a new Metro-North train platform near Yankee Stadium. As with the Bay Bridge, American union labor would carry out most of the work done on United States soil.
American steelworker unions have disparaged the Bay Bridge contract by accusing the state of California of sending good jobs overseas and settling for what they deride as poor-quality Chinese steel. Industry groups in the United States and other countries have raised questions about the safety and quality of Chinese workmanship on such projects. Indeed, China has had quality control problems ranging from tainted milk to poorly built schools.
But executives and officials who have awarded the various Chinese contracts say their audits have convinced them of the projects' engineering integrity. And they note that with the full financial force of the Chinese government behind its infrastructure companies, the monumental scale of the work, and the prices bid, are hard for private industry elsewhere to beat.
The new Bay Bridge, expected to open to traffic in 2013, will replace a structure that has never been quite the same since the 1989 Bay Area earthquake. At $7.2 billion, it will be one of the most expensive structures ever built. But California officials estimate that they will save at least $400 million by having so much of the work done in China. (California issued bonds to finance the project, and will look to recoup the cost through tolls.)
California authorities say they had little choice but to rebuild major sections of the bridge, despite repairs made after the earthquake caused a section of the eastern span to collapse onto the lower deck. Seismic safety testing persuaded the state that much of the bridge needed to be overhauled and made more quake-resistant.
Eventually, the California Department of Transportation decided to revamp the western span of the bridge (which connects San Francisco to Yerba Buena Island) and replace the 2.2-mile eastern span (which links Yerba Buena to Oakland).
On the eastern span, officials decided to build a suspension bridge with a complex design. The span will have a single, 525-foot tower, anchored to bedrock and supported by a single, enormous steel-wire cable that threads through the suspension bridge.
''We wanted something strong and secure, but we also wanted something iconic,'' said Bart Ney, a transportation department spokesman.
A joint venture between two American companies, American Bridge and Fluor Enterprises, won the prime contract for the project in early 2006. Their bid specified getting much of the fabricated steel from overseas, to save money.
California decided not to apply for federal funding for the project because the ''Buy America'' provisos would probably have required purchasing more expensive steel and fabrication from United States manufacturers.
China, the world's biggest steel maker, was the front-runner, particularly because it has dominated bridge building for the last decade. Several years ago, Shanghai opened a 20-mile sea bridge; the country is now planning a much longer one near Hong Kong.
The selection of the state-owned Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries Company was a surprise, though, because the company made port cranes and had no bridge building experience.
But California officials and executives at American Bridge said Zhenhua's advantages included its huge steel fabrication facilities, its large low-cost work force and its solid finances. (The company even had its own port and ships.)
''I don't think the U.S. fabrication industry could put a project like this together,'' Brian A. Petersen, project director for the American Bridge/Fluor Enterprises joint venture, said in a telephone interview. ''Most U.S. companies don't have these types of warehouses, equipment or the cash flow. The Chinese load the ships, and it's their ships that deliver to our piers.''
Despite the American union complaints, former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, strongly backed the project and even visited Zhenhua's plant last September, praising ''the workers that are building our Bay Bridge.''
Zhenhua put 3,000 employees to work on the project: steel-cutters, welders, polishers and engineers. The company built the main bridge tower, which was shipped in mid-2009, and a total of 28 bridge decks -- the massive triangular steel structures that will serve as the roadway platform.
Pan Zhongwang, a 55-year-old steel polisher, is a typical Zhenhua worker. He arrives at 7 a.m. and leaves at 11 p.m., often working seven days a week. He lives in a company dorm and earns about $12 a day.
''It used to be $9 a day, now it's $12,'' he said Wednesday morning, while polishing one of the decks for the new Bay Bridge. ''Everything is getting more expensive. They should raise our pay.''
To ensure the bridge meets safety standards, 250 employees and consultants working for the state of California and American Bridge/Fluor also took up residence in Shanghai.
Asked about reports that some American labor groups had blocked bridge shipments from arriving in Oakland, Mr. Anziano dismissed those as confused.
''That was not about China,'' he said. ''It was a disagreement between unions about which had jurisdiction and who had the right to unload a shipment. That was resolved.''

HEADLINE: A Clubhouse (With Banjo) For Anglers

BYLINE: By MIKI MEEK

 BODY:
SOMETHING is clearly going on behind that modest blue door near the East River waterfront in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Burlap sacks cover the windows, but music and laughter spill out. Strolling by, you might mistake it for a cozy house party.
But wander in and you will discover an old-timey dude's world called Brooklyn Rod and Gun, a fishing club that welcomes anyone willing to follow a few simple rules: ''No booze in. No booze out. Throw your peanut shells on the floor.'' Black waders dangle from a coat rack, a four-foot bass sprawls across a wall, and dim lamps illuminate a long wooden worktable where members commune over fly-tying and American roots music. 
''I've lived in this neighborhood since the 1980s, when there were a lot of Polish and Italian social clubs, and I was always inspired by that idea of creating your own community center,'' said Chris Raymond, 48, a fly-fishing enthusiast and the information-technology director for Abrams Books. His signature accessory is a worn red baseball cap stitched with the words ''Fish Pimp.''
So two years ago, when he was between jobs, Mr. Raymond organized a weekly hangout with 11 other mostly unemployed, musically inclined fathers in a two-story, 800-square-foot former warehouse they rented on an industrial stretch of Kent Avenue near North 11th Street.
The agenda? Listening to records, drinking beer and talking about the great outdoors. They built their own furniture and tacked up fishing maps of the Catskills and Newtown Creek. They jammed on their guitars or headed to the ragged shore nearby to catch moss bunker and bluefish.
Curious passers-by and friends of friends started dropping in. Now there are 80 members, and events almost every night of the week: hootenannies on Sundays, fly-tying tutorials on Mondays, secret-cinema night on Tuesdays and a rotating cast of small bands with names like the Buddy Hollers and the Calamity Janes on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Events are listed, along with photos of past outings, on bklynrodandgun.com, the club's Web site. Members pay $100 to join, but anyone can get in for $10 a night. Though the crowd is predominantly male, women, families and even pets mix in. And despite the ''gun'' in its name, the group has not arranged any shooting events.
One member, Dewey Thompson, 50, described the club as a ''real piece of hangout,'' supplemented by the occasional boating trip, upstate hike or summer campout at an outdoor garden shop next door. The gatherings feel a bit like family reunions. The standard greeting is a fierce handshake or hug, and every once in a while somebody pulls up with a car trunk full of fresh fish and oysters for the grill on the sidewalk out front.
''There's a real kinship and camaraderie I haven't found where I live,'' said Bob Kowalski, 46, who comes to the club three times a week from Newtown, Conn., about 80 miles away. ''The other night, I was here until 3 a.m. I drove home, then turned around and came back the next evening.''
On a recent Friday night, Mr. Kowalski sat with his friend Walter Sipser, 49, in the loft space over the club's main room, trying to get a poker game off the ground. They poured glasses of whiskey and cracked cans of beer to the twang of a banjo played by a bearded man below.
Somebody propped open the door to the club, and pedestrians outside slowed their pace to listen. A few clapped to the bluegrass beat.
''Yes, this is a clubhouse, but it's a very welcome one,'' Mr. Sipser said. ''We're always like: 'Come on in! Come hang out.' ''

HEADLINE: Behind Gay Marriage, an Unlikely Mix of Forces

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO; Danny Hakim contributed reporting.

 BODY:
In the 35th-floor conference room of a Manhattan high-rise, two of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's most trusted advisers held a secret meeting a few weeks ago with a group of super-rich Republican donors.
Over tuna and turkey sandwiches, the advisers explained that New York's Democratic governor was determined to legalize same-sex marriage and would deliver every possible Senate vote from his own party.
Would the donors win over the deciding Senate Republicans? It sounded improbable: top Republican moneymen helping a Democratic rival with one of his biggest legislative goals.
But the donors in the room -- the billionaire Paul Singer, whose son is gay, joined by the hedge fund managers Cliff Asness and Daniel Loeb -- had the influence and the money to insulate nervous senators from conservative backlash if they supported the marriage measure. And they were inclined to see the issue as one of personal freedom, consistent with their more libertarian views. 
Within days, the wealthy Republicans sent back word: They were on board. Each of them cut six-figure checks to the lobbying campaign that eventually totaled more than $1 million.
Steve Cohen, the No. 2 in Mr. Cuomo's office and a participant in the meeting, began to see a path to victory, telling a colleague, ''This might actually happen.''
The story of how same-sex marriage became legal in New York is about shifting public sentiment and individual lawmakers moved by emotional appeals from gay couples who wish to be wed.
But, behind the scenes, it was really about a Republican Party reckoning with a profoundly changing power dynamic, where Wall Street donors and gay-rights advocates demonstrated more might and muscle than a Roman Catholic hierarchy and an ineffective opposition.
And it was about a Democratic governor, himself a Catholic, who used the force of his personality and relentlessly strategic mind to persuade conflicted lawmakers to take a historic leap.
''I can help you,'' Mr. Cuomo assured them in dozens of telephone calls and meetings, at times pledging to deploy his record-high popularity across the state to protect them in their districts. ''I am more of an asset than the vote will be a liability.''
Over the last several weeks, dozens of lawmakers, strategists and advocates described the closed-door meetings and tactical decisions that led to approval of same-sex marriage in New York, about two years after it was rejected by the Legislature. This account is based on those interviews, most of which were granted on the condition of anonymity to describe conversations that were intended to be confidential.
'I Have to Do This'
Mr. Cuomo was diplomatic but candid with gay-rights advocates in early March when he summoned them to the Capitol's Red Room, a ceremonial chamber with stained-glass windows and wood-paneled walls.
The advocates had contributed to the defeat of same-sex marriage in 2009, he told them, with their rampant infighting and disorganization. He had seen it firsthand, as attorney general, when organizers had given him wildly divergent advice about which senators to lobby and when, sometimes in bewildering back-to-back telephone calls. ''You can either focus on the goal, or we can spend a lot of time competing and destroying ourselves,'' the governor said.
This time around, the lobbying had to be done the Cuomo way: with meticulous, top-down coordination. ''I will be personally involved,'' he said.
The gay-rights advocates agreed, or at least acquiesced. Five groups pushing for same-sex marriage merged into a single coalition, hired a prominent consultant with ties to Mr. Cuomo's office, Jennifer Cunningham, and gave themselves a new name: New Yorkers United for Marriage.
Those who veered from the script faced swift reprimand. When Assemblyman Daniel J. O'Donnell, an openly gay Democrat from Manhattan, introduced a same-sex marriage bill in May without first alerting the governor's office, he was upbraided by Mr. Cohen. ''What do you think you're doing?'' the governor's aide barked over the phone.
Mr. Cuomo's hands-on management was a turning point not just for the marriage movement, but also for his long and fraught relationship with the gay community. Advocates groused that he had waited until 2006 to endorse same-sex marriage, years after many leading New York political leaders did so. And many of them still remembered his work on his father's unsuccessful 1977 bid for mayor of New York, which had featured homophobic posters aimed at Edward I. Koch.
Over time, however, championing same-sex marriage had become personal for Mr. Cuomo. He campaigned on the issue in the race for governor last year, and after his election, he was staggered by the number of gay couples who sought him out at restaurants and on the street, prodding him, sometimes tearfully, to deliver on his word.
The pressure did not let up at home. Mr. Cuomo's girlfriend, Sandra Lee, has an openly gay brother, and she frequently reminded the governor how much she wanted the law to change.
Something else weighed on him, too: the long shadow of his father, Mario, who rose to national prominence as the conscience of the Democratic Party, passionately defending the poor and assailing the death penalty. During his first few months in office, the younger Mr. Cuomo had achieved what seemed like modern-day miracles by the standards of Albany -- an austere on-time budget and a deal to cap property taxes. But, as Mr. Cuomo explained by phone to his father a few weeks ago, he did not want those accomplishments to define his first year in office.
''They are operational,'' he told his father. Passing same-sex marriage, by contrast, ''is at the heart of leadership and progressive government.''
''I have to do this.''
A Democratic Surprise
Nobody ever expected Carl Kruger to vote yes.
A Democrat from Brooklyn, known for his gruff style and shifting alliances, Senator Kruger voted against same-sex marriage two years ago, was seen as a pariah in his party and was accused in March of taking $1 million in bribes in return for political favors.
Some gay activists, assuming he was a lost cause, had taken to picketing outside of his house and screaming that he was gay -- an approach that seemed only to harden his opposition to their agenda. (Mr. Kruger has said he is not gay.) But unbeknown to all but a few people, Mr. Kruger desperately wanted to change his vote. The issue, it turned out, was tearing apart his household.
The gay nephew of the woman he lives with, Dorothy Turano, was so furious at Mr. Kruger for opposing same-sex marriage two years ago that he had cut off contact with both of them, devastating Ms. Turano. ''I don't need this,'' Mr. Kruger told Senator John L. Sampson of Brooklyn, the Democratic majority leader. ''It has gotten personal now.''
Mr. Sampson, a longtime supporter of same-sex marriage, advised Mr. Kruger to focus on the nephew, not the political repercussions. ''When everything else is gone,'' Mr. Sampson told him, ''all you have left is family.''
With Mr. Kruger suddenly a possible yes vote, the same-sex marriage organizers zeroed in on the two remaining Democrats who had previously voted no but appeared open to switching sides: Shirley L. Huntley and Joseph P. Addabbo Jr., both of Queens.
Senator Huntley, a close friend of Mr. Sampson, had privately assured him that she would support the marriage bill, largely out of personal loyalty to him and fellow Democrats.
Persuading Senator Addabbo proved trickier. Same-sex marriage advocates had nicknamed him the Counter, after he told them his vote would hinge entirely on a tally of his constituents who appealed to him for or against the measure. By mid-May, Mr. Addabbo sent word to Mr. Cuomo that the numbers were not there for same-sex marriage.
Until then, members of the same-sex marriage coalition had deliberately refrained from inundating Mr. Addabbo's office with feedback from supporters of the bill, fearing it might alienate and offend him. But now, the advocates received a message from the governor's office: Open the floodgates. Brian Ellner, who oversees the marriage push for the Human Rights Campaign, called the head of his field team, who had compiled an exhaustive list of supporters of gay rights in Mr. Addabbo's district.
''Bury him in paper,'' Mr. Ellner said.
Over the next week, the field team collected postcards signed by 2,000 of Mr. Addabbo's constituents who favor same-sex marriage, twice as many as he had received in the previous few months combined.
When his final tally was completed in early June, he had heard from 6,015 people -- 80 percent of whom asked him to vote yes. ''In the end, that is my vote,'' Mr. Addabbo said.
Republicans Resist
In a private room at the Fort Orange Club, a stately brick manor in Albany where the waitresses still wear French maid uniforms, a pollster laid out the results of his research on gay marriage for Senate Republicans in early June.
There was little political rationale for legalizing it, the numbers suggested: statewide support did not extend deeply into the rural, upstate districts that are crucial to the state's Republican Party. And with unemployment at 9 percent, the issue was far down the list of priorities for voters.
Many of the Republicans wanted to avoid ever taking a vote on the issue -- a simple strategy to carry out. As the majority party in the Senate, they could block any bill from reaching the floor.
But the caucus -- a group of 32 senators who had seized control of the Senate in the elections last year but held just a single-seat majority -- was far from unified. And, crucially for same-sex marriage advocates, the Republicans' relatively untested leader showed no interest in forcing them to reach a consensus. ''My management style,'' the Senate majority leader, Dean G. Skelos of Long Island, had told lawmakers, ''is that I let my members lead.''
Mr. Cuomo was determined to exploit the leadership vacuum by peeling off a few senators from moderate districts.
A major target was James S. Alesi, a Republican from suburban Rochester, who seemed tormented by his 2009 vote. Cameras in the Senate chamber captured him holding his head in his hands as the word ''no'' left his mouth.
The coalition approached him from every angle. The Republican donors invited him to a meeting on Park Avenue, telling him they would eagerly support him if he backed same-sex marriage. ''That's not the kind of lily pad I normally hop on,'' Mr. Alesi recalled.
The advocates collected 5,000 signed postcards from his constituents and nudged a major employer in his district, Xerox, to endorse the bill.
And Mr. Cuomo called him, over and over, to address his objections and allay his fears. He told Senator Alesi that as the first Republican to endorse same-sex marriage, he ''would show real courage to the gay community.''
On June 13, aides to the governor left urgent messages with same-sex marriage advocates, who had just left a meeting in Mr. Cuomo's office, to return there immediately, offering no explanation.
As the group assembled around a conference table, the governor opened the door to his private office and peeked in. ''I want to introduce the first Republican to support marriage equality,'' he announced.
Mr. Alesi walked into the room, which erupted into applause. In emotional remarks, he apologized to them for what he called his ''political vote'' against same-sex marriage in 2009.
The next day, Bill Smith, a lobbyist for Gill Action, a gay-rights group, turned to the governor and asked, ''How many rabbits are you going to pull out of the hat?''
Outgunned Opponents
It was befuddling to gay-rights advocates: The Catholic Church, arguably the only institution with the authority and reach to derail same-sex marriage, seemed to shrink from the fight.
As the marriage bill hurtled toward a vote, the head of the church in New York, Archbishop Timothy M. Dolan, left town to lead a meeting of bishops in Seattle. He did not travel to Albany or deliver a major speech in the final days of the session. And when he did issue a strongly worded critique of the legislation -- he called it ''immoral'' and an ''ominous threat'' -- it was over the phone to an Albany-area radio show.
Inside the Capitol, where a photograph of Mr. Cuomo shaking hands with Archbishop Dolan hangs in the governor's private office, the low-key approach did not seem accidental. Mr. Cuomo had taken pains to blunt the church's opposition.
When he learned that church leaders had objected to the language of the marriage legislation, he invited its lawyers to the Capitol to vent their frustration.
Mr. Cuomo even spoke to Archbishop Dolan about the push for same-sex marriage, emphasizing his respect and affection for the religious leader. An adviser described the governor's message to Archbishop Dolan this way: ''I have to do what I have to do. But your support over all is very important to me.''
By the time a Catholic bishop from Brooklyn traveled to Albany last week to tell undecided senators that passing same-sex marriage ''is not in keeping with the will of their people,'' it was clear the church had been outmaneuvered by the highly organized same-sex marriage coalition, with its sprawling field team and, especially, its Wall Street donors.
''In many ways,'' acknowledged Dennis Poust, of the New York State Catholic Conference, ''we were outgunned. That is a lot to overcome.''
With the church largely out of the picture, the governor's real worry was the simmering tension in the Senate Republican delegation. Its members met, for hours at a time, to debate the political and moral implications of allowing a vote. But each time new arguments arose. Some questioned whether homosexuality was genetic or chosen. Others suggested that the same-sex marriage legislation be scrapped in favor of a statewide referendum.
Mr. Cuomo invited the Republicans to visit him at the governor's residence, a 40-room Victorian mansion overlooking the Hudson River, just a few blocks from the Capitol.
There, in a speech the public would never hear, he offered his most direct and impassioned case for allowing gays to wed. Gay couples, he said, wanted recognition from the state that they were no different from the lawmakers in the room. ''Their love is worth the same as your love,'' Mr. Cuomo said, according to someone who heard him. ''Their partnership is worth the same as your partnership. And they are equal in your eyes to you. That is the driving issue.''
In the late hours of Friday night, 33 members of the State Senate agreed with him.

HEADLINE: Portrait of a New York Family, Extended

 BODY:
In the Metropolitan cover story last week, N. R. Kleinfield profiled Carol Einhorn and her family -- her son, Griffin; her friend George Russell, Griffin's biological father, who lives with her part time; and Mr. Russell's partner, David Nimmons, with whom he lives the rest of the week. Following are excerpts from reader comments posted on NYTimes.com:
What childish people! This will be the lesson they teach the poor kid: Flake around, build your life around someone eminently unreliable, hold your breath and hope he doesn't run away; ask nothing, expect nothing, give nothing. Accidentally do something serious by having a child, then refuse to commit to the child, and announce that refusal in The New York Times as your child looks on. How terribly sad. 
Amy, Iowa
I found this article incredibly engaging and delightful. Two adults with very different lives and personalities have cooperated to create and nurture a child. They provide him with consistent routines and seem to have a healthy, dynamic relationship of their own. They have discussions and disagreements (which they work out). They have families and other relationships with people, and those others don't always see eye to eye, yet they have worked it out so that Griffin's interactions with those others are positive experiences. They bicker, they chat, they sing, they share feelings and spaces. What's not to love?
S. Jane, Jax, Fla.
Nothing wrong with an unconventional family arrangement. There is, however, something wrong when the child is not put first. This seemed less an article about the shifting makeup of the modern family and more about adults acting like children.
Laurie C, Marina, Calif.
There was just something about this situation that made me cringe. NONE of the adults in his life place Griffin first. I know they are not planning to tell Griffin the truth about ''Uncle George'' yet, but they still opted to put themselves out in the public eye.Marlene, New York
I don't really have any concerns about the family you describe. They manage to pay rent, they manage to take care of the kid, and they seem to be surviving economically. The rest, really, is any of our concern? Also, you think this is an ''unconventional'' family. Based on what norm? The fact is, these families and these arrangements have existed for a very long time. Nothing new, other than now this becomes public.
L.L., Long Island
This setup is known as ''fluid'' if it's some artsy or upper-middle-class folks involved and is perceived as groundbreaking and rather leading-edge. On the other hand, an arrangement like this is ''unstable'' and pretty much looked down upon if someone on welfare is involved. We sure as heck won't get a detailed, intimate look at poor folks as multiple uninvolved or barely involved fathers or significant others drift in and out of their lives. No, the article would probably be more along the lines of all the damage done to children who grow up in such environments.
Tina, Ohio
Why not just write an article about a gay or lesbian couple raising a child -- or is that too mainstream for you at this point? Trust me -- that isn't mainstream outside of N.Y.C. or San Francisco. Articles like this one only confuse people who think that gay marriage is going to result in these types of situations -- and the woman in this article is not even a lesbian!
Debra, formerly from N.Y.C.
This is some sort of bizarre post-''Seinfeld'' episode, right? Elaine fathers a child with a ''blend'' from Jerry & George. Hilarity ensues.
Barnegat Leight, Haven Beach, N.J.
1. These people clearly watched too many episodes of ''Will and Grace.'' 2. These people are rather self-absorbed. But that's redundant, isn't it?
Wasting time, D.C.
I am constantly astonished, as I get older, at the degree of ''baby rabies'' among older, white educated women. WHY do they feel like they MUST have a child to validate themselves? If it was so so so so so important, why not do it when you're younger (especially if you don't think that wedlock is an important part of the formula)? Not to sound ageist, but 48 is really, really, REALLY REALLY old to START with the whole ''baby thing.'' At the end of the day, it's not fair to anyone involved -- when this lady is pushing 70, her kid will just be starting college. Will she have the energy and financial resources to raise this child down the road?
Jen in Astoria, Queens
Good grief. Are there no limits to your campaign of trying to tell us that traditional American values are dead?
Chris, La Jolla, Calif.
The commenters here seem so distressed that this family is unconventional. They assume that the boy will be traumatized by the experience. Reminds me of all the commenters who said that Arnold's illegitimate child would be traumatized. I have two boys and knew exactly what Arnold's son would say when he found out: ''Cool!'' And he did. If the boy has a nice house, good food, friendship and love, he will thrive no matter what the ''home arrangement.'' People who imagine otherwise do not know children very well.
Jack, U.S.A.
These people are conflicted, flawed, kind of privileged, kind of happy. The kid is totally loved and cared for. What is the problem, exactly? They actually thought about having a kid instead of going on autopilot, and they admit to feelings of ambivalence about it. If only more ''traditional'' (read: married, heterosexual) couples raising kids would be so open about their doubts, fears and reservations -- because it's not like they don't have them, too.
CGS, Brooklyn
This story won't seem like an unconventional family soon. Too often in N.Y.C. I see good-looking, smart, accomplished women pushing 40 without a man in their life. That's the question we should ask: where are the men for these women? Women are pushed to achieve, but where does having a baby work in that scenario?
Solomund, Brooklyn

HEADLINE: John Waters, The Artful Dodger

BYLINE: By HILARIE M. SHEETS

 BODY:
''I ALWAYS think of art as animate objects with their own little lives and personalities,'' said John Waters, the filmmaker known for ignoring the boundaries of good taste and bad in movies like ''Pink Flamingos'' and ''Hairspray.'' ''I'm curious about who can live with each other.''
Mr. Waters, also an actor, writer, artist and art collector, is now a museum curator as well. Invited by the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis to plumb its storerooms and make additions to and subtractions from an existing show of works from its collection, Mr. Waters -- in his role as ''Absentee Landlord,'' as he named his installation, which opened this month -- selected what he considered to be uneasy roommates. ''I want to clean house, reward troublemakers and invite crashers,'' he wrote in an introductory wall panel that raises unusual curatorial questions. Who'd be sloppier to live with than Mike Kelley? Who'd copy from Richard Prince, the infamous appropriator? Would Fischli/Weiss and Roman Signer fight over who's more droll? More Swiss? And if all these artists had to live together, would Carl Andre, the austere Minimalist, ever lighten up? 
''It really does feel like John's standing there speaking to you,'' said Betsy Carpenter, curator of the permanent collection at the Walker, of the highly idiosyncratic text. The curatorial staff had originally envisioned that Mr. Waters would do a kind of ''intervention'' to keep the collection galleries lively. But he became so swept up in the project that, with the Walker's blessing, he almost completely overhauled the existing show. He brought in outside loans of artists he collects, including Lee Lozano, Paul Lee and Jess von der Ahe, as well as some of his own conceptual pieces for comic relief. And he tweaked the entire museumgoing experience with additional manipulations of the parking lot, cafe, admissions badges and audio tour.
''Right out of the gate he's asking visitors not to walk through the show with a hyper-serious or intellectual mind-set that they might go into another show with,'' Ms. Carpenter said. ''The history of art is still being told through these objects, but there is this edge of irony and humor.''
At the start of the show a black-curtained doorway emitting muffled audio will have experienced museumgoers walking directly into a wall if they try to enter. Mr. Waters has planted his own Faux Video Room almost as a decoy next to an actual curtained video room screening surreal footage by Superflex, the Danish artists collective, of a waterlogged McDonald's. ''To see McDonald's flooded slowly, there's a kind of beauty in that destruction,'' Mr. Waters said of the piece, which he borrowed from the group's New York gallery. ''You see it now in a completely different way. That's what art is: a magic trick.''
Nearby roommates include Richard Prince's rephotographed ads of model living rooms, which Mr. Waters finds ''incredibly creepy''; a remnant of ''hideous wall-to-wall carpeting'' mounted and painted by Mike Kelley as a monument to Minimalism; and John Currin's painting of a couple on a date, the woman with an elongated Mannerist-style neck and laughing manically. ''That painting is everything the show is about,'' Mr. Waters said during an interview in his New York apartment. ''It's making fun and loving art history. Is this beautiful or hideous? It's both to me.''
While he hopes that people will like the show, Mr. Waters, who is 65, said he knows he's choosing work that can be polarizing. He's been hooked on the power of contemporary art to infuriate people ever since at the age of 8 in the Baltimore Museum gift shop he bought a Miro print that his friends pronounced disgusting and stupid.
In the Walker show he has included some sacred cows, like Willem de Kooning, as a reminder that they weren't always accepted. ''Who's going to have the nerve to say anything bad about him now?'' said Mr. Waters. ''You have to keep him in there to remember that people did.'' He has paired a depiction of a furious woman by de Kooning, the ultramasculine Abstract Expressionist, with Ms. von der Ahe's portrayal of an effeminate Ludwig II painted with her own menstrual blood. ''I liked her work even without knowing what she painted with,'' Mr. Waters said. ''When you find out, you're a little bit taken aback, but good for her, good idea.''
Another room looks as if it contains a cast of characters out of a Waters film. Photographs include Cameron Jamie's shots of women in bikinis wrestling; and personifications of sausages in meat-related environments by Fischli/Weiss, Mr. Waters's favorite team of artists; and Karlheinz Weinberger's big-haired rebel youth pictures from the early '60s. ''They're from Switzerland?'' Mr. Waters deadpanned, observing Weinberger's subjects. ''These people look like Baltimore.'' He's hung his own photograph of a flower, with a barrier line on the floor, which in museum code means don't get too close. If viewers do cross the line, it triggers the flower to squirt them in the face with water like a clown with a gag lapel flower.
''I am serious about my appreciation for art, dead serious, but I find amusing certain things about the art world that I think should be addressed,'' said Mr. Waters, whose own art is represented by the Marianne Boesky Gallery in New York and who was one of five jurors this month at the international art exhibition at the Venice Biennale. Other treats planted around the museum include the John Waters Blue Plate Special, which can be ordered in the cafe -- hungry visitors are served not food but a limited-edition photograph of meat gristle, sprouting potato eyes and the cutoff ends of vegetables -- and an audio tour of the exhibition spoken by Mr. Waters in pig Latin. ''I know people get really upset by impenetrable art-speak, and I wanted to comment on that.''
Mr. Waters compared his stint as guest curator to making his own mixtape and said it was of a piece with his other work. ''Ever since I started collecting art in the late 1980s, it's become another way I tell stories,'' he said. ''I make movies, but I couldn't get a movie made right now with the economy, so I wrote a book,'' he continued, referring to ''Role Models,'' his 2010 memoir. ''In my book I wrote about art. I made the film 'Pecker' in 1998, which is about the contemporary art world -- I think a loving picture of it. It's all one career. I'm telling stories.''

HEADLINE: School's Out, Forever

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
JUST don't cry. That has been Sister Nora McArt's mantra. She has been unflappable in her 42 years at St. Martin of Tours Elementary School in the Bronx, braving the gang fights, racial unrest and crack wars that were waged outside the school and convent in the Crotona neighborhood. No matter the mayhem, she had to be calm for the children.
Until now.
The sight of old textbooks lining the hallways elicits a sniffle. A teacher's hug leaves Sister Nora dabbing at her eyes. And forget about the kindergarten graduation, which left her speechless when she beheld the nine youngsters sitting before the altar in blue caps and gowns. 
''We are honored to have with us the future college graduates of ...'' She paused, bit her lip and looked at the children. Her voice cracked. ''Of ... 20 ... 27.''
Sister Nora praised them for learning about God, reading and respect.
''We look forward to hearing about the progress they make as they continue their educational journey ... elsewhere.''
She made it, barely. The ''elsewhere'' was the killer, as it has been since January, when Sister Nora was told the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York had decided St. Martin's would close after 86 years. Pleas and plans to save the school were received and rejected. Wednesday was the school's final day.
Most of the 104 students at St. Martin's will be scattered to other Catholic schools. The nine lay teachers on the faculty may not be as lucky -- more than 250 teachers are already unemployed throughout the cash-strapped archdiocese, and schools are retrenching.
St. Martin's is among 26 archdiocesan elementary schools closing this month because of the shrinking enrollments and ballooning deficits the Catholic school system has been experiencing for decades. The archdiocese says its closings are the first step in reorganizing and strengthening its remaining schools -- even though teachers at St. Martin's and other schools wonder if the shutdowns only foretell the demise of urban parochial education.
In 1961, the archdiocese had 212,781 students in 414 elementary and high schools. This year, including the schools that are closing, there were 79,782 children at 274 schools.
Before the advent of charter schools, these schools helped generations of immigrant children become Americans and professionals. They continued to propel Latino and African-American children into the middle class after the tumult of the 1960s, when drastic changes washed over both the church and urban America. They were also the source of religious vocations.
Sister Nora, 66, has not had much time for reflection. Much of her time this month was spent running between her office and the classrooms, closing accounts and guiding teachers through the uncomfortable rituals of throwing out books, clearing out classrooms and taking down crucifixes and statues of saints.
''The teachers and I try to hide our feelings from the kids,'' said Sister Nora, who became principal in 2006. ''But when we're in the faculty room, it's another story. We go from anger to resentment to mourning, and back to anger. I just don't know where we're going. What's going to happen to the church? Nobody's thought that far ahead -- not just the parish, but the church in general in New York.''
This school has long been a sanctuary amid uncertainty -- as it was for me starting in 1964, when my parents fled Hunts Point for the safety of Crotona. The fires followed a few years later, and we moved away in 1969. But I still took two buses from Morris Heights -- past blocks reduced to rubble -- until I graduated.
Forget the cheap jokes about ruler-swinging nuns gliding through the aisles in full-length habits. For those of us who saw our neighborhood almost vanish in smoke from arson or crack pipes, Sister Nora stands as a reminder of the sacrifices made happily and gifts given freely by women religious. Through word and deed they taught us the works of mercy: to feed the poor, clothe the naked and educate the ignorant.
To comfort the afflicted.
And now -- 40 years after I walked down the aisle clutching my diploma -- I returned to fulfill a final work of mercy: to bury the dead.
St. Martin's, named after a fourth-century soldier who cut his cloak in half to clothe a beggar, opened in 1925 to serve the children of Italian and Irish working-class parents. During its heyday, almost a thousand pupils packed its 24 classrooms, even into the 1960s, when racial slurs and Molotov cocktails were hurled on the streets over the influx of Latinos and African-Americans in the neighborhood. It was a haven when abandonment and arson almost destroyed the area in the 1970s, and when crack and guns claimed lives in the '90s.
Childhood haunts often seem smaller in later years. But the school and its neighborhood feel more spacious -- and that's the problem. Many residents fled during the blight of the '70s, while others were pushed out by the city to make room for a hospital that was never built. Fewer children were left to draw from, and many of the parents who remained had precarious jobs that disappeared in sour economic times, making it impossible to cover the $3,300 annual tuition.
Five years ago, the archdiocese placed St. Martin's on a list of endangered schools. About 70 students were withdrawn by parents who worried that they would have nowhere to go the following academic year. Although the school won a reprieve, its finances were taken over by archdiocese officials. Sister Nora and her faculty feel as if they never had a chance after that.
But the demographic and economic pressures closing in on parochial schools go well beyond St. Martin's, said Timothy J. McNiff, superintendent of schools for the archdiocese. The era when thriving congregations could support large schools staffed by nuns is long gone, taking with it the very concept of a parochial school.
With higher costs and fewer students, the archdiocese can no longer subsidize schools running on a deficit. St. Martin's, Dr. McNiff said, is expected to post a $397,000 deficit this year.
A plan to address the schools crisis -- which first required closing the weakest ones -- will now examine creating regional schools.
''The parish-based school is not a model that works in many of our parishes,'' Dr. McNiff said. ''We are having to change the governance structure and business model so that we do not have to continue the next few decades enduring the death of a thousand cuts.''
CHRISTINE ALTSCHULER sat in what was her first-grade classroom in the late 1950s. Now, as a first-grade teacher, she had taken lunch breaks with her colleagues in the same room.
''You know what I'll miss?'' Mrs. Altschuler, 58, asked. ''The kids. As a first-grade teacher, I've seen them grow through eight grades. I've taught entire families.''
She struggled to explain her feelings.
''I can't tell you what this school means to me,'' she said. ''I really can't. It's my past. My present. But it won't be my future.''
Though two other current teachers also attended the school, neither had roots that rivaled Mrs. Altschuler's. Three generations of her family taught or studied there. Her father, Alpine Gori, graduated in 1933 with the first class to go through all eight grades.
Mrs. Altschuler graduated from the school in 1966 and returned to teach in 1991 as a favor to her mother, Albina Gori, who was the school's receptionist for 41 years, many of them with Sister Cecilia McCarthy, now 92, the principal from 1967 until 2001.
Mrs. Altschuler's mother -- Mrs. Gori, to hundreds of school kids -- had a way about her, persuading her to come to the school over the years to take pictures at a bazaar, or to videotape a Christmas pageant. Twenty years ago, Mrs. Gori called her daughter with an urgent request.
'' 'Sister Cecilia needs you to volunteer as a teacher,' '' Mrs. Altschuler recalled. '' 'I told her you could do it. You have to.' ''
Mrs. Altschuler smiled.
''And years later, I wound up doing the same thing to my daughter,'' she said, laughing. ''I called her up one day and said, 'Sister needs you to teach!' ''
Samantha Altschuler, now 28, joined her mother in 2009 -- replacing a popular teacher who had fallen ill -- and most recently taught reading and social studies to the upper grades. They commuted together from their home in Throgs Neck, making the pain of the last few months bearable.
As long as nobody discussed homework.
In recent weeks, the teachers asked students to write essays about their memories of the school. One wrote about the day a friend tossed a boomerang out the window. Another told of feeling as if no one knew he existed, until he made new friends at the school. Alexis Lewis, a seventh grader, insisted that Sister Nora was not as strict as others thought.
''I think she just wanted to push us and prepare us for the real world,'' Alexis wrote. ''When my sister passed away, out of the kindness of her heart she contacted every archdiocesan school in the Bronx and politely asked for their prayers.''
Crotona felt like the suburbs when Sister Nora arrived in 1969. She had come from her first teaching assignment, at St. John Chrysostom, near the infamous Fort Apache police station in the South Bronx. She moved into a convent that was home to 14 other nuns and a German shepherd named Pepper.
Today, Sister Nora lives alone in the run-down building.
She and her two sisters grew up in the Yorkville neighborhood of Manhattan, where her father drove a beer-delivery truck. He died when she was at Cathedral High School in Turtle Bay, where she first encountered members of the Dominican order from Sparkill, N.Y. She liked their easy manner and rapport. She joined the order in 1963, a year after graduating.
''There were 56 of us when I got to Sparkill,'' she recalled. ''The mother general called us her Joyful Mysteries.''
Not long after she arrived at St. Martin's, Sister Nora's order adopted reforms that allowed members to pursue careers beyond teaching or child care. Others left with the upheaval that swept the church after the Second Vatican Council. From her entering class, only six women remain in the order.
''We only have one novice right now at the motherhouse,'' Sister Nora said. ''The older nuns call me the Kid. There are going to be significant changes in religious communities. Life is not going to be the same because of the lack of vocations.''
With St. Martin's closing, Sister Nora will teach English at an immigrant services agency run by her order in the west Bronx. Her stipend will be $16,000 -- half what she received at the school -- and there will be no benefits. ''But at least I'll be working with people in need,'' she said.
ALL through the spring, few people associated with St. Martin's would confront the inevitable. Students wished aloud that they could redo the school year. Teachers forgot to start their annual vacation countdown. For many, there was nothing to look forward to beyond unemployment.
Zahriymar Lassalle, 31, who taught second grade, has seen the institutions that first educated and then employed her slowly vanish. Her grammar school, St. John Vianney, in the east Bronx, is closing this year, while St. Simon Stock, near Fordham, where she taught for a year, has downsized. She earned tenure this year at St. Martin's.
Her prospects are slim.
''It's just too much of a risk to be teaching in Catholic schools,'' Ms. Lassalle said. ''Honestly, I feel they are going to disappear, little by little. The economy is bad, and the people who can't afford it are not getting the help they need. And the price keeps going up. And in neighborhoods like this, it's difficult to keep the kids in Catholic school.''
Upstairs, Antonio Soto, 51, led his eighth-grade science class through a lesson on the elements, mixing goofy enthusiasm with unshakable confidence.
''Come on!'' he said, sitting among his students. ''Let's recite the first 20 elements.''
The class tore through the list.
''Some high school teachers won't think you can do that,'' Mr. Soto said. ''But you do. And when they ask you, 'Where do you come from?' Tell them. You're from St. Martin of Tours.''
Chika Amaefule, 42, a parent, knows public school would ease the burden on her family's budget -- she and her husband work to put their four children through Catholic school. And while she is aware that some charter schools offer more programs, that option is not enough to put her at ease.
''There is opportunity in public school, but there are a lot of distractions,'' said Ms. Amaefule, who is from Nigeria. ''Some things they allow in public schools are disruptive. There is discipline in Catholic schools.''
THE devotional nooks flanking the sanctuary in St. Martin of Tours Church reflect the changes in the neighborhood: old wooden statues of St. Isaac Jogues and St. Anthony stand alongside newer paintings of Our Lady of Guadalupe and La Virgen de la Altagracia.
The pews reflect the changes, too. At the final graduation at St. Martin's, on June 18, the church was cavernously empty.
Mr. Soto played ''Pomp and Circumstance'' on a keyboard as the faculty and 14 final graduates filed up the center aisle. Sister Nora kept her composure as she welcomed the crowd and then read the names of the graduates.
Ginikanwa Amaefule, the oldest of Ms. Amaefule's children, took top honors.
Less than an hour later, they emerged, hugging and taking pictures.
Doris Tacinelli, 53, a teacher at St. Martin's for 29 years -- 22 in kindergarten -- stood off to the side, her big sunglasses hiding red-rimmed eyes. Angel Pagan, his blue graduation robe shimmering in the sun, hugged her. She had been his teacher when he first came to the school.
''I still can't believe it,'' Ms. Tacinelli said as the boy walked away. ''I've done this so many years. I keep saying it's just another summer, but it's not.''
Four days later, the sky was as bruised and gray as the mood inside the school, where misty-eyed teachers offered final words of encouragement and praise, while movers hauled filing cabinets downstairs.
As a school, the children trudged uphill on East 182nd Street to the church, where they knelt and offered thanks for St. Martin's, their teachers and their friends. They spoke of wisdom, grace and remembrance. Then the church's pastor, the Rev. Cosme Fernandes, blessed them.
Reluctantly, Diomara Perez, 26, and her third-grade class returned to the school, where they huddled together one last time. Jeremy Lacayo, who had once told Ms. Perez he wanted to be a priest, sat slumped over his desk. Enaya Martinez, an impish girl who dreams of writing, cried inconsolably.
''I want you to be the best, best of the best in your new schools,'' Ms. Perez said brightly.
They rose and offered a final prayer, then turned and slowly filed out. Lorena Chacon was the last to leave. She stood in the front of the empty, unadorned room, her eyes wide in wonder. Her face was a portrait of pain and puzzlement.
She walked away sobbing.

HEADLINE: 'Is It Always Like This?'

BYLINE: By MATT BAI

 BODY:
'I'm not sure there's any way to be prepared for something like this,'' Jon Huntsman told me last month. He was reflecting on his debut a few days earlier as a prospective presidential candidate: a gorgeous Thursday evening in New Hampshire when his chartered plane touched down at a little airport and a waiting Suburban whisked him off to Jesse's, a hillside steakhouse a few miles from the Dartmouth campus. As the recently departed ambassador to China and a former governor of Utah, Huntsman has some experience with polite, state-run media and small cliques of capital reporters. When he stepped out of the car, he had in mind that sort of familiar scene. 
What Huntsman encountered, instead, was a crush of boom mikes and jostling reporters holding their digital recorders aloft -- the kind of pulsing mass an elected official might expect to run into on the courthouse steps if he'd just been arraigned on charges of lewd behavior. Maybe 75 voters crowded into the back room at Jesse's, under the low-hanging canoe and the mounted fish and the twin bear statues looming in back, but it was hard for them to get close to Huntsman, and some of them seemed more preoccupied with scoping out the assembled television pundits anyway. (''All I care about is Carl Cameron,'' a woman remarked as the Fox News correspondent readied himself a few feet away.)
Huntsman spoke for a mere six minutes, without a microphone, before answering a smattering of questions with practiced, diplomatic vagueness. He introduced his wife, Mary Kaye, and two of his seven children: Liddy, who had just graduated from the University of Pennsylvania; and Gracie Mei, his adopted daughter from China who was celebrating her 12th birthday. The wait staff rolled out a chocolate-mousse cake with 12 candles. Earlier, Huntsman trapped a ladybug in his hands and presented it to her as a gift. ''We are the quintessential margin-of-error potential candidate,'' he told the crowd. ''We're in the early stages of due diligence, where you get around and have conversations with good people, where you share a little bit in the way of ideas, you reflect upon where your country happens to be. And that takes you into the future, where ultimately you make a decision we never thought we would be making.''
''Louder!'' a woman in the back of the room called out at one point.
''Sorry, I've lost my voice,'' Huntsman replied, although this was his first event on a five-day tour and, really, his normally soft voice sounded just fine. It was more that he seemed tentative and a little disoriented, the claustrophobic room swallowing his words.
Back in the car, on his way to a sit-down with George Stephanopoulos, Huntsman turned to his strategist, John Weaver, and asked, ''Is it always like this?''
When he thought back to his experience on that first night, Huntsman, an avid motorcyclist and a lover of perilous sports, compared it to bungee jumping. ''You put on the bungee-jumping cord, and you're standing on the bridge and you leap,'' he told me. ''Well, that leap moment for me was when I stepped out of the car in front of Jesse's. And you're there, figuratively naked, in front of the press gaggle. And you begin to sail. You begin to fall. And whether or not that string is going to catch you before you hit bottom, whether or not you're going to get through the night or get creamed, is an unknown.''
Hundreds of men (and a handful of women) have experienced something like this moment of terror since the media started making a spectacle of the New Hampshire primary and the Iowa caucuses in the 1970s. But it would be hard to think of anyone who has experienced it in quite the same, strange way as Jon Huntsman. Nearly three weeks earlier, he stepped off the plane from China with only a dim awareness, he insists, of all the machinations taking place on his behalf. As a federal employee, he was legally prohibited from engaging in American politics. Now he walked right into a hastily preassembled presidential campaign, peopled by veteran operatives he didn't know, his future the subject of knowing speculation among pundits who wouldn't have recognized him if they slammed into him at the Georgetown Safeway.
''You know it's not about you,'' Huntsman told me at one point, referring to all the attention his arrival created. ''It's about the process. It's about the drama. It's about the entertainment.''
What it was about, really, was this: Republican contributors like the ones with whom Huntsman had been meeting in New York and Florida and South Carolina, along with the restless army of campaign reporters at Jesse's, were searching for a more interesting option than what they had in Mitt Romney and the short list of underwhelming challengers who had declared their intentions to run. This is why they were hoping that a promising commodity like Mitch Daniels, Indiana's brainy governor and a favorite among party insiders, would enter the race. If the field stayed wide open, the 51-year-old Huntsman -- with his silver hair and his prized Harley and his mastery of Mandarin Chinese, with his record as a tax-cutting governor and his vast family fortune -- would be an intriguing prospect. Huntsman's moment seemed somehow to have arrived while the man himself was 10,000 miles away.
''Listen, if we got no one answering our phone calls and no doors opened at any of these places among people who are high-profile and respected players, then I think the answer would be far different,'' Huntsman told me. ''You've got to respond to the marketplace. But in this case, nature abhors a vacuum, and there happens to be a vacuum that's in the process of being filled.
''By whom,'' he added, ''I don't know.''
On his first full day in New Hampshire, Huntsman visited two house parties and a V.F.W. hall, and at every stop, the swarm of national reporters threatened to overwhelm his audience. On television, Huntsman radiates strength, with his conventional good looks and easy demeanor, but in person he sometimes has a lesser presence. Average in height and build and self-effacing in a Jimmy Stewart kind of way, he'll slouch a bit and bow his head, holding a microphone prayerfully with both hands, until it almost seems as if he is receding in front of you. He comes across as genuine and unpretentious, without a hint of entitlement -- the kind of guy you'd be glad to run into at your kid's soccer game.
He said almost nothing memorable or argumentative in his somewhat prepared, somewhat rambling remarks. He called for a ''new industrial revolution'' to retool the American economy and contrasted the giddy, can-do feeling he experienced in China with what he described as the ''funk'' that permeated discussion back home; the truth, he said, was that neither sentiment was fully justified. It was a kind of updated ''Morning in America'' routine, long on optimism and short on detail, but this was designed as a get-to-know-you trip, not a policy seminar -- a chance for voters to put a face with the name.
Off to the side at each event was the man who had set all this in motion, John Weaver, a tall, brooding figure in a rumpled suit, dark eyes perpetually downcast, arms alternately folded or cupped over a cellphone. Weaver has a Texas drawl that is accentuated by his propensity to mumble, which leaves the impression that he doesn't want to be understood, and he communicates mainly by text messaging -- which is to say, he receives what must be thousands but answers precious few. Already Huntsman had taken to calling him ''the holy ghost.''
I first met Weaver, a longtime professional and personal rival of Karl Rove, aboard John McCain's Straight Talk Express in 2000. Weaver was one of McCain's small coterie of adoptive little brothers, furtive and a bit mysterious but also creative and, over drinks at one or another hotel bar, surprisingly idealistic. After the campaign, Weaver's journey became downright weird. Embittered by George W. Bush's victory and shut out in Rove's Washington, he moved to New York and shocked old friends by agreeing to help some Democrats (including the party's leadership in the House and Senate). This got him branded as a traitor inside his party. But even before he could do anything treacherous, Weaver soon had bigger problems; he had leukemia, which is now in remission. Eventually he married for a second time and moved back to Texas. Weaver ultimately made his peace with Rove, at least publicly, but during Bush's tenure he remained little more than a specter in Republican Washington, discredited and invisible. Forgiven his apostasies by McCain (a man who knows a thing or two about apostasies himself), Weaver reinsinuated himself into McCain's inner circle for a time in 2007. But he left the struggling campaign that summer, along with several of his younger acolytes. The immediate impetus was an internal power struggle that ended up marginalizing him, but Weaver also had problems with the strategic direction of McCain's second campaign, the hard and bumpy lurch to the right that was meant to placate various ideological constituencies at the expense of McCain's ''maverick'' reputation.
Weaver likes to use the word ''bigness'' to describe McCain's political brand in 2000, the idea being that McCain seemed to represent neither a party nor an ideology so much as a national yearning for some loftier brand of politics. The descent into tactical positioning, he felt, was a disservice to the man and a faulty strategy to boot. In a way, of course, Weaver was wrong about this, because McCain's metamorphosis into a more typical conservative creature enabled him to win the nomination. But he was also right in that McCain lost the general election largely because Barack Obama co-opted this theme and became, in a sense, the bigger candidate, at a moment when independent voters badly wanted one.
Political strategists are forever in search of the next big thing, some undiscovered talent who might someday be enshrined in marble -- or at least make them household names the way Bush did for Rove or the way Obama did for David Axelrod. It was during his second go-around with McCain that Weaver met Governor Huntsman, who campaigned for McCain as one of his national chairmen. (The other was Tim Pawlenty, the former Minnesota governor who is also running for president.) In Huntsman, Weaver saw another less doctrinaire candidate who could embody the same kind of bigness that had so captivated him in McCain. Weaver had emerged from his two tours at McCain's side with an address book full of names in New Hampshire and other early primary states, reform-minded activists he could count on to take his calls and host some low-key events, if only for old time's sake. So early in 2009, not long after Huntsman was re-elected as Utah's governor with an otherworldly 78 percent of the vote, Weaver quietly set up a series of successful meetings for Huntsman with Republican activists in South Carolina and Michigan, and he set about establishing a political action committee -- the first step toward a possible run in 2012.
All that came crashing to a halt when Huntsman called Weaver and told him he was going to accept an appointment as Obama's ambassador to China. ''Yours is a family newspaper,'' Weaver told me, ''so I won't say what I told him.'' Common wisdom had it that Obama and his team had shrewdly decided to move Huntsman out of the country and take him off the Republican playing field for 2012 -- a not-illogical conclusion, given that David Plouffe, Obama's campaign manager, had noted that Huntsman was the one potential adversary whom he thought could be a potentially strong challenger. But the larger factor was that Obama, having won on a promise to transcend partisanship, was searching for Republicans he could appoint to high-profile posts, and Huntsman was a perfect fit for the job; he had become enthralled with Chinese culture while working in Taiwan as a Mormon missionary in his 20s, and he later served as an Asia expert in George H. W. Bush's Commerce Department. ''He had to take it,'' Weaver says now. ''It wasn't a debatable thing.''
According to Weaver, that was the last he heard from Huntsman, and he considered the matter of a presidential run closed -- until late last year, when Huntsman, who had long planned to resign his post and return to the United States after two years, told a Newsweek reporter that he and his family ''may have one final run left in our bones.'' Back in Austin, Weaver read the Newsweek article and concluded that Huntsman was sending him the modern equivalent of a message in a bottle. Within days, he started calling the contributors and consultants who met with Huntsman back in 2009 to see if they might still be willing to consider him, which most of them were. Then Weaver and Fred Davis, the adman most famous for making the psychedelic ''demon sheep'' ad for Carly Fiorina in California last year, started assembling their small band of loyalists from the McCain days, mostly on a volunteer basis, just in case Huntsman was serious about beginning a presidential campaign as soon as he returned.
It's hard to believe that Huntsman didn't encourage any of this in some tangible way from Beijing, perhaps through back-channel contacts. (Axelrod, who is helping to build Obama's re-election campaign, mockingly calls Weaver's version of events the ''political immaculate conception.'') When I asked Huntsman directly, he told me that he had been thinking of 2016 when he made his comments to Newsweek. It was only when he began to get e-mails from relatives in the United States that he realized that there was now speculation about his plans and that Weaver had taken it upon himself to lay the groundwork. Huntsman said he had assumed that 2012 wasn't an option for a guy who had been out of the country for two years, but that was before he had a sense of just how uninspired Republicans seemed to be by their choices.
I suggested to Huntsman that surely he could have stopped the draft effort had he wanted to, even from Beijing. ''Absolutely, absolutely,'' he nodded. ''But as I say: If the marketplace works, if something is there, if it's viable, if there's a marketplace there for what we've done and our basic approach, then let's see where it goes. And that's what we've done.''
On the last Friday in April, the Huntsmans landed back in Washington for good. The next night, his last as an ambassador, Huntsman ran into Weaver at the White House Correspondents' Dinner, and according to Weaver, the two men agreed to meet first thing Sunday morning, after Huntsman officially relinquished his title. At the Huntsmans' new house in D.C.'s Kalorama neighborhood, surrounded by unpacked boxes, Weaver told Huntsman that his team was prepared to present a series of briefings on the various aspects of a possible campaign plan -- strategy, media, fund-raising -- as early as Monday. Huntsman said he saw no reason to wait. Couldn't they all just come in immediately? The answer was yes.
And so here we all were, just three weeks later, bouncing from Keene to Hancock to Concord. The strange circumstances around Huntsman's candidacy accounted for a certain awkwardness between him and his new cadre of aides, sort of like a honeymoon after an arranged marriage. The truth was that Huntsman's advisers barely knew him, and they still had plenty of doubt as to whether he could even be persuaded to run. Not long before going to New Hampshire, I stopped in to see Huntsman's new pollster, Whit Ayres, at his office in Northern Virginia and asked him to tell me about Huntsman.
''Well, I just met him this morning,'' Ayres said.
''You mean you met with him this morning?'' I asked.
''No,'' Ayres replied, ''I mean I just met him this morning.''
The Huntsmans, meanwhile, were trying to find a comfort level in being constantly handled by strangers. While Huntsman has retained the services of his longtime chief of staff, not a single aide from his Utah days could be found in his New Hampshire retinue. ''I've never been around a political strategist before,'' Huntsman told me during one of our car rides together, when I asked about his relationship with Weaver. ''We've always done it on our own. I've never had a Svengali who has developed a master plan.'' He said this word, ''Svengali,'' with a discernible note of contempt. ''We didn't want one. So I don't have a political infrastructure, amazingly enough.
''When you look at the people around us, all of whom are new best friends as of three weeks ago, they're basically stepping up and filling a void,'' Huntsman said. ''This is close quarters. They may resign at the end of the exercise. They may all flee in disgust. Who knows?'' He turned up his palms. ''In a political-science case study, it would be a very interesting chapter.''
If you're of a certain age, you may remember the ''Saturday Night Live'' routine in which Phil Hartman played the ''Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer'' -- a Neanderthal who thawed out after 100,000 years, went to law school and became a grandstanding advocate and even ran for political office. (''I don't really understand your Congress or your system of checks and balances, because as I said during the campaign, I'm just a caveman,'' went a typical oration. ''I fell on some ice and later got thawed out by scientists. But there is one thing I do know: We must do everything in our power to lower the capital gains tax!'') As I watched Huntsman tour New Hampshire, I began to think of him, in a kind way, as being the unfrozen caveman candidate. He'd been living in a censored society on the other side of the planet -- encased in ice, for all political purposes -- during the town-hall uprisings in the summer of 2009 and all the grass-roots fury that attached itself to everything Obama did. And this, he seemed to think, exempted him from having to know much about any of it. I'm just a caveman. I don't know much about your ''tea parties'' and your ''birthers.'' But there are some things I do know . . . .
Huntsman refused to make any sweeping or personal criticisms of the president he used to serve; the furthest he would go, pressed by reporters at a news conference in a living room in Hancock, was to suggest that Obama pursued some policies he might not have, like sending the military into Libya. At that same news conference, he also refused, bizarrely, to describe himself as a conservative. Huntsman said he didn't like political labels, but if he had to pick one, he considered himself a ''pragmatic problem-solver.''
There are two ways to look at all this, depending on your perception of what's happening in the Republican Party. A lot of political handicappers -- particularly those on the left, who tend to view the Republican base as monolithic and somewhat medieval -- doubt that Huntsman can even win enough delegates to earn himself a decent speaking slot at the convention. My colleague Nate Silver, who blogs his statistical analysis for The Times, has argued that Huntsman has no more than a remote chance of scoring the nomination. Skeptics point out that not only did Huntsman go to work for a Democratic president, but he also sent warm letters to that president, calling him a ''remarkable leader.'' Huntsman believes in the science of climate change, and he favors civil unions for gay couples and leniency for the children of illegal immigrants. In a Pew Research Center poll released earlier this month, only 35 percent of Republican and Republican-leaning voters said they had heard of him -- but that was the good news. Of those who said they had heard of him, 36 percent said there was no chance he'd win their vote.
Some of the more sober-minded Republican insiders in Washington and New Hampshire, though, persuaded me that by distancing himself from some of the party's more populist influences, Huntsman was giving Republican and independent voters an option that could not be so easily dismissed. This judgment has little to do with data and more to do with what Huntsman calls the vacuum in the Republican field, which at this point looks to be more unsettled than at any time in at least a half century. Having been largely wiped out in statewide races in 2006 and again in 2008, Republicans haven't developed the kind of ''bench'' -- young governors and senators in waiting -- you would normally want to have heading into a promising election year. And some of the party's brighter stars (Chris Christie, Paul Ryan, John Thune), perhaps wary of an incumbent president who hopes to raise $1 billion, have taken a pass on 2012.
The result is a field of presidential candidates who strike a lot of Republicans, perhaps unfairly, as better vice presidential candidates -- or, worse, as the vehicles of a less tolerant, more conspiratorial strain of Republicanism that threatens to overrun the party. In New Hampshire, and probably in other states, too, early converts to Huntsman's cause are traditional activists who want someone to steer them past the Tea Party moment, rather than into it. In a conversation with Huntsman at a private dinner for his early backers in New Hampshire, I heard Paul Collins, an influential operative, summarize the feeling this way: ''When I signed on, someone said to me, 'Oh, you've met Huntsman?' And I said: 'No. But I've met all the other guys!' ''
The undisputed front-runner in the field is Mitt Romney, who finished third (just behind Mike Huckabee) in 2008 and has been running ever since, contributing to county-level campaigns in New Hampshire and campaigning for local candidates as if he were hoping to win an appointment to the lottery commission. But in a party with a long and much remarked-upon tradition of closing ranks behind the guy who's next in line, Romney's perch seems unusually precarious, and not only because the health care plan he championed in Massachusetts looks a lot like the one his party wants to repeal in Washington.
While he may be the closest thing to an assumed nominee the party has right now, Romney isn't the kind of reassuring presence toward which Republicans normally gravitate. Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bob Dole and John McCain had all been national figures for decades before they secured the nomination by establishment acclaim; by contrast, Romney served a single term as governor of a Democratic state. And if the Tea Party movement proved anything last year, it was that Republican voters in the digital age aren't inclined to stamp their approval on a candidate just because their leaders or the news media expect them to. ''We're no longer a hierarchical party,'' Weaver told me, brandishing his ubiquitous BlackBerry. ''That's what this achieved.''
It's common for analysts to talk about presidential fields in terms of ''first tier'' and ''second tier'' candidates, but it might be more instructive to divide this year's Republican class into insurgents on one hand and alternatives to Romney on the other. The insurgents, who make up the majority of the field, will run as Tea Party-inspired ideologues, and they will compete principally in Iowa, where social conservatives abound. (No Republican candidate in the modern era has ever won both Iowa and New Hampshire in a contested primary season, and Romney clearly intends to stake his claim in New England.) The alternatives, meanwhile, will present themselves to mainstream Republican voters as being just as electable and experienced as the front-runner, only maybe more likeable or with more conviction.
The most logical alternative at this early point might be Pawlenty, a young, stolid Midwestern sort, with an appealing calmness and a willingness to tack sharply right when he needs to. But Pawlenty is in something of a geographic box; because he's from Minnesota, he will be expected to run strong in Iowa, and this means that he'll be stuck campaigning there for a lot of the fall, while Romney gallivants around New Hampshire talking about his turnaround skills. And while Pawlenty has worked New Hampshire hard this year, the state's voters, for whatever reason, seem less than enthralled at this point. ''He's been doing everything right in every traditional New Hampshire way, but he's also been doing it for 12 months, and he doesn't have a lot to show for it,'' Fergus Cullen, a former state party chairman, told me. ''The voters just keep shopping.''
This is where Huntsman sees his opening. On paper, at least, Huntsman seems less a Romney alternative than a modified clone; he, too, is a granite-jawed, well-coifed Mormon governor with an august family pedigree. His father, Jon Huntsman Sr., is among the world's richest men. (He invented that little clamshell container that holds your Big Mac. Turns out there's something of a demand for it.)
And there are reasons, of course, that a guy like Huntsman could think it worth his while to run for president, even if he thinks he isn't actually going to be president, or even his party's nominee. By diving into the race now, he has a chance to erase this idea of himself as ''the guy who worked for Obama'' and re-establish his credentials as the Republican leader who gave the nominating speech for Sarah Palin in 2008. If he performs even respectably, then he might be able to position himself as the logical next choice should Obama be re-elected -- in other words, the Mitt Romney of 2016.
On his third day in New Hampshire, Huntsman traveled to Hooksett, about 10 miles up the country roads from Manchester, to pose for photographs at Riley's gun shop. The photo op, like all such events, demanded a level of stagecraft -- pretending to be really interested in things while people take pictures of you being really interested in them -- that made me cringe for Huntsman. Stagecraft isn't really his thing.
''Hey, guys,'' Huntsman asked a couple of young, expressionless salesmen, ''what are you selling?''
''Guns,'' one salesman said. His name was Brett.
''What are you selling the most of these days?'' Huntsman persevered.
''Uh, that all depends on what people are looking for,'' Brett replied. And so on.
''This is the third one since I've been here,'' Brett told me later, referring to presidential candidates, ''and I've only been here for two months. I'm not sure of their names.''
After a quick stop for more photos at a historic country store, as we drove past meadows and railroad tracks, I asked Huntsman how he thought he was going to gain traction without sharing some of the anger that Republicans felt toward his old boss. ''People are going to vote not on personalities -- they're going to vote on issues,'' Huntsman replied confidently. He told me that he resisted similar attacks when he ran for governor against a Democrat, Scott Matheson Jr., in 2004. ''I had people around me who said, 'You're going to get creamed if you don't take him down,' '' Huntsman said in his low, quiet voice. ''I fired a couple of them. That's not the way I operate.''
I pointed out to Huntsman that running against fellow Republicans is a very different beast from running against a Democrat in a solidly Republican state. Didn't he at some point have to get in tune with the emotions of his party's electorate? ''I had one person who came up to me at an event in Florida,'' he replied, ''and said, 'If you get into this, are you going to take it to the president, take him down and all this, eviscerate him?' And I said, 'Ma'am, you've just described a losing strategy for the next Republican.' You're either able to take a message to the heart and soul of the American people that they can connect with, or you're done.
''I think what's going to drive this election, really, are two things -- authenticity and the economy,'' Huntsman told me. ''I think people have become so disillusioned by the professional nature of politics -- the organizations around politicians, the way that politicians approach problem-solving, the way in which they go about their daily business. There has been very little in the way of authenticity in politics in recent years.''
This sounded like pretty standard outsider rhetoric, but the more I talked to Huntsman, the more I began to understand that he had a theory of the case, a way in which he saw his candidacy becoming viable, and it involved abstaining from precisely the kind of emotional pandering we'd been talking about. Both Romney and Pawlenty were essentially moderate governors who have now rather baldly intensified their partisan rhetoric. Romney, in particular, has had a problem with authenticity ever since he burst onto the national stage, known as the gay rights, abortion-rights governor of Massachusetts, and started talking like Phyllis Schlafly. Romney-watchers note that first he wore a tie, and now suddenly he doesn't -- fairly or not, there is something about him that evokes Al Gore, a man who seemed lost in a state of constant reinvention.
Huntsman's bet is that some critical mass of moderate Republicans and independents -- and there are still plenty of both in New Hampshire -- can be persuaded to rally around a less ideological candidate who isn't going to get personal or shape-shift, even if they don't love all of his positions. If he can instigate a McCainian uprising in New Hampshire, where the lack of a competitive Democratic race this year should make for a heavier turnout among independent voters on the Republican side than in either 2004 or 2008, the fuse might then burn right through South Carolina and Florida, where Mary Kaye grew up and where Huntsman has based his campaign.
The most obvious problem with this theory, though, is that, in McCain's case, it has always been impossible to separate political identity from biography. What conservatives knew about McCain, first and foremost, was that he was a bona fide American hero who refused to accept his own early release from a P.O.W. camp. That's a pretty powerful credential in a party that worships the military, and what it meant was that a lot of Republican voters were willing to respectfully disagree with him on campaign-finance reform and immigration or to be lectured by him on the need for cross-party cooperation.
It won't be so easy for Huntsman, whom most Republicans barely know, and whose privileged background includes no heroics, unless you count defying his parents and dropping out of high school to play keyboards for a band called Wizard. He doesn't enjoy anything close to McCain's mythological presence, which means that if bigness is going to work for Huntsman, it's probably only going to be because his rivals end up looking just that small.
Huntsman's cellphone rang at about 6 on Sunday morning in his Manchester hotel room. It was his 26-year-old daughter, Mary Anne, who was still in China and, because of the time difference, had already seen the breaking news. She was calling to tell her dad, excitedly, that Mitch Daniels wasn't going to run for president. After he had a little time to process the news, Huntsman told me he was thinking about all the wealthy Republicans who had been telling him they might back him if Daniels didn't run, and whether they might now coalesce around him. Although there would soon be talk of other potential late entrants to the race, like Rick Perry, the Texas governor, Huntsman felt the field was now pretty much set. ''For everyone else, the barriers to entry now are too high,'' he said, ''in terms of organization, the buzz factor, corralling contributors.''
Whether it was the Daniels decision that had loosened him up, or merely the slow acclimation to presidential politics, Huntsman seemed to have located more of his Western self-assuredness as he set out Sunday for another day's worth of events. In Wolfeboro, a lakeside town where Romney spends summer vacations, Huntsman, dressed in a plaid shirt and jean jacket, gave his most crisp and heartfelt talk of the trip, sounding less like a diplomat and very much like a guy who had decided to run. ''I'm feeling a healthy shot of reality here,'' Huntsman told me on his last morning in New Hampshire. ''It was so distant and so tenuous the last few months, and you know, this is the playing field. This is the real thing. We're stepping onto the N.F.L. field, and you either pass the workout or they send you to the minor leagues.'' (It didn't seem the right time to mention that he had confused his sports metaphors. I got the point.) ''And if you begin to pass the workout a little bit,'' Huntsman added, ''you begin to look at yourself a little differently.''
Some commentators who covered Huntsman's New Hampshire expedition arrived back in the capital brimming with hope. In an appearance on ''Morning Joe'' the day Huntsman left New Hampshire, the political handicapper Mark Halperin declared Huntsman to be a more comfortable campaigner than either George W. Bush or Barack Obama -- a pronouncement that struck even Huntsman's own aides as implausible but that they dutifully set about disseminating to the press.
Among the Republican activists who took their measure of Huntsman, however, reactions were decidedly more restrained. ''I don't think he was connecting as well as some of the other candidates,'' Juliana Bergeron, a prominent Republican moderate who hosted Huntsman's first house party, told me, although she was quick to add that she expected him to improve over time. ''Some of the people used the word 'cold' or 'stiff.' ''
More troubling for Huntsman, perhaps, was that his lack of any evident vision -- this decision to begin by introducing himself as a family man rather than offering any real sense of how he might govern -- seemed to have disappointed a lot of voters. It was a theme that came up in several conversations I had with Republicans who, at Weaver's request, had brought their friends and neighbors to meet Huntsman. People liked Huntsman just fine -- you'd have to be pretty ornery not to -- but they were impatient for something more substantive.
''His attitude seems to be, 'Well, I'm just up here introducing myself to people, and I'll let you know what my positions are later,' '' Travis Blais, the Republican chairman in Windham, told me. ''I was surprised by that. It may be fine, and you may get another bite at the apple, but you've got 70 voters in a room right now! You can make your pitch right now!
''Frankly, people noticed,'' Blais added. ''In my conversations with my neighbors since then, people said, 'Nice guy, very smart, but I have no idea what he thinks.' ''
At least at this early stage, it's hard to escape the impression that Huntsman hasn't really thought through his argument as a candidate. And that's bound to make a lot of the voters he meets wonder why it is, really, that Huntsman is jumping in now, so late and with so little preparation. Is he just trying to get a little experience in the arena, in advance of 2016? Is he hoping for a bank shot to the vice presidency? Does he just want to be heard?
Huntsman laughs off such questions. ''That would suppose we actually had some master plan,'' he says. ''Who knows where you're going to be in 2016? Who knows what your family's going to look like, what your health's going to be like, what the world's going to look like? Those things are impossible to forecast or to plan around.''
The truth about Huntsman's intentions, perhaps, has more to do with human nature than it does with any grand strategy. Just about every politician who reaches a certain level dreams one day of occupying the Oval Office. If you're Jon Huntsman, that dream actually seemed within the realm of possibility at one point, before you went off to China and had to put it out of mind for a while. And then one day you share that ambition with a reporter, and suddenly everybody is clamoring to know your plans, and friends are saying that there's a vacuum to be filled, and strategists back home are throwing together a campaign machine without your having to lift a finger. And like any normal person probably would, you find yourself thinking: Let's just see where this goes.
''At least they're not laughing you out of the room,'' Huntsman said of the voters after his first few events in New Hampshire. That's not a terribly high standard to set for the viability of a presidential campaign. But if you're a Republican in 2012, it's enough to make you believe.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 26, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Page 36 this weekend about Jon Huntsman, who recently announced he was running for president, misidentifies the recipient of a letter whom Mr. Huntsman praised as having a ''brilliant analysis of world events.'' It was President Bill Clinton, not President Obama. The article also quoted incorrectly from a U.S. News & World Report article in 2009 in which David Plouffe, Obama's campaign manager in 2008, discussed his feelings about Mr. Huntsman as a potential opponent for Mr. Obama in 2012. Mr. Plouffe did not use the phrase ''a wee bit queasy''; those words were used by the U.S. News & World Report writer to describe how Mr. Plouffe felt.

HEADLINE: German E.Coli Sickens 8 in France

BYLINE: By SCOTT SAYARE and WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
PARIS -- The deadly German E. coli strain that killed at least 45 people has resurfaced in France, where officials said a cluster of eight people have fallen ill, apparently from eating contaminated sprouts grown in France.
Sprouts were also identified as the source of the German outbreak. French officials have not yet determined if the two episodes are connected.
But public health experts in the United States said the new outbreak raised concerns that contaminated seeds from a common supplier might be the ultimate source of the E. coli bacteria. If those seeds are still in circulation, other outbreaks could occur. 
The French health authorities said that seven of those who had become sick attended a charity event at a children's play center in Begles, a suburb of Bordeaux, on June 8. Most of the people who became ill recalled eating gazpacho garnished with sprouts.
French investigators traced the sprouts served at the event to seeds bought at a garden store chain, Jardiland, according to a news release from Frederic Lefebvre, a secretary of state attached to the economy ministry.
Mr. Lefebvre said the seeds were supplied by a British company, Thompson & Morgan. Although the link between the seeds and the illness had not been definitively established, he called on French retailers to pull the company's seeds for fenugreek, mustard and arugula from shelves.
In a statement Saturday, Thompson & Morgan said it had not received any reports of problems with its seeds. ''We note that the French outbreak was localized to a specific event, which would indicate to us that something local in the Bordeaux area, or the way the product has been handled and grown, is responsible for the incident rather than our seeds,'' the statement said.
The company said it was cooperating with British health authorities as they looked into the matter.
The company also distributes seeds in the United States.
The German outbreak began in early May and has sickened more than 3,800 people, nearly 900 of them with a serious complication involving acute kidney failure. Nearly all the cases involved people who lived or had traveled in Germany.
German authorities have blamed the outbreak on bean sprouts grown by a German commercial sprouter, which shut down on June 5. American health experts said the French outbreak was worrisome because it suggested that the ultimate source of the deadly bacteria -- a rare and highly virulent E. coli strain known as O104:H4 -- had not been found and contained.
''If there's no linear connection from the first outbreak, then the simplest and the most ominous explanation is there's an upstream source and that's very concerning because that stuff could still be being distributed,'' said Dr. Phillip Tarr, a professor of microbiology at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.
Dr. Tarr said it was still too early to draw firm conclusions about the cause of the latest round of illnesses. He said it was possible, although unlikely, that someone sickened in the earlier outbreak had prepared food served at the event in France and so passed on the infection.
''Traceback here is absolutely critical because that killer organism could be sitting around viable and not contained,'' he said.
William E. Keene, a senior epidemiologist at the Oregon Public Health Division, said it was urgent to find out if the seeds used by the German grower had come from the same source as the seeds linked to the French cases.
At least five of the French cases involved kidney failure, and tests on two of those people showed they were infected with the O104:H4 strain. The eight people infected in the Begles area were adults, age 31 to 78. In addition, two children were sickened in another town and they were presumed also to have E. coli infections, although it was not clear if they had the same strain.

HEADLINE: The Payroll Tax Needs a Vacation

BYLINE: By ROBERT H. FRANK. 
Robert H. Frank is an economics professor at the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University.

 BODY:
THE federal budget deficit is a distraction.
It's important, yes, and must be addressed. But by a wide margin, it's not the nation's most pressing economic problem. That would be the widespread and persistent joblessness that has plagued the labor market since the Great Recession began in 2008.
Almost 14 million people -- 9.1 percent of the labor force -- were officially counted as unemployed last month. But that's just the tip of the iceberg. There were almost 9 million part-time workers who wanted, but couldn't find, full-time jobs; 28 million in jobs they would have quit under normal conditions; and an additional 2.2 million who wanted work but couldn't find any and dropped out of the labor force. 
If the economy could generate jobs at the median wage for even half of these people, national income would grow by more than 10 times the total interest cost of the 2011 deficit (which was less than $40 billion). So anyone who says that reducing the deficit is more urgent than reducing unemployment is saying, in effect, that we should burn hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods and services in a national bonfire.
We ought to be tackling both problems at once. But in today's fractious political climate, many promising dual-purpose remedies -- like infrastructure investments that would generate large and rapid returns -- are called unthinkable, in the false belief that they would impoverish our grandchildren. Yet there are other ways to attack unemployment that could garner bipartisan support.
Perhaps the most promising is a payroll tax holiday. The payroll tax was originally meant to pay for Social Security, and in recent years, employees and employers have each contributed 6.2 percent of total salary -- with no additional levies on salaries beyond $106,800. Congress should both declare an immediate payroll tax holiday for employees and exempt employers from making contributions for newly hired workers -- and keep both provisions in effect until the end of next year.
The first step would increase take-home pay, thus stimulating spending and employment. And the employer exemption from taxes on new hires would make it substantially less expensive to hire additional workers.
Last December, Congress approved cutting the employee's contribution to the payroll tax to 4.2 percent of salary for the 2011 calendar year, a move that attests to the political viability of my proposal. President Obama has proposed extending the employee reduction through 2012, but in the face of dreary recent labor market data, stronger steps are needed.
Larry Seidman, an economist at the University of Delaware, has estimated that if employee payroll tax payments were suspended from next month through 2012, the unemployment rate by the end of that period would be one percentage point lower than it would have been otherwise. Private-sector employment would thus expand by about 2.4 million workers by the end of next year.
Even greater employment growth would result from the employer exemption on new hires. Companies aren't very likely to hire additional workers unless they can generate at least enough new income to cover their salaries, including all relevant taxes. The exemption would reduce the cost of hiring new workers by 6.2 percent -- and even by conservative estimates, we can expect it to result in more than five million new hires.
Although payroll tax revenue has traditionally been designated to pay for Social Security benefits, Congress should make clear that these steps will have no effect on current or future retirement checks. The Treasury would have to issue new bonds to cover those payments in the short term. But the payroll tax holiday and cap need not compromise the long-term goal of deficit reduction.
Because these two measures would increase employment by more than seven million by the end of 2012, income tax revenue would rise accordingly. And higher employment would sharply increase both the employee and employer portions of the payroll tax, compared with what they otherwise would have been when the tax holiday ended.
Taking such steps to expand employment would improve the long-run deficit picture in other ways. Periods of high unemployment are periods of high social stress. Increasing employment would reduce divorce rates and result in better nutrition and parental care for children. It would also give many recent graduates a quicker start to their careers. These effects would yield permanent increases in lifetime earnings, with corresponding effects on tax revenue.
Higher demand would also accelerate business investment. Many companies aren't investing today because they already have enough capacity to produce more than people want to buy. Greater investment would bolster productivity and wages, which would also lead to permanently higher future tax revenue.
Enacting a payroll tax holiday, however, shouldn't end discussion of more forceful and effective proposals to stimulate employment. We need to keep posing hard questions to deficit hawks who argue that we shouldn't be hiring unemployed workers to maintain our crumbling roads and bridges, even though postponing such projects will make them much more expensive in the future. These projects don't impoverish our grandchildren. They enrich them.
The important point is that bringing down federal deficits is a long-run problem that cannot and should not be solved by gutting entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare. Deficit reduction will require creative thinking about additional revenue sources and judicious decisions about future spending. But our immediate concern must be getting people back to work.

HEADLINE: A Tax Break on Foreign Profits

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Companies Push for a Tax Break on Foreign Cash'' (''But Nobody Pays That'' series, front page, June 20): 
The central argument in the proposal to permit American companies to bring home their global earnings at a reduced rate is, Is it better to keep the money abroad, or to bring it home and invest it in the United States?
The last time companies were able to repatriate, they brought back more than $300 billion and used the money in a variety of ways. This is money that would still be trapped in foreign banks if we had not lowered the corporate tax rate on overseas income, and today estimates place the amount of money that could be repatriated at close to $1 trillion.
In the first few years, not only would we be injecting hundreds of billions into our economy, but we would also be generating a significant amount of money for the Treasury. This money could be spent in a variety of ways: used to pay down the debt or -- my preferred option -- to finance an infrastructure bank.
However policy makers decide to use the additional revenue, if we don't bring the money back, it's a moot point. The fact is, we don't have a lot of other options available to us right now, so in the short term let's bring the money home and put it to work for us, not our competitors.

HEADLINE: Into The Bustle Of China's Boom

BYLINE: By LARRY GOETZ. 
As told to Patricia R. Olsen. E-mail: preoccupations@nytimes.com

 BODY:
I'M an architect in the Seattle office of NBBJ, an international design firm. In the fall of 2007, the partners asked me to transfer to our office in Shanghai for two years. We were designing a research and development building in Beijing for an American technology company. Another employee who had been managing the office and overseeing the project was returning home in 2008.
I was excited about the idea. I've been with the company for more than 20 years. From 2005 to 2007, I worked on a project in Russia and made a number of trips there, but they never lasted more than 30 days. I have a feeling that NBBJ felt I could adapt easily in China because I've worked with some demanding clients. They probably also figured that if I could work in Russia, even for short periods, I could work anywhere. 
I would rather have been offered the China project when my children were young and could have gone with me, because it would have been a great experience for them. On the other hand, I probably had more flexibility when the offer did come up, because they were already grown and on their own.
The biggest drawback was that my wife, Beverly, couldn't join me. She's a lawyer with the Washington State attorney general's office, and her job can't be done from afar. We decided that I'd go and that she'd visit when she could.
My predecessor in China tried to tell me about the job, but it's hard to teach or learn everything by phone. And NBBJ didn't have classes or training that larger corporations with hundreds of overseas employees might have.
Before I agreed to the assignment, however, the company sent my wife and me to Shanghai to give us a feel for what life might be like. We saw some housing options and met the people in the Shanghai office. NBBJ also paid for some economy-class airline tickets for family visits.
That amount of help was O.K. with me. I've traveled a fair amount, and am usually pretty good about preparing for a new region. I'm not necessarily looking for a lot of information; sometimes I enjoy being surprised and would rather find things out for myself.
I had three months to prepare. I picked up software for learning Chinese, but work was so busy that I didn't have time to get to it before I left or after I arrived. Luckily, our Chinese employees spoke English.
Of everything I encountered, the biggest surprise was the street signs -- they were in both English and Chinese, so it was easy to get around. The buses broadcast the stops in both languages as well. I was pleased to find that I could go wherever I wanted; I saw no restricted areas.
Since NBBJ is a United States company, Chinese law requires that we work with a local design institute in China. It could be stressful at times. The Chinese clients expected significantly more design options than a typical American client, and they wanted faster responses. Occasionally, they seemed intent on sticking with a design that had already been done, but on the other hand, they could be willing to take risks.
My work schedule was intense, so I didn't have much free time, but I did become lonely for my family. It took a while, but I made friends in the compound where my apartment was. I also got to know some expats in our office, and my Chinese landlord and his wife were wonderful.
I enjoyed Shanghai more than I thought I would. Life moves onto the street in that city, especially when it's warm. There's always something happening, from card games to street-vendor sales to impromptu ballroom dancing. I was there for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing and Expo 2010 in Shanghai. The Chinese literally rebuilt both cities for these events, which, as an architect, I found fascinating. There is probably no better place for an architect to practice currently than China.
LIKE many other people who return from work in another country, I wish that I had traveled more while I was there. I also wish that I had learned the language before my arrival: then I could have enjoyed arguing with the taxi drivers about directions. But I did learn how to get around and knew the most direct routes. I also regret not being able to just talk with the drivers. Something told me they are like taxi drivers everywhere -- they want to talk about the city and what's happening.
I'd advise people who work overseas to try living outside the expat community. There were expats everywhere in Shanghai, but they seemed to congregate in certain areas. People with children might want to be close to the expat schools, but it pays to live with the locals if you can. You learn so much more about the culture.
I've been home a year now. I live on a houseboat on a lake in the middle of Seattle. In Shanghai, I rode a bike to work; here I walk to the office. I'm amazed by how quiet Seattle streets are. I miss the noise of Shanghai.

HEADLINE: Insiders Sound an Alarm Amid a Natural Gas Rush

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA; Robbie Brown contributed reporting from Atlanta.

 BODY:
Natural gas companies have been placing enormous bets on the wells they are drilling, saying they will deliver big profits and provide a vast new source of energy for the United States.
But the gas may not be as easy and cheap to extract from shale formations deep underground as the companies are saying, according to hundreds of industry e-mails and internal documents and an analysis of data from thousands of wells.
In the e-mails, energy executives, industry lawyers, state geologists and market analysts voice skepticism about lofty forecasts and question whether companies are intentionally, and even illegally, overstating the productivity of their wells and the size of their reserves. Many of these e-mails also suggest a view that is in stark contrast to more bullish public comments made by the industry, in much the same way that insiders have raised doubts about previous financial bubbles.
''Money is pouring in'' from investors even though shale gas is ''inherently unprofitable,'' an analyst from PNC Wealth Management, an investment company, wrote to a contractor in a February e-mail. ''Reminds you of dot-coms.'' 
''The word in the world of independents is that the shale plays are just giant Ponzi schemes and the economics just do not work,'' an analyst from IHS Drilling Data, an energy research company, wrote in an e-mail on Aug. 28, 2009.
Company data for more than 10,000 wells in three major shale gas formations raise further questions about the industry's prospects. There is undoubtedly a vast amount of gas in the formations. The question remains how affordably it can be extracted.
The data show that while there are some very active wells, they are often surrounded by vast zones of less-productive wells that in some cases cost more to drill and operate than the gas they produce is worth. Also, the amount of gas produced by many of the successful wells is falling much faster than initially predicted by energy companies, making it more difficult for them to turn a profit over the long run.
If the industry does not live up to expectations, the impact will be felt widely. Federal and state lawmakers are considering drastically increasing subsidies for the natural gas business in the hope that it will provide low-cost energy for decades to come.
But if natural gas ultimately proves more expensive to extract from the ground than has been predicted, landowners, investors and lenders could see their investments falter, while consumers will pay a price in higher electricity and home heating bills.
There are implications for the environment, too. The technology used to get gas flowing out of the ground -- called hydraulic fracturing, or hydrofracking -- can require over a million gallons of water per well, and some of that water must be disposed of because it becomes contaminated by the process. If shale gas wells fade faster than expected, energy companies will have to drill more wells or hydrofrack them more often, resulting in more toxic waste.
The e-mails were obtained through open-records requests or provided to The New York Times by industry consultants and analysts who say they believe that the public perception of shale gas does not match reality; names and identifying information were redacted to protect these people, who were not authorized to communicate publicly. In the e-mails, some people within the industry voice grave concerns.
''And now these corporate giants are having an Enron moment,'' a retired geologist from a major oil and gas company wrote in a February e-mail about other companies invested in shale gas. ''They want to bend light to hide the truth.''
Others within the industry remain optimistic. They argue that shale gas economics will improve as the price of gas rises, technology evolves and demand for gas grows with help from increased federal subsidies being considered by Congress. ''Shale gas supply is only going to increase,'' Steven C. Dixon, executive vice president of Chesapeake Energy, said at an energy industry conference in April in response to skepticism about well performance.
Studying the Data
''I think we have a big problem.''
Deborah Rogers, a member of the advisory committee of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, recalled saying that in a May 2010 telephone call to a senior economist at the Reserve, Mine K. Yucel. ''We need to take a close look at this right away,'' she added.
A former stockbroker with Merrill Lynch, Ms. Rogers said she started studying well data from shale companies in October 2009 after attending a speech by the chief executive of Chesapeake, Aubrey K. McClendon. The math was not adding up, Ms. Rogers said. Her research showed that wells were petering out faster than expected.
''These wells are depleting so quickly that the operators are in an expensive game of 'catch-up,' '' Ms. Rogers wrote in an e-mail on Nov. 17, 2009, to a petroleum geologist in Houston, who wrote back that he agreed.
''This could have profound consequences for our local economy,'' she explained in the e-mail.
Fort Worth residents were already reeling from the sudden reversal of fortune for the natural gas industry.
In early 2008, energy companies were scrambling in Fort Worth to get residents to lease their land for drilling as they searched for so-called monster wells. Billboards along the highways stoked the boom-time excitement: ''If you don't have a gas lease, get one!'' Oil and gas companies were in a fierce bidding war for drilling rights, offering people bonuses as high as $27,500 per acre for signing leases.
The actor Tommy Lee Jones signed on as a pitchman for Chesapeake, one of the largest shale gas companies. ''The extremely long-term benefits include new jobs and capital investment and royalties and revenues that pay for public roads, schools and parks,'' he said in one television advertisement about drilling in the Barnett shale in and around Fort Worth.
To investors, shale companies had a more sophisticated pitch. With better technology, they had refined a ''manufacturing model,'' they said, that would allow them to drop a well virtually anywhere in certain parts of a shale formation and expect long-lasting returns.
For Wall Street, this was the holy grail: a low-risk and high-profit proposition. But by late 2008, the recession took hold and the price of natural gas plunged by nearly two-thirds, throwing the drilling companies' business model into a tailspin.
In Texas, the advertisements featuring Mr. Jones disappeared. Energy companies rescinded high-priced lease offers to thousands of residents, which prompted class-action lawsuits. Royalty checks dwindled. Tax receipts fell.
The impact of the downturn was immediate for many.
''Ruinous, that's how I'd describe it,'' said the Rev. Kyev Tatum, president of the Fort Worth chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
Mr. Tatum explained that dozens of black churches in Fort Worth signed leases on the promise of big money. Instead, some churches were told that their land may no longer be tax exempt even though they had yet to make any royalties on the wells, he said.
That boom-and-bust volatility had raised eyebrows among people like Ms. Rogers, as well as energy analysts and geologists, who started looking closely at the data on wells' performance.
In May 2010, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas called a meeting to discuss the matter after prodding from Ms. Rogers. One speaker was Kenneth B. Medlock III, an energy expert at Rice University, who described a promising future for the shale gas industry in the United States. When he was done, Ms. Rogers peppered him with questions.
Might growing environmental concerns raise the cost of doing business? If wells were dying off faster than predicted, how many new wells would need to be drilled to meet projections?
Mr. Medlock conceded that production in the Barnett shale formation -- or ''play,'' in industry jargon -- was indeed flat and would probably soon decline.
''Activity will shift toward other plays because the returns there are higher,'' he predicted. Ms. Rogers turned to the other commissioners to see if they shared her skepticism, but she said she saw only blank stares.
Bubbling Doubts
Some doubts about the industry are being raised by people who work inside energy companies, too.
''Our engineers here project these wells out to 20-30 years of production and in my mind that has yet to be proven as viable,'' wrote a geologist at Chesapeake in a March 17 e-mail to a federal energy analyst. ''In fact I'm quite skeptical of it myself when you see the % decline in the first year of production.''
''In these shale gas plays no well is really economic right now,'' the geologist said in a previous e-mail to the same official on March 16. ''They are all losing a little money or only making a little bit of money.''
Around the same time the geologist sent the e-mail, Mr. McClendon, Chesapeake's chief executive, told investors, ''It's time to get bullish on natural gas.''
In September 2009, a geologist from ConocoPhillips, one of the largest producers of natural gas in the Barnett shale, warned in an e-mail to a colleague that shale gas might end up as ''the world's largest uneconomic field.'' About six months later, the company's chief executive, James J. Mulva, described natural gas as ''nature's gift,'' adding that ''rather than being expensive, shale gas is often the low-cost source.'' Asked about the e-mail, John C. Roper, a spokesman for ConocoPhillips, said he absolutely believed that shale gas is economically viable.
A big attraction for investors is the increasing size of the gas reserves that some companies are reporting. Reserves -- in effect, the amount of gas that a company says it can feasibly access from its wells -- are important because they are a central measure of an oil and gas company's value.
Forecasting these reserves is a tricky science. Early predictions are sometimes lowered because of drops in gas prices, as happened in 2008. Intentionally overbooking reserves, however, is illegal because it misleads investors. Industry e-mails, mostly from 2009 and later, include language from oil and gas executives questioning whether other energy companies are doing just that.
The e-mails do not explicitly accuse any companies of breaking the law. But the number of e-mails, the seniority of the people writing them, the variety of positions they hold and the language they use -- including comparisons to Ponzi schemes and attempts to ''con'' Wall Street -- suggest that questions about the shale gas industry exist in many corners.
''Do you think that there may be something suspicious going with the public companies in regard to booking shale reserves?'' a senior official from Ivy Energy, an investment firm specializing in the energy sector, wrote in a 2009 e-mail.
A former Enron executive wrote in 2009 while working at an energy company: ''I wonder when they will start telling people these wells are just not what they thought they were going to be?'' He added that the behavior of shale gas companies reminded him of what he saw when he worked at Enron.
Production data, provided by companies to state regulators and reviewed by The Times, show that many wells are not performing as the industry expected. In three major shale formations -- the Barnett in Texas, the Haynesville in East Texas and Louisiana and the Fayetteville, across Arkansas -- less than 20 percent of the area heralded by companies as productive is emerging as likely to be profitable under current market conditions, according to the data and industry analysts.
Richard K. Stoneburner, president and chief operating officer of Petrohawk Energy, said that looking at entire shale formations was misleading because some companies drilled only in the best areas or had lower costs. ''Outside those areas, you can drill a lot of wells that will never live up to expectations,'' he added.
Although energy companies routinely project that shale gas wells will produce gas at a reasonable rate for anywhere from 20 to 65 years, these companies have been making such predictions based on limited data and a certain amount of guesswork, since shale drilling is a relatively new practice.
Most gas companies claim that production will drop sharply after the first few years but then level off, allowing most wells to produce gas for decades.
Gas production data reviewed by The Times suggest that many wells in shale gas fields do not level off the way many companies predict but instead decline steadily.
''This kind of data is making it harder and harder to deny that the shale gas revolution is being oversold,'' said Art Berman, a Houston-based geologist who worked for two decades at Amoco and has been one of the most vocal skeptics of shale gas economics.
The Barnett shale, which has the longest production history, provides the most reliable case study for predicting future shale gas potential. The data suggest that if the wells' production continues to decline in the current manner, many will become financially unviable within 10 to 15 years.
A review of more than 9,000 wells, using data from 2003 to 2009, shows that -- based on widely used industry assumptions about the market price of gas and the cost of drilling and operating a well -- less than 10 percent of the wells had recouped their estimated costs by the time they were seven years old.
Terry Engelder, a professor of geosciences at Pennsylvania State University, said the debate over long-term well performance was far from resolved. The Haynesville shale has not lived up to early expectations, he said, but industry projections have become more accurate and some wells in the Marcellus shale, which stretches from Virginia to New York, are outperforming expectations.
A Sense of Confidence
Many people within the industry remain confident.
''I wouldn't worry about these shale companies,'' said T. Boone Pickens, the oil and gas industry executive, adding that he believes that if prices rise, shale gas companies will make good money.
Mr. Pickens said that technological improvements -- including hydrofracking wells more than once -- are already making production more cost-effective, which is why some major companies like ExxonMobil have recently bought into shale gas.
Shale companies are also adjusting their strategies to make money by focusing on shale wells that produce lucrative liquids, like propane and butane, in addition to natural gas.
Asked about the e-mails from the Chesapeake geologist casting doubt on company projections, a Chesapeake spokesman, Jim Gipson, said the company was fully confident that a majority of wells would be productive for 30 years or more.
David Pendery, a spokesman for IHS, added that though shale gas prospects had previously been debated by many analysts, in more recent years costs had fallen and technology had improved.
Still, in private exchanges, many industry insiders are skeptical, even cynical, about the industry's pronouncements. ''All about making money,'' an official from Schlumberger, an oil and gas services company, wrote in a July 2010 e-mail to a former federal regulator about drilling a well in Europe, where some United States shale companies are hunting for better market opportunities.
''Looks like crap,'' the Schlumberger official wrote about the well's performance, according to the regulator, ''but operator will flip it based on 'potential' and make some money on it.''
''Always a greater sucker,'' the e-mail concluded.

HEADLINE: First a Gold Rush, Then the Lawyers

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

 BODY:
SAN ISIDRO, El Salvador -- When a Central American gold rush brought a Canadian mining company here a few years ago, the company promised to stake a claim that would be as green as the lush hills.
The copious amounts of water needed would come only from the rain, not from the nearby Rio Lempa that is this country's lifeline, the company said. Cyanide, a toxic chemical used to extract gold embedded in rocks, would be dispersed naturally, dried by sunlight in vast double-lined pools. Several hundred jobs could be created here, in one of the country's poorest regions.
''No other mine in North America has gone to this level of environmental protection,'' said Tom Shrake, the chief executive of the Canadian company, Pacific Rim, which is seeking to tap a vein that it says could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
But when the government of El Salvador, facing mounting public concern over the consequences of mining, failed to grant the company the final permit it needed, Pacific Rim sought to extract a different kind of green: $77 million from the nation's treasury as compensation for lost profits. 
Pacific Rim is suing the Salvadoran government in an international investment court, one of scores of cases in recent years in which frustrated oil, gas and mining investors, using provisions of trade agreements, have sought to recoup losses from mostly developing countries.
Pacific Rim has cited as a precedent a landmark case from Mexico in 2000 in which the government was sued under the North American Free Trade Agreement and forced to pay a California company, Metalclad, $15.6 million in damages. The company sued after it said local authorities had thwarted its efforts to build a hazardous waste treatment plant despite assurances from the Mexican government that it would get the needed permits.
Since then, environmental advocates say, corporations have increasingly taken nations to court under regional trade agreements.
One of the biggest payouts occurred last year, when an arbitration panel awarded Chevron $700 million in a dispute with Ecuador over what it considered a delay in settling lawsuits over oil contracts, even as the company lost a much larger environmental ruling in Ecuador's own judicial system. In another example, a Malaysian firm, MTD Equity, used provisions of an investment treaty between Malaysia and Chile to win a $10.8 million case against Chile in 2004 over a residential and commercial development that government authorities ended up opposing.
The Pacific Rim case, now before a World Bank court in Washington, is the first of its kind to come under the Central America Free Trade Agreement that was approved in 2005, all sides in the dispute say.
Though the company went to court to ensure the level playing field for foreign businesses that it says the treaty guarantees, the case has angered Salvadoran officials, who consider it an attack on the sovereignty of a nation still struggling to fortify its institutions nearly 20 years after a brutal civil war.
''They are using the tribunal to dictate El Salvador's environmental policies,'' said Marcos Orellana, a lawyer for the Center for International Environmental Law in Washington, which has filed a brief supporting El Salvador.
In the court hearing the case, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, Latin American governments make up 9 percent of the court's 155 members but about 55 percent of the cases, according to the Institute for Policy Studies, a left-leaning research group in Washington.
The imbalance of cases in the region arises both from the bounty of natural resources there and political candidates who are making good on campaign promises to rein in foreign corporations or more closely examine their projects, the institute said.
With gold prices at record highs, companies are scouring the earth for every last deposit, and a run of new mines in Central America, particularly in Guatemala and Honduras, as well as a legacy of contamination from old ones is making the region a focal point for the fight.
''Past experience with mining companies has demonstrated to us that the country has been, in the past, not very careful in verifying that these projects were developed within acceptable parameters for the environment and our water resources,'' said El Salvador's attorney general, Benjamin Pleites Mazzini.
Pacific Rim began exploring an existing mine just north of San Isidro at El Dorado in 2002 and eventually discovered a new, potentially lucrative vein. Right-leaning governments initially appeared on course to grant the mine final approval but stalled amid signs that public sentiment was turning against the project.
By 2005, community members who rely on tributaries of the Rio Lempa for their farms complained that the water was drying up during the exploration phase. Mr. Shrake said that river water was used only briefly and that the company's activities did not account for the problem. The left-leaning government now in power has refused to sign off on the project.
Because Canada is not a party to Cafta, Pacific Rim filed suit in 2009 through a United States subsidiary.
Conflict has shadowed the case. Heated demonstrations have occurred, as both sides claim they have the will of the people. Pacific Rim says some of its employees have been threatened, while those on the other side say several mining opponents have been killed or gone missing in the past few years. This month, the body of a university student who disappeared while posting antimining fliers was found.
Local investigators have chalked up the cases to common crime in a region with its share of gang and other violence, but residents say the episodes have not been thoroughly investigated and hearken back to the darkest chapters of the war.
''People are worried about the lack of capacity to monitor these mines,'' said AndresMcKinley, former El Salvador director for Oxfam America, the nongovernmental organization that has taken the lead in organizing opposition to mining here. ''People need jobs, but not jobs at any cost.''
El Salvador's environment, he said, is fragile. It has the second-worst deforestation in the hemisphere, after Haiti, and 96 percent of its surface water is contaminated, mostly with agricultural and industrial runoff, he said.
''Can this country sustain an industry in mining?'' Mr. McKinley said.
It appears El Salvador, the only country in Central America to experience a decline in foreign investment last year, was preparing to answer yes. It has issued 29 licenses for mining exploration since 1999.
But Mr. Pleites, the attorney general, suggested new permits would not be issued until investors, environmental groups, outside experts and others came together to write a plan to more closely regulate the industry.
Mr. Shrake countered that the government stands to scare off investors if it cannot even approve a project as environmentally clean as Pacific Rim has sought to make it.
''We raised the bar for environmental protection,'' he said, touring the remnants of the ranch where the gold would be tapped.
Neto Mendez Murillo, 49, a driver for Pacific Rim, said he and other local residents are counting on the final approval of the mine for badly needed jobs. The only options for work now, he said, are low-paying jobs in the corn, bean and sugar cane fields, or in the United States.
''We are waiting for the gold jobs to change our lives,'' he said.
But Francisco Pineda, a farmer who has led raucous protests against the mine, jumping on machinery at one rally, said he doubted the company could contain all the cyanide it would use.
''We don't believe what they say,'' he said. ''The river is too important for us, and they already tampered with it. We are fighting for survival here.''

HEADLINE: Job Jugglers, on the Tightrope

BYLINE: By HANNAH SELIGSON

 BODY:
WHEN someone asks Roger Fierro ''What do you do?'' -- which he knows is shorthand for ''Where do you work?'' -- he laughs. Then he says, ''I do everything.''
Mr. Fierro, who is 26, has four jobs: working as a bilingual-curriculum specialist for the textbook publisher Pearson; handling estate sales and online marketing for a store that sells vintage items; setting up an online store for a custom pinata maker; and developing reality-show ideas for a production company. So far this month, he's made about $1,800.
Whereas most 9-to-5ers have some kind of structure in their lives, each workday can be wildly different for him. On a recent day, he worked on and off from 7 a.m. to midnight, making business calls, working on the pinata store's Web site and visiting the vintage store, among other things. (To maintain his sanity, he made sure to schedule some ''me'' time from 2 to 4 and 6 to 8.)
''I have eight million things going on,'' said Mr. Fierro, who lives in the West Town area of Chicago. ''It's exhausting. Sometimes I just want to take a nap.'' 
Some portions of the population -- especially young, creative types like actors, artists and musicians -- have always held multiple jobs to pay the bills. But people from all kinds of fields are now drawing income from several streams. Mr. Fierro, for one, has a degree in international studies and Latin American studies at the University of Chicago.
Some of these workers are patching together jobs out of choice. They may find full-time office work unfulfilling and are testing to see whether they can be their own boss. Certainly, the Internet has made working from home and trying out new businesses easier than ever.
But in many cases, necessity is driving the trend. ''Young college graduates working multiple jobs is a natural consequence of a bad labor market and having, on average, $20,000 worth of student loans to pay off,'' said Carl E. Van Horn, director of the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers.
''There are two types of people in this position: the graduate who can't get a full-time job, and the person whose income isn't sufficient to meet their expenses,'' he said. ''The only cure for young people in this position is an economic recovery of robust proportions.''
An entry-level salary often doesn't go very far these days. According to a study by the Heldrich Center, the median starting salary for those who graduated from four-year degree programs in 2009 and 2010 was $27,000, down from $30,000 for those who graduated in 2006 to 2008, before the recession. (Try living on $27,000 a year -- before taxes -- in a city like New York, Washington or Chicago.)
Many earn even less than $27,000. Maureen McCarty, 23, who graduated from American University in 2010 with a journalism degree, makes $25,000 before taxes as managing editor of TheNewGay.net, a blog focusing on gay issues, with no benefits like health insurance or a 401(k). The salary doesn't cover her expenses, so she often baby-sits five nights a week for six families in the Washington area.
Without the baby-sitting jobs, she says, she couldn't afford to live in Adams Morgan, a hip neighborhood in Washington, or take a vacation: ''I'm working in online publishing, an industry that is struggling to monetize, so if I want to do anything fun, like take a trip to New Orleans, I have to have additional income.''
Juggling jobs has its perils. ''I do sometimes get my schedules mixed up and will double- or even triple-book myself,'' Ms. McCarty said. Maintaining a social life can be challenging, and it might consist of ''dragging a friend along while I run errands on a Saturday.''
''Sometimes I do get burnt out from all of the juggling, but caffeine, for the most part, keeps me going,'' she said. ''I try when I get to that point to take some time by myself even if it's just 30 minutes during lunch.''
All told, Ms. McCarty says, she works 75 to 80 hours a week, a schedule more typical of investment bankers or lawyers aspiring to make partner in a firm -- but for just a fraction of the pay.
Between her salary at TheNewGay.net and the $5,000 she makes at her various baby-sitting jobs, Ms. McCarty has a pre-tax income of $30,000, or about $2,500 a month. More than $700 a month goes to the apartment she shares with two roommates.
Some months, however, when she doesn't have enough baby-sitting jobs lined up, Ms. McCarty has to make that ''horrible phone call'' to her parents to tell them that she can't make her rent.
LOUISE GASSMAN, 28, has a rotating schedule of multiple jobs: as an actress; as an assistant to dance instructors at the Circle in the Square and Juilliard schools; as a baby-sitter; and in a variety of administrative roles and as a spinning instructor at SoulCycle, an indoor cycling studio in New York.
Ms. Gassman's monthly income, which can vary greatly depending on whether she books an acting job, ranges from $1,800 to $4,000. Some months, almost all of her income goes to the $1,450 rent on her 290-square-foot studio on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Whatever is left after essentials goes toward paying off her remaining $16,000 in college loans.
''I worry about money all the time,'' Ms. Gassman said. ''I live on a really tight budget, and I live paycheck to paycheck.''
Periodically, the accountant who cuts her check at SoulCycle reminds her that someone her age should be putting away $300 a paycheck for retirement, an amount that is sometimes almost half of her pay. ''I'm like, retirement?'' she asks. ''Then I have the 'Oh my God, Oh my God' feelings.''
Ms. Gassman has come up with creative ways to save money. She has a policy not to spend $5 bills and instead puts them in a Tupperware container. So far, she's been able to use this cash to pay for a new air-conditioner, for three plane tickets, and for her dog to be neutered.
Mia Branco, 23, says she is always worried about money, even though she also works four jobs. She is the house manager at the Discovery Theater at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, teaches drama and music at Imagination Stage in Bethesda, Md., supervises the box office at the Woolly Mammoth Theater Company and works as a nanny.
Ms. Branco says she logs 40 to 50 hours a week, including travel time, and takes home $1,300 in a good month.
Still, Ms. Branco, who graduated magna cum laude with a degree in musical theater from American University in 2009, says she feels lucky to be employed at all. ''The majority of the jobs I have right now are because people were laid off and they didn't want to hire back full-time employees,'' she said. ''My willingness to have a hodgepodge schedule makes me more marketable.''
But very few part-time employers offer health insurance, and job jugglers tend to worry: What happens if I become really sick or get into an accident?
At least Ms. McCarty is covered through her parents under the new health care law that allows anyone under 26 to stay on their parents' insurance.
Mr. Fierro still receives insurance from a teaching job he used to have, but it runs out in August. He doesn't know what he'll do after that.
Ms. Branco pays $89 a month for very basic health insurance that has a high deductible, the kind of plan that she says makes her ''bank on not getting sick.''
Ms. Gassman, who does not have health insurance and hasn't had a physical since 2004, says she is extra careful when crossing the street because anything medically catastrophic is simply not an option right now. ''I can't afford to get hit by a taxi,'' she said.
ON the brighter side, when or if these job jugglers get on a career path, they may offer an attractive skill set: they are expert multitaskers, hyper-organized and often very knowledgeable in technology. Having multiple jobs is an exercise in mental dexterity.
Ms. Branco says that because of her four jobs, which require skills as diverse as developing lesson plans and mastering an online ticketing system, she has become more adept at dealing with a wide range of people and situations: ''I've learned to be very adaptable, because one day I'm corporate, the next day I'm start-up, and the next day I'm nonprofit.''
Mr. Fierro describes himself as ''MacGyver.'' He might have to transport some furniture, ''read and synthesize documents, find obscure bits of information on Google and give presentations in Spanish, all in one day,'' he says.
But beware: Too much multitasking makes it harder to sustain attention, according to Kirk Snyder, an assistant professor of communications at the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California, who researches the changing workplace values of Gen Y.
''I think being focused on more than one professional pursuit at the same time makes it easier to give up on those pursuits that take more effort or have a longer payoff curve because there are always other options to focus on,'' he said.
More damaging, however, may be the economics. A national study by the Johns Hopkins Institute for Policy Studies found that young women who worked primarily in part-time jobs did not make higher wages in their 30s than in their 20s.
''The study was clear. Women don't benefit wage-wise from working part time,'' said Andrew Sum, director of the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University and a co-author of the study. The reason is that part-time jobs generally provide fewer training opportunities and often don't put workers on a track for advancement.
More college graduates are working in second jobs that don't require college degrees, part of a phenomenon called ''mal-employment.'' In short, many baby-sitters, sales clerks, telemarketers and bartenders are overqualified for their jobs.
Last year, 1.9 million college graduates were mal-employed and had multiple jobs, up 17 percent from 2007, according to federal data. Almost half of all college graduates have a job that doesn't require a bachelor's degree.
The goal for most, Mr. Sum said, is to be upgraded to full-time jobs. ''That is where there is the most payoff for a college degree,'' he said.
But full-time jobs don't suit everyone. Ms. Gassman, for example, has been offered a full-time job at SoulCycle, complete with full benefits, but she doesn't want it. ''I wouldn't be able to go on auditions in the middle of the day,'' she explained. ''Of course, it stresses me out not to have health insurance, but what is my choice? Work in an office and be unhappy? Being happy is a superhigh value to me.''
Mr. Fierro is much happier now than when he was working as a bilingual reading specialist for a public school in Chicago. ''I was working 12 hours a day and making $38,000 a year and it wasn't making a dent in the $120,000 in loans I had to pay off. Plus, I was miserable.''
Mr. Fierro, who calls himself an ''aesthetic consultant,'' would ultimately like to create his own line of merchandise, along the lines of Marc Jacobs. He is optimistic that he is more likely to achieve his goal by working on many projects than if he held a traditional job.
Ms. Branco says that while she is often exhausted and hasn't had two consecutive days off in months, she isn't ready to commit to one employer. ''The jobs are allowing me to wander and figure out what I really want to do,'' she said.
Professor Snyder at Southern Cal doesn't see multiple job-holding as a trend that will disappear anytime soon.
''The likelihood of this generation devoting their professional life to just one job or career at the same time is simply counterintuitive to their worldview,'' he said. ''I think we would be seeing this generation pursuing multiple jobs and careers at once even in a robust economy.''
Still, is job-juggling really sustainable, particularly when the next stage of life hits and there may be a mortgage and children?
Ms. McCarty doesn't think so. She is looking for an end to her 80-hour weeks and meager paychecks. ''I don't want to be 30 and working a bunch of small jobs so I can pay my bills,'' she said.

HEADLINE: A Troubled High School Celebrates a Milestone

BYLINE: By MERIBAH KNIGHT. 
mknight@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
Standing in the hallway of Austin Polytech, Stran'Ja Burge, 18, adjusted her burgundy graduation cap and shifted her weight restlessly from one foot to the other. Her four-year-old high school was about to graduate its first senior class, but for Ms. Burge, the end of high school had still not registered.
''It hasn't hit me yet,'' she said, carefully clasping her hands a few inches from her waist so as not to wrinkle her gown.
Austin Polytechnical Academy opened on the West Side of Chicago in 2007 as the city's first and only career academy dedicated to occupations in high-skill manufacturing. On June 12, the school sent its first 92 graduates into that understaffed job market, many with industry-recognized credentials, internship experience and more than three years of engineering classes on their transcripts. 
The school, developed as part of the Renaissance 2010 initiative by Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, then chief executive of Chicago Public Schools, aims to prepare students to fill some of the nation's estimated three million vacant positions in science, technology, engineering and math. The ambitious plan seeks to engage private-industry companies to help train the students, all of them from a community that has watched local industry flee, unemployment climb and foreclosure rates soar to the highest in the city.
Where graduates go from here -- work force or college, inside or outside the community -- will be a test of achievement for Austin Polytech.
Since September, the Chicago News Cooperative has followed three students: Stran'Ja Burge and Marquiese Travae Booker, both seniors, and Deandre Joyce, a junior. In that time, the school has endured wrenching changes, many of them emblematic of a larger instability within C.P.S. as leaders seek to reform one of the country's largest and most troubled public school systems .
Two separate narratives about the school have emerged: one public and one private; one filled with success, the other fraught with troubles.
In the positive narrative, the Center for Labor and Community Research, a nonprofit organization, helped Austin Polytech obtain accreditation for its machine shop through the National Institute for Metalworking Skills, becoming the only high school in Illinois to earn that classification. The school also rolled out two job-shadowing programs, secured summer jobs and internships for 36 students, and saw 89 students earn 123 industry-recognized certificates.
But it was also a year of nearly constant fits and starts by the C.P.S. system, sapping energy from teachers, administrators and students. In October, school district officials placed Austin Polytech on probation for poor academic performance. In February, students learned that the interim principal would be leaving at the end of the school year. In March, C.P.S. backed off a plan to merge Austin with the Austin Business and Entrepreneurship Academy after a community uproar. In May, the principal fired seven teachers, nearly a quarter of Polytech's teaching staff, prompting a flurry of union grievances, followed by a student walkout and sit-in that resulted in the suspension of 36 students. (The suspensions were later rescinded and stricken from the students' records.)
Yet for students like Ms. Burge, who is ranked in the top 10 of her class, as well as for Mr. Joyce and Mr. Booker, much of the hurly-burly has been a sideshow to the usual rites of passage: college applications, ACTs, prom, final exams and future plans. The unrest at the school was more a nuisance than anything else, they said.
What comes next is different for each: Ms. Burge will attend college at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, where she will play basketball and pursue a degree in engineering. Mr. Booker landed a job at the Laystrom Manufacturing Company, where he interned last summer. Mr. Joyce hopes to stay on track during his senior year, raise his ACT score from an 18 to a 20, and then decide what will come next: college or work.
Despite the school's tumultuous year, Ms. Burge said she had enjoyed her time at Austin Polytech. It gave her the opportunity to take advanced-placement calculus, travel to Washington on behalf of the school and participate in student government.
The home environment was tougher. Ms. Burge often waited until everyone in the house was asleep before cracking her books. After coming home, she would sleep from 5 p.m. until 10 p.m., then wake up and work on school assignments until 2 a.m. It was the only time the house was quiet, she said.
As she headed off to school a few days before the graduation ceremony, Ms. Burge walked by her uncle sleeping on the front porch. He struggles with addiction and her grandmother lets him sleep there, she said, adding that his example was an impetus to work harder.
''I'm not like 'Aw because my uncle's a crackhead, then I'm not going to go to school,' '' she said last fall. ''I'm going to do the reverse and because I see him do that, this is why I'm going to school every day and this why I'm going to college.'' She is the first in her family to pursue college outside Illinois.
When Mr. Booker was not playing baseball or practicing with the bowling team, he spent the year working at Harold's Chicken and trying to figure out what came next. Then an opportunity presented itself. Laystrom Manufacturing offered Mr. Booker a position, created just for him, in the quality control department. He took the job.
On graduation day, waiting in the hallway of Polytech in his cap and gown, a visitor asked him if he was excited about his new job. ''Yes,'' he said, giving way to a big smile. ''I really, really am.''
In the auditorium, Deandre Joyce, 18, looked on, expecting that next year, his senior year, he will be up on the stage. His junior year went well enough, he said, though there were rough spots. He was kicked off the basketball team after a disagreement with his coach. His grades. he said, foundered after he and his grandmother were forced out of their apartment because of flood damage. In the winter, his two front teeth were knocked out after he was elbowed in the jaw in a pickup basketball game.
''All I want for Christmas are my two front teeth,'' he said he sang to the doctor as he was fitted for false ones.
The spring protest over the teachers' firing was a highlight of his year, Mr. Joyce said. He was among the 36 students suspended for participating in the walkout and sit-in. ''Our voices can be heard,'' he said. ''There is power in numbers.''
As the seniors crossed the stage to receive their diplomas, they danced, dipping, shaking, pumping their fists victoriously. When Mr. Booker's name was called, he pulled a pair of guitar-shaped sunglasses out of his pocket, put them on and shimmied across the stage to shake the principal's hand. Ms. Burge danced across the stage as her family cheered her on.
Outside after the ceremony, students received congratulatory hugs and posed for photographs with family and friends. At the end of the street, Police Officer Brian Tierney, a neighborhood beat officer, parked his cruiser in the middle of the street.
Mr. Tierney opened his door, turned on his public address system and offered the students some parting words.
''Congratulations,'' he said. ''Now, do the right thing.''

HEADLINE: Hammer Time?

BYLINE: By KRISTINA SHEVORY

 BODY:
LOUIS FOUNDOS didn't think he would have a problem selling out his new condominium project last fall. It was a renovated building in East Harlem with everything a first-time buyer might want, including granite countertops, dishwashers and washing machines in every unit. It was just a few blocks from the subway, and plenty of new development was under way in the neighborhood.
Five months later, when not a single one of his 12 condos had sold, he decided it was time for drastic measures. He would break his long-held vow and follow his bank's advice. He would try an auction.
''It's not an easy decision,'' said Mr. Foundos, the managing partner of FFS Realty of East Meadow, N.Y. ''No one likes to roll the dice when you don't know where they'll go.'' 
Last weekend Mr. Foundos's building, the Winfield, went on the block. The four units without a reserve price were sold. Opening bids started as low as $149,000, or 60 percent off the previous asking price.
''We needed a kick-start, and the auction provided that,'' he said. ''It was kind of what I expected -- getting people through the building was good, and it got good exposure.''
With few sales, developers like Mr. Foundos, tired of seeing loan payments, taxes and maintenance costs consume the bottom line, are resorting to auctions, in a gamble that selling units at a discount now will be better than sitting on unsold property for another year. In some cases they are trying to sell a building's last remaining units; in others, to prod moribund sales or introduce a property.
Since the housing downturn, condo auctions around the country have increased. But in New York City they have been rare; and in Manhattan, nearly nonexistent.
Brokers and lawyers, sensing that the time may be right for residential auctions in New York, have started auction companies, like BidOnTheCity.com and Paramount Realty USA, in the last two years. Established auctioneers, like Sheldon Good & Company and Auction.com, have opened offices in Manhattan in expectation of a boom.
Yet, for all the interest, fewer than 10 live, in-person auctions have taken place in New York City since the housing bubble burst three years ago. Only about 75 units have changed hands in this way.
''What drives this business is a significant fall in housing prices,'' said Ken Rivkin, an executive vice president of Auction.com, ''and we have not had that in Manhattan.''
According to some predictions, the housing bust was going to create a wave of auctions across the country. But despite an uptick, auctions represent less than 2 percent of the overall residential real estate market nationwide. In 2008, the most recent year for which data are available, $17.1 billion in residential real estate sold at auction, or 1.4 percent of all homes sold, according to the National Auctioneers Association. That figure was $11.5 billion in 2003 and $16 billion in 2006.
The majority of homes put up for auction in New York are foreclosures sold in city courthouses or through Auction.com, formerly the Real Estate Disposition Corporation. Foreclosure auctions disposed of 6,621 apartments, single- and two-family homes last year in New York City, according to PropertyShark.com. (Most auction houses avoid foreclosed properties because they don't want the accompanying hassles and uncertainty.)
In the past, developers and individual homeowners were loath to auction properties because of the air of desperation associated with the process. Most have been content to list their homes through a traditional brokerage or to wait for the market to recover. Auction houses report that they have come close to signing deals with developers, only to have them back out the minute they sell a few units.
''What it takes to be a good developer is to be a perpetual optimist,'' said John J. Cuticelli Jr., the chief executive of the Sheldon Good & Company auction house in Manhattan. ''What he doesn't realize when you have 100 to 150 units to consume, three or five isn't a velocity of sales to sustain any business model. There's this continual hope that the market will come back.''
Some developers have had problems selling condominiums because of new Federal Housing Administration rules. The agency will not insure a mortgage unless 30 percent of the units in the building have been sold. Banks, too, have tightened their financing demands and generally will not lend unless 30 to 50 percent of a building is sold.
''That's a Catch-22 for a seller,'' Scott Burman, a developer and a founder of Paramount USA, which auctioned the Winfield condos. ''Buyers need mortgages, banks need contracts. Unless you can line up all-cash buyers, it's very difficult to do.''
Because of the relative strength of the New York market, banks here have not been pushing developers to hold auctions as they have in other parts of the country. The average price for a Manhattan apartment is 22.7 percent less than in 2008, according to the real estate appraisal company Miller Samuel.
Auctions were more common in New York in the early 1990s, when they were driven by a wave of co-op conversions and a recession. At the time, sponsors had been hit hard by soaring interest rates and a freeze in financing and mortgages, so they resorted to auctions to sell co-ops whose carrying costs had become too high.
''The difference between this time and last time is there was tremendous pressure from banks that forced them to move product,'' said Jon Gollinger, the chief executive of Accelerated Marketing Partners, a residential marketing company in Boston that auctions condos. ''It was primarily bank-driven, and this time banks are not driving it. It's extend and pretend,'' he said, alluding to a reluctance to declare loans distressed, in hopes that the economy will pick up.
After trying for two years to sell out the Grand at Diamond Beach, a condominium tower on the Jersey Shore, the Carlyle Group, a private equity company, said this month that it would auction 18 units there early next month. Only 34 of 125 condos have sold.
''Because of a correction in the national housing market,'' D. Scott Jenkins, a vice president of the Carlyle Group, wrote in an e-mail, ''accurate pricing for the Grand at Diamond Beach is unclear. Auctioning a limited number of residences will allow the market to determine true value.''
An auction moved the last six units at One Hanson Place in Brooklyn for Canyon Johnson Urban Funds, an investment group, and the Dermot Company, a developer. All penthouses, they had been on the market since 2006. The May auction created a sense of urgency and focused attention on the units, Maria L. Stamolis, a Canyon Johnson fund managing director, said in an e-mail. The auction sold all six for prices ranging from $1.457 million to $2.805 million, including the buyer's premium, a fee charged to the winning bidder.
Not every auction is a wild success for developers. At the Solaria in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, only 10 apartments sold in the year after the 64-unit tower went on the market at the start of 2008. Joseph Korff, the developer, decided on an auction.
But there were few in attendance when it took place in November 2009. Most bids came in below the reserve -- the minimum price that the seller will accept. Only eight units sold at the auction and in postauction negotiations.
''On this particular property, I wouldn't do it again,'' said Mr. Korff, the principal at ARC Development in Manhattan. ''I'd want to see a greater public acceptance of a model of marketing inventory, and I'd like to see some successes in Manhattan.''
He is trying other methods of selling the other units, including inducements like free summer camp for buyers' children.
Auctions are not necessarily deals for buyers, either. Most apartments appearing in auctions have been in less desirable locations, or priced too high for the market.
Many auctions carry a 5 to 10 percent buyer's premium. Some sellers don't disclose the reserve, so the highest bidder may have to wait until after the auction to see if his bid has been accepted.
''Most auctions I've been aware of are faux auctions because they don't have a disclosed reserve,'' said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal company Miller Samuel. ''The developer decides whether to sell.''
The weekly foreclosure auctions at county courthouses are another option for buyers. Most participants are investors who buy in teams and come with bank checks for thousands of dollars. The winning bidder must be ready to pay 10 percent of the purchase price.
Adam Paul started buying foreclosed co-ops eight years ago when he grew tired of making no money as an actor, and he now owns, with relatives and friends, more than 90 apartments in various stages of renovation, legal turmoil and sale.
''The way you make money in this business is volume,'' said Mr. Paul, 33, who lives in a rental apartment. ''The notion that I have $200,000 and invest in a foreclosed apartment and make a lot of money is the stuff of late-night infomercials. There are a million pitfalls.''
Yamil Martinez and his partner, Enrique Garcia, went to an open house at the New Amsterdam Condominiums in Washington Heights on a lark. They liked the 26 condos that were going on the block, so they obtained financing and attended the auction, conducted in February by Sheldon Good. Their budget was $300,000.
Within an hour, after first bidding on a penthouse, they had bought a two-bedroom two-bath condo for $304,000, including a 10 percent buyer's premium. In the months since, they have remodeled the kitchen and bathroom, so the place ''looks like an apartment you'd see in SoHo or TriBeCa,'' Mr. Martinez said.
''You're going to get more for your money, more square footage,'' said Mr. Martinez, 28, a restaurateur. ''I think it's a better deal. The buyer's premium didn't bother me. I would have given it to a broker anyway.''

HEADLINE: Car Bomb Leaves at Least 20 Dead At Hospital in Eastern Afghanistan

BYLINE: By RAY RIVERA; Sharifullah Sahak contributed reporting.

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- A sport utility vehicle packed with explosives blew up on Saturday outside a small hospital in a remote area of eastern Afghanistan, killing at least 20 people and injuring at least 23 more, government officials said.
The powerful midmorning blast ripped through the Akbar Khail hospital, a 10-bed facility in the Azra District of Logar Province, about 40 miles southeast of Kabul near the Pakistan border. 
The explosion leveled the one-story building and sent debris crashing down on patients, visitors and staff members inside, said Din Mohammad Darwish, a spokesman for the provincial governor's office.
Rescuers continued to pull the dead and injured out of the wreckage late into the afternoon, Mr. Darwish said.
''The hospital is totally destroyed,'' he said. ''The numbers may go higher.''
The Ministry of Public Health in Kabul said at one point on Saturday that 60 people had been killed and 120 wounded but later downgraded the toll to 43 killed and wounded. Dr. Mohammad Zaref Nayebkhail, the health director for Logar Province, said the explosion killed at least 50 and injured an additional 90. The conflicting numbers reflected the confusion surrounding the scene and the difficulty of getting information out of the isolated and mountainous area, where telephone coverage is spotty.
Even as he spoke, Dr. Nayebkhail was boarding a helicopter in the provincial capital, Pul-i-Alam, about 70 miles west of the hospital, to help in the rescue. Another helicopter filled with doctors, nurses and supplies had left moments earlier, he said.
''Helicopter is the only way to get there, it is a very difficult area to reach,'' he said.
No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, and the Taliban have denied any involvement. ''We strongly condemn this inhuman attack which was carried out by some other elements who are trying to defame the Taliban and blame us for doing this,'' the Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said by cellphone from an undisclosed location.
Dr. Nayebkhail said the bomber rammed his vehicle through front gate of the compound around 10:30 a.m., striking and killing a guard who tried to stop him. The vehicle struck a second guard in front of the main clinic and then detonated.
''It made a huge explosion,'' he said. The hospital was fairly new, he said, built with money from the United States Agency for International Development. It was originally intended as a maternity clinic but was recently expanded to be a full-service health center.
Midwives and a number of children were believed to be among the dead, he said.
Insurgent activity has been on the rise in the province. Attacks in the first two weeks of June surpassed the figure for the entire month of May, according to the Afghanistan NGO Safety Office, which tracks insurgent activity. Coalition forces have also increased the number of night raids in the province searching for Taliban leaders. Last week, a Taliban leader and another insurgent were killed in an airstrike in the Charkh District, according to NATO reports.
The leader, Khalil, was involved in coordinating and carrying out attacks against Afghan government officials and was supported by both the Taliban and the Haqqani networks, NATO said. Other night raids last week in the districts of Charkh and Baraki Barak captured several individuals with suspected ties to the Haqqani network and a leader with the Hezb-i-Islami insurgent group led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, reflecting the range of varying insurgent networks active in the province.
According to NATO, the Haqqani network, a particularly brutal group based in the tribal areas of Pakistan, was responsible for the May 2 suicide attack on the national military hospital in Kabul, which left six people dead and wounded 20 others.
Mollawi Qalamudin, a former high-ranking Taliban official from Logar who is now a member of President Hamid Karzai's High Peace Council, said he believed it unlikely that the Taliban would have singled out a purely civilian medical facility.
But, he said, ''There might be some irresponsible commanders who carry out these kind of heartbreaking attacks without informing their higher-ups.''
Saturday's attack comes one day after a bicycle rigged with explosives blew up in an outdoor market in the northern province of Kunduz, killing at least 10 people, including a police officer.
While violence was expected to increase in the warmer summer months, civilians have borne the heaviest toll so far, even as NATO casualties are down slightly from this period last year. The United Nations said that May was the deadliest month for Afghan civilians since it began keeping count in 2007, with 368 civilians killed.
Most of the casualties, 82 percent, were caused by Taliban and other militants, while 12 percent were caused by NATO troops and Afghan forces; in 6 percent of the cases, it was not clear who was responsible.

HEADLINE: Citizen Kushner

BYLINE: By JEREMY PETERS

 BODY:
ON a recent Monday evening, Jared Kushner, the 30-year-old publisher of The New York Observer, was holding court in the grand ballroom at the Harmonie Club on East 60th Street. The occasion marked the newspaper's annual ''100 Most Powerful People in New York Real Estate'' issue, and many in attendance were city fixtures, people whose names appear on donor plaques and ballots, not on movie marquees: the developer Richard LeFrak, New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman, the public relations wizard Howard Rubenstein.
A seraphic figure with neatly sculptured chestnut brown hair and fair skin, the young publisher worked his way through a stream of approaching guests with business-like efficiency. In a corner stood a white backdrop covered in company logos. A velvet rope sat unused nearby.
''Isn't this fun and glamorous,'' Mr. Kushner said, his wry tone and boyish grin suggesting that he found the scene around him neither. 
If you knew anything about Jared Kushner five years ago, it was probably that he was the oldest son of Charles Kushner, a New Jersey real estate developer who had spent time in prison for orchestrating one of the more memorable get-even schemes perpetrated in the name of sibling rivalry. He had hired a prostitute to entrap his brother-in-law and captured their encounter on hidden camera to show his sister.
After watching his father's case play out in the media, with articles full of unflattering, anonymous leaks, Mr. Kushner did the one thing he could do to gain a modicum of control over the press: he bought his way in, paying about $10 million for The Observer, a newspaper read obsessively by New York's business, political and cultural elite.
He was 25 at the time.
Since then Mr. Kushner has managed The Observer through a recession that left the newspaper business in tatters. He has turned over virtually the entire staff -- including three editors in chief in two years -- while trying to shift to a business model centered on real estate and digital advertising dollars.
If it was a bad time to buy a newspaper, it was arguably a worse time to be doubling down on real estate. He added to his family's holdings, helping Kushner Companies acquire one of the city's better known properties, the 666 Fifth Avenue office towers, at the height of the market.
While these moves have elevated his profile in the city, he has warily embraced his place in the spotlight. He is far from the brash, publicity seeking dynamo one might expect to see in someone who managed to buy a New York newspaper at a tender age. He seems uninterested in using the paper to further political ambitions. Unlike Mort Zuckerman, another real estate mogul who moved into the media business by acquiring The Atlantic, U.S. News & World Report and The Daily News in New York and aggressively embraced the platform it afforded, you won't see Mr. Kushner on ''Meet the Press.''
In other ways he has made the most of his new visibility. He married one of the most famous young women in New York, Ivanka Trump. The couple vacations on Rupert Murdoch's 184-foot sailboat and have appeared as themselves on the CW series ''Gossip Girl.''
Yet every Friday night, you'll find Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump at home in their Park Avenue apartment marking the Sabbath with dishes like Moroccan meat pie and sweet pea soup that Ivanka, a novice cook, prepares herself. (''I think he humors me,'' Ms. Trump, 29, said of her husband's enthusiastic reviews.)
Mr. Kushner, who saw at a young age how the media glare can scald, maintains he wants to stay out of it. ''I quickly learned that there really wasn't much benefit to being out there,'' he said in a recent interview.
But friends of Mr. Kushner say it was more than just seeing potential in an undervalued media property that drew him to the salmon-colored weekly.
''He was definitely looking to make a reputation for himself quickly, and the newspaper was the opportunity that was there to be had,'' said Bob Sommer, who worked as one of The Observer's top business executives from 2007 to 2009.
''I'd be lying if I said it didn't have an impact,'' Mr. Kushner said of his purchase. ''When I bought the paper I had no idea the level of power and influence it had. I really bought the paper because I saw it as a great brand.''
After Mr. Kushner bought it, its longtime editor, Peter Kaplan, told him that he would never be a successful publisher unless he truly loved running a newspaper. For Mr. Kushner, who developed a deep-seated mistrust of the press during his father's travails, that love did not come easily. Nor is it clear that it has ever come at all.
Mr. Kaplan, who quit The Observer two years ago after tensions with Mr. Kushner became too severe, has moved on to become editorial director of the Fairchild Fashion Group and declined to comment.
Graydon Carter, who was the editor of The Observer before he moved to Vanity Fair, said he is unclear as to what drew Mr. Kushner to the paper, but ''there are only three reasons to own a publication. One is to create great journalism. Two is to have fun. And three is to make some money.''
''Anything else,'' he said, ''to raise your social standing or whatever -- is a chump's game.''
JARED KUSHNER turned 30 in January and is about to be a father. In ways both personal and professional, 2011 is shaping up to be a defining year in his life. Most 30-year-olds would have the luxury of confronting these tests privately. But that is a luxury that Mr. Kushner doesn't have inside the fishbowl of his own making.
For one thing, 666 Fifth Avenue is not taking in enough money. Mr. Kushner is renegotiating the terms of the loan so the company can continue making payments on the building, which currently are $6.2 million a month. Then there is The Observer itself. While it has been profitable for the past several quarters, the recession took its predictable toll.
Mr. Kushner also found it difficult to work alongside his editors. Sometimes he was in open conflict with his editorial staff, who often paid him little respect.
One day in early 2009, a security breakdown in The Observer's computer system allowed employees access to one another's hard drives. A few staff members with prying eyes went into Mr. Kushner's and found a file with an intriguing name. They opened it and found pictures of their boss and Ms. Trump, his girlfriend at the time, and Billy Joel aboard Mr. Murdoch's sailboat, Rosehearty.
For a group that had seen its ranks shrunk by layoffs and demoralized by pay cuts, the sight of their young publisher surrounded by such decadence was a sore one.
Mr. Kushner is now on his fourth editor in chief, Elizabeth Spiers, who is undertaking a wholesale remake of the paper's Web site and print design.
Ms. Spiers said she went into the job with eyes wide open, harboring no misconceptions about the difficulties her predecessors faced. But she said she also believes that all the turmoil -- the staff exodus, the budget cuts, the digital-print integration -- had left the organization at a point where there was no more upheaval left to play out.
The paper ''kind of veered off in the wrong direction the last couple of years,'' Ms. Spiers said.'' There wasn't much of a vision, maybe it tried to go in too general of a direction, and the voice flattened. I think we've been able to restore a few crucial things.''
As for Mr. Kushner, running The Observer has been grueling at times.. ''It's obviously been a lot more work than I anticipated it being,'' he said. At the same time, he added, ''If you look at where the paper is relative to when I bought it, it's a much more stable organization.''
MR. KUSHNER grew up as the oldest son in a large Orthodox Jewish family in northern New Jersey. His paternal grandparents were Holocaust survivors, and he was educated at the Frisch School, a coed Jewish institution in Paramus, N.J.
He went to Harvard for his undergraduate degree. While many of his classmates occupied their free time with more indulgent collegiate pursuits, he got a jump on the family business, buying up apartment buildings around Boston. Friends recalled that he always displayed a preternatural orientation toward adulthood.
''He would get out of class and you wouldn't see him until late at night,'' said Nitin Saigal, who lived with Mr. Kushner for three years at Harvard and then shared an apartment with him on Mercer Street for several years after they graduated and moved to New York. ''You'd say, 'Where have you been?' And he'd say he was in Somerville talking to a contractor because the doors on one of his buildings weren't working.''
For what awaited him after college, maturity was not optional. Charles Kushner pleaded guilty in August 2004 to filing false tax returns, hiding illegal campaign donations and retaliating against his sister -- a government witness -- by hiring a prostitute to entrap her husband.
''I lay awake at night, and I think about the guilt, the pain and the suffering that I've caused to my family,'' Charles told a judge on the day of his sentencing in early 2005. ''I've caused a lot of pain.''
With his father more than 1,000 miles away in a federal prison in Montgomery, Ala. (he was sentenced to serve time there because of a special program for Orthodox Jewish prisoners), Jared became the de facto Kushner paterfamilias.
He flew down to Alabama ''every single weekend,'' his brother Josh, 26, said. ''He never missed one.''
In between prison visits, Jared's life was one of lack of experience born by too much experience. He studied at New York University in a joint M.B.A. and law degree program, earning his degree in 2007. Before he even graduated he had bought The Observer and helped Kushner Companies negotiate the $1.8 billion purchase for 666 Fifth, at the time the largest sum paid for a single office building in the country.
Things came at him very fast in those first few years, he said. Suddenly city leaders and media executives were seeking him out. Ms. Trump was now part of his orbit. ''I knew about him in his capacity as the new owner of The Observer,'' she recalled.
More connections followed. After The Observer published an editorial supporting Joel Klein, then the schools chancellor, in his efforts to do away with ''rubber rooms,'' where teachers accused of wrongdoing or incompetence would bide time on suspension, Mr. Klein sent Mr. Kushner a thank-you note. The two men have been friends since, and Mr. Klein and his wife have been guests at the Kushners' Friday night dinners.
Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump also became close to Rupert Murdoch and his wife, Wendi, and the Murdochs' young daughters were flower girls at their wedding.
''I grew up, a kid in New Jersey,'' Mr. Kushner said. ''And I'm here with these people who are very interesting people. And I've been able to develop a lot of very interesting relationships.''
He then hastened to add, ''But it's something that is not very central to who we are.''
Being friends was the easy part. Running a newspaper that wrote about these kinds of people regularly, often relishing the opportunity to take shots at them, has been another matter altogether.
One of Mr. Kushner's first major editorial moves after buying the newspaper was to create that list of the 100 ''most powerful'' players in New York real estate. It quickly became a source of tension with Observer editors, especially over a question that hit very close to home for Mr. Kushner: Where to rank his father-in-law, Donald Trump?
In years past, the creation and inevitable revising of the list has played out awkwardly. Observer editors and reporters would draw up a draft, placing Mr. Trump somewhere insufficiently high in Mr. Kushner's mind, according to several people who have been involved in creating the lists.
Editors would then reshuffle the list, awarding Mr. Trump a higher ranking. In 2010, he was No. 16. This year he moved up to No. 14.
Kyle Pope, who edited the newspaper until he left in February over what he called irreconcilable differences with Mr. Kushner, said of his former boss: ''The thing that he never got his head around is that you can write a negative story on someone and still be powerful in those circles. The paper can run a negative story, and it's not going to diminish his power. In fact, it would probably increase his power. He thought you had to write nice stories about people you might run into.'' Mr. Pope said he left on his own terms and continued to be paid; Mr. Kushner said he fired him.
Many once-loyal Observer readers have begun to wonder whether it had lost its irreverent edge.
''I just don't read it as much as I used to,'' Mr. Carter said. ''I'm just not that interested in stories about commercial real estate.''
AT the Harmonie Club function, Ivanka Trump was there with her father-in-law and brother-in-law Josh. ''I love my son -- I couldn't be prouder of my son,'' Charles Kushner said. ''We've had a lot of experience with journalists. Some of them not so. ...'' His voice trailed off and he stopped himself. ''I'll leave the rest to him.''
Jared Kushner got a break from the crush of guests only after a publicist tugged on his arm and prodded him toward the podium.
He delivered some obligatory thank-yous and opening remarks.
''I will keep it short,'' he told the crowd. And he kept his word.

HEADLINE: In Uganda, a Bitter Personal Rivalry Is Played Out on the National Stage

BYLINE: By JOSH KRON

 BODY:
KAMPALA, Uganda -- Like many war stories, this one began with love.
Before the tear gas and street riots, the violent arrests and hospital visits, Yoweri Museveni and Kizza Besigye were close friends, a future president and the doctor to whom he entrusted his life. They fought together to free their country from dictatorship.
Some say they even fell for the same woman.
Now, as Uganda undergoes its most raucous political convulsion in years, with broad-based demonstrations and dissenting officials testing President Museveni's 25-year hold on power, the passions from a feud that began long ago between the friends are playing out on the national stage. 
Unlike the revolutions in Egypt and Tunisia, which were borne of popular uprisings, the protest movement in Uganda has been driven by a single man, Mr. Besigye, who may know the president -- and how to get under his skin -- better than any politician.
Mr. Besigye did not light himself on fire, like the Tunisian man who set in motion the Arab Spring, or take up arms like the rebels in Libya. Instead, after losing badly to the president in yet another election -- he has run the last three times -- Mr. Besigye simply said he was going to walk to his office, rather than use his car, to protest rising commodity prices and corruption.
The resulting demonstrations were meek -- Mr. Besigye was practically alone on the first day -- but President Museveni's government responded with overwhelming force, eventually locking up hundreds of opposition supporters, killing others and at times using tear gas and water cannon to disperse as few as six protesters at a time.
With each clampdown, the protests became larger, fueled by outrage over the repression. Mr. Besigye, once seen as a political dud, was suddenly credited as an alchemist, and President Museveni, long seen by the United States as a liberal ally, exhibited a more draconian side.
The protests have since fizzled, but the political row has not. Opposition lawmakers boycotted the president's recent inaugural address, Mr. Besigye has appeared in court on numerous charges, and the police remain heavily deployed.
Many have wondered why the president would inflate such a seemingly insipid challenge.
His critics, some of whom were once close to him, say this is the real Mr. Museveni, an arrogant and at times ruthless ruler who has silenced political opponents to stay in power this long.
But they also say that the feud is personal, tied to the president's relationship with Mr. Besigye and his wife, Winnie Byanyima, whom Mr. Museveni has known since childhood and, many say, once wanted to marry.
The history may shed light on the depth of the political movement. It was the winter of 1980, after nearly a decade of Idi Amin's brutal dictatorship, when Mr. Besigye, then a young doctor, started attending rallies for a popular and charismatic new political figure, Mr. Museveni.
''He was a young person who in himself attracted us as young people,'' Mr. Besigye said. ''He was saying the right things that struck a chord with us, about what kind of government Uganda deserved. We started to see him as one of the shining torches.''
When Mr. Museveni's new political party came in third in general elections that year, he started a guerrilla movement in the bush. Activists like Mr. Besigye were hunted down, and Mr. Besigye says he and others were locked in the basement of a popular Kampala hotel.
He escaped and in 1982 found the rebels in the bush and was welcomed by Mr. Museveni, who made him his personal doctor. ''I lived next to him in a tent,'' Mr. Besigye said, ''and stayed close by him until the end of the war.''
Mr. Besigye said he also met Ms. Byanyima. She was a young rebel officer close to Mr. Museveni in the bush while his wife and children were living in Sweden. Years later, Mr. Besigye and Ms. Byanyima would marry.
Mr. Besigye said that at times Mr. Museveni and Ms. Byanyima were involved in a romantic relationship, and that as a doctor he treated both of them, gradually becoming a trusted counsel to the rebel leader. After Mr. Museveni triumphed and became president in 1986, Mr. Besigye was named minister of internal affairs.
But trouble soon began. Mr. Besigye said that when he challenged the president on corruption or constitutional issues, the relationship soured.
Ms. Byanyima also fell out with the president, and her father, Mzee Boniface Byanyima -- an elder statesman and a one-time surrogate father to President Museveni. Mr. Byanyima said he rejected the president when he asked for his daughter's hand, offering to seek an annulment of his marriage to make it possible.
''I didn't like the man's character,'' Mr. Byanyima, 92, said in a recent interview. ''I knew that that man, sooner or later, he will run this country into trouble. I told my daughter, 'Don't allow Museveni to make you his second wife.' ''
Ms. Byanyima declined to comment, saying only that Uganda's political row was about national issues.
In 1990, Mr. Besigye was dismissed from his position as minister and was ordered to take military training, a clear demotion. He soon became popular within the armed forces and was elected to the military's high command.
He became increasingly vocal in politics, and in the early 1990s he says he began a romantic relationship with Ms. Byanyima, who left a diplomatic post in France to run for Parliament as an opposition politician. The two campaigned together, romance intertwining with politics.
Mr. Besigye acknowledges an element of romantic friction in the political dynamics between him and President Museveni, but he said it was not a critical factor.
''Even if there was no relationship,'' Mr. Besigye said of his marriage to Ms. Byanyima, the antagonism between him and the president ''would be the same as it is today.''
While many observers agree that Uganda's political row is about larger political differences, they say the tight nucleus of personalities is a steering force in the events. ''This is about power,'' said Amii Omara-Otunnu, a Ugandan professor of history at the University of Connecticut, and ''animosity.''
''Besigye was the one who was closest to Museveni,'' said Dr. Omara-Otunnu, whose brother is an opposition politician. ''The person Museveni fears the most, apart from Besigye, is Winnie.''
Another person close to the first family said that, for President Museveni, losing Ms. Byanyima was like ''losing Helen of Troy.''
Tamale Mirundi, a spokesman for Mr. Museveni, declined to discuss any personal relationship between the president and Ms. Byanyima, and he referred to Mr. Besigye as a ''reject.'' He added that Ms. Byanyima had used her professional relationships with the governing party to ''pave the way'' for Mr. Besigye.
President Museveni has presided over a period of expansive economic growth. His country has become a military ally for the United States, playing a role in countries like Somalia and Congo, and its shopping malls and hotels cater to Western tourists.
But the protests showed something else. At least nine people were killed by security forces, including a 2-year-old child. Mr. Besigye was shot in the hand with a rubber bullet and later partly blinded by the police.
He donned a cast and dark sunglasses and flew to Nairobi for treatment: a photo-op of government oppression to many back in Kampala. Then he flew home, upstaging President Museveni's latest inauguration with an outpouring of tens of thousands of supporters.
''The government seems clueless as to how to respond to an unarmed movement, fierce but clumsy,'' said Mahmood Mamdani, an anthropology professor at Columbia and at Uganda's Makerere University. ''The irony is that the government is succeeding in uniting not only the opposition, but more and more people around the opposition.''
Mr. Byanyima, a longtime leader in Uganda's Democratic Party, remembers a night in 1980, shortly after the fall of Mr. Amin, when a jittery Milton Obote, a former president whose government was accused of human rights abuses, arrived at his doorstep with a warning.
''He said, 'I hear Museveni has been coming to your house,' '' Mr. Byanyima recalled. ''He said, 'Take care of Museveni,' '' meaning ''watch out.''

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths TOMITA, IWAO

 BODY:
TOMITA--Iwao. It is with deep sadness that the firm of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu LLC (hereafter Tohmatsu), the Japanese member firm of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited, announces the death of Iwao Tomita. He died on June 6, 2011, in Tokyo, surrounded by his family. One of the founding partners of the Japanese public accounting firm Tohmatsu, Mr. Tomita was 86 years old. 
He was a respected partner of Tohmatsu, and later a senior advisor to Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International. In a final message to his family and colleagues, he said, "My mission is accomplished." That mission was to establish Tohmatsu as the leading public accounting firm in Japan, not only in size but also in professional standards and quality of service. One of Mr. Tomita's proudest moments was when Deloitte Haskins & Sells merged with Touche Ross in 1990, and the two international firms invited Tohmatsu to join them as an equal to form Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu International, which changed to Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International in 1990. At the time, J. Michael Cook, chairman and CEO of Deloitte & Touche in the United States, referred to Tohmatsu as the crown jewel of the international organization. "We have had no more global citizen, and no one more committed to our global organization. Tomita deserves significant credit for the global growth of our services for Japanese headquartered companies," said Jim Quigley, global CEO of DTTL until May 31, 2011. Quoted in a history of the Japanese firm published in 1995, Edward Kangas, then chairman of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International, said, "Tomita-san has been a man of vision, a man who proposed practical implementation of his vision and a very good friend." Many people are visionaries and strategists, but they can't translate their ideas into action. Tomita-san has an incredible capacity to translate his strategy and vision into action in a powerful way." In 1967, the Deputy Minister of Finance asked Mr. Tomita to organize the first nationwide public accounting firm. It was to be established to accomplish two main objectives: the first, to be capable of reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States according to U.S. accounting standards; the second, to establish offices overseas. He allied himself with former Admiral Nobuzo Tohmatsu to found Tohmatsu in 1968. Three years later, Mr. Tohmatsu withdrew from the business due to an incapacitating stroke; Mr. Tomita continued pursuing their original goal of making a truly international accounting firm for Japan. Mr. Tomita later succeeded to the position of chief executive officer. In 1975, Tohmatsu became a member firm of Touche Ross International, and Mr. Tomita was asked to join the international Board of Governors. The alliance meant that, rather than establish separate offices as it had done in New York, Tohmatsu would instead send forth a wave of professionals to be assigned to Touche Ross offices worldwide, coinciding with the rise of the Japanese economy. What began as a firm with a few offices in Japan is today an organization with a workforce of over 6000, including 658 partners, and professionals posted on long-term assignments to more than 40 locations outside Japan where they serve the unique needs of Japanese companies operating overseas. Today, the founders' goal is realized: Tohmatsu is one of the largest and the most international professional services firm in Japan. From the founding of the firm, Mr. Tomita traveled extensively to establish Tohmatsu's presence abroad, beginning in San Francisco and quickly spreading throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia. Until months before his death, Mr. Tomita kept up a heavy travel schedule, averaging 150 days annually outside Japan. In the past decade he increased his efforts in Asia, where he saw the most growth potential. His ability to see and shape the future led him to send a Tohmatsu professional to the People's Republic of China as early as 1979 to start the long process of establishing an office in Beijing. Wherever he traveled, he met with Tohmatsu professionals assigned overseas, to offer advice and encouragement. "Tomita-san's extraordinary vision and courage as a founding partner of our Deloitte Japan Tohmatsu member firm and his global mindshare in his actions over many decades is a lesson for us all in As One behavior long before we termed this vision. We will miss his presence though will reap the benefits of his legacy for many years to come," said Barry Salzberg, global CEO, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited. Mr. Tomita was preceded in death by Yoko Tajima Tomita, his wife of 54 years. He is survived by three daughters; eight grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. Funeral services were held June 10 at St. Ignatius Church in Tokyo. A memorial service will take place Tuesday, July 5, 2011, in Tokyo from 11:00am to 1:00pm at the Imperial Hotel "Fuji No Ma."

HEADLINE: Why Is He Bi? (Sigh)

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
HE was born this way.
Bi.
Not bisexual. Not even bipartisan. Just binary.
Our president likes to be on both sides at once.
In Afghanistan, he wants to go but he wants to stay. He's surging and withdrawing simultaneously. He's leaving fewer troops than are needed for a counterinsurgency strategy and more troops than are needed for a counterterrorism strategy -- and he seems to want both strategies at the same time. Our work is done but we have to still be there. Our work isn't done but we can go.
On Libya, President Obama wants to lead from behind. He's engaging in hostilities against Qaddafi while telling Congress he's not engaging in hostilities against Qaddafi. 
On the budget, he wants to cut spending and increase spending. On the environment, he wants to increase energy production but is reluctant to drill. On health care, he wants to get everybody covered but will not press for a universal system. On Wall Street, he assails fat cats, but at cocktail parties, he wants to collect some of their fat for his campaign.
On politics, he likes to be friends with the other side but bash 'em at the same time. For others, bipartisanship means transcending their own prior political identities. For President Obama, it means that he participates in all political identities. He does not seem deeply affiliated with any side except his own.
He was elected on the idea of bold change, but now -- except for the capture of Osama and his drone campaign in Pakistan and Yemen -- he plays it safe. He shirks politics as usual but gets all twisted up in politics.
The man who was able to beat the Clintons in 2008 because the country wanted a break from Clintonian euphemism and casuistry is now breaking creative new ground in euphemism and casuistry.
Obama is ''evolving'' on the issue of gay marriage, which, as any girl will tell you, is the first sign of a commitment-phobe.
Maybe, given all his economic and war woes as he heads into 2012, Obama fears the disapproval of the homophobic elements within his own party. But he has tried to explain his reluctance on gay marriage as an expression of his Christianity, even though he rarely goes to church and is the picture of a secular humanist.
While picking up more than three-quarters of a million dollars from 600 guests at a gay and lesbian fund-raising gala in Manhattan on Thursday night, the president declared, ''I believe that gay couples deserve the same legal rights as every other couple in this country,'' even as he held to his position that the issue should be left to the states to decide.
He's not as bad as New York's Archbishop Timothy Dolan, who gave another grumpy interview on Thursday, this time to The National Catholic Register, asserting: ''You think it's going to stop with this? You think now bigamists are going to want their rights to marry? You think somebody that wants to marry his sister is going to now say, 'I have a right'? I mean, it's the same principle, isn't it?''
The archbishop concluded: ''Next thing you know, they're going to say there's four outs to every inning of baseball. This is crazy.'' (He's beginning to sound like Justice Scalia.)
Still, Obama's reluctance to come out for gay marriage seems hugely and willfully inconsistent with what we know about his progressive worldview. And it is odd that the first black president is letting Andrew Cuomo, who pushed through a gay-marriage bill in Albany on Friday night, go down in history as the leader on the front lines of the civil rights issue of our time.
But for the president, ''the fierce urgency of now'' applies only to getting checks from the gay community, not getting up to speed with all the Americans who think it's time for gay marriage.
As with ''Don't ask, don't tell,'' Obama is not leading the public, he's following. And worse, the young, hip black president who was swept in on a gust of change, audacity and hope is lagging behind a couple of old, white conservatives -- Dick Cheney and Ted Olson.
As a community organizer, Obama developed impressive empathetic gifts. But now he is misusing them. It's not enough to understand how everybody in the room thinks. You have to decide which ones in the room are right, and stand with them. A leader is not a mediator or an umpire or a convener or a facilitator.
Sometimes, as Chris Christie put it, ''the president has got to show up.''
With each equivocation, the man in the Oval Office shields his identity and cloaks who the real Barack Obama is.
He should draw inspiration from the gay community: one thing gays have to do, after all, is declare who they are at all costs.
On some of the most important issues facing this nation, it is time for the president to come out of the closet.

HEADLINE: What Would Nixon Do?

BYLINE: By GIDEON ROSE. 
The editor of Foreign Affairs and author of ''How Wars End: Why We Always Fight the Last Battle.''

 BODY:
PRESIDENT OBAMA has made good on his pledge to begin drawing down American forces in Afghanistan, but his stated strategy is unlikely to lead to a successful withdrawal.
Mr. Obama announced last week that 10,000 troops would come home by December and another 23,000 by next summer. By 2014, he confidently proclaimed, ''the Afghan people will be responsible for their own security.''
Administration hawks, largely in the military, are uneasy; they had wanted to go slower, so as to safeguard recent gains made against the Taliban. Administration doves, largely in the White House, are disappointed; they had wanted to pull back faster, seeing the killing of Osama bin Laden as an ideal opportunity to get out.
The president split the difference, suggesting that he was charting a ''centered course.'' But he has actually once again evaded the fundamental choice between accepting the costs of staying and the risks of leaving. 
What he needs is a strategy for getting out without turning a retreat into a rout -- and he would be wise to borrow one from the last American administration to extricate itself from a thankless, seemingly endless counterinsurgency in a remote and strategically marginal region. Mr. Obama should ask himself, in short: What would Nixon do?
Richard M. Nixon and his national security adviser, Henry A. Kissinger, tried to manage the risks of exiting the Vietnam War by masking their withdrawal with deliberate deception and aggressive covering fire. They almost succeeded -- and if tried again in today's more favorable environment, their strategy would most likely work.
The Nixonian approach has its costs: it would generate charges of lying, escalation and betrayal. And embracing it would require the president to display a deftness and a tough-mindedness he has rarely shown. But it could also provide the ticket home. Indeed, Mr. Obama's best option is to repeat Mr. Nixon's Vietnam endgame and hope for a different outcome -- to get 1973, one might say, without having it followed by 1975.
It may seem crazy to regard the American withdrawal from Vietnam as anything but disastrous. Our local ally collapsed two years after signing a peace deal, our enemies triumphantly conquered the country we had fought for more than a decade to defend, and the image of panicked friends reaching in vain for the last helicopter out of Saigon remains seared into our national consciousness. But Mr. Nixon actually did a lot right in Vietnam, and his approach there was not the primary cause of the war's ignominious end.
In late 1969, faced with increasing domestic pressure to end the war, the president and Mr. Kissinger settled on a strategy to reduce the American role in ground combat while fending off a South Vietnamese collapse. They sought to walk away from the war, get American prisoners back and avoid formally betraying an ally -- something they believed would damage America's reputation. They recognized that their approach would leave the South Vietnamese vulnerable following the American withdrawal, but considered that an acceptable price to pay for getting out.
They never said this last bit publicly, of course. But in private, they were more candid, as the White House tapes showed. During an August 1972 Oval Office chat, Mr. Nixon told Mr. Kissinger:
''Let's be perfectly cold-blooded about it.... I look at the tide of history out there, South Vietnam probably is never gonna survive anyway.... [C]an we have a viable foreign policy if a year from now or two years from now, North Vietnam gobbles up South Vietnam?''
Mr. Kissinger replied that American policy could remain viable if Saigon's collapse '' looks as if it's the result of South Vietnamese incompetence. If we now sell out in such a way that, say, in a three- to four-month period, we have pushed President Thieu over the brink.... it will worry everybody... So we've got to find some formula that holds the thing together a year or two, after which... no one will give a damn.''
Although Mr. Nixon and Mr. Kissinger had steeled themselves for the possibility of an eventual South Vietnamese collapse, they hoped it could be avoided and did what they could to prevent it. And had events in Washington played out differently -- with Watergate not crippling the administration and with Congress less hell-bent on slamming the door behind the departing ground troops -- they might have succeeded.
Mr. Obama does not have a Watergate to contend with, nor does he face a passionately antiwar Congress. And his opponents on the battlefield don't have the capabilities or support the North Vietnamese did. Without these stumbling blocks, he should be able to pull off a Nixonian strategy in Afghanistan. But this will involve more than simply tinkering with the number of troops being pulled out. It will mean denying what is going on, aggressively covering the retreat and staying after leaving.
THE first rule of withdrawal is you do not talk about withdrawal. You may agree with the doves about the value of exiting, but you should respect the hawks' fears about what will happen once people realize what you are doing. You must deflect attention from the true state of affairs, doing everything you can to keep your foes and even your friends in the dark as long as possible.
The second rule of withdrawal is to lay down suppressive fire so the enemy cannot rush into the gap you leave behind. The Nixon administration was brutal and ham-fisted about this, using secret bombing runs along the Ho Chi Minh Trail and expeditions into Cambodia and Laos to buy time and space for its ''Vietnamization'' programs to work. Thanks to technological advances, the Obama administration can do the same thing while incurring far fewer human, financial, legal and political costs. Drone attacks and raids against enemy targets in Pakistani sanctuaries today are a precision replay of actions in Cambodia and Laos, but more effective and less controversial.
The third rule of withdrawal is to remain engaged, providing enough support to beleaguered local partners so they can fend off collapse for as long as possible. Withdrawal should be defined as the removal of ground forces from direct combat, not the abandonment of the country in question.
The Nixon administration tried to do this, and its success in stopping North Vietnam's Easter offensive in 1972 showed that it could work. But once American troops and prisoners came home, few displayed any appetite for reengagement. Congress ordered an end to all military operations in Southeast Asia and cut aid to Saigon, making its eventual collapse a foregone conclusion. A weakened Nixon and his novice successor could do little to help their erstwhile allies in Saigon, even if they had wanted to.
Unlike Mr. Nixon, however, Mr. Obama is relatively popular and widely trusted. He has gained credibility on national security thanks to the killing of Osama bin Laden. Congress is obsessed with domestic economic issues rather than foreign policy and deferential rather than hostile to military leaders -- who themselves support staying engaged in Afghanistan.
Such a favorable domestic environment is matched by a relatively favorable international one, in which America's ability to project power remains strong and most of the world shuns radical jihadists. Should Mr. Obama seek to fend off a complete enemy victory in Afghanistan even after most American combat forces leave, he should be able to succeed -- at least until, as Mr. Kissinger put it, no one gives a damn.
Having tired of the fight in Afghanistan, the United States now has to perform political triage, deciding what goals are still worth fighting for and how they can be achieved.
In Vietnam, Mr. Nixon and Mr. Kissinger sought to extricate the United States from a war even as the local combatants continued to struggle. The Obama administration should try to do the same in Afghanistan -- while planning carefully for how to keep withdrawal from turning into defeat.
Correction: June 26, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An opinion article on June 26 about the path the Obama administration should take in withdrawing from Afghanistan incorrectly described the end of Richard M. Nixon's presidency. He resigned; he was not impeached.

HEADLINE: Whose Stimulus? Giving multinationals a big tax break on foreign profits won't create more jobs

 BODY:
Big businesses are telling Washington that they are willing to do their bit for the economy -- if the price is right. Multinational companies say they could repatriate hundreds of billions in foreign profits and pump them into domestic investment and hiring, but only if Congress and the White House agree to cut the tax rate on those profits to 5.25 percent from 35 percent. They call their plan ''the next stimulus.'' Sounds more like extortion. 
In the last five years American businesses have kept abroad more than $1 trillion worth of foreign earnings, according to government data. An article by David Kocieniewski in The Times last week noted that Microsoft has $29 billion offshore, Google has $17 billion and Apple has $12 billion.
The Obama administration should not give in to such corporate coercion. The last time big businesses got such a ''tax holiday,'' in 2005, companies spent most of the money rewarding their shareholders with stock buybacks and dividends, not in hiring.
Truth is, businesses' decisions to invest or increase employment depend on the state of the economy. If consumer demand is depressed, as it continues to be, corporate chieftains see no business logic in raising production. In the second quarter of 2010, when expectations of recovery were rosier, nonresidential investment jumped 17.2 percent. In the first quarter of this year it grew only 2 percent.
Bringing more money home at lower tax rates isn't going to change that thinking. What these businesses don't say is that they are already awash in cash. According to Federal Reserve data, companies in the United States have $2 trillion stashed in bank accounts, Treasury securities and other investment-ready assets. And this excludes cash held abroad by their foreign subsidiaries to avoid taxes.
Businesses will always want a tax cut. And they will always justify it as good for hiring and investing, whether or not it is. We remain perplexed by the Obama administration's decision to consider businesses' contention that cutting employers' contributions to payroll taxes will lead to more jobs. It probably won't -- especially if the break is not specifically tied to new hiring.
The faltering economy needs real stimulus, like extending the payroll tax cut for workers until the end of next year. That would put money directly in the pockets of American workers and stimulate consumption. Investing in infrastructure would also help.
Beyond pleasing shareholders, there is one other guaranteed result of giving employers a big tax break on their foreign profits: less cash to finance government programs or pay down the deficit. According to Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation, the proposed cut would cost $79 billion over 10 years.

HEADLINE: Tapping the Oil Reserve

 BODY:
We have never been enthusiastic about quick fixes. But the Obama administration's decision to release 30 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve -- the nation's emergency stockpiles -- makes sense. 
It should provide a modest boost to the American economy. It will help consumers at the pump as they head into the summer vacation season. And it sends an important message to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries that the United States is capable of protecting its domestic market, at least in the short term, even when those countries refuse to increase production.
The initiative is part of a joint effort with the International Energy Agency, whose other members will release an additional 30 million barrels. The total amount, 60 million barrels over 30 days, is aimed at making up the loss of nearly two million barrels a day in exports caused by unrest in Libya and, to a lesser extent, Yemen.
The two million barrels is a tiny fraction of the 89 million barrels consumed daily around the globe. Even so, there should be some relief for consumers. According to the Center for American Progress, a research and advocacy group, past oil sales from the reserve -- most recently President George W. Bush's release of 21 million barrels after Hurricane Katrina -- reduced prices by 10 to 15 percent within a month. That would translate today into savings of 25 to 35 cents per gallon of gas at the pump.
The predictable critics weighed in after the announcement. The American Petroleum Institute, the lobby for oil companies profiting from high prices, called the release ''ill-timed.'' House Speaker John Boehner accused President Obama of ''using a national security instrument to address his domestic political problems.'' Fred Upton, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, who is always eager to drill in environmentally fragile areas, said 30 million barrels could be found on Alaska's outer continental shelf if the administration ''would stop blocking permits.''
The strategic reserve, established after the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo, contains 727 million barrels -- just over two months' worth of imports. When it is tapped, the oil usually has to be replaced at higher prices. So this is not something the country should do very often. Given the turmoil in the Middle East and the weak economy, it is justified now.
An important question is what happens next. After OPEC failed this month to agree to increase production, Saudi Arabia said it would pump as much as 1.5 million more barrels a day until the end of the year. The administration and the International Energy Agency now need to hold the Saudis to that promise.

HEADLINE: At Clerks' Offices, Girding for More Weddings

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE and MICHAEL BARBARO; Elizabeth A. Harris and Mick Meenan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
ALBANY -- From City Hall in Manhattan to rural hamlets upstate, New York officials began to prepare on Saturday for a surge in gay couples expected to flood clerks' offices next month seeking to marry.
The state's same-sex marriage law, which was signed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo just before midnight on Friday, will go into effect in 30 days, meaning that gay couples can marry here beginning on July 24.
Gay couples from out of state will also be allowed to apply for wedding licenses and hold nuptials in New York. 
Roughly 45,000 gay couples live in New York State, according to census estimates. No exact projection is available for how many will marry here, but officials are readying for thousands, especially in the first week.
''We are training our staff to be prepared for a very large number of people on the first day,'' said Michael McSweeney, the New York City clerk, who oversees the marriage bureau. ''We are going to be part of history.''
The city has struck an agreement to increase the number of state judges available to perform same-sex marriages. Their workload could swell; John Feinblatt, a top adviser to the mayor, said judges could be bombarded by requests to circumvent the 24-hour waiting period.
Over the next 30 days, state officials must also rewrite the marriage license application form and distribute it to the hundreds of city and town clerks. In Oneonta, a college town of about 14,000 people in central New York, the city clerk, James R. Koury, was expecting a surge in applications, especially on the first day.
''I think we're probably going to have people coming that day, and I'm looking forward to it,'' Mr. Koury said.
The marriage bill was approved in the State Senate late Friday night by a vote of 33 to 29. Four Republicans joined all but one Democrat in supporting the measure after a lengthy and often-heated campaign.
The state's political establishment is watching closely to see what kind of backlash those four Republicans will face. Already, the National Organization for Marriage, an advocacy group, is pledging to raise $2 million in a bid to defeat them.
New York is now the sixth and largest state to permit same-sex marriage, joining Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont, along with the District of Columbia.
After the passage of the legislation, the governor declared that New York had resumed its role as a ''beacon for social justice.'' Mr. Cuomo, the prime mover of the bill, is expected to march in the city's gay pride parade on Sunday, which will likely be an emotional and overflowing gathering. His past appearance at the parade was attacked by his Republican opponent, Carl P. Paladino, during the campaign for governor last year. Mr. Paladino criticized Mr. Cuomo for taking his teenage daughter to march alongside him.
The governor is certain to be a major attraction this year in the procession, which sweeps down Fifth Avenue and across Greenwich Village. Attendance is typically 1.5 million; this year, organizers expect an additional 500,000 to 1 million people.
''The phones have been ringing off the hook!'' said Britton Hogge, the media director for Heritage of Pride, which runs the parade. ''It's going to be one big celebration, a catharsis, if you will. This has been building for some time.''
Ross Levi, the executive director of the Empire State Pride Agenda, said, ''Its going to be the biggest street party ever.''
In the hours after the vote Friday night, people danced, embraced and sang in the streets of the West Village. On Saturday morning, smaller celebrations continued to break out. Councilman Daniel Dromm, who is gay, brought a wedding cake and homemade cupcakes to the local post office in Jackson Heights, Queens, which has seen an influx of gay residents over the past decade, and invited supporters to enjoy a slice.
Passage of the legislation is expected to spawn a cottage industry around same-sex marriage in the state. The city estimated in 2009 that the state economy would gain up to $210 million over the first three years of same-sex marriage.
The change, of course, will mean fewer gay New Yorkers traveling to Massachusetts and Connecticut and spending money on weddings there.
''We've actually had a long stream of residents from Manhattan and other parts of New York come up to Connecticut for the weekend to have their marriage ceremony and reception here,'' Andrew J. McDonald, general counsel to Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut.
In Kingston, N.Y., a small town 90 miles north of Manhattan, the entrepreneur Paul Joffe said he was dusting off plans to turn the decommissioned Methodist church that he bought six years ago into a mecca for same-sex weddings.
''The moment it's legal, I want people to be there,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Beyond Common Ground On Health Care Costs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Seriously, Some Consensus About Health Care'' (Economic View, June 19) N. Gregory Mankiw contended that Democrats and Republicans might be wrong in agreeing that health care costs can be reined in, even as they disagree about how such control is achieved. He then asks, ''if controlling the cost of health care fails, what is Plan B?'' 
I would suggest that Plan B should be to examine how other advanced democracies have managed to provide health care coverage to all, while spending less of their gross domestic product on health care than we do in the United States.
No one should say that controlling health costs may be futile when so many countries have already done so through various combinations of competitive forces and government regulatory action. And while the United States leaves millions of people uninsured, these countries provide coverage for all.

To the Editor:
N. Gregory Mankiw provides a helpful perspective on the politics of health care reform, but does not include an important point about the way free-market competition works.
Perfect competition requires perfect information, which is not part of the health insurance market. Supporters of President Obama's health care law don't necessarily believe private competition is good in this arena; they may simply take it as a political given.
In the new law, choosing among private plans in a regulated exchange is an improvement over the current system, in which comparison is difficult for lack of information. The plan is an effort to make competition work.
Jennie Kaufman
Brooklyn, June 20
To the Editor:
In comparing the recent health care reform law to the Medicare proposal by Representative Paul D. Ryan, the column posed this question: ''If choosing among competing private plans on a government-regulated exchange is a good idea for someone at age 50, why is it so horrific for someone who is 70?''
First, 50-year-olds who seek to buy health insurance are most likely near the peak of their earning power and thus more capable of paying in one way or another for their insurance -- which might not be too expensive because of the relatively modest cost of insuring someone who is that age.
But people who are 70 are generally retired, living on stagnant or reduced income. Their insurance would be far more expensive because of the higher use of services at their age.
The plan to treat retired Americans the same as 50-year-olds for health insurance purposes misses this crucial difference. Dene F. Karaus

HEADLINE: Two G.O.P. Hopefuls Divide the Voters In Deep-Pocketed Utah

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON; Kitty Bennett, Marjorie Connelly and Griffin Palmer contributed research.

 BODY:
SALT LAKE CITY -- Two hugely popular political figures in Utah, Mitt Romney and Jon M. Huntsman Jr., are going fishing in this same small pond of a state, seeking financial support in their bids to become the Republican Party's nominee for president next year.
That has potentially significant implications for the national election, given the Mormon propensity to dig deep in supporting one of their own -- Mr. Romney and Mr. Huntsman are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which is based here. But it is already creating deep division and uncertainty among people who like both men and are now being forced to choose. 
''My wife is a Mitt person, and I am a Jon person -- you're going to see that in a lot of households,'' said Lew Cramer, a business development executive here who contributed the maximum allowed to Mr. Romney's presidential campaign in 2008 but has switched allegiances and is now serving on Mr. Huntsman's national finance committee.
On Friday, Mr. Romney came to the state for private meetings and for one sun-baked afternoon appearance in the parking lot of a drive-in fast food restaurant.
His targets were President Obama and most everything Mr. Obama has done as president. Mr. Huntsman, who jumped into the race last week, was not on the menu for attack. A restaurant sign reading ''tips are appreciated'' was covered with bunting just before Mr. Romney spoke.
''We have 20 million Americans that are out of work or have stopped looking for work or are in part-time jobs,'' Mr. Romney said, standing tie-less on the back of a pickup truck with his wife, Ann, as he addressed a crowd of several hundred people.
The crowd was enthusiastic, but not uniformly so.
''I'm supporting our party,'' said Jeff Haaga, 55, a marketing executive and chairman of his local Republican Party precinct who said he was undecided. ''Huntsman, if I had to choose today,'' he added.
Utah, despite having only 2.8 million people, was Mr. Romney's third biggest source of money in 2008 -- after Massachusetts, where he had been governor, and California -- contributing more than $5.5 million. Mr. Romney also raised significant money in heavily Mormon areas of the West outside Utah, particularly in Idaho and Arizona. In the 2008 Republican presidential primary in Utah, he got almost 90 percent of the vote.
Mr. Huntsman, on the other hand, succeeded where Mr. Romney never ventured. He got elected to office in Utah -- twice as governor, in 2004 and 2008. In the 2008 election, in particular, his popularity was overwhelming, winning with 78 percent of the vote. Indeed, 36 percent of Utah voters who identified themselves as Democrats voted for him that year, according to an Edison-Mitofsky exit poll.
The imprint and connection to Utah extend, for both men, partly through their fathers. Mr. Romney's was George W. Romney, a former resident of Utah and later governor of Michigan in the 1960s. Mr. Huntsman's father, Jon M. Huntsman Sr., is an economic and political patriarch -- a billionaire chemical-industry entrepreneur and philanthropist whose name is associated with the cancer research institute he financed at the University of Utah.
For better or worse -- and probably worse in overwhelmingly Republican Utah -- Mr. Huntsman is also linked to Mr. Obama, having served as ambassador to China from 2009 until this April. Mr. Obama got less than 35 percent of the vote here, one of his lowest rates in the nation.
Both men face potential trouble in Utah from Tea Party groups. They have attacked Mr. Romney for his role, as governor of Massachusetts, in helping pass a health care plan in 2006, considered a model for the federal overhaul passed last year. Mr. Huntsman has come under fire for, among other things, supporting a cap-and-trade program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions when he was governor of Utah.
''I don't know of any true-blue Tea Party activists who are supporting Huntsman or Romney,'' said Darcy Van Orden, chairwoman of the Utah Republican Liberty Caucus, a group that declares itself ''the conscience of the Republican Party.''
But beyond the issues of money and popularity, the Huntsman-Romney divide seems likely to expose what could be an even trickier question for many people in Utah: Is one candidate more devoutly Mormon than the other? And should a conclusion about that bleed over into political support or opposition?
Mr. Huntsman, in some recent interviews, appears to have distanced himself a bit from his religion. ''I can't say I am overly religious,'' he said in an interview with Fortune magazine last year, a quote that many Utahans can recite from memory. ''I get satisfaction from many different types of religions and philosophies.''
The statement could prove to be positive on the national stage, but it sticks in at least few craws here at home.
''For those Mormons like myself that are more committed, I think that rubs us wrong,'' said Steve Belnap, 53, an accountant who was on his way to work in downtown Salt Lake City on Friday morning. ''However, on the other side, Huntsman is going to pick up those who have lost the commitment. Who gets the most votes because of that, I don't know.''

CORRECTION-DATE: July 10, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A Political Memo article on June 26, about the popularity of Jon M. Huntsman Jr. and Mitt Romney in Utah, described incorrectly the connection Mr. Romney's father, former Gov. George W. Romney of Michigan, had to the state at one time. He lived and worked in Utah through his teenage years, but he was not ''a businessman'' there.
