HEADLINE: The Easy Problem

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Over here in the department of punditry, we deal with a lot of hard issues, ones on which the evidence is mixed and the options are all bad. But the immigration issue is a blessed relief. On immigration, the evidence is overwhelming; the best way forward is clear.
The forlorn pundit doesn't even have to make the humanitarian case that immigration reform would be a great victory for human dignity. The cold economic case by itself is so strong. 
Increased immigration would boost the U.S. economy. Immigrants are 30 percent more likely to start new businesses than native-born Americans, according to a research summary by Michael Greenstone and Adam Looney of The Hamilton Project. They are more likely to earn patents. A quarter of new high-tech companies with more than $1 million in sales were also founded by the foreign-born.
A study by Madeline Zavodny, an economics professor at Agnes Scott College, found that every additional 100 foreign-born workers in science and technology fields is associated with 262 additional jobs for U.S. natives.
Thanks to the labor of low-skill immigrants, the cost of food, homes and child care comes down, living standards rise and more women can afford to work outside the home.
The second clear finding is that many of the fears associated with immigration, including illegal immigration, are overblown.
Immigrants are doing a reasonable job of assimilating. Almost all of the children of immigrants from Africa and Asia speak English and more than 90 percent of the children of Latin-American immigrants do. New immigrants may start out disproportionately in construction and food-service jobs, but, by second and third generation, their occupation profiles are little different from the native-born.
Immigrants, including illegal immigrants, are not socially disruptive. They are much less likely to wind up in prison or in mental hospitals than the native-born.
Immigrants, both legal and illegal, do not drain the federal budget. It's true that states and localities have to spend money to educate them when they are children, but, over the course of their lives, they pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits. Furthermore, according to the Congressional Budget Office, giving the current illegals a path to citizenship would increase the taxes they pay by $48 billion and increase the cost of public services they use by $23 billion, thereby producing a surplus of $25 billion.
It's also looking more likely that immigrants don't even lower the wages for vulnerable, low-skill Americans. In 2007, the last time we had a big immigration debate, economists were divided on this. One group, using one methodology, found immigration had a negligible effect on low-skill wages. Another group, using another methodology, found that the wages of the low-skilled were indeed hurt.
Since then, as Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute explains, methodological advances suggest that the wages of most low-skill workers are probably not significantly affected. It turns out that immigrant workers are not always in direct competition with native-born workers, and, in some cases, they push the native-born upward into jobs that require more communication skills.
Shierholz found that between 1994 and 2007 immigration increased overall American wages by a small amount ($3.68 per week). It decreased the wages of American male high school dropouts by a very small amount ($1.37 per week). And it increased the wages of female high school dropouts by a larger amount ($4.19 per week).
The argument that immigration hurts the less skilled is looking less persuasive.
Because immigration is so attractive, most nations are competing to win the global talent race. Over the past 10 years, 60 percent of nations have moved to increase or maintain their immigrant intakes, especially for high-skilled immigrants.
The United States is losing this competition. We think of ourselves as an immigrant nation, but the share of our population that is foreign-born is now roughly on par with Germany and France and far below the successful immigrant nations Canada and Australia. Furthermore, our immigrants are much less skilled than the ones Canada and Australia let in. As a result, the number of high-tech immigrant start-ups has stagnated, according to the Kauffman Foundation, which studies entrepreneurship.
The first big point from all this is that given the likely gridlock on tax reform and fiscal reform, immigration reform is our best chance to increase America's economic dynamism. We should normalize the illegals who are here, create a legal system for low-skill workers and bend the current reform proposals so they look more like the Canadian system, which tailors the immigrant intake to regional labor markets and favors high-skill workers.
The second big conclusion is that if we can't pass a law this year, given the overwhelming strength of the evidence, then we really are a pathetic basket case of a nation.

HEADLINE: In Turnaround, Governor Wants to Spend in Florida

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
MIAMI -- Up for re-election in 2014 and still deeply unpopular, Gov. Rick Scott announced the largest proposed budget in Florida history on Thursday -- $74.2 billion, or $4 billion more than last year -- and said he wanted to sharply increase education spending.
As his budget centerpiece, the governor proposed raising teacher salaries across the board by $2,500 a year and dedicating $1.2 billion more to public schools. The increase would give Florida schools the largest budget ever, the governor said. Mr. Scott said his other priority was to spur manufacturing jobs by eliminating a sales tax on equipment. 
Underscoring his transformation from Tea Party booster to political realist, Mr. Scott, a Republican, also proposed budget increases for the environment and the state's university system.
This is the second straight year that Mr. Scott, who campaigned in 2010 on a pledge to shrink government, has proposed an increase in public school spending, a noticeable turnaround from his first year in office, when he sought a 10 percent cut in school financing. Schools in Florida have been reeling from years of cuts, with budgets still below those of six years ago.
Teachers, who must now contribute to their pensions and have seen their paychecks dwindle, have disapproved loudly and vehemently.
''This is a historic investment in K-12,'' the governor said in his upbeat budget presentation, where he stood with a crowd of educators behind him. ''It's the right thing to do for our children.''
School board officials and superintendents praised the governor's announcement, with the superintendent of Hillsborough County public schools, MaryEllen Elia, saying she was ''encouraged'' by the ''laser focus'' on education.
But state Democratic leaders said it smacked of ''pre-election-year gimmicks,'' as Senator Chris Smith, the Democratic leader, put it. Mr. Smith added that Florida teachers and schools were still being shortchanged.
''No number of teachers gathered as props in a news conference can change those facts,'' he said.
The governor's budget now heads to the Republican-dominated Legislature, which is considerably less enthusiastic about the large spending increases and raises.
''Right now, our budget shows that we don't have $1.2 billion in surplus,'' Will Weatherford, a Republican and the state's new House speaker, said on Wednesday. ''So certainly, to get to that number, you would have to make some cuts somewhere else. But we're going to take his budget seriously, and we're going to look at it critically.''
For the first time since taking office in 2011, Mr. Scott delivered undisputable good news to a state that suffered greatly in the recession. He announced a modest budget surplus and a steady drop in unemployment. The jobless rate is now 8 percent, a four-year low.
Taking credit for Florida's rebounding economy, Mr. Scott said the state was back in business.
''Florida's economy is back on track, and the nation is taking notice of our economic turnaround,'' he said.
He also reached out to public employees, who have been critical of his tenure. Under Mr. Scott, nearly 2,000 state workers have lost their jobs. His budget would include at least $1,200 in a lump-sum bonus for most state workers, which could rise to as much as $5,000 depending on job performance. It was welcome news for some but not others.
The Florida Police Benevolent Association said that its members would prefer to see raises rather than a one-time bonus and that it would lobby the Legislature to pursue that option.
''We believe salary increases are long overdue,'' Matt Puckett, the association's executive director, said in a statement. ''Some officers have gone six years without a wage increase due to state budget constraints.''
The governor also proposed making up the $300 million that was cut from universities last year and increasing spending for land conservation and restoration of the Everglades.
Although the governor is trying to reverse years of school budget cuts, the proposed $1.2 billion increase would not go entirely to the classroom. Nearly $420 million would go toward teacher pensions and new enrollments.
The budget did not address Florida's quandary over Medicaid and whether to extend Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act.
''Today is not the day for that decision,'' Mr. Scott said.

HEADLINE: My Valuable, Cheap College Degree

BYLINE: By ARTHUR C. BROOKS. 
Arthur C. Brooks is president of the American Enterprise Institute and a former professor at Syracuse University.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
MUCH is being written about the preposterously high cost of college. The median inflation-adjusted household income fell by 7 percent between 2006 and 2011, while the average real tuition at public four-year colleges increased over that period by over 18 percent. Meanwhile, the average tuition for just one year at a four-year private university in 2011 was almost $33,000, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. College tuition has increased at twice the rate of health care costs over the past 25 years.
Ballooning student loan debt, an impending college bubble, and a return on the bachelor's degree that is flat or falling: all these things scream out for entrepreneurial solutions. 
One idea gaining currency is the $10,000 college degree -- the so-called 10K-B.A. -- which apparently was inspired by a challenge to educators from Bill Gates, and has recently led to efforts to make it a reality by governors in Texas, Florida and Wisconsin, as well as by a state assemblyman in California.
Most 10K-B.A. proposals rethink the costliest part of higher education -- the traditional classroom teaching. Predictably, this means a reliance on online and distance-learning alternatives. And just as predictably, this has stimulated antibodies to unconventional modes of learning. Some critics see it as an invitation to charlatans and diploma mills. Even supporters often suggest that this is just an idea to give poor people marginally better life opportunities.
As Darryl Tippens, the provost of Pepperdine University, recently put it, ''No PowerPoint presentation or elegant online lecture can make up for the surprise, the frisson, the spontaneous give-and-take of a spirited, open-ended dialogue with another person.'' And what happens when you excise those frissons? In the words of the president of one university faculty association, ''You're going to be awarding degrees that are worthless to people.''
I disagree. I possess a 10K-B.A., which I got way back in 1994. And it was the most important intellectual and career move I ever made.
After high school, I spent an unedifying year in college. The year culminated in money problems, considerably less than a year of credits, and a joint decision with the school that I should pursue my happiness elsewhere. Next came what my parents affectionately called my ''gap decade,'' during which time I made my living as a musician. By my late 20s I was ready to return to school. But I was living in Spain, had a thin bank account, and no desire to start my family with a mountain of student loans.
Fortunately, there was a solution -- an institution called Thomas Edison State College in Trenton, N.J. This is a virtual college with no residence requirements. It banks credits acquired through inexpensive correspondence courses from any accredited college or university in America.
I took classes by mail from the University of Washington, the University of Wyoming, and other schools with the lowest-priced correspondence courses I could find. My degree required the same number of credits and type of classes that any student at a traditional university would take. I took the same exams (proctored at local libraries and graded by graduate students) as in-person students. But I never met a teacher, never sat in a classroom, and to this day have never laid eyes on my beloved alma mater.
And the whole degree, including the third-hand books and a sticker for the car, cost me about $10,000 in today's dollars.
Now living back in the United States, I followed the 10K-B.A. with a 5K-M.A. at a local university while working full time, and then endured the standard penury of being a full-time doctoral fellow in a residential Ph.D. program. The final tally for a guy in his 30s supporting a family: three degrees, zero debt.
Did I earn a worthless degree? Hardly. My undergraduate years may have been bereft of frissons, but I wound up with a career as a tenured professor at Syracuse University, a traditional university. I am now the president of a Washington research organization.
Not surprisingly, my college experience has occasionally been the target of ridicule. It is true that I am no Harvard Man. But I can say with full confidence that my 10K-B.A. is what made higher education possible for me, and it changed the course of my life. More people should have this opportunity, in a society that is suffering from falling economic and social mobility.
The 10K-B.A. is exactly the kind of innovation we would expect in an industry that is showing every indication of a bubble that is about to burst, as Thomas K. Lindsay of the Texas Public Policy Foundation shows in a new report titled, ''Anatomy of a Revolution? The Rise of the $10,000 Bachelor's Degree.'' When tuition skyrockets and returns on education stagnate, we can expect a flight to value, especially by people who can least afford to ride the bubble, and who have no choice but to make a cost-effective college investment.
In the end, however, the case for the 10K-B.A. is primarily moral, not financial. The entrepreneurs who see a way for millions to go to college affordably are the ones who understand the American dream. That dream is the opportunity to build a life through earned success. That starts with education.

HEADLINE: Deutsche Bank Reports Surprise $3 Billion Loss

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
FRANKFURT - Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest lender, reported a surprise quarterly net loss of $3 billion on Thursday, as new management tallied the cost of past mistakes and tried to draw a line under the bank's troubled past.
The fourth-quarter loss of 2.2 billion euros included about 1 billion euros the bank set aside to cover legal proceedings and investigations, including accusations that Deutsche Bank was among institutions that rigged global benchmarks used to set rates on trillions in loans. The bank also booked losses in recognition of the diminished value of acquisitions going as far back as its purchase of Bankers Trust in the United States in 1998. 
While the loss partly reflected problems peculiar to Deutsche Bank, it was a reminder of the weak state of European banking more than four years after the beginning of the financial crisis. Deutsche Bank is considered relatively healthy by European standards. Hesitant action by national regulators means that many other banks have not yet been forced to recognize the full scope of bad investments and depend on the European Central Bank for cash they need to operate.
The loss at Deutsche Bank contrasts with strong earnings recently by competitors like JPMorgan Chase. Still, its shares rose 2.9 percent in Frankfurt trading as investors apparently concluded that the German bank's relatively new co-chief executives, Jürgen Fitschen and Anshu Jain, were front-loading the bad news. Investors were also rewarding the bank's efforts to increase the size of the reserves it holds as insurance against losses.
The two men took over the reins less than seven months ago and have declared their intention to deal more severely with the legacy of the financial crisis. The new approach includes raising the amount of capital the bank keeps in reserve compared with the amount of money it lends to customers or otherwise puts at risk. Deutsche Bank has suffered from the perception that it is among the most highly leveraged banks in Europe.
The bank said on Thursday that it had raised its so-called core Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of the size of the reserves in relation to the amount of money at risk, to 8 percent from less than 6 percent a year ago. Some analysts questioned whether the bank really had become safer or whether the improved ratio simply reflected changes in the way the bank calculates risk.
For now, though, investors are willing to give Deutsche Bank the benefit of the doubt, analysts said.
"The new management under co-C.E.O. Anshu Jain is starting to deal with D.B.'s legacy issues," analysts at JPMorgan Cazenove said in a note to clients.
Capital is also an issue for Deutsche Bank in the United States, where the Federal Reserve is proposing that foreign banks hold more capital at their local operating units. Stefan Krause, the bank's chief financial officer, said in a call with analysts that Deutsche Bank was prepared to allocate more capital to the United States in 2015, adding that the rules "were really not very helpful in terms of helping global financial markets."
The quarterly results showed the bank was clearing its books of bad assets and reducing risk, its executives said. Late last year Deutsche Bank created a "noncore operations unit" to dispose of bad investments or holdings that did not produce an adequate return.
"We are willing to take pain," Mr. Jain said at a news conference. "That is the real story of the fourth quarter. We are willing to take losses."
Deutsche Bank said revenue in the fourth quarter rose 14 percent, to 7.9 billion euros, from the period a year earlier. The bank warned in December that it would incur major charges in the quarter, but most analysts had not expected the loss to be nearly so big. Before taxes, the loss was 2.6 billion euros.
For the full year, Deutsche Bank reported a net profit of 665 million euros after subtracting 3.5 billion euros related to legal problems or diminished value of assets.
The bank's problems are far from over. Deutsche Bank continues to cope with the consequences of behavior by some employees, including a tax evasion inquiry that led to a raid on company headquarters last month involving hundreds of police officers. Executives acknowledged on Thursday that the bank could face additional lawsuits related to its sale of securities tied to the United States subprime mortgage market.
"Although they have taken some chunky provisions, litigation is an ongoing drag on the industry," said Jon Peace, a bank analyst with Nomura in London. "There is probably going to be more litigation drag in 2013."
Deutsche Bank is among institutions accused of helping to manipulate the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, which is used to set rates on trillions of dollars of mortgages and other debt. Mr. Jain said on Thursday that during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week, he and other bankers discussed whether it would be possible to work out a global settlement with authorities and complainants. While the bankers did not make any decisions, Mr. Jain said, they agreed that a comprehensive settlement might make sense and would discuss it further.
In response to lapses of the past, executive bonuses have been curtailed, and employees have undergone mandatory ethics training which stresses integrity in trading and dealing with clients, Mr. Fitschen said.
"If you cannot commit yourself to those values without reservation," he said, "Deutsche Bank is not the place for you."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Jobless Aid Claims Rise, But Raise Little Concern

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans seeking unemployment aid rose sharply last week but remained at a level consistent with moderate hiring.
Weekly applications for unemployment benefits leapt 38,000 to a seasonally adjusted 368,000, the Labor Department said Thursday. Applications plummeted in the previous two weeks to five-year lows; applications fell by a combined 45,000 in the second and third weeks of January. 
The volatility reflects the government's difficulty adjusting the data to account for layoffs after the holiday shopping season. Job cuts typically spike in the second week in January as retailers dismiss temporary employees hired for the winter holidays. Layoffs then fall in the second half of the month.
The department tries to adjust for such fluctuations but the January figures can still be volatile. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, ticked up to 352,000, just above a four-year low.
Most economists weren't concerned by the increase.
''This just reverses some of the previous sharp falls without altering the gradual downward trend,'' said Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics.
On Friday, the government is scheduled to issue its January jobs report. Analysts forecast that it will show employers added 155,000 jobs, the same as in December. The unemployment rate is expected to remain at 7.8 percent for the third straight month.
That's consistent with the number of people seeking unemployment aid. Applications fluctuated between 360,000 and 390,000 for most of last year. At the same time, employers added an average of 153,000 jobs a month.
That's just been enough to slowly push down the unemployment rate, which fell 0.7 percentage points last year to 7.8 percent.
The number of people continuing to claim benefits also rose. More than 5.9 million people received benefits in the week ended Jan. 12, the latest data available. That's 250,000 more than the previous week.
Steady hiring is needed to resume economic growth. The government said Wednesday that the economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.1 percent in the October-December quarter, hurt by a sharp cut in military spending, fewer exports and sluggish growth in company stockpiles.
The contraction points to what is likely to be the biggest headwind for the economy this year: sharp government spending cuts and continuing budget fights.
Two important drivers of growth improved last quarter. Consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of economic activity, increased at a faster pace and businesses invested more in equipment and software.
Homebuilders are stepping up construction to meet rising demand. That could create more construction jobs.
Home prices are rising steadily. That tends to make Americans feel wealthier and more likely to spend. Housing could add as much as 1 percentage point to economic growth this year, some economists estimate.
And auto sales reached their highest level in five years in 2012. That's increasing production and hiring atAmerican automakers and their suppliers.

HEADLINE: Doubt Is Cast On Firms Hired To Help Banks

BYLINE: By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG and BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
Federal authorities are scrutinizing private consultants hired to clean up financial misdeeds like money laundering and foreclosure abuses, taking aim at an industry that is paid billions of dollars by the same banks it is expected to police.
The consultants operate with scant supervision and produce mixed results, according to government documents and interviews with prosecutors and regulators. In one case, the consulting firms enabled the wrongdoing. The deficiencies, officials say, can leave consumers vulnerable and allow tainted money to flow through the financial system.
"How can you be independent if you're hired by the entity you're reviewing?" Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, who sits on the Senate Banking Committee, said.
The pitfalls were exposed last month when federal regulators halted a broad effort to help millions of homeowners in foreclosure. The regulators reached an $8.5 billion settlement with banks, scuttling a flawed foreclosure review run by eight consulting firms. In the end, borrowers hurt by shoddy practices are likely to receive less money than they deserve, regulators said. 
On Thursday, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Representative Elijah Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, announced that they would open an investigation into the foreclosure review, seeking "additional information about the scope of the harms found."
Critics concede that regulators have little choice but to hire outsiders for certain responsibilities after they find problems at the banks. The government does not have the resources to ensure that banks follow the rules. Still, consultants like Deloitte & Touche and the Promontory Financial Group can add to regulators' headaches, the government documents and interviews indicate. Some banks that work with consultants continue to run afoul of the law. At other times, consultants underestimate the extent of the misdeeds or facilitate them, preventing regulators from holding institutions accountable.
Now, regulators and lawmakers are rethinking their relationship with the consultants. Officials at the Federal Reserve, which oversees many large banks, are questioning the prudence of relying on consultants so heavily, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter.
When the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency penalized JPMorgan Chase last month for breakdowns in money-laundering controls, it imposed stricter requirements, ordering the bank to hire a consultant with "specialized experience" in money laundering and to ensure that the firm "not be subject to any conflict of interest." In a separate action against the bank related to a $6 billion trading loss last year, the agency opted not to mandate an outside consultant at all.
While the comptroller's office will continue requiring consultants in certain cases, some agency officials are worried about the quality of the work, as well as the consultants' independence, according to three government officials briefed on the matter.
Since the financial crisis, regulators have increasingly relied on consultants. The comptroller's office ordered banks to hire consultants in more than 130 enforcement actions since 2008, or nearly 15 percent of the cases.
It can be a lucrative business. In 2011, regulators mandated that 14 banks employ consultants to determine whether homeowners were wrongfully evicted. Over 14 months, the consultants collected about $2 billion in fees, according to regulators and bank officials.
Those fees amounted to more than half of what homeowners will receive under the $8.5 billion settlement that ended the review. As part of the deal, officials will disburse $3.3 billion to 3.8 million borrowers in foreclosure.
According to consultants and regulators, the broad review was plagued with inefficiencies. For example, Promontory initially instructed employees to calculate lawyers' fees for each loan, to assess if borrowers were overcharged. Later, it scrapped the original procedure, only to reverse the policy again two weeks later, according to two reviewers who worked for Promontory.
"From Day 1, Promontory strove to conduct its review work as thoroughly and independently as possible," a spokesman for the firm, Christopher Winans, said in a statement. "Our overarching concern at all times was to serve the best interests of borrowers."
Some lawmakers question whether a consultant's regulatory connections helped it secure contracts. PricewaterhouseCoopers, which has a stable of former Securities and Exchange Commission officials, won much of the foreclosure review work, signing deals with four banks, including Citigroup. Promontory, the firm examining loans for Wells Fargo, Bank of America and PNC, was founded in 2000 by the former head of the comptroller's office, Eugene A. Ludwig.
When the contracts were initially awarded, some housing advocates complained that consulting firms could not objectively evaluate banks with which they had pre-existing business relationships. The comptroller's office said it vetted the firms to spot such potential conflicts, and argued that the process provided swifter relief for homeowners than if the government had hired the companies directly through a lengthy contracting process.
But concerns persisted. Deloitte, which won the contract to review JPMorgan's loans, had previously audited Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns, two firms JPMorgan acquired during the financial crisis. In May, the comptroller's office replaced Allonhill, the consultant for Aurora Bank, after the firm disclosed that it had already reviewed some "of the same pool of loans" as part of an earlier contract.
"It's clear from the foreclosure settlement that oversight over consultants was inadequate and the review process was deeply flawed," said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York, who recently pressed regulators to detail how consultants were paid. People close to the review say consultants relied on a process that the comptroller's office designed in 2011, under previous leadership.
"This was a very complex process," a spokesman for the comptroller said. "Throughout the process, regulators provided continuous oversight, guidance and were available to discuss issues." The agency also performs spot checks on the consultants.
Still, the foreclosure review highlighted broader concerns about the role consultants play.
Since the financial crisis, the comptroller's office has issued nearly 20 enforcement actions against banks that had already hired consultants to help iron out problems, according to government documents. While consultants cannot be expected to remedy every last issue at the banks, the actions raise questions about the effectiveness of their work.
When HSBC, the British bank, was sanctioned in 2003 over porous money-laundering controls, the bank turned to Deloitte to review its compliance, an official briefed on the matter said. Deloitte also worked for HSBC from 2006 to 2008, the person said, building a system to monitor money flows more effectively. But the bank ran into trouble in 2010 over similar issues, as highlighted in a recent scathing report by the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.
As part of a regulatory order, HSBC again hired Deloitte, this time to assess the number of times the bank failed to report suspicious transactions. Deloitte, three officials said, generously bundled hundreds of missed transfers into a single report. That helped save the bank from some government fines.
Despite the undercounting, HSBC still paid a record $1.9 billion last year to settle accusations that it enabled drug cartels to move money through its American subsidiaries.
In a statement, a spokesman for the firm said, "Deloitte fully stands behind the quality and integrity of its work on behalf of regulatory authorities."
Deloitte has also been suspected of helping institutions cloak illicit transfers of money to rogue nations around the globe. In August, New York's top banking regulator, Benjamin M. Lawsky, accused Deloitte of helping the British bank Standard Chartered flout American sanctions.
The consulting firm was hired to flag suspicious transfers routed through Standard Chartered's New York branches. Instead, it instructed bankers on how to escape regulatory scrutiny, according to state court documents.
Deloitte turned over "highly confidential information" from which the bank gleaned insight into "regulators' concerns and strategies," the court documents said. The firm later doctored its report to regulators, Mr. Lawsky said, deliberately removing some illegal transfers on behalf of Iranian clients. In an e-mail, a Deloitte partner admitted that a report on the transactions was a "watered-down version."
The authorities never took legal action against Deloitte, and federal officials noted in a separate settlement agreement that Standard Chartered employees withheld critical information from the consulting firm.
Despite these concerns, regulators are turning to a familiar source to help Standard Chartered. As part of a $327 million settlement last year, the bank is required to hire "an independent consultant."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: After Adding Online Privacy Protections, F.T.C. Chief Resigns

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Jon Leibowitz, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, said on Thursday that he would resign effective mid-February. His departure will end a four-year tenure in which he pushed for online privacy protections and sought to restrain unfair competition, but stumbled in an attempt to rein in the Internet search practices of Google.
Mr. Leibowitz, 54, said in an interview that he intended to move to the private sector and was likely to focus on competition policy and privacy. His departure was widely expected and had been talked about among antitrust lawyers since last summer. 
''I felt like this was a good time to leave because we got through a number of things that I wanted the commission to address,'' he said, citing the blocking of several regional hospital mergers and cases brought against Facebook and Google for violating their own privacy policies.
This spring, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in an F.T.C. case involving generic drug companies that agree to delay putting new products on the market in exchange for payments from brand-name pharmaceutical companies that market similar drugs.
Mr. Leibowitz's successor could come from within the commission, with Democratic commissioners Julie Brill and Edith Ramirez considered contenders. Other possible candidates are Howard Shelanski, an antitrust expert who is director of the commission's bureau of economics, and Philip J. Weiser, a former aide to Joel Klein at the Justice Department's antitrust division.
Under Mr. Leibowitz, who was a commissioner for more than four years before being appointed chairman in 2009, the commission also worked to expand the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and brought an enforcement action against Intel for unfair competitive practices in the microprocessor market.
Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who is the new chairwoman of the Senate antitrust subcommittee, said Mr. Leibowitz had been able to get bipartisan attention paid to issues like generic-drug competition and telephone billing practices in part because of his experience as a staff aide on Capitol Hill.
''He's done really aggressive work to stop these pay-for-delay settlements,'' she said, referring to drug industry practices. He also drew attention to cramming, the addition of unauthorized, often-unnoticed charges to consumers' phone bills, she said.
Other Democrats, including some consumer advocates, were less generous in their assessment, although none of them wanted to speak on the record. They noted, however, a few areas where the F.T.C. did not block merger actions, including a $2 billion proposal to join the Universal Music Group and EMI, two large record labels.
Last year, the commission also approved the $29 billion merger of two of the nation's largest pharmacy-benefit managers, Express Scripts and Medco Health Solutions.
If only because it was his last big effort, however, the Google case is likely to be the one that is foremost in people's minds over the next few years. Mr. Leibowitz sought the case, winning a cordial but tense battle with the Justice Department's antitrust division over the right to investigate Google's search practices.
Competitors, advertisers and some consumer advocates had complained that Google manipulated the results of its Internet searches to give top priority to results that featured companies in which it held an interest, while punishing those that were a competitive threat.
It was a widely watched case, not only because Google was one of the country's largest companies, a symbol of the enormous success that could be bred by the Internet, but also because Mr. Leibowitz had made anticompetition enforcement a high priority.
In 2009, shortly after he took over as chairman of the commission, Mr. Leibowitz threw down the gauntlet at a conference of antitrust lawyers, saying he intended to push the F.T.C. to protect consumers ''by expanding the use of our authority to prohibit unfair methods of competition.''
That authority, laid out in Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, allows the commission more leeway than do antitrust laws to sanction companies for actions that might not be antitrust violations but that are unfair and deceptive practices.
But when the F.T.C.'s five commissioners looked closely at Google's practices, they unanimously agreed that while some of its behavior was not beneficial to competitors, over all its actions improved its search results for the benefits of users. The commission did get Google to agree to voluntarily change some of its methods; critics of that agreement, including one commissioner who dissented on that part of the decision, said the voluntary agreement was essentially unenforceable because it did not have court authority behind it.
The F.T.C. did bring formal charges against Google in another matter, reaching a settlement of charges that Google illegally refused to license some of its patents for cellular phone technology to companies, like Apple, whose products compete with Google's Android operating system.
''That would have been a much harder case to bring under antitrust law,'' Mr. Leibowitz said.
Asked if he felt the Google case was a failure, Mr. Leibowitz gave an unequivocal no.
''You don't take these jobs without wanting to bring a big case,'' he said. ''But I think we did our job there.''

HEADLINE: Companies Weigh Federal Labels for Gene-Engineered Ingredients

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
With Washington State on the verge of a ballot initiative that would require labeling of some foods containing genetically engineered ingredients and other states considering similar measures, some of the major food companies and Wal-Mart, the country's largest grocery store operator, have been discussing lobbying for a national labeling program.
Executives from PepsiCo, ConAgra and about 20 other major food companies, as well as Wal-Mart and advocacy groups that favor labeling, attended a meeting in January in Washington convened by the Meridian Institute, which organizes discussions of major issues. The inclusion of Wal-Mart has buoyed hopes among labeling advocates that the big food companies will shift away from tactics like those used to defeat Proposition 37 in California last fall, when corporations spent more than $40 million to oppose the labeling of genetically modified foods.
''They spent an awful lot of money in California -- talk about a lack of return on investment,'' said Gary Hirshberg, co-chairman of the Just Label It campaign, which advocates national labeling, and chairman of Stonyfield, an organic dairy company. 
Instead of quelling the demand for labeling, the defeat of the California measure has spawned a ballot initiative in Washington State and legislative proposals in Connecticut, Vermont, New Mexico and Missouri, and a swelling consumer boycott of some organic or ''natural'' brands owned by major food companies.
Mr. Hirshberg, who attended the January meeting, said he knew of roughly 20 states considering labeling requirements.
''The big food companies found themselves in an uncomfortable position after Prop. 37, and they're talking among themselves about alternatives to merely replaying that fight over and over again,'' said Charles Benbrook, a research professor at Washington State University who attended the meeting.
''They spent a lot of money, got a lot of bad press that propelled the issue into the national debate and alienated some of their customer base, as well as raising issues with some trading partners,'' said Mr. Benbrook, who does work on sustainable agriculture.
For more than a decade, almost all processed foods in the United States -- like cereals, snacks and salad dressings -- have contained ingredients from plants with DNA that has been manipulated in a laboratory. The Food and Drug Administration, other regulators and many scientists say these foods pose no danger. But as Americans ask more pointed questions about what they are eating, popular suspicions about the health and environmental effects of biotechnology are fueling a movement to require that food from genetically modified crops be labeled, if not eliminated.
Impending F.D.A. approval of a genetically modified salmon and the Agriculture Department's consideration of genetically engineered apples have further intensified the debate.
''We're at a point where, this summer, families could be sitting at their tables and wondering whether the salmon and sweet corn they're about to eat has been genetically modified,'' said Trudy Bialic, director of public affairs at PCC Natural Markets in Seattle. ''The fish has really accelerated concerns.''
Mr. Hirshberg said some company representatives wanted to find ways to persuade the Food and Drug Administration to proceed with federal labeling.
''The F.D.A. is not only employing 20-year-old, and we think obsolete, standards for materiality, but there is a general tendency on the part of the F.D.A. to be resistant to change,'' he said. ''With an issue as polarized and politicized as this one, it's going to take a broad-based coalition to crack through that barrier.''
Morgan Liscinsky, an F.D.A. spokeswoman, said the agency considered the ''totality of all the data and relevant information'' when forming policy guidance. ''We've continued to evaluate data as it has become available over the last 20 years,'' she said.
Neither Mr. Hirshberg nor Mr. Benbrook would identify other companies that participated in the talks, but others confirmed some of the companies represented. Caroline Starke, who represents the Meridian Institute, said she could not comment on a specific meeting or participants.
Proponents of labeling in Washington State have taken a somewhat different tack from those in California, arguing that the failure to label will hurt the state's fisheries and apple and wheat farms. ''It's a bigger issue than just the right to know,'' Ms. Bialic said. ''It reaches deep into our state's economy because of the impact this is going to have on international trade.''
A third of the apples grown in Washington State are exported, many of them to markets for high-value products around the Pacific Rim, where many countries require labeling. Apple, fish and wheat farmers in Washington State worry that those countries and others among the 62 nations that require some labeling of genetically modified foods will be much more wary of whole foods than of processed goods.
The Washington measure would not apply to meat or dairy products from animals fed genetically engineered feed, and it sharply limits the ability to collect damages for mislabeling.
Mr. Benbrook and consumer advocates say the federal agencies responsible for things like labeling have relied on research financed by companies that make genetically modified seeds.
''If there is a documented issue with this overseas, it could have a devastating impact on the U.S. food system and agriculture,'' Mr. Benbrook said. ''The F.D.A. isn't going to get very far with international governments by saying Monsanto and Syngenta told us these foods are safe and we believed them.''
Advocacy groups also have denounced the appointment of Michael R. Taylor, a former executive at Monsanto, as the F.D.A.'s deputy commissioner for food and veterinary medicine.
Ms. Liscinsky of the F.D.A. said Mr. Taylor was recused from issues involving biotechnology.
What has excited proponents of labeling most is Wal-Mart's participation in the meeting. The retailer came under fire from consumer advocates last summer for its decision to sell a variety of genetically engineered sweet corn created by Monsanto.
Because Wal-Mart is the largest grocery retailer, a move by the company to require suppliers to label products could be influential in developing a national labeling program.
''I can remember when the British retail federation got behind labeling there, that was when things really started to happen there,'' said Ronnie Cummins, founder and national director of the Organic Consumers Association. ''If Wal-Mart is at the table, that's a big deal.''
Brands like Honest Tea, which is owned by Coca-Cola, have written to the association, which estimates 75 percent of grocery products contain a genetically modified ingredient, to protest its ''Traitors Boycott,'' which urges consumers not to buy products made by units of companies that fought Proposition 37. Consumers have peppered the companies' Web sites, Facebook pages and Twitter streams with angry remarks.
Ben & Jerry's, the ice cream company, announced recently that it would remove all genetically modified ingredients from its products by the end of this year. Consumers had expressed outrage over the money its parent, Unilever, contributed to defeat the California measure.
The state Legislature in Vermont, where Ben & Jerry's is based, is considering a law that would require labeling, as is the General Assembly in Connecticut. Legislators in New Mexico have proposed an amendment to the state's food law that would require companies to label genetically modified products.
And this month, a senator in Missouri, home of Monsanto, one of the biggest producers of genetically modified seeds, proposed legislation that would require the labeling of genetically engineered meat and fish.
''I don't want to hinder any producer of genetically modified goods,'' the senator, Jamilah Nasheed, who represents St. Louis, said in a news release. ''However, I strongly feel that people have the right to know what they are putting into their bodies.''

HEADLINE: Text of Chuck Hagel's Opening Remarks

 BODY:
The following is Chuck Hagel's opening remarks to the Senate Armed Services Committee, as prepared for delivery.
Thank you Chairman Levin, Ranking Member Inhofe, and Distinguished Members of the Committee. I am honored to come before you today as the President's nominee to be Secretary of Defense.
I want to thank my friends Sam Nunn and John Warner for their support, encouragement, and friendship over many years. These two distinguished Americans represent what's best about American public service and responsible bipartisanship. They have embodied both in their careers and are models for each of us.
To my family, friends, and fellow veterans who are here this morning -- and those who are not -- thank you. A life is only as good as the family and friends you have and the people you surround yourself with. 
I also want to thank my friend Leon Panetta for his tremendous service to our country over so many years. If I'm given the privilege of succeeding him, it will be a high honor.
Finally, I want to thank President Obama for his confidence and trust in me. I am humbled by the opportunity and possibility he has given me to serve our country once again.
I fully recognize the immense responsibilities of the Secretary of Defense. I assured the President that if I am confirmed by the United States Senate, I will always do my best for our nation and for the men and women -- and their families --
who are called on to make the enormous sacrifices of military service. Their safety, success, and welfare will always be at the forefront of the decisions I make.
I also assured the President that I would always provide him with my most honest and informed advice. I make that same commitment to this Committee and to the Congress. If confirmed, I will reach out to the members of this Committee for advice and collaboration. It will be a partnership, because the national security challenges America faces require it.
Our nation's security is the highest priority of our leaders and our government. We cannot allow the work of confronting the great threats we face today to be held hostage to partisanship on either side of the aisle, or by differences between the bodies represented in Articles I and II of our Constitution. The stakes are too high. Men and women of all political philosophies and parties fight and die for our country. As this Committee knows so well, protecting our national security or committing a nation to war can never become political litmus tests. I know Secretary Panetta has put a strong emphasis on reaching out to the Congress. I, like Leon, come from the Congress, and respect and understand this institution's indispensable role in setting policy and helping govern our country.
We are all products of the forces that shape us. For me, there has been nothing more important in my life -- or a more defining influence on my life -- than my family. Whether it was helping my mother raise four boys after my father -- a World War II veteran -- died suddenly at age 39 on Christmas Day, or serving side by side my brother Tom in Vietnam, or the wonderful miracle of my wife Lilibet and me being blessed with two beautiful children. That is who I am. We each bring to our responsibilities ''frames of reference'' formed by our life's
experiences. They help instruct our judgments. We build out from those personal foundations by continually informing ourselves, listening, and learning.
Like each of you, I have a record. A record I am proud of, not because of any accomplishments I may have achieved, or an absence of mistakes, but rather because I've tried to build that record by living my life and fulfilling my responsibilities as honestly as I knew how and with hard work. Under-pinning everything I've done in my life was the belief that we must always be striving to make our nation a better and more secure place for all of our people.
During the twelve years I had the privilege of serving the people of Nebraska in the United States Senate, I cast over 3,000 votes and hundreds of Committee votes. I've also given hundreds of interviews and speeches, and written a book. So, as you all know, I am on the record on many issues.
But no one individual vote, quote, or statement defines me, my beliefs, or my record. My overall worldview has never changed: that America has and must maintain the strongest military in the world; that we must lead the international community to confront threats and challenges together; and that we must use all tools of American power to protect our citizens and our interests. I believe, and always have, that America must engage -- not retreat -- in the world. My record is consistent on these points.
It's clear that we are living at a defining time. Our nation is emerging from over a decade of war. We have brought our men and women in uniform home from Iraq, and have started to bring them home from Afghanistan.
That does not mean the threats we face and will continue to face are any less dangerous or complicated. In fact, it is quite the opposite. Recent events in Mali and Algeria remind us of this reality. Twenty first century complexities,
technologies, economies, and threats are bringing the seven billion global citizens closer together. And as our planet adds another two billion people over the next 25 years, the dangers, complications, and human demands will not be lessened, but rather heightened.
Despite these challenges, I believe we also have historic opportunities to help build a safer, more prosperous, more secure, more hopeful and just world than at maybe any time in history. Yes, the curse of intolerance, hatred, and danger exists around the world, and we must continue to be clear-eyed about this danger -- and we will be. We will not hesitate to use the full force of the United States military in defense of our security. But we must also be smart, and more importantly wise, in how we employ all of our nation's great power.
America's continued leadership and strength at home and abroad will be critically important for our country and the world. While we will not hesitate to act unilaterally when necessary, it is essential that we work closely with our allies and partners to enhance America's influence and security -- as well as global security. If confirmed, I will continue to build on the efforts of this administration and of former Secretary Gates, Secretary Panetta, and Secretary Clinton to strengthen our alliances and partnerships around the world. I will also look forward to working with my former Senate colleague and friend, John Kerry, in this effort.
As I told the President, I am committed to his positions on all issues of national security, specifically decisions that the Department of Defense is in the process of implementing. This includes the Defense Strategic Guidance the President outlined in January 2012. Allow me to briefly address a few of those specific issues now.
First, we have a plan in place to transition out of Afghanistan, continue bringing our troops home, and end the war there -- which has been the longest war in America's history. As you know, discussions are ongoing about what the U.S. presence in Afghanistan will look like after 2014. The President has made clear -- and I agree -- that there should be only two functions for U.S. troops that remain in Afghanistan after 2014: counterterrorism -- particularly to target al Qaeda and its affiliates, and training and advising Afghan forces. It's time we forge a new partnership with Afghanistan, with its government and, importantly, with its people.
Second, as Secretary of Defense I will ensure we stay vigilant and keep up the pressure on terrorist organizations as they try to expand their affiliates around the world, in places like Yemen, Somalia, and North Africa. At the Pentagon, that means continuing to invest in and build the tools to assist in that fight, such as special operations forces and new intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance technologies. And it will mean working hand-in-hand with our partners across the national security and intelligence communities, to confront these and other threats, especially the emerging threat of cyber warfare.
Third, as I have made clear, I am fully committed to the President's goal of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and -- as I've said in the past -- all options must be on the table to achieve that goal. My policy is one of prevention, and not one of containment -- and the President has made clear that is the policy of our government. As Secretary of Defense, I will make sure the Department is prepared for any contingency. I will ensure our friend and ally Israel maintains its Qualitative Military Edge in the region and will continue to support systems like Iron Dome, which is today saving Israeli lives from terrorist rocket attacks.
Fourth, while we pursue the reductions in our deployed stockpiles and launchers consistent with the New START Treaty, I am committed to maintaining a modern, strong, safe, ready, and effective nuclear arsenal. America's nuclear deterrent over the last 65 years has played a central role in ensuring global security and the avoidance of a World War III. I am committed to modernizing our nuclear arsenal.
As we emerge from this decade of war, we also must broaden our nation's focus overseas as we look at future threats and challenges. As this Committee knows, that's why DoD is rebalancing its resources towards the Asia-Pacific region. We are in the process of modernizing our defense posture across the entire region to defend and deepen our partnerships with traditional allies, especially Japan, South Korea, and Australia; to continue to deter and defend against provocations from states like North Korea, as well as non-state actors; and to expand our networks of security cooperation throughout the region to combat terrorism, counter proliferation, provide disaster relief, fight piracy, and ensure maritime security.
I will continue this rebalancing, even as we continue to work closely with our longtime NATO allies and friends, and with allies and partners in other regions. At the same time, we will continue to focus on challenges in the Middle East and North Africa, where we have clear national interests. Rather, it is a recognition that the United States has been and always will be a Pacific power, and the Asia- Pacific is an increasingly vital part of the globe for America's security and economy. That's why we must become even more engaged in the region over the coming years.
Doing all of this and much more will require smart and strategic budget decisions. I have made it clear I share Leon Panetta's and our service chiefs' serious concerns about the impact sequestration would have on our armed forces. And as someone
who has run businesses, I know the uncertainty and turbulence of the current budget climate makes it much more difficult to manage the Pentagon's resources. If confirmed, I am committed to effectively and efficiently using every single taxpayer dollar; to maintaining the strongest military in the world; and to working with Congress to ensure the Department has the resources it needs -- and that the disposition of those resources is accountable.
Even as we deal with difficult budget decisions, I will never break America's commitment to our troops, our veterans, and our military families. We will continue to invest in the well-being of our all-volunteer force. And, working with the VA and other institutions, we will make sure our troops and their families get the health care, job opportunities, and education they have earned and deserve -- just as I did when I co-authored the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill with Senators Jim Webb, John Warner, and Frank Lautenberg. This includes focusing on the mental health of our fighting force, because no one who volunteers to fight and die for our country should feel like they have nowhere to turn.
In my twelve years in the Senate, my one guiding principle on every national security decision I made and every vote I cast was always this: Is our policy worthy of our troops and their families and the sacrifices we ask them to make? That same question will guide me if I am confirmed as Secretary of Defense. Our men and women in uniform and their families must never doubt that their leaders' first priority is them. I believe my record of leadership on veterans issues over the years -- going back to my service in the Veterans Administration under President Reagan -- demonstrates my rock-solid commitment to our veterans and their families.
We must always take care of our people. That's why I will work to ensure that everyone who volunteers to fight for this country has the same rights and opportunities. As I've discussed with many of you in our meetings, I am fully committed to implementing the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell and doing everything possible under current law to provide equal benefits to the families of all our service members. I will work with the service chiefs as we officially open combat positions to women, a decision that I strongly support. And I will continue the important work that Leon Panetta has done to combat sexual assault in the military. Maintaining the health and well-being of those who serve is critical to maintaining a strong and capable military, because an institution's people must always come first.
As we look ahead to the coming years, we have an extraordinary opportunity now to define what's next for America's military and our country. It is incumbent upon all of us to make decisions that will ensure our nation is prepared to confront any threat we may face, protect our citizens, and remain the greatest force for good in the world.
If confirmed as Secretary of Defense, it will be my great honor -- working with the President, this Committee, the Congress, and our military -- to ensure our policies are worthy of the service and sacrifice of America's finest men and women. Thank you. I look forward to your questions.

HEADLINE: A Symbol of Progress, or Villainy?

BYLINE: By CHRYSTIA FREELAND | REUTERS

 BODY:
NEW YORK -- Is oil like red meat or is it like tobacco? Your answer to that question determines how you feel about the North American boom in unconventional sources of fossil fuel, particularly the Canadian oil sands.
If you think oil is like tobacco, it is a strictly noxious commodity, which seriously harms its users and those around them. We should stop consuming it at once and at all costs. But if you think oil is like red meat, you take a more nuanced view. For the health of the planet, we should find greener alternatives to it whenever we can, but used wisely and in moderation, it has an honorable role in the 21st-century economy.
This morality play is being acted out with the greatest intensity in the fight over the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, which would stretch from Canada to the Texas Gulf Coast. ''Keystone is really a symbol of oil, it is very emotive,'' Daniel Yergin, the Pulitzer Prize-winning energy expert and chairman of IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates, told me. ''It is probably the most famous pipeline in the history of the world, and it hasn't even been built yet. It is a symbol around which the opponents of hydrocarbon have rallied.'' 
Last autumn, the consensus view was that the pipeline would be approved after the U.S. presidential election, no matter who won. In recent weeks, those odds have shifted.
''If you had asked me prior to the U.S. election, I would've said, 'Of course it's going to be built after the election, regardless of who wins,''' said Naheed Nenshi, the mayor of Calgary, Alberta, where many of the oil companies that are counting on Keystone have their headquarters.
''If you had asked me immediately after the U.S. election, I would've said, 'Of course it's going to be built, now that the immediate political pressure is off,''' he said. But today, Mr. Nenshi is less certain: ''The feeling in Canada over the past four or five weeks has become less optimistic about this thing being built.''
Jim Flaherty, the Canadian finance minister, took the same view. ''I actually don't know,'' he replied, when I asked him if the Keystone pipeline would be built. ''I had reason for optimism before the election that the president would approve it, were he re-elected.''
But, Mr. Flaherty said, President Barack Obama's inaugural address ''was not encouraging.''
Many politicians and business leaders in Canada, whose economy relies heavily on fossil fuels, have been caught by surprise by the intense opposition to the Keystone pipeline, and to the oil sands crude it would carry south. The paperback edition of Mr. Yergin's latest book, ''The Quest,'' provides a powerful explanation of that mystery.
''We have to start somewhere to end the addiction to oil,'' is the way one environmentalist explained the broader strategy to Mr. Yergin. ''The pipeline is a convenient device for fighting a larger battle,'' Mr. Yergin said.
Canadians, who are accustomed to being thought of as the world's official nice guys -- think of all those students globe-trotting with maple leaves on their backpacks -- are uncomfortable with this new role as climate change villains. (Disclosure: I am a proud Canadian myself.)
''I think it's a shame that a one-meter-in-diameter pipe is suddenly having to wear all of the sins of the carbon economy,'' Mr. Nenshi said. ''You know, it's not clubbing seals with child labor.''
Mr. Yergin agrees. ''The one thing that doesn't get much talked about is that this oil sands technology continues to advance, it is not static,'' he said.
''We reached peak oil demand in the U.S. more than half a decade ago. Our oil demand is going down. Our cars are getting more efficient,'' he said. ''Meanwhile, there is a supply of energy we do need now. The real trade-off is, is it going to be Canadian oil, or is it going to be Venezuelan oil?''
That trade-off used to be viewed in primarily strategic terms: Were our oil suppliers political friends or foes? By that measure, the Canadians score high. But the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, of all places, underscored another consequence of the North American boom in unconventional sources of oil: its impact on jobs.
Participants from slow-growth Europe and more vigorous Asia alike were dazzled by the job-creating potential of North America's renaissance as a fossil fuel producer. Moreover, these jobs happen to be the very sort that are being hollowed out by globalization and the technology revolution: high-paying, skilled, blue-collar work that cannot be outsourced or done by robots.
Which may be why the Canadians are picking up such mixed messages from the White House on the Keystone pipeline. For the Al Gore wing of the Democratic Party, it has become a symbolic battle in the fight to save the planet; for the Joe Biden wing, Keystone and the unconventional oil revolution are a source of the middle-class jobs many feared modern economies could no longer provide.
The pipeline is also a litmus test for what you think is the most important problem in the early 21st century.

HEADLINE: Central Coastline of Vietnam Draws Interest Overseas

BYLINE: By MIKE IVES

 BODY:
DA NANG, VIETNAM -- The coastal road from Da Nang to Hoi An is littered with the concrete skeletons of unfinished beachfront developments -- physical proof of how the slump in Vietnam's banking and property sectors is dragging down its economy.
But some projects have succeeded, and a trickle of foreigners has joined the Vietnamese who are buying luxury villas and condominium units along the country's prime central coastline, which runs about 130 kilometers, or 80 miles, from Hue to Hoi An and includes the stretch that U.S. troops called China Beach during the Vietnam War.
''The central coast has the potential to develop over the next decade into Asia's next beachfront destination resort, à la Phuket and Bali,'' said Peter R. Ryder, chief executive of Indochina Capital, which has built three luxury resorts here.
Indochina Capital's first central coast project was the Nam Hai, an all-villa resort that opened in 2006. Today, 9 of its 40 villas are reselling for $660,000 to about $2 million, and Mr. Ryder said asking prices were as much as three times the units' original prices. (An offshore structure developed by the company allows buyers to pay in dollars, instead of Vietnamese dong.) 
Mr. Ryder's company, which is based in Vietnam, later developed Montgomerie Links Vietnam, which includes a golf course and villas, and the Hyatt Regency Danang Resort and Spa, a 20-hectare, or 50-acre, beachfront complex that opened in 2011. Montgomerie has sold 18 of its planned 66 units, and the Hyatt has sold 22 of 27 villas and 154 of 183 condos.
Whether many of those sales eventually will be to foreigners is unknown. The country's laws concerning property purchases by noncitizens are more restrictive than those in nearby countries.
In Indonesia, for example, resident foreigners may lease villas for 25 years with options to extend for an additional 45 years, and nonresident foreigners typically buy properties freehold through local nominees, according to Knight Frank, an international property-consulting company. In Thailand, foreigners can buy condominium units or lease villas for three consecutive 30-year terms.
In Vietnam, by contrast, nonresident foreigners may not own or lease property, and a five-year pilot program introduced in 2009 allows only resident foreigners who meet certain qualifications to lease apartments for fixed, 50-year terms. Real estate experts say that Vietnam's legal structure is murky, so it remains unclear whether foreign-purchase laws will evolve.
To lure overseas buyers, Indochina Capital pioneered an arrangement that allows non-Vietnamese to buy 50-year leases through entities in the Cayman Islands or British Virgin Islands. Mr. Ryder said the complex shareholder structure minimized the buyer's risk by creating a firewall between the local and offshore companies involved in a transaction.
At the Nam Hai, all but one of the first 38 villas were sold from 2005 to 2008 on a leasehold basis to international clients.
So far, units at the newer properties have sold mainly to Vietnamese, but Mr. Ryder said sales dynamics were beginning to shift again as the country's economy slumped.
''People aren't clamoring over the barricades here to get into the market,'' he said. ''But whereas it was purely a foreign market initially, and then over a several year period became predominately a local market, now you're beginning to see an uptick in foreign interest.''
Developers and local businessmen say the central coast has the right mix of ingredients for a world-class beach destination, including Hoi An and Hue, which are both Unesco World Heritage sites, and a handful of international-standard golf courses.
The coastline already has several upscale international resorts, including the Hyatt, Nam Hai and two newcomers: The InterContinental Danang Sun Peninsula Resort and Laguna Lang Co., where Banyan Tree Group is marketing 40 finished condominiums and 75 planned villas to international clients through an offshore lease structure that resembles Indochina Capital's.
Da Nang's international airport, which completed a major renovation in 2011, will surely give a boost to the central coast's international profile, observers say. There are already regular flights to Seoul, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, and Dragonair, which is based in Hong Kong, has announced that it will offer three flights a week beginning in March.
From 2008 to June 2012, the number of five-star hotels in Da Nang grew to eight from two, but their occupancy rates hovered at about 30 percent to 55 percent, according to CBRE, a commercial real estate company based in Los Angeles.
And while Da Nang's government has a reputation in Vietnam for being enthusiastically pro-business, analysts say the stalled resort and residential projects on the coastal road illustrate the slump in the area's property market.
Da Nang's second-home market had strong growth from 2005 to 2010 but then saw a big downturn and is unlikely to improve for at least two years, said Stephen Wyatt, country managing director at Knight Frank Vietnam.
''There's no reason why we're going to see any change in the market, purely because we are effectively facing a major banking crisis,'' Mr. Wyatt said, referring to the loans in or near default that analysts say threaten Vietnam's economic stability.
Factors limiting growth include an absence of international retailers and the government's lack of a concerted tourism marketing campaign, said David Henry, managing director for real estate at the fund manager VinaCapital.
Mr. Henry, whose company has developed several properties in Da Nang and sells them exclusively to Vietnamese clients, said he would welcome a move by the government to change property ownership laws for foreigners seeking long-term leases.
''You'll never have freehold for foreigners in this country,'' he said. ''But I think an extended lease allowing you to rent, and a few other things, would certainly open the market up a bit.''
Alexander Schmid, a Dubai-based stock trader from Switzerland who purchased a 50-year lease on a Hyatt condominium for $490,000 last year, said he first grew interested in Vietnam while visiting with his wife, a Swiss citizen of Vietnamese descent.
Mr. Schmid, 38, said he considered his condo, which covers 150 square meters, or 1,615 square feet, a sound investment because he sees potential in the Vietnamese economy despite gloomy short-term forecasts. On a recent afternoon, the beach near the Hyatt was empty but for a lone fisherman. Mr. Schmid said over lunch that he would like to see a few more restaurants and shopping options in the area, but not the sprawling development he has seen at larger resort destinations in other parts of Asia.
''If it's going to be like Bali, I would sell,'' he said. ''That's not what I'm looking for.''

HEADLINE: STMicroelectronics May Pay $500 Million to Exit Venture

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
PARIS -- STMicroelectronics, the biggest European chip maker, may have to spend up to $500 million this year to wind down the mobile chip-making joint venture with Ericsson that has been a ball-and-chain on its results, the company's chief executive said Thursday.
''We're committed to going fast,'' Carlo Bozotti, the chief executive, said during a briefing in Paris. ''It's important for us to move on, to become a leaner company.'' 
Mr. Bozotti also said he had seen ''encouraging signs'' that the semiconductor market was improving this year after a rocky 2012, but ''we'll have to see if that's sustainable.''
Shares of STMicroelectronics closed up 3.5 percent in Paris trading. Analysts said positive outlooks issued by STMicroelectronics and the company's German rival, Infineon Technologies, helped lift the stock price.
STMicroelectronics, an Italian-French company with its headquarters in Geneva, and the Swedish mobile networking giant Ericsson bet big on chips to power smartphones. But their joint venture, ST-Ericsson, foundered as big customers like Nokia and BlackBerry were smashed by competition from Apple and Samsung, which rely heavily on chips made by Qualcomm. The venture has lost about $2.8 billion since 2009.
Negotiations to sell or close down the company, which employs more than 5,000 people, will be a delicate matter. Complicating any deal, at a time of economic stagnation and fears for the future of European industry, is the fact that the French and Italian governments own a combined 27.5 percent stake in STMicroelectronics. At any rate, a near-term closure of the company is thought to be unlikely, as ST-Ericsson has long-term supplier contracts it has promised to fulfill.
Mr. Bozotti said STMicroelectronics expected to dispose of its ST-Ericsson stake ''during the third quarter of 2013,'' though he gave no indication of how the company planned to do so. The cost would probably be in the range of $300 million to $500 million, he said, ''including around $100 million in the first quarter.''
STMicroelectronics is one of the biggest high-technology enterprises in Europe and an industry leader in areas with strong growth prospects, like sensors and microcontrollers. Its chip-making and research and development facilities around Grenoble are at the heart of the innovation cluster that serves as France's answer to Silicon Valley.
Mr. Bozotti spoke after STMicroelectronics announced late Wednesday a $544 million write-down of good will and other intangible assets on its share of ST-Ericsson, a charge that reduced the accounting value of the 50-50 joint venture to ''a negligible amount'' on its books. The charge led the company's fourth-quarter net loss to balloon to $428 million from an $11 million loss a year earlier.
STMicroelectronics said its full-year 2012 revenue slid nearly 13 percent, to $8.5 billion, largely because sales to Nokia fell. Just four years ago, the Finnish cellphone maker accounted for about a fifth of all its sales; STMicroelectronics did not disclose the current level but acknowledged that it was far lower.
The bottom line was ''horrible,'' Thomas Becker, an electronics sector analyst at Commerzbank, said of the results, ''but the underlying numbers were not that bad.''
He said that shares of STMicroelectronics and Infineon -- which forecast a rise in second-quarter sales and operating profit on Thursday -- got a lift ''because some investors may be hoping to get in on the upswing in the semiconductor cycle.''
The company is refocusing its business, Mr. Bozotti said, and expects growth in 2013 to be driven primarily by sales of devices in its imaging, analog and microsensor, and microcontroller businesses. He said STMicroelectronics would cut its quarterly costs to $600 million to $650 million by 2014, from around $900 million currently.

HEADLINE: Looking For Mister Goodpain

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Three years ago, a terrible thing happened to economic policy, both here and in Europe. Although the worst of the financial crisis was over, economies on both sides of the Atlantic remained deeply depressed, with very high unemployment. Yet the Western world's policy elite somehow decided en masse that unemployment was no longer a crucial concern, and that reducing budget deficits should be the overriding priority.
In recent columns, I've argued that worries about the deficit are, in fact, greatly exaggerated -- and have documented the increasingly desperate efforts of the deficit scolds to keep fear alive. Today, however, I'd like to talk about a different but related kind of desperation: the frantic effort to find some example, somewhere, of austerity policies that succeeded. For the advocates of fiscal austerity -- the austerians -- made promises as well as threats: austerity, they claimed, would both avert crisis and lead to prosperity. 
And let nobody accuse the austerians of lacking a sense of romance; in fact, they've spent years looking for Mr. Goodpain.
The search began with a passionate fling between the austerians and the Republic of Ireland, which turned to harsh spending cuts soon after its real estate bubble burst, and which for a while was held up as the ultimate exemplar of economic virtue. Ireland, said Jean-Claude Trichet of the European Central Bank, was the role model for all of Europe's debtor nations. American conservatives went even further. For example, Alan Reynolds, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, declared that Ireland's policies showed the way forward for the United States, too.
Mr. Trichet's encomium was delivered in March 2010; at the time Ireland's unemployment rate was 13.3 percent. Since then, every uptick in the Irish economy has been hailed as proof that the nation is recovering -- but as of last month the unemployment rate was 14.6 percent, only slightly down from the peak it reached early last year.
After Ireland came Britain, where the Tory-led government -- to the sound of hosannas from many pundits -- turned to austerity in mid-2010, influenced in part by its belief that Irish policies were a smashing success. Unlike Ireland, Britain had no particular need to adopt austerity: like every other advanced country that issues debt in its own currency, it was and still is able to borrow at historically low interest rates. Nonetheless, the government of Prime Minister David Cameron insisted both that a harsh fiscal squeeze was necessary to appease creditors and that it would actually boost the economy by inspiring confidence.
What actually happened was an economic stall. Before the turn to austerity, Britain was recovering more or less in tandem with the United States. Since then, the U.S. economy has continued to grow, although more slowly than we'd like -- but Britain's economy has been dead in the water.
At this point, you might have expected austerity advocates to consider the possibility that there was something wrong with their analysis and policy prescriptions. But no. They went looking for new heroes and found them in the small Baltic nations, Latvia in particular, a nation that looms amazingly large in the austerian imagination.
At one level this is kind of funny: austerity policies have been applied all across Europe, yet the best example of success the austerians can come up with is a nation with fewer inhabitants than, say, Brooklyn. Still, the International Monetary Fund recently issued two new reports on the Latvian economy, and they really help put this story into perspective.
To be fair to the Latvians, they do have something to be proud of. After experiencing a Great-Depression-level slump, their economy has experienced two years of solid growth and falling unemployment. Despite that growth, however, they have only regained part of the lost ground in terms of either output or employment -- and the unemployment rate is still 14 percent. If this is the austerians' idea of an economic miracle, they truly are the children of a lesser god.
Oh, and if we're going to invoke the experience of small nations as evidence about what economic policies work, let's not forget the true economic miracle that is Iceland -- a nation that was at ground zero of the financial crisis, but which, thanks to its embrace of unorthodox policies, has almost fully recovered.
So what do we learn from the rather pathetic search for austerity success stories? We learn that the doctrine that has dominated elite economic discourse for the past three years is wrong on all fronts. Not only have we been ruled by fear of nonexistent threats, we've been promised rewards that haven't arrived and never will. It's time to put the deficit obsession aside and get back to dealing with the real problem -- namely, unacceptably high unemployment.

HEADLINE: Developers Join Labor to Back Eased Limits on Midtown Work

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
In recent years, the real estate industry has clashed repeatedly with unions in New York City over wages, work rules and its favorite development projects.
But now, prominent developers have forged an unusual alliance with labor and the construction industry to lobby for rules to allow a new crop of skyscrapers around Grand Central Terminal in Midtown.
They are seeking to go further than the Bloomberg administration, which has proposed zoning changes that would enable developers to build office towers in some cases twice the size currently permitted. The new alliance is pressing the administration to loosen its proposed rules so that more skyscrapers can be built on more sites, at a quicker pace and at a lower cost. 
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has said the densely built-up neighborhood's position as the city's premier office district has been undermined by zoning rules that curtail the height of buildings and discourage placing new towers where the average age of buildings now is 73 years.
Community boards, preservationists, elected officials and the Municipal Art Society have urged the city to slow down and do a rigorous assessment of the impact of more tall buildings on an already congested area. They say they fear that the proposal could lead to the demolition of historic buildings to make way for towers that would cast shadows over landmarks, like the Waldorf-Astoria and the MetLife Building.
In a letter dated Jan. 25 to Deputy Mayor Robert K. Steel, who is leading the rezoning effort, the alliance -- called Midtown 21C: Coalition for a Globally Competitive NYC -- vowed to ''aggressively advocate for the passage of a rezoning plan for Midtown East, along with the proposed improvements to the plan that we have suggested.''
The letter was signed by officials from the Real Estate Board of New York, the powerful lobbying arm of the industry; the New York Building Congress; the Building Trades Employers Association; the Manhattan Chamber of Commerce; and three labor organizations: Local 32BJ Service Employees International Union, the Building and Construction Trades Council of New York and the Hotel Trades Council.
No one involved in the debate disputes there is a need for modern office towers in the 70-block area around Grand Central. The discussion has been over the best way to encourage development and how to pay for the improvements to streets, sidewalks and transit links that then would be necessary.
After meeting with real estate executives, the city's Planning Department unveiled proposed zoning changes last year and hopes to have them approved by the City Council in October. It is trying to complete the rezoning in less than half the time spent on the Hudson Yards rezoning on the West Side, which was adopted in 2005 after five years' work, or the Hudson Square rezoning downtown, which is in its fifth year.
The administration's plan would allow developers, under certain conditions, to build taller, more efficient office towers. Developers would be able to buy development rights for the towers from the city and later from the owner of the development rights over Grand Central.
Planning Department officials have played down the impact, saying the new towers would go up over a long period of time and add only four million square feet of space and 16,000 employees to a neighborhood with 230,000 office workers.
At a breakfast forum on Tuesday sponsored by Crain's New York Business, City Councilman Daniel Garodnick, a Democrat who represents the district, said the city was on the right track. But, he added, new office space is only part of the equation. There is a need for $400 million worth of improvements to Grand Central today, he said, let alone when new towers are put up nearby.
The city's plans to raise money for those improvements are uncertain, he said. And there may not be enough time before October to calculate the full effect of the zoning changes.
''Pace is an issue for us,'' Mr. Garodnick said. ''The Council is not going to get boxed in here.''
Nervous that the Council could scuttle the proposal and eager to make changes to the city's plan, the real estate industry decided to build a united front with unions representing construction, building maintenance and hotel workers. Real estate executives credit Rob Speyer, a developer and the new chairman of the Real Estate Board, with the new strategy.
''Business and labor have a lot of common interests,'' Mr. Speyer said. ''We want to focus on our common ground. We're sending a strong message to elected officials that labor and business are united on a given issue.''
Mr. Speyer and Hector Figueroa, president of Local 32BJ, plan to interview prospective mayoral candidates jointly in the coming months about economic development, job creation, affordable housing and overhauling immigration policy. Thirteen months ago, the union and real estate owners were engaged in contentious contract negotiations.
''Both industry and unions have political clout for different reasons,'' Mr. Figueroa said. ''To the extent we can identify issues that we can agree on, so much the better.''
But he cautioned that the two sides ''may not end up endorsing the same candidates.''

HEADLINE: A Pension for Security, Not Politics

BYLINE: By ALICIA H. MUNNELL. 
Alicia H. Munnell, a professor of management sciences and the director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, is the author of ''State and Local Pensions: What Now?''

 BODY:
CHESTNUT HILL, Mass.
EVERY few years, politicians come up with the notion of using public pension funds to make political statements.
The most recent incarnation is the effort to divest public pension and retirement plans from companies that make firearms. On Jan. 14, Chicago's mayor, Rahm Emanuel, ordered a review of the holdings of the city's public plans and asked their boards to take steps to end any investments in companies that manufacture or sell assault weapons. Days later, the Municipal Employees' Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago voted to sell roughly $1 million in investments in three gun makers, including Freedom Group, the company that made the Bushmaster rifle used in the shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.
That move followed the one by the California State Teachers Retirement System, known as Calstrs, which voted in early January to begin to divest from firearms companies. Pension officials in New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts also say they are considering or beginning the divestment process. 
Such responses have a powerful emotional appeal in the wake of the Newtown murders. And on a gut level, they might seem to make sense. But there are strong arguments not to use public pension plans to accomplish public policy goals. Divestiture will have no impact on the targeted companies and will create risks for already vulnerable plans.
First, the divestiture of gun stocks by a handful of public plans -- or even by dozens of them -- is unlikely to have a long-term impact on the share prices of these companies. The action may cause a temporary price drop, but as long as some buyers remain, they will swoop in and purchase the stock after the dip -- and, if history is any indication, maybe even make money.
And the buyers are out there. The Vice fund, which was established in 2002, specializes in four sectors -- alcohol, tobacco, gambling and military -- and thus may stand ready to buy any stocks diverted from standard portfolios. Even the major anti-apartheid shareholder boycotts in the 1980s had no negative impacts on the valuation of banks or corporations with South African operations.
Second, public pension funds are particularly ill-suited vehicles for social investing. Adding a new criterion to the investment decision may increase the likelihood of mistakes. While the investment arms of many large public funds are first-rate, others are much less experienced. The boards of smaller funds often consist of about 10 people, including mayors, comptrollers, city council members, union leaders, retirees and citizens. The process is often conducted behind closed doors and subject to little public scrutiny. Introducing divestment requirements into such an environment may well take the manager's eye off the prize: maximum returns for any given level of risk.
Finally, the people advocating for divestiture and the stakeholders are not the same people. The advocates for divestiture are either the fund board or the politicians. The stakeholders are tomorrow's beneficiaries and taxpayers. If divestiture produces losses either through higher administrative costs or lower returns, tomorrow's taxpayers will have to ante up or future retirees will receive lower benefits. The welfare of these future actors is not well represented in the decision-making process.
The last of these reasons is largely why the issue of divesting does not arise in private pension plans, which are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Under the law, private plan fiduciaries may not ''subordinate the economic interests [of participants and beneficiaries] to unrelated objectives.''
That should be the governing wisdom for public pensions as well. Their charge is to be good stewards of their participants' assets. Anything beyond that is a potentially costly diversion.

HEADLINE: Chinese Company Will Run Strategic Pakistani Port

BYLINE: By DECLAN WALSH; Bree Feng contributed research from Beijing.

 BODY:
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- Pakistan is handing management control of a strategic but commercially troubled deep-sea port to a Chinese company, the information minister confirmed Thursday.
The minister, Qamar Zaman Kaira, said that control of the port at Gwadar, near Pakistan's border with Iran, would pass from the Port of Singapore Authority to a company he identified as China Overseas Port Holdings, in a move that had been anticipated for some time.
Mr. Kaira said the Chinese company would inject money into the Gwadar port, which has failed to meet the lofty goals set by the military ruler Gen. Pervez Musharraf on its completion in late 2006 and now lies largely unused. 
''We hope that the Chinese company will invest to make the port operational,'' Mr. Kaira said, according to Reuters.
A spokesman for the Singaporean company declined to comment, as did the Chinese government. However, at a news briefing in Beijing on Thursday, a Foreign Ministry spokesman noted that China would ''actively support anything that is beneficial to the China-Pakistan friendship.''
The fate of Gwadar, once billed as Pakistan's answer to the bustling port city of Dubai, United Arab Emirates, has been a focus of speculation about China's military and economic ambitions in South Asia for the past decade. Some American strategists have described it as the westernmost link in the ''string of pearls,'' a line of China-friendly ports stretching from mainland China to the Persian Gulf, that could ultimately ease expansion by the Chinese Navy in the region. Gwadar is close to the Strait of Hormuz, an important oil-shipping lane.
But other analysts note that Gwadar is many years from reaching its potential, and they suggest that fears of creeping Chinese influence might be overblown. ''There may be a strategic dimension to this, where the Chinese want to mark their presence in an important part of the world,'' said Hasan Karrar, an assistant professor of Asian history at the Lahore University of Management Sciences, referring to the management transfer at Gwadar. ''But I wouldn't go so far as saying this implies a military projection in the region.''
The supply lines for the American-led coalition forces in Afghanistan mainly pass through ports farther east in Pakistan and do not involve Gwadar.
Of greater likely concern to Washington was another announcement Pakistan made on Wednesday, saying that it was pressing ahead with a joint energy project with Iran that the United States strongly opposes.
Mr. Kaira said the cabinet had approved an Iranian offer to partly finance the 490-mile-long Pakistan segment of a planned gas pipeline between the two countries. Last year, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton warned that the project could lead to possible sanctions against Pakistan.
But political analysts in Pakistan saw the announcement as part of Pakistani election politics, and there is wider skepticism that Pakistan can bring the $1.6 billion project to completion. At present Pakistan is suffering from a major energy crisis, including a severe gas shortage that has caused lengthy lines outside fuel stations.
The gas pipeline, which enjoys broad public support, represents positive news for the government of President Asif Ali Zardari before it dissolves in preparation for elections that are expected to take place in May. And although Iran has offered a $500 million finance deal to help Pakistan build its part of the pipeline, Western officials say the Zardari government will still struggle to meet its part of the deal.
Both the Gwadar port and the pipeline to Iran offer the potential of reducing Pakistan's strategic dependence on the United States, but as yet have failed to deliver.
Commissioned by General Musharraf, the Gwadar port project initially set off a flurry of excited property speculation in what was once a quiet fishing village. Developers presented flashy plans for luxury apartment blocks amid talk the port could rival Dubai.
China paid for 75 percent of the $248 million construction costs, while the Port of Singapore Authority won a 40-year contract to manage the facility, which started in early 2007. General Musharraf assuaged critics of the Chinese involvement by saying the port would not be put to any military use.
But Pakistan has failed to build the port or transportation infrastructure needed to develop the port, the property bubble has burst and, according to the port management Web site, the last ship to dock there arrived in November. ''The government never built the infrastructure that the port needed -- roads, rail or storage depots,'' said Khurram Husain, a freelance business journalist. ''Why would any shipping company come to the port if it has no service to offer?''
According to reports in the Pakistani news media, the Port of Singapore Authority sought to withdraw from the management contract after the Pakistani government failed to hand over land needed to develop the facility.
Mr. Kaira said Wednesday that both the Singaporean and Chinese companies had agreed to transfer the contract for control of the port, but he did not give a timetable.

HEADLINE: U.N. Panel Sees Violations In Israeli Settlement Policy

BYLINE: By NICK CUMMING-BRUCE and ISABEL KERSHNER; Nick Cumming-Bruce reported from Geneva, and Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem.

 BODY:
GENEVA -- Israel has pursued a creeping annexation of the Palestinian territories through the creation of Jewish settlements and committed multiple violations of international law, possibly including war crimes, a United Nations panel said Thursday, calling for an immediate halt to all settlement activity and the withdrawal of all settlers.
Presenting their findings in Geneva after a nearly six-month inquiry for the United Nations Human Rights Council, a panel of three judges, led by Christine Chanet of France, presented its view that Israel's settlements violated the Geneva Conventions, which prohibit a state from transferring its own civilian population into territory it has occupied. 
Asked if Israel's actions constituted war crimes, Ms. Chanet replied that its offenses fell under Article 8 of the International Criminal Court statute. ''Article 8 of the I.C.C. statute is the chapter of war crimes,'' she said at a news conference. ''That is the answer.''
Israel's Foreign Ministry quickly dismissed the report as ''counterproductive and unfortunate'' and said it provided a reminder of the Human Rights Council's ''systematically one-sided and biased approach towards Israel.''
Israel and the United States view the Human Rights Council, which answers to some nondemocratic member states, including Saudi Arabia, China and Cuba, that are themselves often scrutinized for human rights violations, as eager to shine a harsh spotlight on Israeli practices even though it overlooks egregious rights problems elsewhere. Israel has had repeated conflicts with the body and declined to cooperate with the panel's fact-finding inquiry.
Israel ''must cease all settlement activities without preconditions'' and start withdrawing all settlers from the occupied territories, the judges said in their report, scheduled to be debated in the rights council in March.
The panel drew on 67 submissions from a cross section of academics, diplomats, Israeli civilian organizations and Palestinians, Ms. Chanet said. Because Israel decided not to cooperate with the investigators, they were unable to visit the West Bank and went instead to the Jordanian capital, Amman, to take testimony.
The council's decision last March to investigate the effect of Jewish settlements on Palestinian rights prompted Israel to break off cooperation with the council, castigating it as a political platform used ''to bash and demonize Israel.'' The panel's report came two days after Israel boycotted a council review of its human rights, becoming the first country to withhold cooperation from a process in which all 193 United Nations member states have previously engaged.
The United States has condemned Israel's settlement policy as unhelpful and an obstacle to achieving a two-state solution to the Palestinian issue, but it also opposed the creation of the fact-finding mission, saying at the time that it was an example of the council's bias against Israel, that it did not ''advance the cause of peace'' and that it would ''distract the parties from efforts to resolve the issues that divide them.''
The panel noted that Israel had established about 250 Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem since 1967, with a combined population now estimated at 520,000. It said the settler population was growing much faster than the population of Israel outside the settlements.
The report quotes the Israeli finance minister, Yuval Steinitz, as saying in November that the government had doubled the budget for West Bank settlements ''in a low-key way because we didn't want parties in Israel or abroad to thwart the move.''
These actions fall under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, the panel said, and if a future Palestinian state ratified the Rome Statute, which created the court, Israel could be called to account for ''gross violations of human rights law and serious violations of international humanitarian law.''
The report was welcomed by Palestinian officials and some settlement opponents in Israel. Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said in a statement that the report documented ''illegal Israeli practices without any ambiguity.''
Israeli officials, on the other hand, dismissed the report, saying that the only way to resolve the settlement issue was through direct Israeli-Palestinian negotiations without preconditions.
Yigal Palmor, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said that the council ''systematically gives Israel a raw deal'' and that the report's conclusions were predictable. Defending Israel's decision not to cooperate with the fact-finding mission, Mr. Palmor said, ''If the cards are marked, are we expected to play anyway?''
He criticized the report for mentioning Israel's unilateral evacuation of 21 settlements in Gaza and 4 in the northern West Bank in 2005 ''in passing in a few lines, as an insignificant detail, although it was a very major event for Israel.''
''It adds insult to injury,'' he said.
The report did not explicitly call for an economic boycott of the settlements or sanctions against Israel, but Israel said its authors deliberately used language that could serve groups calling for such measures.
Frances Raday, an Israeli law professor and a human rights advocate, told Israeli television that the report ''gives unusual encouragement to attempts that already exist to boycott settlements and Israeli institutions and Israel as a state because of the settlements.''
According to the report, Palestinians' rights to freedom of movement and expression and their access to places of worship, education, water, housing and natural resources ''are being violated consistently.''
The settlements are maintained through ''a system of total segregation'' between the settlers, who enjoy a preferential legal status, and the rest of the population, the report concludes. The settlements have resulted in the creation of legal zones in which settlers are subject to Israeli laws but Palestinians come under a patchwork of military orders and laws dating back to Ottoman and British rule, the report says.
In July, an Israeli government-appointed commission of legal experts published a report saying Israel's presence in the West Bank was not occupation and recommending that the state approve scores of unauthorized Jewish settlement outposts there.
The three-member commission, led by Edmund Levy, a retired Israeli Supreme Court justice, confirmed a position long held by Israel: that the territories are not occupied, since Jordan's previous hold over them was never internationally recognized, and that their fate must be determined in negotiations. Still, fearing international censure, among other things, Israel's government has not formally adopted the commission's conclusions.

Previews and Openings
'All in the Timing' (in previews; opens on Feb. 12) Fresh from his well-reviewed Broadway production of ''A Christmas Story, the Musical,'' John Rando directs the 20th-anniversary revival of this collection of six one-act comedies in which David Ives brings his playful perspective and wizardry with language to matters romantic and existential. The cast for the Primary Stages production includes Jenn Harris, Carson Elrod and Matthew Saldivar. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, primarystages.org. (David Rooney) 
'Clive' (in previews; opens on Thursday) After directing Jonathan Marc Sherman's ''Things We Want'' for the New Group, Ethan Hawke reunites with that playwright and company to stage this premiere inspired by Bertolt Brecht's ''Baal.'' Mr. Hawke also plays the title character in this modern update, which traces the slide from success to self-destruction of a songwriter in 1990s New York. Brooks Ashmanskas, Vincent D'Onofrio and Zoe Kazan also star in the production, which features live performances of classic American songs. Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'The Dance and the Railroad' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Feb. 25) Each Signature Theater season typically features at least one relative obscurity by the honored playwright, and this year's David Henry Hwang season is no exception. This 1981 play, which was only Mr. Hwang's second, uses the conventions of Chinese opera to illuminate the story of two Chinese immigrant workers in the California mountains during the building of the Transcontinental Railroad. Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Eric Grode)
'Donnybrook!' (previews start on Thursday; opens on Feb. 17) The lyricist Johnny Burke is best known for his longstanding relationship with Paramount Pictures, including more than two dozen Bing Crosby films, but he also contributed the music as well as lyrics to this short-lived 1961 Broadway musical. Its source material -- the classic John Ford film ''The Quiet Man,'' featuring John Wayne as an Irish-American boxer who returns to the old sod -- makes it a natural property for Irish Repertory Theater, which has enlivened similarly forgotten musicals like ''Take Me Along'' and ''New Girl in Town.'' Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Grode)
'Fuenteovejuna' (previews start on Friday; opens on Thursday) Repertorio Español gives this 17th-century Félix Lope de Vega classic a modern-day workout. As before it takes an entire Spanish village to kill a corrupt ruler; as before each and every villager responds to the subsequent inquiry with ''Fuenteovejuna did it!'' But the director, Julián J. Mesri, has updated the play (based on an actual incident) and set it in a modern-day office. Think ''Spartacus'' restaged at Dunder Mifflin. In Spanish with English subtitles. Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 225-9999, repertorio.org. (Grode)
'Good Person of Szechwan' (previews start on Friday; opens on Wednesday) Fabulousness can come in many forms, and Taylor Mac seems intent on assuming each and every one of them. The last two years alone have seen him embarking on a 24-hour-long survey of popular music, creating a pair of sprawling performance pieces (''The Lily's Revenge,'' ''The Walk Across America for Mother Earth'') and even playing Puck in ''A Midsummer Night's Dream.'' Now the shape-and-gender-shifting Mr. Mac adds Brecht to his résumé, as he stars in this Foundry Theater revival alongside Lisa Kron, Annie Golden and Mia Katigbak. La MaMa Ellen Stewart Theater, 66 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710, thefoundrytheatre.org. (Grode)
'Isaac's Eye' (in previews; opens on Feb. 9) It's ''Amadeus'' with optics! Once again an enterprising playwright (Lucas Hnath, in this case) has attempted to look at centuries-old culture by having a young genius (and partly named title character) do battle with an older contemporary, rising to far greater notoriety when all is said and done. It worked for Mozart, and now it's Isaac Newton's turn, with the scientist Robert Hooke filling in as the embittered eminence destined to relative obscurity. Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, ensemblestudiotheatre.org. (Grode)
'Katie Roche' (in previews; opens on Feb. 25) To the extent that New York theatergoers know anything about the 20th-century Irish playwright Teresa Deevy, it is because of the Mint Theater. The enterprising theater, which is also publishing two volumes of her writings, wraps up its three-play Deevy retrospective with this 1936 drama about a wildly ambitious servant girl. The Abbey Theater brought it to America in 1937, but this is the first American production. The Mint's artistic director, Jonathan Bank, directs once again. 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, minttheater.org. (Grode)
'The Luck of the Irish' (in previews; opens on Feb. 11) Kirsten Greenidge made a splash in 2011 with her Obie Award-winning play ''Milk Like Sugar,'' about teenage pregnancy. Her new play may sound familiar to ''Clybourne Park'' fans; it also looks at race relations, filtered through the eyes of black and white inhabitants of the same house over multiple generations. Ms. Greenidge's play is about the tensions that rise when an Irish family, which is paid to ''ghost buy'' a house in an all-white Boston neighborhood for a black family in the 1950s, comes back to claim the house. Her ''Milk'' director, Rebecca Taichman, returns for this one. Claire Tow Theater, Lincoln Center, 150 West 65th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com, lct3.org. (Grode)
'The Madrid' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Feb. 26) When a kindergarten teacher one day gets up and walks out of work, she leaves in the lurch not only a batch of blinking 5-year-olds but also a loving husband and a daughter. Liz Flahive makes her return to Manhattan Theater Club, which presented her domestic drama ''From Up Here'' in 2008, with this new work and Edie Falco in tow. Leigh Silverman, who directed ''From Up Here'' and has a way with plays about troublesome parents (''Well,'' ''Coraline''), teams up with Ms. Flahive again here. City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Grode)
'Much Ado About Nothing' (previews start on Saturday; opens on Feb. 17) Fans of no-frills, shrewdly conceived, elegantly presented Shakespeare have learned to circle their calendars for Arin Arbus's annual Theater for a New Audience productions. This one, her fifth in as many years, features a love-hate relationship not unlike that in last year's ''Taming of the Shrew,'' and Ms. Arbus once again has Maggie Siff (''Sons of Anarchy'') to represent the female half of the equation. Playing Benedick opposite Ms. Siff's Beatrice is the British classical actor Jonathan Cake. The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (646) 223-3010, dukeon42.org. (Grode)
'Really Really' (in previews; opens on Feb. 19) The premise of the play sounds less than groundbreaking: College pals turn on one another after a boozy party. But this new play by Paul Downs Colaizzo has plenty going for it, including a good track record (it was a smash for the Signature Theater in Washington last year), TV darlings in the cast (Zosia Mamet of ''Girls,'' Matt Lauria of ''Friday Night Lights'') and, most intriguing of all, the infinitely resourceful director David Cromer (''Tribes,'' ''Our Town''). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 352-3101, mcctheater.org. (Grode)
'Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella' (in previews; opens on March 3) The 1957 television musical of ''Cinderella'' was a runaway smash and almost immediately began spawning stage incarnations, starring Eartha Kitt, Everett Quinton and Jean Stapleton (though they weren't cast in the title role). But this staging is the property's first appearance on Broadway, complete with a new book by Douglas Carter Beane (''Sister Act,'' ''The Little Dog Laughed'') and four fairly obscure songs added from the Rodgers and Hammerstein catalog. Laura Osnes stars as Cinderella, and she is surrounded by a formidable trio of scene stealers: Harriet Harris, Victoria Clark and Ann Harada. Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Grode)
'This Clement World' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Feb. 10) A decade into Cynthia Hopkins's working relationship with St. Ann's Warehouse, she isn't exactly resting on her laurels. In addition to a handful of new characters portrayed by the versatile Ms. Hopkins and a collection of original avant-folk compositions (performed by a septet and a choir), her latest piece includes video footage that she shot of a three-week Arctic expedition. It's all designed to address climate change, but straight-ahead agitprop isn't exactly Ms. Hopkins's style. 29 Jay Street, at Plymouth Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779, stannswarehouse.org. (Grode)
'Totally Tubular Time Machine' (in previews; opens on Feb. 9) Every time a new jukebox assembly appears, musical theater purists complain that the form is being dumbed down into elaborate karaoke. The creators of this show thumb their noses at such charges. This immersive experience allows audiences to time-travel through the 1980s and '90s and back to the present, joining the party of celebrity excess and pop mash-up. (Saturdays only) Culture Club, 20 West 39th Street, (212) 921-1999, totallytubularnyc.com. (Rooney)
'Women of Will' (in previews; opens on Sunday) Quick: How many of William Shakespeare's title characters are women? The answer is three, though Juliet, Cressida and Cleopatra each have to share the marquee with a guy. By comparison, four different Henrys alone warrant title billing. Tina Packer, the founding artistic director of Shakespeare & Company in Massachusetts, looks to rectify this imbalance with her 15-years-in-the-making exploration of the Shakespearean canon through the eyes of his female characters. Nigel Gore stars with Ms. Packer, but expect the focus to be on Beatrice, Portia, Viola, Lady Macbeth and many other women.

'Annie' James Lapine's revival of the singing comic strip from 1977 is merely serviceable. But its smiley-faced mixture of hope and corn scratches an itch in a city recovering from a recession and a hurricane. Theatergoers may feel the urge both to mist up and throw up, but Lilla Crawford is a nigh irresistible Orphan Annie. With Katie Finneran and Anthony Warlow (2:25).

'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' A four-alarm urgency infuses Scarlett Johansson's performance in Rob Ashford's oxygen-starved revival of Tennessee Williams's 1955 drama of sex and lies. If Ms. Johansson is oddly un-feline as Maggie the Cat, she sure has presence. The rest of the cast, including Benjamin Walker and Ciaran Hinds, gets lost in the heavy atmospherics (2:40). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'The Heiress' Masterpiece Theater on Broadway. Moisés Kaufman's revival of Ruth and Augustus Goetz's sturdy war horse, starring a one-note Jessica Chastain, is lovely to look at, easy to follow and -- aside from a vivid supporting performance from Judith Ivey -- about as full of real life as an Olde New York Christmas window in a department store (2:45). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'The Mystery of Edwin Drood' A boisterous, well-cast revival of Rupert Holmes's Tony-winning 1986 musical, which gives the audience the chance to choose the identity of the killer of the titular hero. Chita Rivera lends an air of authentic glamour, Jim Norton is a cutup as the music-hall proprietor, and the young cast sings the lovely score with great skill (2:35). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Charles Isherwood)
'Newsies' This Disney musical -- adapted from the 1992 movie and inspired by the newsboy strike of 1899 -- markets Urchin Appeal with extra! extra! enthusiasm. Jeff Calhoun directs a cast of comely, if overgrown, ragamuffins. The largely interchangeable songs are by Alan Menken and Jack Feldman (2:20). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (866) 870-2717, newsiesthemusical.com. (Brantley)
'Nice Work if You Can Get It' Every now and then a bubble of pure, tickling charm rises from the artificial froth of this pastiche 1920s musical, directed by Kathleen Marshall and featuring songs by George and Ira Gershwin. But mostly the production, starring Matthew Broderick and Kelli O'Hara, registers as a shiny, dutiful trickle of gags and production numbers (2:30). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Once' This gentle musical, set in Dublin, about a love affair that never quite happens -- based on the 2006 movie -- inventively uses songs (by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova) and dance to convey a beautiful shimmer of might-have-been regret. Staged by John Tiffany and Steven Hoggett (''Black Watch''), the production stars the immensely appealing Steve Kazee and Cristin Milioti (2:15). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'The Other Place' Laurie Metcalf gives a captivating, complicated performance in Sharr White's clever puzzle of a drama, portraying a woman grappling with sudden onset of a mysterious illness at the same time as her personal life -- disloyal husband (Daniel Stern), estranged daughter (Zoe Perry) -- threatens to implode. Joe Mantello's nimble direction ratchets up the suspense (1:10). Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (800) 432-7250, mtc-nyc.org. (Isherwood)
'Picnic' A torso stars in Sam Gold's stultifying revival of William Inge's time-yellowed 1953 play, set in lusty, dusty Kansas. The torso belongs to Sebastian Stan as a handsome drifter whose bare pecs and abs stir deep longings in lonely bosoms. Those being stirred include Maggie Grace, Elizabeth Marvel, Ellen Burstyn and the excellent Mare Winningham (2:05). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' Pam MacKinnon's shattering 50th-anniversary revival of Edward Albee's hair-raising drama of marital discord stars an electrifying Tracy Letts (of ''August: Osage County'' fame) as George and Amy Morton (ditto) as Martha, ably supported by Carrie Coon and Madison Dirks as the young couple they use as cannon fodder. Not to be missed (3:05). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
Off Broadway
&#x2605; 'Bethany' A single mother (the terrific America Ferrera) fights to win back custody of her child -- lost to foster care when she became homeless -- in Laura Marks's smart, compassionate play, featuring a fine supporting cast and sensitive direction by Gaye Taylor Upchurch (1:30). City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Isherwood)
'Le Cid' When Rodrigue's father is insulted, Rodrigue must seek vengeance. Inconveniently, his target happens to be his future father-in-law. It is the original Corneillian dilemma, named for this 1636 play by Pierre Corneille, of a choice between honor and love. The infatuations with face-saving veer from the tragic to the comic, usually by design. An uneven cast struggles with some of the meatier roles, but the rarely produced masterwork is still worth seeing (1:55). Theater of the Church of Notre Dame, 405 West 114th Street, at Morningside Drive, Morningside Heights, (212) 868-4444, stormtheatre.com. (Catherine Rampell)
'Collision' Taken as a fast, creepy exercise in suspense, Lyle Kessler's play about a college roommate from hell might be reasonably diverting. But as David Fofi's production for the Amoralists company sprints and staggers toward an apocalyptic conclusion, it doesn't sustain the scrutiny invited by its too-topical plot (imagine ''Leopold and Loeb with automatic weapons'') (1:40). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (866) 811-4111, collisiontheplay.com. (Brantley)
'Cougar the Musical' Three older women find themselves attracted to younger men, two against their better judgment. The concept seems made for bus tours, but imagination, appealing numbers with original melodies and theme-transcending jokes lift this show well above the level of ''Menopause: The Musical'' and its ilk (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)
'Doña Flor y Sus Dos Maridos' A Spanish-language adaptation (''Doña Flor and Her Two Husbands,'' in English) of Jorge Amado's novel, a sex farce with the clarity and logic of a folk tale and the spirit of a party (1:40). Repertorio Español at Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 225-9920, repertorioespanol.com. (Rachel Saltz)
&#x2605; 'Forbidden Broadway: Alive and Kicking' Gerard Alessandrini's essential satirical cheat sheet to Broadway musicals returns after a three-year absence, packing polished brass knuckles. A precisionist cast of four provides vocal cartoons as evocative as Al Hirschfeld's caricatures. This show not only tickles but also pierces the Achilles' heels of the productions under scrutiny (1:40). At the 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Forever Dusty' If Kristen Holly Smith turned up to your costume party in Dusty Springfield drag and started singing, there would be no mistaking the woman she was channeling. But doing a passable impersonation is a far cry from capturing the essence of one of the most distinctive female vocalists of all time, as this amateurish inflated cabaret act demonstrates. Written in by-the-numbers basics by Ms. Smith and Jonathan Vankin, and directed with minimal finesse by Randal Myler, this misconceived bio-musical is a soulless tribute to the platinum-haired, panda-eyed queen of white soul. She deserves better (1:40). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, foreverdusty.net. (Rooney)
&#x2605; 'Fried Chicken and Latkes' Rain Pryor, the daughter of the comedian Richard Pryor (who died in 2005), stars in this effervescent solo show, which recounts her upbringing in a biracial household (her mother is Jewish) in Beverly Hills, Calif. Ms. Pryor, who sings and portrays a range of characters (including, poignantly, her father in a spot-on impression) is an ebullient performer with a robust singing voice. She lives in Baltimore now, but her outsize personality is built for Broadway (1:30). Actor's Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Andy Webster)
'The Jammer' Rolin Jones's thin comic strip of a play finds a humble Everyman from Brooklyn (the fine Patch Darragh) leaving behind his beloved girl to chase a dream of becoming a roller derby star (1:30). Atlantic Stage 2, 330 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Isherwood)
'My Name Is Asher Lev' Aaron Posner's adaptation of Chaim Potok's novel feels like a well-made play from the era in which the story takes place -- the 1950s. Set in a Hasidic community in Brooklyn, this tale of an artistic prodigy has been directed with an attention to emotional nuance by Gordon Edelstein and features strong performances from its three-person cast: Ari Brand, Mark Nelson and Jenny Bacon (1:30). Westside Theater/Upstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rachel Saltz)
'Old Jews Telling Jokes' With old jokes, a few songs and a little schmaltz, this winning revue is simple, effective entertainment executed with obvious affection (1:20). Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Jason Zinoman)
&#x2605; 'Water by the Spoonful' Quiara Alegría Hudes's moving collage of lives in crisis, the 2012 winner of the Pulitzer Prize for drama, is the second part of a trilogy centering on the Ortiz family. Elliot (the fine Armando Riesco), a former Marine injured in Iraq, struggles with the loss of the aunt who raised him and a tempestuous reconnection with the ex-crack-addict mother who abandoned him (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 305 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422, 2st.com. (Isherwood)
'Working on a Special Day' This two-hander, directed and performed by Ana Graham and Antonio Vega, adapts Ettore Scola's 1977 film ''A Special Day'' for the stage. With the humblest of means -- chalk drawings, a few props -- the actors create a world, a refuge for two, playfully reminding us that theater is a place for make believe and that imagination can be a bulwark against oppression (1:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org, playco.org. (Saltz)
Off Off Broadway
'The House of Von Macramé' A flamboyantly gory musical spoof of slasher movies, set in the fashion world, where everyone is either wearing or wielding a stiletto (metaphorically speaking). Delicious performances abound, and Matt Marks's songs are fun, but Joshua Conkel's script could stand to lose a few inches off the hemline (2:15). Bushwick Starr, 207 Starr Street, between Irving and Wyckoff Avenues, Brooklyn, (800) 836-3006, thebushwickstarr.org. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Patti Issues' In his funny, tender coming-of-age monologue, Ben Rimalower traces the obsessive Patti LuPone fandom that provided him with an empowering role model. That inspiration proved perhaps most useful to Mr. Rimalower in processing the fallout after his father kicked down the closet door and bailed on the family. While on one hand, this is the story of many young gay men's propensity for diva worship, the tartly observed show goes several steps further by exploring the wide-eyed experiences that result when the acolyte gets to interact with his idol (1:00).

Last Chance
'Bare' (closes on Sunday) Stafford Arima directs this tragic tale of star-cross'd gay lovers in a Roman Catholic boarding school. While the boys try to keep their romance secret, the truth comes spilling out during a school production of ''Romeo and Juliet.'' Retooled significantly since its first incarnation in 2000, this emo musical has been updated to reflect attitudes toward homophobia and bullying in the ''It Gets Better'' era. But despite touching moments and a committed cast, the material is too painfully earnest and riddled with clichés to connect with audiences not still mired in adolescence (2:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, baremusicalnyc.com. (Rooney)
'The Future Is Not What It Was' (closes on Saturday) Michael Rabe's dark and promising comedy about a skeptic (Mr. Rabe) with women and roommate problems is often clever, sometimes deliberately messy and surprisingly hopeful here and there (2:20). Walkerspace, 46 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (800) 838-3006, kindling.brownpapertickets.com. (Gates)
'In Acting Shakespeare' (closes on Sunday) What began as a homage to Ian McKellen's one-man show ''Acting Shakespeare'' has become a boisterous, agreeable and somewhat glib tale of acting Shakespeare. The eager-to-please James DeVita charts his progress from histrionics to honesty, interwoven with bits of Shakespeare biography and plenty of dog-eared soliloquies (1:45). Pearl Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 563-9261, pearltheatre.org. (Grode)
'Life and Times: Episodes 1-4' (closes on Saturday) An epic journey through the life of a young woman growing up in Rhode Island, as recollected at Wagnerian length in the disjointed, disorganized language of everyday speech. (The script is a literal transcription of several phone conversations.) Pavol Liska and Kelly Copper, directors of the Nature Theater of Oklahoma, have created a magnum opus that seeks to transform trivial material into magical theater. They more or less succeed, though only those with affection for endurance-test theater will leave cheering rather than exhausted (Episode 1: 3:15; Episode 2: 2:00; Episode 3 and 4: 2:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Isherwood)
'Not by Bread Alone' (closes on Sunday) This singular touring production from the Nalagaat Theater of Israel is performed entirely by deaf and blind actors. Directed by Adina Tal, the show is strongest when its cast members describe the sensory content of their lives. The flashier diversions (slapstick, dance, comic vignettes) cater bluntly to a hearing and seeing audience (1:30). N.Y.U. Skirball Center, 566 La Guardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101, nyuskirball.org. (Brantley)
'The Service Road' (closes on Saturday) This new play by Erin Courtney (''A Map of Virtue'') -- about a nature guide searching for a child after a storm -- is that rare production that draws you into the realm of the unconscious, conjuring an eerie landscape that follows its own rules and dares you not to believe in it. The setting is Prospect Park, imbued with dark enchantment, fertile territory for Ms. Courtney's explorations into self-recrimination and forgiveness. Extraordinary video effects and sound design merge with Ms. Courtney's intimate, poetic script to create a cohesive, resonant and captivating experience (1:10). Voorhees Theater at the City University of New York College of Technology, 186 Jay Street, between High and Nassau Streets, Downtown Brooklyn, (800) 838-3006, adhesivetheater.com. (Webster)
'The Steadfast' (closes on Sunday) Mat Smart's ambitious play about the drama and morality of combat presents snapshots from eight different wars in American history (2:20). TBG Theater, 312 West 36th Street, Manhattan, (212) 866-4444, smarttix.com. (Zinoman)
&#x2605; 'The Suit' (closes on Saturday) Devastation by enchantment, courtesy of the great director Peter Brook and the Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord. Even as it draws you in like the gregarious host of a spirited party, this simply told tale of adultery in apartheid South Africa is quietly preparing to break your heart. Four actors and three musicians make beautiful magic together (1:15). Harvey Theater, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org. (Brantley)

HEADLINE: Plan for Older Students Faces Obstacles

BYLINE: By MORGAN SMITH. 
msmith@texastribune.org

 BODY:
In 2009, all that stood between Anita Rodriguez and a high school diploma was one standardized test. She was a student at the Austin Independent School District, and had the required credits for graduating but could not pass her TAKS math exam. 
Ms. Rodriguez, now 22, earned her general education development degree in August. The G.E.D. will help her get into cosmetology school, but its value in the work force is still lower than that of the high school diploma she nearly received. To receive her G.E.D., she repeated much of her earlier course work.
The Goodwill Industries of Central Texas program that helped Ms. Rodriguez obtain her G.E.D. is one of the few options available for adults who want to improve their job opportunities. In Texas, one in five people older than 25 lacks a high school diploma, and employment projections indicate that over the next four years, 80 percent of the 20 fastest-growing occupations will require education above the high school level.
With that in mind, Goodwill wants to expand its services by opening a charter school that focuses on awarding high school diplomas to older students, instead of the G.E.D.'s that adult education programs traditionally offer. The charter application will be filed in February.
The program, modeled on schools that the charity operates in Indianapolis, would be the first of its kind in Texas. Goodwill hopes to serve about 300 students in its first year.
But first, there are obstacles to overcome. The state provides financing for charters and school districts to operate dropout recovery programs only for students under 26.
''Why do we give up on somebody when they turn 25?'' said Traci Berry, the vice president for development of Goodwill in Central Texas. ''We want the people to still be educated. We want to prepare them for life. We want to give them the training and the skills, to be able to say, here they are now, able to contribute.''
There is limited financing for adult education services for the over-25 population. In 2011, primarily with federal money, those programs served about 112,000 of the estimated 3.5 million Texans eligible. The vast majority of that money goes to English-as-a-second-language programs and instruction in basic reading, writing and math. Only 4 percent goes to programs geared toward helping those adults who already learn above the basic level to earn high school degrees or their equivalent.
For Ms. Berry, that is a missed opportunity to reach those who are closest to entering the work force.
Lawmakers, including Representative John Davis, the Houston Republican who heads the economic development committee in the House, have expressed interest in reforming adult education policies this session.
If Goodwill's efforts to gain financing for older students are unsuccessful, Ms. Berry said, the charter will focus on students 19 to 25, with the hopes of finding a way to serve those 26 and older in the next few years, even without money from the state.

HEADLINE: Perry's Agenda Touches On Both Policy and Politics

BYLINE: By ROSS RAMSEY. 
rramsey@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Two years ago, in his State of the State speech, Gov. Rick Perry set up the legislative session and a future presidential run with a laundry list of issues dear to Republican primary voters. His address on Tuesday was subtler, but still political.
Trust state legislators to give less than their complete devotion and attention to his suggestions, but the key word is ''complete.'' Some of his ideas make it into state policy, and some don't. And the speeches are best read as hybrids of policy and politics, setting up the governor's agenda for a legislative session as well as the foundation for his next election cycle. With Mr. Perry's interest in national office, those cycles come every two years now instead of every four. 
The politics are easy this time. Mr. Perry has not said whether he will seek re-election in 2014 or whether he will run for president again in 2016. But a politician planning for a race in either year could have done a lot worse than the governor's performance.
He talked about fiscal conservatism and how well the Texas economy is doing because of a light regulatory touch. He reiterated his loathing of the federal government's health care plans while also saying the state stands ready to work with the re-elected president. And he spent something like $6.8 billion on tax breaks, water, roads and a financing swap involving highway money and state police.
Mr. Perry stayed out of the red-meat market on social issues; for instance, he didn't talk about his support for a proposal to outlaw abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy to prevent ''fetal pain,'' though he had been at an anti-abortion rally on the Capitol grounds three days earlier.
Social conservatives didn't get much. This is a fiscal program.
The tax breaks deserve particular attention. Mr. Perry wants lawmakers to set $1.8 billion aside for tax refunds or breaks. He asked them to back a constitutional amendment that would allow refunds.
Should the Legislature agree, voters would see that amendment in November, probably after a campaign with a slogan like, ''Hey, you don't want money back, do you?'' Five months later, those voters will be passing judgment -- in party primaries -- on the lawmakers who offered the breaks on the November ballot.
That is pretty good politics.
Not that lawmakers listen to what governors want: this was Mr. Perry's seventh effort, and if the Legislature took these things more seriously, it would be different around here.
We wouldn't have a state-run lottery -- it would have been sold to create an endowment fund for public education and an insurance program for the poor. That's from Mr. Perry's 2007 speech. That's also where he raised the idea of a $3 billion fund to fight cancer, also paid for with money from the sale of the Texas Lottery. It turned into the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas, financed with government bonds and, it turns out, riddled with problems of great interest to auditors and, perhaps, prosecutors.
We would be building a huge network of roads, rail and utility easements across the state called the Trans-Texas Corridor. That one didn't survive the opposition of property rights activists. Texas is still building roads, but the idea of 1,200-foot-wide ribbons of infrastructure draped across the state is dead.
Students in Texas would be allowed to pay for private schooling with public money -- a voucher or ''school choice'' proposal that was in the governor's 2003 speech and that reappeared periodically after that, including in this week's address.
Those misses have not had much effect on Mr. Perry's success in state elections, and the rhetoric sometimes has as much political value as the idea behind it.
The governor was less overtly political this time out, but he was political just the same. He has not put any items on emergency status -- a designation that allows the Legislature to consider a bill during the first 60 days of a session. Two years ago, Mr. Perry stoked the government furnaces with emergency proposals for immigration, voter photo identification, required sonograms for women seeking abortions, a call for a balanced federal budget and property rights.
The emergencies are missing this time, but not the politics. Watch the spending ideas -- and the declarations against participating in the federal health care law. Those could be in play in 2014. Or 2016. Or both.

HEADLINE: U.P.S. Reports a Loss and Forecasts Lower Profit in 2013

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
United Parcel Service reported a fourth-quarter net loss on Thursday after taking a large pension-related charge and forecast weaker-than-expected profit for 2013 because of an uneven global economy. 
U.P.S. followed a stream of other big companies like Rockwell Automation and Northrop Grumman that were also weighed down by pension-related charges. A prolonged period of low interest rates is driving up companies' pension costs.
Even factoring out the $3 billion noncash pension charge, U.P.S., the world's largest package-delivery company, reported a fourth-quarter profit that still missed Wall Street's expectations.
U.P.S. said it faced a $225 million rise in pension costs this year.
''This will be a significant drag in 2013,'' the chief financial officer, Kurt Kuehn, told investors in a conference call.
The company expects earnings to rise 6 to 12 percent in 2013, from $4.80 to $5.06 a share, below the average Wall Street target of $5.11.
''It's going to come down to worldwide economic growth,'' said Helane Becker, a Dahlman Rose analyst.
U.P.S. posted a fourth-quarter net loss of $1.75 billion, or $1.83 a share, after the pension charge, in contrast to a net profit of $725 million, or 74 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.
Revenue rose 2.9 percent, to $14.57 billion from $14.17 billion. U.P.S. said costs related to Hurricane Sandy, which pounded the New York metropolitan area in late October, sliced profit by 5 cents a share in the quarter.
Factoring out one-time, noncash items, profit came to $1.32 a share, below the analysts' average estimate of $1.38, according to Thomson Reuters.
''We remain in a cycle of mixed growth and mixed signals,'' the chief executive, D. Scott Davis, told investors in the conference call. ''Fiscal uncertainty continues to erode business confidence and growth prospects.''
A Morningstar analyst, Keith Schoonmaker, said one good sign in the quarter was the 7.7 percent rise in next-day air shipments in the United States.
''We need to cut through the pension clutter and look at economic results,'' Mr. Schoonmaker said. ''This is a company that has tremendous operating capability, so when you feed them a little bit more volume into their system, this company is able to make hay with that.''
U.P.S.'s largest American rival, FedEx, has been struggling with falling profits as customers increasingly send goods by ground, which is less costly and less profitable than by air.

HEADLINE: As NATO Prepares for Afghan Withdrawal, Uzbekistan Seeks War's Leftovers

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- With planning for the Western military withdrawal from Afghanistan in full swing, officials in Uzbekistan want to make a deal: we will provide the roads out if you leave some of those extra vehicles and supplies behind for us.
Uzbek officials have quietly contacted American, German and British officials with the offer, in their latest bid to supplement their military despite international embargoes, according to officials in NATO countries, human rights advocates and German news reports. On the wish list are armored vehicles, mine detectors, helicopters, navigation equipment and night-vision goggles -- used and dusty would be fine. 
It is a proposal that has won the attention of Western capitals and that is said to have annoyed the Kremlin enough that it is pushing through an arms deal with Uzbekistan's neighbor, Kyrgyzstan.
''The Uzbeks see this as their window of bargaining leverage,'' Alexander Cooley, a professor at Barnard College and an authority on the former Soviet states of Central Asia, said in a telephone interview. Both Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan were once Soviet republics.
Uzbekistan is ranked as the sixth most corrupt country in the world by Transparency International and has been banned from most arms purchases in Europe and the United States since political prisoners were discovered to have died in detention a decade ago from scalding water -- from, in fact, being boiled alive.
But what Uzbek officials are offering, however, has value. Over the next two years, NATO forces are expected to remove about 70,000 vehicles and 120,000 shipping containers from Afghanistan, and the way out will require rail lines and well-surfaced roads.
Although Pakistani ports are seen as the most efficient avenue for the cargo's withdrawal, alternatives will be important, and allied officials are mindful of a potential disruption if Pakistan ever decides to again close the routes or ask for more money, as it did during a diplomatic crisis with the United States in 2011 and 2012.
The United States government has taken the Uzbek proposal seriously enough to partially lift a set of arms sales restrictions that have been in place for about a decade. And it has held interagency meetings in Washington this month to consider the latest Uzbek proposal, according to nongovernmental experts on American policy in the region.
The Uzbek request illustrates the difficult logistics of winding down the war, an unglamorous coda to a fight that began with troops parachuting in out of the night sky.
As was the case in the withdrawal from Iraq in 2011, the cost of shipping used equipment to the United States often exceeds its value. The Army left tens of thousands of air-conditioned residential trailers in Iraq, and many of the armored vehicles that were rolled across the border into Kuwait were mothballed there.
A legacy of abandoned weapons is a common one in battle zones, including Afghanistan, which became a bustling secondhand arms bazaar after the Soviet pullout in 1989.
The State Department issued a statement saying that it was ''premature to speculate on plans for any transfer of excess equipment, or even what equipment may be declared excess'' after the withdrawal, but it clarified the parameters for any potential deals with Central Asian countries. ''Only equipment deemed in excess of operational needs by the Department of Defense would be provided to foreign countries, including Northern Distribution Network host nations in Central Asia,'' the statement said, referring to the name of the northern supply lines into Afghanistan.
Delighted with that possibility, the Uzbeks have been broadening the scope of their demands, said a senior American official directly involved in the diplomacy of the Afghan logistical routes, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the delicate negotiations.
The requests have gone from relatively common items like night-vision goggles to large and expensive American-made goods like MRAP vehicles, the 14-ton armored utility trucks that help protect troops from roadside bombs.
Other items that the Uzbeks have eyed in the American arsenal in Afghanistan are small arms, mine detectors, navigation equipment and possibly drones, according to Der Spiegel, the German newsmagazine, suggesting that the Uzbeks are looking at the pullout next year as a sort of everything-must-go moment for military shopping.
The government is trying to broaden its scope beyond Russian military equipment standards, lest Uzbekistan be beholden to Moscow in regional conflicts over water rights or border enclaves with its neighbors.
In December, Uzbekistan pulled out of Russia's regional security bloc, the Collective Security Treaty Organization, as it stepped up its requests for Western weapons. Russia responded by offering a $1 billion arms deal to Kyrgyzstan.
Against the backdrop of its dispute with Moscow, the Uzbek government is said to have quietly conveyed its requests for military surplus to officials from NATO countries.
After years of watching helicopters fly in and out of Termez airfield, which is used as a German base in Uzbekistan, the government in March told Germany's defense minister, Thomas de Maizière, who was visiting, that it would not mind getting its hands on a few of them, the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported.
A British delegation passed through in July. On the diplomatic agenda between the two countries, according to Craig Murray, a former British ambassador to Uzbekistan and now a critic of British policy in the region, is the handover of used Land Rovers or other military vehicles as partial payment for shipping out other items.
Such talks have alarmed members of the German Parliament, who requested clarification from their government.
''Either the Uzbeks want money, and quite a lot, or they want weapons,'' Viola von Cramon, a member of Parliament, said in a telephone interview. ''What I've heard from informed sources is they are not interested in civil assistance, or anything progressive like university exchanges. It's really hard in that respect. They really prefer the military sector.''
Human rights groups harbor apprehensions at the thought of a second life for Western military hardware in Uzbekistan.
''Uzbekistan has one of the most abysmal and atrocious records of any of the countries we work on here at Human Rights Watch, which is well over 100 countries,'' Steve Swerdlow, the group's Central Asia researcher, who was expelled from Uzbekistan in 2010, said in a telephone interview.
In one horrific episode, the Uzbek military fired on protesters in a public square in Andijon in 2005, killing as many as 745 people, according to an opposition party. And the nation's economy depends heavily on the forced labor of children and adults in cotton fields.
While Western militaries still deal with Uzbekistan, more than 100 apparel brands, including H & M, Gap and Walmart, have signed a pledge not to buy Uzbek cotton.

HEADLINE: Bias in Job Networks

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''In Hiring, a Friend in Need Is a Prospect, Indeed'' (front page, Jan. 28) reports that companies depend increasingly on employees to recommend friends and contacts to fill jobs. Employers should think twice. 
Hiring programs that rely on word-of-mouth recruiting, also known as ''good old boy'' networks, have a long and ugly history of discriminating against African-Americans -- and they still do.
Employees usually refer candidates of the same race, disadvantaging groups that suffer from disproportionate unemployment or underemployment. Despite signs of economic recovery, African-Americans remain unemployed at a staggering rate of 14 percent, compared with the general rate of 7.8 percent.
African-American applicants risk being shut out of opportunities to compete for high-paying, high-prestige jobs, like those described in the article, because they often do not have personal contacts in those positions to recommend them. Employers should ensure that internal referrals do not eclipse other recruiting methods that draw from a diverse pool of candidates.

Museums
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Life, Death and Transformation in the Americas' (continuing) For generations, one of the first things visitors to Brooklyn Museum encountered was the Hall of the Americas, the two-story rotunda right off the main lobby. And when you were in it, you knew you were home. A few years ago during renovations, the museum put the Americas material in storage, but now it's back in new galleries on the fifth floor. The look is very different -- ultraminimalist Arctic white and sky blue -- but the 102 objects, from a collection that is a jewel in Brooklyn's crown, are utterly gripping. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter) 
Brooklyn Museum: 'Go: a community-curated open studio project' (through Feb. 24) Inspired by ArtPrize, an art competition in Grand Rapids, Mich., that awards money to artists based on votes by the public, and by local open-studios programs, the Brooklyn Museum created a contest in which the award was a spot in this exhibition. More than 1,800 artists registered with the museum; visitors went out to their studios and voted; and the Top 10 artists were whittled down to 5 by Brooklyn Museum curators. The results are less than stellar. ''Go'' has not unearthed any hidden masters of the borough, but it does raise questions about who should choose what appears in museums and what constitutes ''great'' art. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Materializing ''Six Years'': Lucy R. Lippard and the Emergence of Conceptual Art' (through Feb. 17) This big, intellectually enthralling exhibition of Conceptual works from the 1960s and early '70s is not a conventional museum period survey. Rather, it approximates how the rise of Conceptualism was seen while it was happening by one person: the curator, critic and writer Lucy R. Lippard, who was an extraordinarily energetic participant in and promoter of a trend that brought us the triumph of mind over matter in art. Anyone who wants art to be radically defiant of the market-driven system must see it. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'African Art, New York, and the Avant-Garde' (through Sept. 2) Timed to the centennial of the Armory Show of 1913, this exhibition tells the story of African art's debut in cutting-edge New York museums and galleries with exceptional candor. It makes clear that early-20th-century Americans received Modern art and African art as a single import, derived from French and Belgian colonies, distilled in Paris and presented on these shores by a few tastemaking dealers and collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'George Bellows' (through Feb. 18) Organized by the National Gallery in Washington, this exhibition starts strong with the lush early paintings of New York City and its residents for which Bellows is justifiably well known. It then devotes more than half its space to a disorganized reprise of his restless but steady artistic decline, which ended with his death in 1925 at 42 from a ruptured appendix. It does little to clarify his achievement, partly because of the short shrift given to his plein air oil studies and late landscape paintings. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Matisse: In Search of True Painting' (through March 17) This stunning exhibition skims across the great French modernist's long, productive career with a mere 49 stellar, often pivotal paintings arranged in pairs or groups according to subject. Examining his penchant for working in series and copying his own canvases, they shed new light on the arduous evolution of Matisse's seemingly effortless art, forming one of the most thrillingly instructive exhibitions about the artist, or painting in general, that you may ever see. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Path of Nature: French Paintings from the Wheelock Whitney Collection, 1785-1850' (through April 21) ''Sparkle with repose'' was the effect the British artist John Constable said he was after in his landscapes. His French contemporaries had the same idea. Today, Constable's a star. But León Pallière? Adrien Dauzats? Alexandre-Hyacinthe Dunouy? Only wonkish scholars are likely to know their names. Lucky for them, and for us, that one of those scholars is Whitney Wheelock III, who has a passion for French art from the years between neo-classicism and Romanticism, and a special love for gleaming little oil sketches done out of doors. In 2003 he gave his pictures to the Met, where 50 of them, along with some exquisitely funky genre paintings, make up this small gem of a show. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; MoMA PS1: 'Huma Bhabha: Unnatural Histories' (through April 1) In this midcareer survey, long-enduring forms from the ancient world lend some gravity to the throwaway materials that are now commonplace in contemporary sculpture. You could also say that the precariousness of recent assemblage and installation art haunts Ms. Bhabha's monstrous, totemic figures, which are typically made of Styrofoam, clay, rubber, wood scraps and wire mesh; either way, the juxtaposition is arresting. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, momaps1.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; MoMA PS1: 'Thomas Lanigan-Schmidt: Tender Love Among the Junk' (through April 1) Mr. Lanigan-Schmidt makes luminous art out of trash: candy wrappers, cling wrap, reflective plastics, aluminum foil, plastic bottles, beer cans and too many other kinds of cheap refuse to list. As this four-decade retrospective reveals, his devotion to his materials and hobbylike processes has yielded an oeuvre of transcending beauty, eroticized religiosity and poignant autobiography. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, momaps1.org. (Johnson)
MoMA PS1: 'Now Dig This! Art & Black Los Angeles 1960-1980' (through March 11) This exhibition of works by black artists who lived and worked in Los Angeles during a time of revolutionary changes happening in art and society had its debut at the Hammer Museum last year as part of the citywide extravaganza ''Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A. 1945-1980.'' Focusing mainly on assemblage, the show includes pieces by Melvin Edwards, Betye Saar, David Hammons and nearly 30 others. It contributes a valuable chapter to the American art history of the last 50 years. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Morgan Library & Museum: 'Drawing Surrealism' (through April 21) This sensational show of 165 works by 70 artists from 15 countries traces the movement from its early automatist stirrings to the doorstep of Abstract Expressionism. Expanding the field of players with numerous new names, it also has a wonderful clarity, organized according to the techniques that the Surrealists commandeered (collage and photography), breathed life into (frottage, decalcomania and exquisite corpse) and frequently crossbred. It may be among the best encapsulations of Surrealism you will ever see. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Arts and Design: 'Doris Duke's Shangri La: Architecture, Landscape and Islamic Art' (through Feb. 17) The Honolulu estate known as Shangri La is a masterpiece of refined eclecticism. Doris Duke, the owner, referred to it as a ''Spanish-Moorish-Persian-Indian complex.'' Whatever you call it, it looks magnificent in this show and the accompanying book. Both combine sparkling new color shots of the home and gardens taken by Tim Street-Porter; architectural documents and vintage photographs; pieces of the collection; and projects by contemporary artists who had residencies at Shangri La (which has served, since Duke's death in 1993, as the Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art). 2 Columbus Circle, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Artist's Choice: Trisha Donnelly' (through April 8) The 10th artist invited to select an exhibition from the Modern's collection does the series proud. Installed in three far-flung galleries within the museum's vaunted painting and sculpture collection, her effort disturbs the march of masterworks by concentrating on photographs, drawings and other works on paper as well as several kinds of design. At every turn it asks what is art, who is an artist and what makes for greatness? (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Inventing Abstraction: 1910-1925' (through April 15) The pursuit of the holy grail of early modernism at its most feverish is presented as a multiple-medium, multinational effort in this dizzying, magisterial cornucopia. The 350-plus works by 84 artists encompass painting, sculpture, music, poetry, dance, film and photography; alternate between the tentative and the prescient; and capture something of both the terrors and thrills of the project, with clusters of paintings by Kazimir Malevich and Piet Mondrian among the high points. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Edvard Munch: The Scream' (through April 29) A version of Edvard Munch's ''Scream'' is on view at this museum for the next six months, having come almost straight from the auction block. Protected by a Plexiglas box, like the Mona Lisa, it has been given a prominent perch opposite van Gogh's ''Starry Night'' in the fifth-floor painting and sculpture galleries. There is talk of timed tickets. But if you can put up with all the pageantry, you'll have a rare chance to get acquainted with ''The Scream'' in person and in context. The museum has built a mini-exhibition around the work, surrounding it with Munch paintings and prints that amplify its motifs and mood. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Projects 99: Meiro Koizumi' (through May 6) It would be hard to find another work of contemporary art that protests war with such soulful grace as Meiro Koizumi's ''Defect in Vision'' (2011), the main attraction of this small show. This 12-minute, black-and-white video dramatizes a final conversation between a kamikaze pilot and his wife, both of whom are blind, as they eat together in a small, old-world-style dining room. It is a riveting meditation on the doomed, myth-saturated mind of Japan's warrior class in the last days of World War II. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Tokyo 1955-1970: A New Avant-Garde' (through Feb. 25) Modernist art, insurgent and utopian, ignited like a firecracker cluster in cities across the globe in the early 20th century, and Tokyo was one of them. Rising from the ashes after World War II, it produced huge amounts of new art, feisty, fantastic, often politically subversive. And a wave of it comes surging out at you like a blast of sound -- half noise, half music -- in this surprising exhibition made up of loans from Japan and little-seen material from MoMA's collection. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Performing Histories (1)' (through Aug. 5) An awareness of the uprisings, protests, occupations and revolutions erupting around the globe is present in ''Performing Histories (1),'' a show of video, film and photographic work recently acquired by MoMA. Insurrection and resistance pervade the Romanian artist Ion Grigorescu's film ''Dialogue With Ceausescu'' (1978), while the feminist personal as political is employed in Martha Rosler's ''She Sees in Herself a New Woman Every Day'' (1976) and Sharon Hayes's four-channel video ''The Interpreter Project'' (2001). Andrea Fraser's two videos connect politics and the museum. In one she describes how scientific philanthropy in the 19th century directed wealth to museums and other public institutions rather than the poor, while another video delves into how MoMA itself interacted with revolutionaries and communists, like the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Schwendener)
New-York Historical Society: 'John Rogers: American Stories' (through Feb. 18) The sculptor John Rogers (1829-1904) was the Norman Rockwell of his time. For a few decades following the Civil War, his lively, anecdotal, figurative tableaus known as Rogers Groups sold by the tens of thousands to middle- and upper-middle-class folks for about $15 apiece. Including examples of the technically impressive bronze masters from which the multiples were cast in plaster, this exhibition showcases an artist who was as remarkable for his entrepreneurial savvy as for his idealistic vision of life in America. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Rubin Museum of Art: 'Radical Terrain' (through April 29) The third and last of three beautifully produced, back-to-back mini-surveys in the series Modernist Art From India, this exhibition combines landscape painting done in India in the years following independence in 1947 with recent work by young artists -- some South Asian, most not -- that corresponds to or comments on the older art. Small in size and unfamiliar in content, the show is large with history. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; South Street Seaport Museum: 'Compass: Folk Art in Four Directions' (through March 31) The American Folk Art Museum presents some 200 works from its unparalleled collection in this beautifully orchestrated exhibition. Paintings, sculpture, textiles, scrimshaw, painted furniture and much, much more are arrayed along themes that reflect the history of Lower Manhattan -- seafaring, commerce, social life and that all-important factor, the weather -- but not too tightly. Poetic license is taken, yielding an intricate constellation of connected artworks, histories and concerns that highlights one of the city's great treasures. 12 Fulton Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 748-8600, southstreetseaportmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Fore' (through March 10) In 2001 the Studio Museum in Harlem opened a dynamite group exhibition called ''Freestyle,'' which turned out to be the first in a series of shows introducing emerging artists of African-American descent. In the latest edition, ''Fore,'' organized by three young staff curators, Lauren Haynes, Naima J. Keith and Thomas J. Lax, covers the waterfront in terms of media, which it samples and mixes with turntablist flair, and in its contents, ranging from abstract to personal to political, sometimes combining all three. Firelei Báez, Sadie Barnette, Crystal Z. Campbell, Zachary Fabri, Yashua Klos, Akosua Adoma Owusu, Valerie Piraino and Nikki Pressley are some of the names to look for. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Sinister Pop' and 'Dark and Deadpan: Pop in TV and the Movies' (through March 31) The dark and truculent mood of this collection show is conversant with recent presentations of Warhol's death-and-disaster paintings, but the curators make plenty of room for other artists (including photographers). The point is not to cast a pall over Pop as we know it; it's to find common ground between the winking consumerism of early-1960s art and the antiwar, anti-corporate sentiment of work made later in the decade and into the 1970s.

&#x2605; 'Calder: The Complete Bronzes' (through Feb. 9) The ingenious master of spare, levitating modern sculpture in wire, wood and sheet metal turns out to have been almost as adept with the ancient dead-weight staple of bronze, as demonstrated by 35 examples and some dozen plaster models in this eye-opening show. They run the gamut from figurative to abstract; dabble in Surrealism; achieve their own kind of levitation; and delve into art history while enabling the artist to use his hands and amazing tactile sense in a different way.

Paul Laffoley: 'The Boston Visionary Cell' (through March 9) Judging by his mandala-type compositions on usually square canvases, Mr. Laffoley has yet to encounter a system of mystical thought he could not absorb into his own project. Profusely annotated with press-on vinyl letters, his works refer to a dizzying array of mental adventurers from Socrates to the Theosophist charlatan Madame Blavatsky. This show is an excellent introduction to one of the most unusual creative minds of our time. Kent Fine Art, 210 West 11th Avenue, between 24th and 25th Streets, (212) 365-9500, kentfineart.net. (Johnson)
Daniel Buren: 'Electricity, paper, vinyl ...' (through Feb. 16) This well-known French Conceptualist, who reduced painting to awning stripes printed on canvas or paper, has probably eked more mileage out of this end-of-painting motif than anyone should rightly expect. In the better of two concurrent solo shows nearly around the corner from each other, he tailors earlier pieces to the gallery's architecture, creating what are in effect intermittent expanses of wallpaper that alter our sense of a space and create a nice graphic, even decorative punch. Friedrich Petzel Gallery, 456 West 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 680-9467, petzel.com. (Smith)
Daniel Buren: 'Electricity Fabric Paint Paper Vinyl' (through Feb. 16) Here, the French artist Daniel Buren adds several new twists to his signature awning-striped canvas, including sheets of Plexiglas, luminescence and glowing strands of fiber optics. In addition to being arbitrary, conventional art-objects, the results conjure the early-1960s efforts of artists like Frank Stella and Robert Mangold. These pieces might as well be derivative student works that Mr. Buren abandoned to make the site-specific pieces for which he is known.

&#x2605; 'Distance and Desire: Encounters with the African Archive (Part II: Contemporary Reconfigurations)' (through March 9) Africa is an unstinting source of new photography, of which New York would see little were it not for a few commercial galleries and the Walther Collection. Last fall the Walther, a German foundation with a project space in Chelsea, initiated a series of three consecutive exhibitions under the umbrella title ''Distance and Desire: Encounters With the African Archive.'' The first show included European ethnographic photography. The current one illustrates how much a product of invention and fantasy ethnography can be.

&#x2605; 'Gaylen Gerber' (through Feb. 9) Starting from a gray-painted floor that coincidentally matches the gray-paper installation lining a small back room, Gaylen Gerber's latest New York appearance forms a modest, weirdly perfect entity, as well as a meditation on the monochrome. The monochromes are mostly appropriated artworks and artifacts meticulously painted white, gray or brown that also succinctly and insouciantly extend other 20th-century artistic conventions like the ready-made, appropriation, collaboration and homage as a form of (gentle) transgression. The ensemble bends both mind and eye. Wallspace, 619 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 594-9478, wallspacegallery.com. (Smith)
Maria Loboda: 'General Electric' (through Feb. 16) The small, isolated works here, by an artist who contributed a ''moving forest'' to last summer's Documenta festival, find natural forces resisting our attempts to tame or harness them. In photographs, traditional English gardens, with their rows of conical shrubberies, are set against marbled backgrounds. More intriguing are the tree branches and clumps of selenite (a mineral found in the desert) that hang from points along the ceiling, and a series of blackened steel bars that define the edges of the gallery. Andrew Kreps, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 741-8849, andrewkreps.com. (Rosenberg)
John A. Parks: 'Paint and Memory' (through Feb. 16) The strange, seemingly innocent paintings that dominate this show are small, based on the artist's childhood memories and painted with his fingers. The loosely Pointillist, somewhat Vuillardian hazes of color, light and form that result demarcate trees, gardens, brick buildings, puffy clouds and, above all, scrambling children, whose feral energy and natural subversiveness are vividly conveyed. The distinction between illustration and painting is rendered moot by the teeming quality of both surface and subject. 532 Gallery Thomas Jaeckel, 532 West 25th Street, (917) 701-3338, 532gallery.com. (Smith)
Jacolby Satterwhite: 'The Matriarch's Rhapsody' (through Feb. 16) Mr. Satterwhite's eight-minute video ''Reifying Desire 5,'' the main attraction of his first solo show in New York, is a hallucinogenic tossed salad of different kinds of animation. In a silver jump suit, Mr. Satterwhite dances athletically through a vertiginous flux of glimmering abstract and representational imagery, including offbeat texts -- rendered like rubbery neon signs -- from drawings by his mother.

Alexandre Singh: 'The Pledge' (through March 13) One of the first projects done in the United States by the French-born, British-raised artist Alexandre Singh was a sprawling, delirious collaboration with Jonah Freeman and Justin Lowe titled ''Hello Meth Lab in the Sun,'' installed at the Ballroom Marfa in Texas. Mr. Singh's solo exhibition at the Drawing Center is another full-gallery, somewhat psychedelic installation, albeit a considerably more subdued one. Black-and-white inkjet prints of collages that Mr. Singh made in response to interviews with artists and scientists are arranged like maps and schematics on the gallery's walls. It's a sleek display, vibrating with art historical references. But despite the high-tone interview subjects and visual references the show is unsparingly vapid, about as exciting as paging through a design magazine. 35 Wooster Street, Soho, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org.

'Beat Memories: The Photographs of Allen Ginsberg' (through April 6) During two periods in his life -- from the early 1950s to about 1964 and from the early '80s until his death in 1997 -- the poet Allen Ginsberg made photographs and added handwritten captions. Images of his now famous pals, including the writers Jack Kerouac, William Burroughs and Gregory Corso, as well as Neal Cassady, their logorrheic muse, make this show required viewing for Beat fans. (A panel of scholars will discuss Ginsberg's work in photography, film and sound on Thursday at 6:30 p.m.) Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart. (Johnson)
Nathaniel Robinson: 'Outer Air' (through Feb. 9) Mr. Robinson's transporting, walk-in poem of an installation revolves around a watering hole for animals, whose simulated feces are scattered about, on an urban rooftop covered by asphalt paper. Its themes regarding nature, culture and consciousness may be heavy, but Mr. Robinson's deft way with metaphor, which calls to mind the early Robert Gober, keeps things light and fresh.

&#x2605; Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych' (ongoing) This little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism was begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 610-9700, germany.info.

&#x2605; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden: 'Ai Weiwei: According to What?' (through Feb. 24) As seen in its first American survey, the work of the lionhearted Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, is no match for his prominent role as a human rights advocate. The sculptures and installation pieces too often adhere to the fashionable international genre of handsome, Conceptually generated artworks. Explanatory labels do much of the heavy lifting, along with historically-charged materials and objects, like Chinese antique furniture and wood from destroyed Qing dynasty temples. The artist's photographs and videos suggest that his documentary work may be best.

&#x2605; Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art: 'Oh, Canada' (through April 8) Seesawing between bigness and intimacy, the personal and the communal, this 62-artist survey of contemporary art in the Great White North may tell you more about Canada's identity crisis than it does about Canadian art. A sense of place, if not nationhood, does emerge in stark photographs of Newfoundland by Ned Pratt and Kim Morgan's hanging latex cast of a lighthouse on Prince Edward Island. Elsewhere, cartoonlike pencil drawings by Annie Pootoogook and Shuvinai Ashoona depict contemporary Inuit life and the artist Amalie Atkins stars in a prairie fairy tale involving musical wolves and bears with golden teeth. 87 Marshall Street, North Adams, (413) 662-2111, massmoca.org. (Rosenberg)
Smithsonian American Art Museum: 'The Civil War and American Art' (through April 28) On the surface, this probing, perspective-altering exhibition, one of many events commemorating the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, looks straightforward, even ordinary. We know most of the paintings and photographs on sight; they're classics. What we know less well is their meaning within the context of the nation's single greatest internal catastrophe, and that's what the show is about. It travels to the Metropolitan Museum of Art this spring, running from May 21 to Sept. 2. Eighth and F Streets NW, Washington, (202) 633-7970, americanart.si.edu. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Smithsonian American Art Museum: 'Nam June Paik: Global Visionary' (through Aug. 11) Including a large and fascinating trove of material from the Nam June Paik archive, acquired by the Smithsonian from the artist's estate in 2009, this survey of the avant-garde musician, multimedia wizard and video art pioneer (1932-2006) looks startlingly current despite the preponderance of analog televisions and other obsolete hardware. It makes clear that contemporary artists like Christian Marclay, Jon Kessler, Cory Arcangel, Ryan Trecartin and Haroon Mirza owe a great deal to Mr. Paik's tweaked TV sets and frenetic, technically innovative videos. Eighth and F Streets NW, Washington, (202) 633-1000, americanart.si.edu. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Yale University Art Gallery (continuing) In a museum era dominated by vying forces of bad economics and compulsive building, it's a miracle when something comes out right, which makes the opening of the splendidly renovated and expanded Yale University Art Gallery a happy event. The angels of art, design and budgetary planning were on duty. Everything worked. The country's oldest university art museum has arrived at a kind institutional ideal of opposites in balance: an encyclopedic teaching museum, big enough to get lost in, small enough for intimate art encounters. New galleries of Indo-Pacific art are a particular attraction, but so are other collections, including one of the countries premier holdings in American art and a small, matchless display of very early Italian Renaissance painting. A special exhibition, ''Societe Anonyme: Modernism for America,'' made up of Yale-owned material, is on view through July 14. 1111 Chapel Street, New Haven, (203) 432-0600, artgallery.yale.edu.

&#x2605; 'Anything Can Substitute Art: Maciunas in SoHo' (closes on Saturday) Decades before there was Occupy, there was the artist George Maciunas (1931-78). Born in Lithuania, he came to New York City in the late 1940s, graduated from Cooper Union in 1952 with a multitasking degree in art, graphic design and architecture. Inspired by Dada and Zen Buddhism, he helped conceive the giant nebula of international collective activity known as Fluxus, which was to propose a new kind of art that was open to everyone and that was a sly send-up of corporate culture. The archival show beautifully catches his anarchist-existentialist spirit. 41 Cooper Union Gallery, 41 Cooper Square, East Village, (212) 353-4100, cooper.edu. (Cotter)
'Cellblock I' and 'Cellblock II' (closes on Saturday) This pair of strenuously cerebral group shows, both organized by the scholar Robert Hobbs, envision the artwork as a kind of prison (formalist and otherwise). ''Cellblock I,'' in the main gallery, includes large paintings by Peter Halley, plans for underground mazes by Alice Aycock, works from Robert Motherwell's ''Open'' series and Kelley Walker's canvases printed with images of brick walls. The livelier ''Cellblock II,'' in the gallery's new project space down the street, gathers smaller works by some of the same artists in ''Cellblock I,'' along with others like Robert Morris, Bruce Nauman and Nancy Holt.

'Forget About the Sweetbreads' (closes on Sunday) A loose interpretation of this spirited group show's title (borrowed from Bill Cosby) might be ''Let's not get too refined here.'' The painter Joanne Greenbaum and Adrianne Rubenstein, the gallery's associate director, have picked seven artists who range in age from their 30s (the painter Ellen Gronemeyer) to their 80s (the painter-turned-ceramist Alice Mackler). The selections stress color, robustly manipulated materials (paint, clay, plywood) and humor (expect clown faces). A welcome change from the grisaille seriousness of much contemporary art.

Master Drawings New York 2013 (through Saturday) This annual weeklong confab of dealers in fine, often quite old drawings is in its final two days. Ensconced in galleries from East 64th to East 81st Streets are local, visiting and normally private dealers who are displaying works that cover quite a bit of the medium's history, especially in Europe. You can chart your path on a helpful map available on the organization's Web site and the odds are great that you will see plenty to love, and learn something too.

Morgan Library & Museum: 'Fantasy and Invention: Rosso Fiorentino and Sixteenth-Century Florentine Drawing' (closes on Sunday) With just under 30 works -- including an unfinished Rosso painting on loan from the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, a Rosso drawing from the Metropolitan Museum and a smattering of drawings and letters by other Italian masters in the Morgan's collection -- this exhibition is a fine little introduction to the eccentricities of Florentine Mannerism and to one of the style's quirkiest practitioners, who was lauded by Vasari as ''bold and well grounded in draftsmanship, graceful in manner, sublime in the highest flights of the imagination.'' 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'New Photography 2012' (closes on Monday) In her pellucid photographs, Anne Collier contemplates old record covers and an Edward Weston photograph in an old MoMA date book. In montages by Michele Abeles we see the bodies of naked men through spaces between grids and stripes cut from other printed materials. Shirana Shahbazi's abstractions picture alluring colors and light of photography itself. Zoe Crosher recycles amateur snapshots by a woman who worked as an escort in the 1960s, '70s and '80s.

&#x2605; 'Rooms of Wonder: From Wunderkammer to Museum, 1599-1899' (closes on Saturday) The propulsive force of human curiosity is captured in this lavish repast of rare illustrated books and ephemera. They examine the history of wunderkammers, or cabinets of curiosity -- those hodgepodge collections of strange and beautiful objects both natural and manufactured -- that apothecaries, scholars and the odd nobleman or king began to amass in the 16th-century and vividly trace their evolution into all sorts of contemporary museums, including art, natural history, medicine and wax.

Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Richard Artschwager!' (closes on Sunday) Mr. Artschwager had his first career retrospective at the Whitney Museum in 1988, and now at 88 he is having his second. Much of the work -- the furniturelike sculptures covered with wood-grain Formica and the paintings that appeared to be done with smudged soot -- is familiar. His recent portraits of George W. Bush and Osama bin Laden and his high-color landscapes of the American Southwest are not. An installation of his famous ''blps'' (pronounced blips), abstract lozenge forms, usually black and shaped like the uprights in an exclamation point, is in place on and around the High Line near the site of the Whitney's future home at Gansevoort and Washington Streets. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)
Winter Antiques Show (closes on Sunday) Entering the 59th Winter Antiques Show is like time-tripping back to the Gilded Age. Front and center is a loan exhibition, ''Newport: The Glamour of Ornament,'' which consists of art from eight Newport homes; it has been installed in an elaborate pavilion modeled on the Breakers, a Vanderbilt residence. But the fair's 73 exhibitors offer much beyond the gilded mirrors, grandfather clocks and crystal chandeliers favored by Newport's ''summer cottagers.'' Here you can find Japanese scrolls, medieval French books of hours, Chinese porcelain, Roman mosaics, Scandinavian ceramics, Italian glassware and a surprising quantity of humble-looking folk art and Americana.

GRAPHIC: PHOTO: MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'TOKYO 1955-1970: A NEW AVANT-GARDE' (through Feb. 25) Modernist art, insurgent and utopian, ignited like a firecracker cluster in cities across the globe in the early 20th century, and Tokyo was one of them. Rising from the ashes after World War II, it produced huge amounts of art, feisty, fantastic, often politically subversive. A wave of it comes surging at you like a blast of sound -- half noise, half music -- in this surprising exhibition, made up of loans from Japan and little-seen material from MoMA. Some of postwar Japan's greatest artists are here, including Hosoe Eiko, whose ''Sickle-Toothed Weasel, No. 5 (Kamaitachi sakuhin 5),'' above, is on display. (212) 708-9400, moma.org.

HEADLINE: Battling Big Beer

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED; Peter Lattman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
8:57 p.m. | Updated
For more than a decade, the world's biggest brewers have been swallowing competitor after competitor as they grapple with slowing growth in many markets. Now, the Obama administration wants to cut them off.
The Justice Department on Thursday sued to block Anheuser-Busch InBev's $20.1 billion deal to buy Grupo Modelo, the Mexican maker of Corona beer, saying that the merger would cement Anheuser-Busch InBev's control of the market and enable it to continue to raise beer prices. Grupo Modelo is the third-biggest beer company in the United States. 
"This is the sort of product that matters to consumers," William J. Baer, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, said in a conference call with reporters. "If you have a very slight price increase that happens because of this deal, it could mean that consumers will pay billions of dollars more."
The lawsuit is the first major roadblock in a decade of consolidation by brewers around the world, which has reduced the industry to only a few major players, primarily multinationals that own a majority of big brands.
At the top worldwide is Anheuser-Busch InBev, itself the product of a 2008 merger between a St. Louis-based icon and a Belgian-Brazilian brewing juggernaut. To compensate for slow growth in developed economies like the United States, the company has been seeking significant footholds in emerging markets like Mexico.
Since the middle of 2008, the brewer has announced more than 15 takeovers, according to Capital IQ.
The government's lawsuit details how in California, a price war among the biggest brewers had led Anheuser to complain in internal documents that Modelo's strategy was "eating [Budweiser's] lunch." According to the suit, a sales executive said that "California is a burning platform" for Anheuser.
With the lawsuit, the Justice Department is again flexing its aggressive antitrust muscle. It is the biggest deal to be opposed since 2011, when the government sued to stop AT&T's proposed $39 billion takeover of T-Mobile USA. (Those companies abandoned the deal.)
The antitrust action is in an industry that previous administrations had allowed waves of consolidation. Anheuser-Busch InBev; the acquisitive SABMiller, which is one of MillerCoors's parents; and Grupo Modelo have 72 percent of the $80 billion American beer market, giving them enormous power over pricing.
Despite the explosion of smaller breweries in recent years, industry analysts say that the craft beer market makes up just 6 percent of beer sales.
The biggest in the market, Anheuser - brewer of Budweiser and Stella Artois - has raised its prices with regularity every year, with MillerCoors following suit, the Justice Department said.
"Even small price increases could lead to significant harm," Mr. Baer said.
Like AT&T, which ferociously battled the government's case for months, Anheuser-Busch InBev has promised a fight. In a statement, the company said, "We remain confident in our position, and we intend to vigorously contest the D.O.J.'s action in federal court."
Yet behind the scenes, the two sides will continue to try to reach a settlement.
Analysts were divided over how significant a hurdle the lawsuit posed. In a research note on Thursday, analysts at UBS wrote that the case wasn't a "deal breaker," expecting Anheuser to give up what they called "reasonable" concessions.
Anheuser has long pursued the benefits of consolidation, including opportunities to cut costs. Last summer, the company agreed to buy the 50 percent that it did not already own in Modelo, a deal that would give it full control of Corona, the United States' top imported beer brand.
"In this case, there are pretty significant synergies," said Harry Schuhmacher, the editor of Beer Business Daily. "Anheuser can afford to overpay for Modelo and is eager to."
He added that he believed the Modelo deal was the end of beer deals for a long time, especially among the beer giants. Some consolidation could still be in store among smaller companies.
The Justice Department's lawsuit is the first prominent antitrust action on the watch of Mr. Baer, who took over as President Obama's top antitrust lawyer at the beginning of the year. Mr. Baer, who previously worked at the Federal Trade Commission and in private practice at the law firm Arnold & Porter, is the first permanent antitrust chief since August 2011, when Christine A. Varney stepped down.
Ms. Varney left the government to join Cravath, Swaine & Moore, where she is now leading Modelo's antitrust defense.
The Justice Department contends that taking over full control of Modelo would give Anheuser overwhelming control both nationally and in markets like California, Texas and New York.
Mindful of potential antitrust issues, Anheuser has proposed selling Modelo's 50 percent stake in Crown Imports, the main importer of Corona in the United States, to Constellation Brands for nearly $1.9 billion. Anheuser has said that Crown is what dictates the prices of Modelo products, and that selling the stake removes any say that it would have in the matter.
But the Justice Department called that offer a "facade," arguing that Crown's dependence on Modelo products makes it effectively subject to Anheuser's wishes. The government's lawsuit highlighted an internal e-mail from Crown's chief executive, Bill Hackett, to employees that read, "Our #1 competitor will now be our supplier."
Since the Modelo deal's announcement last June, consumer advocacy groups have called for government intervention.
"Obviously, beer is different from most other goods and services because there are significant public health issues relating to alcohol," said Sandeep Vaheesan, special counsel at the American Antitrust Institute, a nonprofit group that supports stronger enforcement of the antitrust laws. "But an antitrust analysis looks strictly at promoting competitive prices, product innovation and consumer choice, and this deal thwarts those objectives."
Thursday's lawsuit is the most prominent setback in the deal-making career of Carlos Brito, Anheuser's chief executive. Mr. Brito helped lead the growth of AmBev, a regional Brazilian brewer, into a global giant through a successive series of takeovers.
"I'm not sure if this is the end, but Brito's a guy who's used to getting what he wants," said Lew Bryson, a writer who follows the beer industry. "InBev isn't a company that's growing much organically. It's grown by acquisition."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

WASHINGTON -- Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Thursday that both Iran and Russia continued to provide military support to the Syrian government led by President Bashar al-Assad and that there were indications that Iranian assistance was increasing.
The airstrike that Israel carried out on Wednesday in Syria on an arms convoy that was believed to be en route to Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, and Iran's subsequent warnings that the Israeli attack would lead to ''grave consequences,'' have raised concerns that the conflict is becoming a regional one. 
Mrs. Clinton, who will leave her State Department post on Friday, declined to discuss the Israeli operation.
But she noted that Iran appeared to have stepped up its aid to the Assad government, including the number of military advisers it was sending to Syria and the quality of military equipment it was providing.
''The Iranians have made it clear for some time that keeping Assad in power is one of their highest priorities,'' she said in her final meeting with reporters at the State Department. ''There is a lot of concern that they are increasing the quality of the weapons because Assad is using up his weaponry. So it is numbers and it's matériel.''
Russia's backing for Mr. Assad, she added, remains a worry as well.
''The Russians are not passive bystanders in their support for Assad,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''We have reasons to believe that the Russians continue to supply financial and military assistance in the form of equipment to Assad.'' Mrs. Clinton outlined her vision of diplomacy in a speech on Thursday afternoon at the Council on Foreign Relations here, repeating her themes that economic development and the use of social media were important complements to military force and the other more traditional levers of power.
''We face challenges, from financial contagion to climate change to human and wildlife trafficking, that spill across borders and defy unilateral solutions,'' she said. ''The geometry of global power has become more distributed and diffuse as the challenges we face have become more complex and crosscutting.''
But the immediate problems her successor, John Kerry, the former Massachusetts senator, will face after he is sworn in on Friday involve bitter military conflicts and looming confrontations, including the deteriorating situation in Syria, the diplomatic standoff with Iran over its nuclear program, the turmoil in Egypt and the emergence of affiliates of Al Qaeda in North Africa.
Iran and major powers have yet to settle on a site and date for resuming talks on the Iranian nuclear program.
''I don't think the window can remain open for too much longer,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''I am not going to put days, weeks or months on it.''
Mrs. Clinton said she thought that there was much debate at the highest levels of the Iranian government on ''how to maximize the leverage they have'' in talks over the country's nuclear program, as well as political jockeying with an eye toward Iran's June elections, and that this had led to the delays in fixing a date for resuming negotiations.
As for American concerns about Russia, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is scheduled to fly to Munich this weekend for a security conference and is expected to meet there with the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, on Syria and arms control issues. Mrs. Clinton said she believed that she had made headway with the Russians over the past year in fashioning a plan for a post-Assad transition in Syria. But it quickly emerged that the Russian government had not dropped its support for Mr. Assad.
Despite her complaints over continued Russian support for Mr. Assad, she voiced hope that the Russians would change their position.
Looking back on her years at the State Department, Mrs. Clinton said she had done everything she could to tamp down the Syria conflict by working to organize the Syrian opposition, backing humanitarian assistance and working to isolate Mr. Assad.
''I've done what was possible to do,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
At the same time, she acknowledged that the situation there had the potential to get much worse.
''The worst kind of predictions about what could happen internally, and spilling over the borders of Syria, are certainly within the realm of the possible now,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Congress Passes Debt Bill As a $1 Trillion Ax Looms

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN and ANNIE LOWERY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Senate gave final approval on Thursday to legislation suspending the statutory debt ceiling until May, officially turning Congress's attention to the next budget showdown: $1 trillion in across-the-board military and domestic spending cuts set to begin on March 1.
The 64-to-34 vote ended for now a clash that had threatened the full faith and credit of the United States government. But the next budget fight is just four weeks away. House Republican leaders insist that the across-the-board cuts, known as sequestration, are coming, even as senators in both parties scramble for short- and long-term remedies. 
Senate Democratic leaders hope to present legislation next week at a party retreat that would mix revenues and spending cuts to replace the first three months of indiscriminate cuts while longer-term negotiations continue.
Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, is assembling his own proposal to replace the across-the-board cuts with the elimination of duplicative efforts in the federal government in areas like the promotion of environmentally friendly construction, science and technology education, and work force training.
Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan and chairman of the Armed Services Committee, has drafted more ambitious legislation to raise nearly $200 billion for sequester replacement by closing off a variety of offshore tax shelters, ending preferential tax treatment for many private equity and hedge fund managers, and taxing the exercise of stock options more heavily.
''The fiscal situation is grave enough, the threat of sequestration is so serious in terms of its impact on our domestic priorities and on our security, that I believe that if we can get this in front of the Congress, because it will have huge public support, it will pass,'' Mr. Levin said in an interview.
But even the architects of such efforts are pessimistic that they have time to win passage.
''I think sequester's going to happen,'' Mr. Coburn said. ''I think people want it to happen.''
Yet the economic recovery remains weak, and unemployment high. This week, Washington got one of the first signs of how the sequester might play out in the economy, when government figures showed that the economy had contracted in the final three months of 2012, largely a result of a 22 percent drop in military spending.
Economists cautioned that they did not expect such a precipitous decline to continue in the coming quarters. Moreover, the drop came after a surge in military spending in the third quarter, as offices rushed to spend money obligated to the 2012 fiscal year.
Still, the automatic cuts have the potential to derail the recovery. Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm in St. Louis, estimated that if the sequester came into full effect starting in March, it would knock 0.7 percentage points from economic growth in 2013, dropping it to 1.9 percent. Economists say hundreds of thousands of jobs could be lost, if not more.
With half of the sequester hitting military spending, the worst effects would be felt by the Pentagon and military contractors. Congress already cut half a trillion dollars from military spending in the 2011 Budget Control Act, and the sequester would cut a further half-trillion.
Defense companies have been engaged in an extensive behind-the-scenes effort to sway lawmakers, and they have warned that the cuts might lead to serious job losses, while also threatening the country's security. ''We're sounding a full-throated alarm about this,'' said Marion Blakey, the president of the Aerospace Industries Association, a lobbying group. ''It was never intended to take place. It is terribly bad public policy. And it would have a very negative effect on our economy.''
Concerns about the sequester cast a shadow over corporate earnings season in January. Many businesses said they expected Congress to delay or reduce the cuts, but warned of a bleak outlook if they took full effect. ''While we recognize that both parties are strongly opposed to allowing sequestration to happen, we remain deeply concerned that sequestration could occur as the default outcome if negotiations fail,'' Marillyn A. Hewson, the chief executive of Lockheed Martin, told investors in January. ''Sequestration not only puts at risk our defense industrial base, it also harms military readiness.''
But with just four weeks to go, the search for any replacement for the across-the-board cuts seems to be stumbling out of the gate.
Senator Barbara Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland and chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, said Thursday that she would try to enlist the White House to help stop her own leadership's three-month bill. She wants any legislation to last at least a year.
''I hope the White House is not colluding with the 90-day reprieve,'' she said. ''This is like appeals on death row.''
Mr. Levin's tax bill effectively pits the defense industry against other heavyweights, especially high-tech companies like Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft and Facebook, all of which are singled out by the Levin bill as abusers of the tax code. Dan Stohr, a spokesman for the Aerospace Industries Association, said military contractors were not going to be drawn into that fight.
With the price of failure so high, Mr. Levin and Mr. Coburn said this week that their longstanding quests to cull the tax code of egregious loopholes and cut overlapping government programs could finally succeed. Mr. Levin pointed to two cases in particular. Microsoft develops software in the United States, sells intellectual property rights to subsidiaries in low-tax jurisdictions offshore, then shifts the bulk of its profits from product sales to those tax havens by paying its own subsidiaries royalties. Hewlett-Packard, like many companies, pays no taxes on overseas profits until they are brought back to the United States, but it has been able to keep cash flowing home through a series of tax-free loans from its offshore subsidiaries to its California headquarters.
In testimony in September to Mr. Levin's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard executives said they were following the letter of United States tax law, but also said that the law was putting their companies at a disadvantage with competitors from other countries. Mr. Levin conceded that that argument had been persuasive with colleagues for years, as he sought to tighten tax loopholes.
In lieu of a deal, Republican senators are drafting legislation at least to give agencies the flexibility to make the cuts more selectively, Mr. Coburn said.
''Necessity becomes the mother of invention,'' he said. ''We've got smart people in these agencies. They will do what's most important and least expensive.''

HEADLINE: Wall Street Journal Announces That It Was Hacked by the Chinese, Too

BYLINE: By NICOLE PERLROTH; Michael Gordon contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
One day after The New York Times reported that Chinese hackers had infiltrated its computers and stolen passwords for its employees, The Wall Street Journal announced that it too had been hacked.
On Thursday, The Journal reported that it had been attacked by Chinese hackers who were trying to monitor the company's coverage of China. It said hackers had broken into its network through computers in its Beijing bureau.
In a written statement, the business newspaper owned by News Corporation described the attack as an ''ongoing issue'' and said it was working closely with authorities and security specialists to clean up its systems. It said that it completed a ''network overhaul'' on Thursday in an effort to rid its systems of hackers. 
China's Ministry of National Defense has denied any involvement in the cyberattack at The Times or any other American corporations.
But security experts said that in 2008, Chinese hackers began targeting American news organizations as part of an effort to monitor coverage of Chinese issues.
In a report for clients in December, Mandiant, a computer security company, said that over the course of several investigations it found evidence that Chinese hackers had stolen e-mails, contacts and files from more than 30 journalists and executives at Western news organizations, and had maintained a ''short list'' of journalists for repeated attacks. Among those targeted were journalists who had written about Chinese leaders, political and legal issues in China and the telecom giant Huawei.
Bloomberg News, another American news organization, was targeted by Chinese hackers last year, and some computers were infected, according to a person with knowledge of the company's internal investigation. The attack occurred after Bloomberg published an article on June 29 about the wealth accumulated by relatives of Xi Jinping, a Chinese official who is expected to become president in March.
Bloomberg has confirmed that hackers had made attempts but said that ''no computer systems or computers were compromised.''
The timing of the attacks on The New York Times coincided with the reporting for an investigation, published online on Oct. 25, that found that the relatives of Wen Jiabao, China's prime minister, had accumulated a fortune worth several billion dollars through business dealings.
Security experts hired by The Times to detect and block the computer attacks found digital evidence that Chinese hackers, using methods that some consultants have associated with the Chinese military in the past, breached The Times's network.
The Associated Press reported Thursday that officials in the Obama administration were considering more assertive action against Beijing to stop Chinese computer espionage campaigns.
The Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, said Thursday a global effort was needed o establish ''rules of the road'' for cyber activity. In her final meeting with reporters at the State Department, Mrs. Clinton addressed a question about China's efforts to infiltrate computer systems at The New York Times.
''We have seen over the last years an increase in not only the hacking attempts on government institutions but also non-governmental ones,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
The Chinese, she said, ''are not the only people who are hacking us.''
''There is a lot that we are working on that will be deployed in the event that we don't get some kind of international effort under way,'' Mrs. Clinton added without elaborating.
The United States has been increasingly vocal about such efforts against government and private industry. In a November 2011 intelligence report, government officials specifically accused China and Russia of stealing intellectual property for economic gain.

HEADLINE: Drug Giant Paid to Stop A Generic, Europe Says

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER and KATIE THOMAS; James Kanter reported from Brussels and Katie Thomas from New York.

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- European antitrust officials on Thursday accused the drug giants Johnson & Johnson and Novartis of colluding to delay the availability of a less expensive generic version of a powerful medication often used to ease severe pain in cancer patients.
The case focuses on monthly payments that a Netherlands-based subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson made to Sandoz, a unit of the Swiss company Novartis. While the companies have said the payments were legitimate, the European Union's antitrust chief said on Thursday that the money probably changed hands to keep lower-cost versions of the drug, called fentanyl, off the market in the Netherlands. At issue were transdermal patches that deliver the drug through the skin.
European authorities are ''determined to fight undue delays in the market entry of generic medicines,'' Joaquín Almunia, the European competition commissioner, said in a statement on Thursday. 
Agreements to delay the introduction of generic drugs have come under heightened scrutiny in both Europe and the United States in recent years, with regulators on both sides of the Atlantic concluding that such deals are anticompetitive. In the United States, the Supreme Court is scheduled to take up the issue in March. Typically, such arrangements are a result of patent disputes between brand-name and generic drug makers, although no such dispute was mentioned in the most recent case involving Johnson & Johnson and Novartis.
''From our perspective in the United States, we hope to have a real resolution of this issue with the Supreme Court this term,'' said Jay Lefkowitz, a lawyer who has represented several drug companies in such cases. But because many companies sell their products around the world, ''this is something that people are taking note of, for sure.''
Fentanyl is widely used in Europe and the United States, typically paid for by government-provided health plans or, in many cases in the United States, by private insurance. Although the pricing of such drugs is usually negotiated behind closed doors, generic versions are typically much cheaper.
Mr. Almunia warned pharmaceutical companies against practices that raised costs for European governments, squeezed by austerity and an economic slowdown, which must buy medicines for state-supported health care plans. It is ''important to make sure that pharmaceutical companies do not free-ride our welfare state and health insurance systems, especially in this period of constraints on public spending,'' he said.
A goal of European authorities has been to increase patient access to less costly medicines as name-brand drug patents worth tens of billions of euros expire. The end of a drug's patent protection -- typically after as long as 25 years in Europe -- can hurt a pharmaceutical company's bottom line but benefits governments and private insurers by lowering their costs.
Patent expirations also open opportunities for generic competitors, which is why in some cases drug makers have been accused of paying generic competitors to delay bringing their products to market.
A preliminary investigation by Mr. Almunia's office found that the Johnson & Johnson unit in the Netherlands, Janssen-Cilag, made the payments to stop Novartis from selling generic fentanyl skin patches in the Netherlands for more than a year, from July 2005 until December 2006. That kept prices artificially high, according to the European Commission, the European Union's administrative body that enforces antitrust law. Mr. Almunia's office would not disclose the amount of money that Janssen-Cilag paid to Sandoz, nor would officials indicate whether the investigation would go beyond the Netherlands.
Both companies will have the chance to formally respond to the accusation.
A spokesman for the Johnson & Johnson subsidiary said in a statement that the company had acted properly. ''Janssen continues to believe that these arrangements were legitimate,'' the spokesman, Stefan Gijssels, said on Thursday. ''Janssen supports a sustainable health care system, where patients have access to both innovative and generic drugs,'' he said.
Sandoz said in a statement that it and Novartis ''operate to the highest of standards and take the position of the commission seriously.'' It also indicated that it and Novartis would seek to rebut the accusations made by the commission by using their ''rights of defense as provided for in the process.''
The case is the latest in a series of actions by authorities in Europe and the United States to crack down on so-called pay-to-delay tactics by pharmaceutical companies and comes at a time when the biggest name-brand drug makers are losing billions of dollars in sales to generic competition as best-selling drugs lose their patent protection.
United States regulators have argued for years that such arrangements were anticompetitive. But the pharmaceutical companies have argued that the deals in question were simply legal settlements over patent disputes that helped the companies avoid costly litigation.
The deals typically unfold as part of the peculiar requirements of the federal law governing generic-drug approval, known as the Hatch-Waxman Act. Under that law, generic companies typically seek approval to make a copycat drug before the patent expires because the first company to challenge the patent's validity wins the right to exclusively sell its version for 180 days. The brand-name company often then challenges the generic company's right to make the drug, contending the patent is valid.
In recent years, the companies have tended to settle their litigation by agreeing to let the generic company begin selling the drug before the patent expires -- but not as quickly as the generic company would originally have liked.
Federal regulators say the practice is illegal when it involves a payment from the brand-name company to the generic company to keep a product off the market. But pharmaceutical companies have argued that the settlements actually bring generics to market earlier because the agreements usually allow the generic companies to begin selling their products before the drug's patent would normally have expired.
Michael A. Carrier, an antitrust and patent expert who is a professor at Rutgers School of Law, Camden, said both brand-name and generic drug makers win in such situations because the brand company gets to sell its patented drug for longer without any competition while the generic drug maker receives a generous payment to stay out of the market.
''That's why we've seen these agreements in the U.S., and that's why we've seen these agreements in Europe,'' said Mr. Carrier, who has filed an amicus brief in the Supreme Court case arguing against such deals on behalf of more than 100 law, economics and business professors. ''It's just the consumer that winds up footing the bill.''
Several federal circuit courts have upheld the arrangements. But last July, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia ruled they were anticompetitive. And despite the controversy over the practice, a report released in January by the Federal Trade Commission found that the popularity of these settlements increased significantly in 2012, to 40 deals from 28 in 2011.

HEADLINE: On Immigration, a Campaign-Style Push in Hispanic Media

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: As he makes his case for major immigration changes, President Obama is turning to a forum he used effectively during his two presidential campaigns: the Hispanic media. 

 BODY:
As he makes his case for major immigration changes, President Obama is turning to a forum he used effectively during his two presidential campaigns: the Hispanic media.
In two interviews this week -- one with Univision and another with Telemundo -- Mr. Obama pledged to press Congress to pass a sweeping overhaul of the immigration system before the year's end.
"I am happy to meet with anybody, any time, anywhere to make sure that this thing happens," Mr. Obama said in an interview with José Díaz-Balart on Telemundo. 
In a separate interview with Jorge Ramos and Maria Elena Salinas on Univision, the president said he was not going to "lay down a particular date" by which Congress must act. But he made clear he won't wait too long.
"I want to give them a little bit of room to debate," Mr. Obama said. "If it slips a week, that's one thing. If it starts slipping three months, that's a problem."
Mr. Obama's appearance on the two networks is an extension of his campaign's aggressive outreach to the Hispanic community during the 2012 presidential race. His campaign spent heavily on Spanish-language advertisements to win Hispanic votes. He granted an interview to Telemundo just a week after accepting the nomination in September. 
Getting an immigration overhaul through a reluctant Congress, especially the House, will require Mr. Obama to persuade lawmakers and voters beyond the Hispanic community. His aides are working to build support in rural, white communities where opposition to illegal immigration is strong.
But putting the president in front of a largely Hispanic audience could also help to convince that community that he has made a concerted effort to push through immigration changes, even if the effort gets bogged down in the Congress. Hispanic supporters of the president have expressed deep disappointment that he didn't push for changes in his first term.
The interviews could also help the president respond to lingering anger among many Hispanics that he has moved too aggressively to deport illegal immigrants during his first term. Questions about his deportation policy came up in both interviews.
"You know, when it comes to enforcement of our immigration laws, we've got some discretion," Mr. Obama told Telemundo. "We can prioritize what we do. But we can't simply ignore the law."
The deportation issue was also raised during a "Fireside Chat" that the White House organized on the Internet on Thursday. Cecilia Muñoz, the president's top domestic policy adviser, who is one of the White House officials in charge of the immigration effort, joined in a video chat with Latino and immigrant advocates, seeking to rally groups who will provide support from the ground for Mr. Obama's overhaul.
By invitation from the White House, the chat was moderated by Jose Antonio Vargas, a journalist born in the Philippines who has revealed publicly that he is in this country illegally. Mr. Vargas, who has become an immigrant rights activist, questioned Ms. Muñoz about the high number of deportations during Mr. Obama's first term.
Like the president, Ms. Munoz responded that the administration has no choice but to follow the current law, and said that is part of the motivation for broad immigration changes that would give illegal immigrants a path to citizenship.
The Internet event was unusual in that it had visible participation by an immigrant without legal status in a White House activity. 
But it was further evidence that the White House is eager to reach all parts of the Hispanic community as it campaigns for immigration legislation in Congress. In the interview with Univision, Mr. Obama said he thought the politics of the issue was ripe for success.
"I'm going to keep on pushing as hard as I can," Mr. Obama said, perhaps signaling more conversations with Hispanic supporters in the near future. "I believe that the mood is right."

HEADLINE: Patent Producers Clustered in Only a Few Cities

BYLINE: STEVE LOHR


HIGHLIGHT: A new study by the Brookings Institution shows the high concentration of patented innovation in a relatively small number of metropolitan areas in America. Twenty metro areas -- home to 34 percent of the population -- generate 63 percent of the nation's patents. 

 BODY:
Patents, for all their flaws, are a widely used proxy for innovation. And a new study from the Brookings Institution shows just how clustered patent-related innovation is in America.
That cities are hot beds of creativity of all kinds well known. But the Brookings research details just how concentrated an activity associated with scientific and technological innovation -- patent filings -- really is. There are more than 370 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States. But the people living in just 20 metro areas -- home to 34 percent of the population -- generate 63 percent of the nation's patents. In the five most patent-intensive metro areas, the study found, the average resident is 2.4 times more likely to produce a patented innovation than the average American.
Those five metro areas with the most patent filings per million people, from 2007 to 2011, were: San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, Calif; Burlington-South Burlington, Vt.; Rochester, Minn.; Corvallis, Ore.; and Boulder, Colo. 
(It's easy to see why Silicon Valley is on the list, but the others? The common thread among three of the cities, Burlington, Rochester and Boulder, is universities and I.B.M. Corvallis is also a university town, with a Hewlett-Packard facility.) 
The 49-page report, according to its lead author, Jonathan Rothwell, a senior research associate at Brookings, was an attempt to put a yardstick to the output of innovation, make comparisons and suggest useful policy steps.
One school of thought in regional economic development, Mr. Rothwell observed, has emphasized stimulating consumption by investing in downtown sports stadiums, convention centers and shopping malls -- attractive urban settings to attract people and dollars. That was the path, he said, taken by some central California cities, like Stockton. 
"Those investments proved to be made on a house of sand," Mr. Rothwell said, noting that Stockton declared bankruptcy last year, a financial casualty of the real estate recession.
The prime economic engines, Mr. Rothwell said, are research universities. These university communities are patent-generating powerhouses and large recipients of research funding from the federal government, a resource at risk, Mr, Rothwell observed, with budget cuts in the offing. And companies that receive federal Small Business Innovation Research grants tend to be prolific patenters.
Patent-intensive metro areas, Mr. Rothwell said, enjoy higher incomes, even compared with cities of comparable size and education levels. "San Diego does much better than, say, Atlanta or Houston," he said. One factor, he added, was that the college educated in San Diego were far more likely to have degrees in science, technology, engineering or math than in Atlanta or Houston.
The Brookings report says some critical things to say about sectors of the patent system, notably broad and vague software patents. "The growing popularity of open-source software is something of a rebuke to the patent system," write the authors Mr. Rothwell, Jose Lobo, Deborah Shrumsky and Mark Muro.
But the study points to the trends of increasing research spending per patent, and the rising number of citations and claims in each patent as evidence that the pace of patent activity overall is a good stand-in measure of innovation -- and it is growing.
In an earlier version of this article, a caption misidentified a location in San Jose. It is Santana Row, not Santa Row.

HIGHLIGHT: What can bond vigilantes do if you borrow in your own currency? 

 BODY:
Ah, Paris in the 1920s. It was the era of Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas, sovereign debt and stabilization. Wait, what?
OK, I've written before about the notion that France in the 20s offers the closest thing I can find in the historical record to a crisis of the kind the deficit scolds keep warning us about. We're not at all like Greece; we have our own currency, and our debts are in that currency. So we can't run out of cash, even if the bond vigilantes turn out to be real and lose faith in America. At worst, we're something like France in the 1920s, with its floating exchange rate and large wartime debt -- except that our debt isn't nearly as bad as a share of GDP, and we don't have the lingering gold standard mentality that prevailed across the Western world back then. 
So, what actually happened to 1920s France?
France emerged from World War I with very large debts. Here's a comparison, using the IMF debt database, with the country the deficit scolds use to scare us nowadays:
The striking thing, of course, is the sharp decline in the debt to GDP ratio. How did that happen? Actually, it happened thanks to speculators, who turned on France in 1926, sending the franc sharply lower (yay, FRED has NBER macrohistory data!):
This in turn led to a large rise in prices, eroding the real value of the debt:
So, how did this affect the real French economy? Actually, France grew strongly during the 1920s. It suffered a severe but brief recession associated with the Poincare stabilization of the franc -- largely, I believe, because of the sudden fiscal austerity -- but it didn't last:
Then came the Great Depression, but that's another story.
Now, France was far deeper in debt than we are, and its politics were arguably even more dysfunctional than those of early 21st-century America. Even so, however, French debt didn't cause anything like the kind of apocalypse that deficit scolds routinely promise unless we do what they say. There was no sustained economic downturn -- nothing at all like the hell Greece, Spain, Portugal, and Ireland are going through; and while there was a burst of inflation, there was nothing like Weimar or Zimbabwe either.
I know that the scolds want their apocalypse; they really, really want to believe that unless we do their bidding incredibly terrible things will happen. But the most relevant historical example I can find offers no support at all for their scare-mongering.

HEADLINE: The Origins of 'Big Data': An Etymological Detective Story

BYLINE: STEVE LOHR


HIGHLIGHT: Tracing the origins of the term "Big Data" shows how digital technology is changing the way words and ideas develop and spread, and how they are studied. 

 BODY:
 Words and phrases are fundamental building blocks of language and culture, much as genes and cells are to the biology of life. And words are how we express ideas, so tracing their origin, development and spread is not merely an academic pursuit but a window into a society's intellectual evolution.
Digital technology is changing both how words and ideas are created and proliferate, and how they are studied. Just last month, for example, the Library of Congress said its archive of public Twitter messages has reached 170 billion tweets and rising, by about 500 million tweets a day.
 The Library of Congress archive, resulting from a deal struck with Twitter in 2010, is not yet open to researchers. But the plan is that it soon will be. In a white paper, the Library said that social media promises to be a rich resource that provides "a fuller picture of today's cultural norms, dialogue, trends and events to inform scholarship, the legislative process, new works of authorship, education and other purposes." 
The new digital forms of communication -- Web sites, blog posts, tweets -- are often very different from the traditional sources for the study of words, like books, news articles and academic journals. 
"It's almost like oral language instead of edited text," said Fred R. Shapiro, editor of the "Yale Book of Quotations" and an associate librarian at the Yale Law School. "It's the way of the future."
The unruly digital data of the Web is a big ingredient in what is now being called "Big Data." And as it turns out, the term Big Data seems to be most accurately traced not to references in news or journal archives, but to digital artifacts now posted on technical Web sites, appropriately enough.
To our modest tale of word sleuthing: Last August, I wrote a Sunday columnabout 2012 being the breakout year for Big Data as an idea, in the marketplace, and as a term. 
At the time, I did some reporting on the roots of the term, and I asked Mr. Shapiro of Yale to dig into it. He scoured data bases and came up with several references, including in press releases for product announcements and one intriguing use of the term by a now-famous author (more on that later).
But Mr. Shapiro couldn't find anything as crisp and definitive as he had done for me years earlier when I asked him to try to find the first reference to the word "software" as a computing term. It was in 1958, in an article in "The American Mathematical Monthly," written by John Tukey, a Princeton mathematician.
So, without a conclusive answer, I didn't write about the origins of the term Big Data in that Sunday column. But afterward, I heard from people who had ideas on the subject.
Francis X. Diebold, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania, got in touch and even wrote a paper, with the mildly tongue-in-cheek title, "I Coined the Term 'Big Data' " I had not thought of economics as the breeding ground for the term, but it is not unreasonable. Some of the statistical and algorithmic methods now in the Big Data tool kit trace their heritage to economic modeling and Wall Street. 
Mr. Diebold staked a claim based on his paper, "Big Data Dynamic Factor Models for Macroeconomic Measurement and Forecasting," presented in 2000 and published in 2003. The economic-modeling paper was first academic reference found to Big Data, according to research by Marco Pospiech, a Ph. D. candidate at the Technical University of Freiberg in Germany. 
By then, I had heard from Douglas Laney, an veteran data analyst at Gartner. His said the father of the term Big Data might well be John Mashey, who was the chief scientist at Silicon Graphics in the 1990s. 
I replied to Mr. Diebold that I thought from what I had seen he probably had plenty of competition. And I passed along the e-mail correspondence I had received. Mr. Diebold said thanks much, and added that he had a University of Pennsylvania research librarian looking into it as well.
The term Big Data is so generic that the hunt for its origin was not just an effort to find an early reference to those two words being used together. Instead, the goal was the early use of the term that suggests its present connotation -- that is, not just a lot of data, but different types of data handled in new ways.
The credit, it seemed to me, should go to someone who was aware of the computing context. That is why, in my view, a very intriguing reference, discovered by the Yale researcher Mr. Shapiro, does not qualify. 
In 1989, Erik Larson, later the author of bestsellers including "The Devil in the White City" and "In The Garden of Beasts," wrote a piece for Harper's Magazine, which was reprinted in The Washington Post. The article begins with the author wondering how all that junk mail arrives in his mailbox and moves on to the direct-marketing industry. The article includes these two sentences: "The keepers of big data say they do it for the consumer's benefit. But data have a way of being used for purposes other than originally intended."
Prescient indeed. But not, I don't think, a use of the term that suggests an inkling of the technology we call Big Data today. 
Since I first looked at how he used the term, I liked Mr. Mashey as the originator of Big Data. In the 1990s, Silicon Graphics was the giant of computer graphics, used for special-effects in Hollywood and for video surveillance by spy agencies. It was a hot company in the Valley that dealt with new kinds of data, and lots of it.
There are no academic papers to support the attribution to Mr. Mashey. Instead, he gave hundreds of talks to small groups in the middle and late 1990s to explain the concept and, of course, pitch Silicon Graphics products. The case for Mr. Mashey is on the Web sites of technical and professional organizations, like Usenix. There, some of his presentation slides from those talks are posted, including "Big Data and the Next Wave of Infrastress" in 1998.
For me, looking for the origins of Big Data has been a matter of personal curiosity, something to get back to someday and write up on a weekend.
When I called Mr. Mashey recently, he said that Big Data is such a simple term, it's not much a claim to fame. His role, if any, he said, was to popularize the term within a portion of the high-tech community in the 1990s. "I was using one label for a range of issues, and I wanted the simplest, shortest phrase to convey that the boundaries of computing keep advancing," said Mr. Mashey, a consultant to tech companies and a trustee of the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif.
At the University of Pennsylvania, Mr. Diebold kept looking into the subject as well. His follow-up inquiries, he said, proved to be "a journey of increasing humility." He has written to two papers since the first one. 
Hismost recent paper concludes: "The term Big Data, which spans computer science and statistics/econometrics, probably originated in the lunch-table conversations at Silicon Graphics in the mid-1990s, in which John Mashey figured prominently."
Tracing the origins of Big Data points to the evolution in the field of etymology, according to Mr. Shapiro. The Yale researcher began his word-hunting nearly 35 years ago, as a student at the Harvard Law School, poring through the library stacks. He was an early user of databases of legal documents, news articles and other documents, in computerized archives.
The Web, Mr. Shapiro said, opens up new linguistic terrain. "What you're seeing is a marriage of structured databases and novel, less structured materials," he said. "It can be a powerful tool to see far more."

HEADLINE: Bank of America Suffers Widespread Outages; Hacking Is Not Suspected

BYLINE: NICOLE PERLROTH, BEN PROTESS and JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: Bank of America customers were unable to access their online banking accounts, mobile payment systems or the company's telephone call centers on Friday. But it does not appear to be the result of hacking. 

 BODY:
Bank of America customers were unable to access their online banking accounts, mobile payment systems or the company's telephone call centers on Friday.
"We're aware of the issue and are addressing," Mark Pipitone, a Bank of America spokesman, said in a statement. "We're also working closely with our customers to help alleviate any concerns."
A customer service representative said that the bank's online and mobile payment systems had been down since 11 a.m. Eastern time. The customer service telephone lines were also down Friday morning but were restored hours later. The representative described the outage as a "whole system failure" and said that even Bank of America employees were not able to see customers' accounts for several hours. 
A person close to Bank of America said the problem appeared to stem from an internal breakdown, rather than a cyberattack, but the bank continued to investigate.
American banks have been hit by a wave of computer attacks in recent months. Starting last September, intruders have caused intermittent disruptions to the online banking sites of more than a dozen American banks, including Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp, PNC, Capitol One, Fifth Third Bank, BB&T and HSBC.
But those earlier attacks caused online banking sites to hiccup or fall offline for several minutes at a time. The outage at Bank of America lasted for several more than four hours. Also, this appeared to be the first outage that affected a bank's telephone lines.
Previous outages, representatives for banks have confirmed, were the result of DDoS, or distributed denial of service attacks, so named because attackers deny customer service by directing a large volume of traffic to a site until it falls offline. There were no breaches of bank accounts and no customers' money was taken.
Security researchers who have studied those attacks say that the attackers flooded each site with traffic that was more than 10 orders of magnitude larger than the amount of traffic that Russia directed at Estonia in a monthlong online assault in 2007 that nearly crippled the Baltic nation.
They were able to do so by infecting data centers and then using multiple data centers to fire unprecedented amounts of traffic at each bank simultaneously until they fell offline. And then firing unprecedented amounts of traffic at each banking site until it fell offline.
Affected banks have been working closely with each other and with Internet service providers to conduct forensics on the attacks. Government officials in the United States have accused Iran of orchestrating the attacks in retaliation for American computer attacks against Iran and for Western economic sanctions, but they have offered no proof to back up their claims.
A hacker group calling itself Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters has claimed responsibility for the attacks in online posts, but deny that they are affiliated with any particular nation state.
On Friday, Bank of America customers seemed less concerned with the origin of the outage then when it would be fixed. Several took to online forums and Twitter to vent.
"Bank of America website and app down going on 4 hours now," tweeted one customer. Why does this happen so often?"
"I don't always shutdown worldwide, but when I do... I make sure it's on the 1st of the month when my clients bills are due," another tweeted, half-joking.

HEADLINE: Common Core Practice | Deadly Showers, Killer Cats and Children's Lit

BYLINE: SARAH GROSS, JONATHAN OLSEN and KATHERINE SCHULTEN


HIGHLIGHT: This week: narrative writing about a children's book award; informative writing about daily routines and their potential risks; and argumentative writing about cats and their surprisingly deadly habits. 

 BODY:
The teachers we collaborate with for this feature might have made some macabre choices this week, but, as always, only in the service of learning.
Mr. Olsen writes that their first pick, the much-e-mailed piece by the scientist and author Jared Diamond, "That Daily Shower Can Be a Killer," was obvious:
"In our humanities class, Jared Diamond has become something of a legend. His Pulitzer Prize-winning "Guns, Germs, and Steel" is on the freshmen summer reading list, and I use the related National Geographic video series - a great way for students to see the importance of an interdisciplinary approach to research - throughout the year in my history classes," he writes. 
Ms. Gross and Mr. Olsen report that when their students saw that an essay by Professor Diamond was in the Science Times, they "broke out into wild applause and high fives."
We hope you enjoy this week's collection, but if your students aren't high-fiving over them, you can find many more by viewing the full series here.
 Common Core Practice Tasks | Week of Jan. 28 - Feb. 1, 2013 
 Informative Writing 
Science Essay: "That Daily Shower Can Be a Killer"
Common Core Standards: RI3, RI8, RI10, W2, W4, W9, WHST2
 From 50 years of field work on the island of New Guinea, the writer Jared Diamond has become aware of the importance of being attentive to hazards that carry a low risk but are encountered frequently. 
For forest dwelling New Guineans, this means avoiding sleeping under a tree as it could potentially fall on them. Professor Diamond has learned to apply this practical, but often ignored, advice to his everyday life in the United States. 
What do you encounter in your daily routine that carries potential risk?
 Your Task: In a paragraph describe an infrequently encountered risk you think people exaggerate that wasn't listed in the essay, and then explain what risks you encounter daily yet underestimate. How might you become more vigilant in your daily routine?
 Before You Do the Task, You Might ... 

        
Make sure you fully understand the difference between high risk/low frequency and low risk/high frequency.
        
List possible risks in two columns for both categories.
        
Develop a narrative around your lists by first explaining any that are high risk/low frequency followed by those that are low risk/high frequency. Explain how low risk hazards could be avoided.
 Extension Activity 

        
Identify low-risk hazards that are common in your school or house. Create posters - whether humorous or serious - using a single image with a single sentence or fragment in large block letters that warn of a potential hazard. Post these images as a way to warn others of potential dangers in efforts to change behaviors you see often those places.
 Narrative Writing 
Arts: "Tale of Gorilla's Renewed Life Wins Newbery Award"
Common Core Standards: RI10, W3, W4, W9, WHST4
 "The One and Only Ivan," the story of a silverback gorilla who makes a new life for himself after being moved from a tiny cage in a mall to a zoo, won this year's Newbery Medal for outstanding contribution to children's literature. The Newbery Medal is regarded as the most prestigious honor in children's literature. How would you react if you won this award? 
 Your Task: On the day the awards are decided, the committees must call the winners very early in the morning and swear them to secrecy until the announcement is made later that morning. Write a short scene imagining what it would be like to receive that phone call.
 Before You Do the Task, You Might ... 

        
Read these blog posts from authors about the morning they received a call: Peter Brown, Karen Cushman, Neil Gaiman.
        
Brainstorm a list of emotions the winners might feel.
        
Describe what it is like to receive a phone call that wakes you up in the morning.
 Extension Activity 

        
What are your favorite books? The favorite books of your classmates? Take an inventory, then publish your list on a blog or class Web site or in the school library. Or, invent a new literary award, perhaps with several subcategories, and tell what books you'd give it to and why. 
 Argumentative Writing 
National: "That Cuddly Kitty is Deadlier Than You Think"
Common Core Standards: RI2, RI4, RI7,W1, W4, W9, W10,RH1
 In a new report, scientists have identified a shocking new truth: cats are far deadlier than anyone realized. It is believed that cats are responsible for killing about 2.4 billion birds and 12.3 billion mammals a year throughout the United States. 
More birds and mammals die at the mouths of cats than from automobile strikes, pesticides and poisons, collisions with skyscrapers and windmills, or other similar causes. What is the solution to this problem of cats as killing machines?
 Your Task: How should the government handle the issue of indoor-outdoor cats and their impact on wildlife? What about feral cats? Be specific, citing evidence from the article.
 Before You Do the Task, You Might ... 

        
Highlight or underline quotes from the text that you can use in your narrative.
        
Pay careful attention to whose quote you are using. Is it Natalie Angier, the article's author, or some other expert?
        
While supporting your argument with quotes, be sure to introduce who is saying the quote and what their relationship to the subject material is.
 Extension Activity 

        
Many people own indoor-outdoor cats or feed local stray cats. As the article explains, this can be deadly for the local wildlife population. Using information in the article, create an informative advertisement that you can share with your neighbors, advising them of the dangers of outdoor cats.
        
In New Zealand, cats have been blamed for the extinction of nine bird species. Gareth Morgan, an economist and environmentalist, says that the cat is actually a "friendly neighborhood serial killer" when it comes to birds, and his Web site suggests that New Zealanders should gradually reduce the local feline population by having all cats neutered, and that when cats die, their owners should not replace them. Read more about his plan, and those against it, on The Times's View from Asia Blog.

HEADLINE: Art in Odd Places, Plus Some Evens, Equals a Numbers-Themed Festival

BYLINE: ROBIN POGREBIN


HIGHLIGHT: Circle Oct. 11 on your calendar. 

 BODY:
Art in Odd Places, which presents visual and performance art in unexpected public spaces in New York, is inviting proposals for its coming annual festival.
The theme of this year's event -- which takes place Oct. 11 through Oct. 20 on 14th Street from Avenue C to the Hudson River -- is number. 
To wit: "How numbers crowd us. Hurrying us, burying us, buoying us, worrying us. Dates to remember and forget, time to make, numbers in funds, pools, mints, checks, and balances, a lucky promise, the first, the last, boom and dip, growth and decline, profit and loss, debt and depression, taxes, tolls, polls, inflation, treasure and foreclosure, precision, penury, exactitude, excess, codes, ciphers, coins, currency, rhythm and cycles, counting and accounting, counting votes, counting cards, counting all his money, counting the hours, counting sheep, counting down, count your blessings, don't count your chickens, stand up and be counted, discounts and recounts, but who's counting? ... "

HEADLINE: Alec Soth's Great Plains Dispatch

BYLINE: STACEY BAKER


HIGHLIGHT: Alec Soth discusses his method behind his photographs documenting the oil boom in North Dakota. 

 BODY:
 For this week's cover story about the oil boom in North Dakota, we asked Alec Soth, known for his photographic road trips, to drive from his home in Minnesota to northwestern North Dakota last fall and document life there. Recently he answered a few questions about the project via e-mail. 
 What most interested you about this assignment? 
About a year ago I woke up to the fact that my photographic work had become a bit too self-indulgent. Fed up with my Twitter-ish navel-gazing, I started working on a series of small stories about Middle America. More often than not these stories were about the tenuous nature of community, particularly in a time of economic turmoil. Most of this turmoil has been recession-based. So when I was approached by the magazine about photographing this community turned upside down by an economic boom, I was thrilled to see what it looked like.
 I know you like to drive to your locations. Why is that? 
Driving is a way of getting my head in the game. There's something about spending a lot of time in the quiet container of the car with the landscape whizzing past that somehow prepares me for the kind of attention needed while photographing. When I fly to an assignment, I feel like my body is there but my brain lags behind.
 How have your road trips evolved over the years? 
I used to need solitude in the car. All of my early work was made while driving alone. When I worked with writers or assistants, I felt self-conscious. But over the years, a lot of that has dropped away. Lately I prefer having other people in the car with me. It helps dampen my solipsistic inclinations.
In your book "From Here to There," you compare yourself to Joel Sternfeld, calling him "more of a social documentarian," someone who "really is interested in the social issues of the day." Are you becoming a social documentarian now?
You are absolutely right. I've been really aware of this shift in my approach. Just a couple of weeks ago I tracked down an old copy of Life magazine with W. Eugene Smith's ''Country Doctor'' essay. While I've always admired his work, I never I thought I'd identify with it. More and more I seem to be working in that tradition. But I really haven't thought through all of the ramifications of this on my career. It just feels like the right work to be making at the moment. But who knows, in six months I could be back in my basement finger painting self-portraits.
 Tell us about the cover photo. 
The great thing about this particular assignment was that there weren't all of these specific expectations to fulfill. I was given extraordinary free range to photograph whatever I wanted. That said, there was this one lingering expectation to make a killer cover picture. This meant not only making a great vertical image, but also a picture that functions as a kind of shorthand for the story. This led to what I came to call the "There Will Be Blood" problem. Since this is a story about oil, everyone involved in the project, myself included, had a mental picture of men covered in oil. But when I asked a local, he chuckled and said that such scenes might have been common 80 years ago, but it wasn't like that anymore. (Afterward, my assistant and I joked about carrying around a bucket of oil to dump on men during our shoots.) So you can imagine my delight when I encountered Brian Coffey at one of the drilling rigs I visited. But here's the thing, it isn't oil - it's the slurry used in the drilling process. Nevertheless, it worked for the picture. But the magic is the contrast of this grime with the snow and fog. When I saw that, it actually surpassed the mental picture I'd been dragging around with me.
What were your impressions of this community that has been so tremendously affected by the boom?
What's happening in North Dakota is a perfect inversion of what's happening in the rest of the country. While most of America is still dealing with the collapse of the housing bubble, there's a housing boom in North Dakota. While many American citizens can't find jobs, North Dakota employers struggle to find workers. What was interesting, however, was that it still looked and felt like a community in crisis. The infrastructure simply can't handle what's happening. Everyone I talked to complained about the exorbitant rent, the crowded and understaffed Walmart, the bad roads and so on. The place didn't look or feel any happier than most of the recession-stung towns I've been visiting of late. If anything, it helped me appreciate the moderation inherent in the sluggish rebound of the economy at large.

HEADLINE: A Bad Jobs Report Turns Out to Have Been Wrong

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: The jobs report for last March was a big disappointment, one that spurred talk of a new recession. Now we learn that report was simply wrong, that March was actually a very good month and that jobs rose much more rapidly in 2012 than we had previously been told. 

 BODY:
The jobs report for last March was a big disappointment, one that spurred talk of a new recession. Now we learn that report was simply wrong, that March was actually a very good month and that jobs rose much more rapidly in 2012 than we had previously been told. 
Last April, with the presidential campaign heating up, the Labor Department reported that its survey of employers showed the economy added only 120,000 jobs in March, far below forecasts. The unemployment rate -- based on a separate survey of households -- did decline a bit, to 8.2 percent, but that was widely dismissed as indicating some people gave up looking for work.
From the next day's Times:
Republicans pounced on the lower than expected payroll numbers, with the party's front-runner, Mitt Romney, declaring, "This is a weak and very troubling jobs report that shows the employment remains stagnant." Speaker John A. Boehner and Representative Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, also deplored the numbers and laid the blame for them at Mr. Obama's feet.
The report came out on Good Friday, when the stock market was closed, so investors had all weekend to ponder the numbers. They did not like what they saw, and the Dow tumbled on both Monday and Tuesday.
Now we know what really happened in March. On Friday, the Labor Department issued its "benchmark revision" for the 12 months through March 2012. The new numbers are based on far more reliable -- but slower to arrive -- counts of the the number of workers for whom unemployment insurance premiums were paid. It turns out 205,000 jobs were added that month.
For all of 2012, we are now told that the average month added 181,000 jobs. A month ago, we were told the average for the year was only 153,000, basically the same as in 2011. With the revisions, we are told that the 2011 average was really 175,000.
At the end of last year, the official figures showed employment had risen 3.7 percent from the bottom in February 2010 to the end of 2012. Now that figure is 4.1 percent.
A year from now we will get benchmark revisions for the last nine months of 2012. It is quite possible the 2012 annual average will then rise further, to more than 200,000. 
A couple of weeks ago, speaking in Hong Kong, Charles Evans, the president of the Chicago Fed, was asked about what would show things were getting better. He replied, according to Reuters, "One good indicator of labor market improvement would be if we saw payroll employment increase by 200,000 each month for a number of months. We've been averaging about 150,000, but it's been very uneven."
Turns out the average was a lot higher than the Fed thought. Could that signify we are closer to an end to quantitative easing than we thought?

HEADLINE: Comparing Jobs in Recessions and Recoveries

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Employment still has a long way to go before returning to its pre-recession level. 

 BODY:
For the 28th straight month, the country added jobs: 157,000 nonfarm payroll jobs in January, to be more precise.
But employment still has a long way to go before returning to its pre-recession level. 
The chart above shows economy-wide job changes in this last recession and recovery compared with other recent ones; the red line represents the current cycle. Since the downturn began in December 2007, the economy has had a net decline of about 2.3 percent in its nonfarm payroll jobs. And that does not account for the fact that the working-age population has continued to grow, meaning that if the economy were healthy we should have more jobs today than we had before the recession.
Getting the economy to 5 percent unemployment within two years - a return to the rate that prevailed when the recession began - would require job growth of closer to 284,984 a month.
There are now 12.3 million workers looking for work who cannot find it. The tally of those who are "underemployed" - that is, adding in those workers who are part-time but want to be employed full-time, and workers who want to work but are not looking - is an even larger 21.4 million.
As bad as all these figures are, it's worth remembering that job markets in the decade following a financial crisis are always terrible. In fact, layoffs were far worse and lasted much longer in the aftermath of the financial crises that struck, for example, Finland and Sweden in 1991 and Spain in 1977, not to mention the United States during the Great Depression.

HEADLINE: A Cry of Frustration at Delhi's Sustainable Summit

BYLINE: AMY YEE


HIGHLIGHT: Another international conference underscores the lack of concerted policy action on climate change. 

 BODY:
NEW DELHI - Once more, frustration with stymied efforts on climate change has emerged as a major theme at an international conference on the planet's health. Opening the 13th annual Delhi Sustainable Development Summit conference this week, India's prime minister noted that similar sentiments surfaced last year at the United Nations Rio+20 meeting, which marked the two-decade anniversary of a landmark Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. 
Rio+20 was a "poignant reminder that the ambitious goals that we had set for ourselves"" are "far from being realized,''Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told the heads of state, government ministers and delegates gathered here on Wednesday.
 In a panel discussion on the theme ''Defining the Future We Want,'' Jean Charest, a former premier of Quebec, suggested that states, cities and provinces are now addressing climate change in ways that many national leaders are not. Maybe heads of state and national legislatures can be ''embarrassed into action by other levels of government,'' he said.

Quebec has led the way nationally in Canada by adopting tighter auto car emission standards, just as California has been a pathbreaker in the United States. 
John Prescott, a former British deputy prime minister and member of Parliament, spoke angrily about the slow pace of change and the need for political will. ''We can't continue talking at all these conferences!'' he declared from the podium. 
Mr. Prescott even sniped at last week's World Economic Forum in Davos and its theme of "resilient dynamism." ''What the hell does that mean?" he asked. The most important global issue, he said, is at hand here in New Delhi "This is the place where it really matters,'' he said.
With a rapidly growing population of 1.2 billion already stretching the country's resources, sustainability is a pressing matter in India. Like other developing countries, it already bears much of the brunt of global climate change, including weather extremes like drought and severe flooding as well as severe pollution. 
In Asia over all,some 650 million people in Asia lack access to clean fuel for cooking and heating and tend to rely on fires made from wood and dung, emitting soot that contributes significantly to global warming.
No country or region can address the risks posed by climate change wholly on its own, Prime Minister Singh told the conference delegates. The challenge "can only be tackled through coordinated global action,'' he said. "It is therefore crucial to look at sustainable development from a global rather than a purely national perspective.''

HEADLINE: Washington Post Says It Will Seek New Home

BYLINE: CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY


HIGHLIGHT: The Washington Post, another newspaper struggling to trim costs, is planning to move out of the District of Columbia headquarters where its staff has worked for nearly four decades. 

 BODY:
The Washington Post, another newspaper struggling to trim costs, is planning to move out of the District of Columbia headquarters where its news staff has worked for nearly four decades.
Katharine Weymouth, the paper's publisher, sent a memo to the staff on Friday morning announcing that the company was looking into a move and had hired two real estate firms, Studley Inc. and JM Zell Partners, as advisers. The company is also interviewing space planners and architects for guidance.
"Our preliminary analysis suggests that a move will make good operational and economic sense, however we have not yet decided on where or when," Ms. Weymouth said in her memo. 
Since the company removed its presses more than a decade ago, Ms. Weymouth said, "we are no longer tied to this particular location."
According to the company's Web site, a $5 million printing plant was built at the current location on 15th Street NW in 1950, and The Post's $25 million headquarters building was officially dedicatedthere in October 1972. Katharine Graham, the former publisher and Ms. Weymouth's grandmother, originally wanted I. M. Pei to design the building in the shape of a typewriter, according to Dave Kindred, a former Post columnist who wrote a 2010 book about the paper, "Morning Miracle: Inside The Washington Post." But that plan proved too costly.
Over the years, The Washington Post newsroom has been a destination for heads of state, business executives and Hollywood moguls and stars. An article in The Post in April 1975 about the filming of "All the President's Men" said the newspaper allowed filmmakers to shoot only the building's exterior. But film crews passed through repeatedly to "soak up authenticity, rub elbows with newspaper people and learn the routine of a daily newspaper."
Mr. Kindred recalled that when he was reporting his book between 2007 and 2009, he rode an elevator with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who had been visiting Donald E. Graham, Ms. Graham's son and chief executive of the Washington Post Company. Mr. Kindred also recalled a day when the actor Brad Pitt stopped by to glean inspiration for a movie he was working on.
"Everyone has passed through at one time or another," said Mr. Kindred.
Newspapers around the country are trying to find ways to cut costs as they battle a troubled advertising environment and their readers migrate to digital news sources. The Post underwent a major shake-up last fall when Ms. Weymouth abruptly replaced the paper's executive editor, Marcus Brauchli, with Martin Baron, editor of The Boston Globe.
Andrew J. Asbill, a Washington-based director of the capital markets group at Cushman & Wakefield, said that whoever purchased the headquarters would most likely tear it down and rebuild because it's an older building and relatively far from the Metro.
Ms. Weymouth's memo did not say where the company was looking to relocate.
An earlier version of this post, using information from The Washington Post Web site, misstated the dedication date of its headquarters building at 1150 15th NW. It was October 1972, not 1973.

HEADLINE: On Iran, Hagel Muddles the Message

BYLINE: DAVID E. SANGER


HIGHLIGHT: In his confirmation hearing on Thursday, Chuck Hagel became the latest official to send what many inside the administration fear has been an inconsistent and confusing message to Iran's supreme leader about the possibility of using military measures to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. 

 BODY:
Dealing with Iran is complicated, but President Obama's policy on the question of whether a nuclear-armed Iran could be successfully "contained'' - the way the Soviet Union was during the cold war - is simple.
His answer is no. 
But in the weeks of preparation for his Senate confirmation hearing to be defense secretary on Thursday, either no one explained that to Chuck Hagel, Mr. Obama's nominee for secretary of defense, or he forgot it. And so on his first outing, Mr. Hagel fell immediately into the trap that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and several other administration officials have complained about in recent years. He became the latest official to send what many inside the administration fear has been an inconsistent and confusing message to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamanei, about whether the Obama administration would, if there was no other option, take military measures to prevent Iran from possessing a weapon.
"It's somewhere between baffling and incomprehensible," a member of Mr. Obama's own team of advisers on Iran said on Thursday night when asked about Mr. Hagel's stumbling performance on the question during the all-day hearing. The worry was evident in the voice of the official, who would not speak on the record while criticizing the performance of the president's nominee. For those who question whether the no-containment cornerstone of the Obama approach to Tehran is for real, or just diplomatic rhetoric, Mr. Hagel clearly muddled the message, he said. 
Mr. Hagel's flubbing of the answer was even more remarkable because in his prepared remarks to the committee, which were carefully vetted by the White House and then e-mailed to reporters before the hearing, he got the president's position exactly right. "As I said in the past many times, all options must be on the table,'' Mr. Hagel said, in a statement meant to clean up past comments by the former Nebraska senator suggesting that an attack on Iran's nuclear sites would be so disastrous that it was not a feasible alternative. "My policy has always been the same as the president's, one of prevention, not of containment. And the president has made clear that is the policy of our government.''
So far, so good.
But then, Mr. Hagel went down a different road. "I support the president's strong position on containment," he said, appearing, perhaps by imprecision, to suggest that the president's view was that a nuclear Iran could be contained. (Mr. Obama has gone on to explain that containment would fail because other players in the neighborhood - probably led by Saudi Arabia - would race for the bomb as soon as Iran had one.)
Then an aide slipped a piece of paper to Mr. Hagel. He glanced at it, then said: "By the way, I've just been handed a note that I misspoke and said I supported the president's position on containment. If I said that, it meant to say that obviously - on his position on containment - we don't have a position on containment."
That made it worse. So the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, tried to rescue Mr. Hagel. "Just to make sure your correction is clear, we do have a position on containment: which is we do not favor containment.''
Why might any of this matter? Perhaps it won't; it could just be another in the litany of Iran slips, like the time in December 2011 when Leon E. Panetta, the man Mr. Hagel hopes to replace at the Pentagon, described how any attack on Iran would strengthen the country's position in the region and help it shed its pariah status. (He was probably right, but it made it sound as if the defense secretary really thought there were no military options on the table.)
But Mr. Hagel's stumbling caused heartburn inside the administration because it made him appear unfamiliar with his brief. And even before he spoke, American credibility on the question of whether it would allow nations to get the bomb has been less than impressive.
The United States warned Pakistan against pursuing the development of a nuclear weapon during the Clinton administration. It conducted a nuclear test in 1998, responding to an Indian test, and both countries briefly suffered American economic sanctions. Then, after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the sanctions were lifted, Pakistan became a "major non-NATO ally'' and India signed a commercial nuclear agreement with the United States.
Then there is North Korea. President George W. Bush said he would never "tolerate'' a North Korea with nuclear weapons. North Korea set off its first nuclear test in 2006, and its second a few months after Mr. Obama became president. Satellite photographs suggest that a third may be only days or weeks away.
That record, many believe, could prompt Iran's leaders to conclude that once countries get a weapon, or the capability to build one, America shrugs its shoulders and declares that containment will work fine. Mr. Hagel raised that possibility in a 2007 speech - though he stopped short of endorsing it - which is why the administration wanted to make sure he got on the same page with the president. He didn't, and there is little doubt that the Iranians noticed.

BYLINE: MELENA RYZIK


HIGHLIGHT: The director of "Life of Pi" said he finally realized he could make the seemingly unfilmable novel work if it was in 3D. Still, the studio dropped the movie twice. 

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES - "Making this film was a nightmare."
So said Eric Fellner, a producer of "Les Misérables," at a panel here last weekend put together by the Producers Guild of America, where awards hopefuls talked about the challenges and successes of their movies. "Les Miz," of course, is doing quite all right, with eight Oscar nominations and more than $300 million at the worldwide box office But it's not quite as all right as "Life of Pi," which has 11 nominations and is nearing $500 million in global ticket sales. It was equally hard to envision on film, as its director, Ang Lee, emphasized at the panel. 
"I thought, 'This is kind of unsolvable,'" he said of adapting Yann Martel's novel into a big-budget Hollywood production. "Pi doesn't mean anything. The economic side and the artistic side, the two of them would never meet, just like" the numeral pi. But he couldn't shake the desire to do the movie, and eventually hit upon a solution. "I thought, 'Well, maybe if I add another dimension, maybe it would work. How about 3D?'"
Though he enlisted an effects house here, Mr. Lee decided to shoot the movie at home in Taiwan, where he built a state-of-the-art wave tank and enjoyed the benefits of a local boy made good. "I could just go about things that are unprecedented," he said. In Hollywood, "too many people know everything and then tell you what to do, and it's way too expensive."
It took a year to persuade investors and executives at Fox to give him the money he needed, and even then, Mr. Lee said, "the studio dropped it twice." The second time, it was the audition tape of his star, Suraj Sharma, that helped put the project in motion again.
Mr. Sharma had never acted before, had never seen the ocean and did not know how to swim. He was cast after an open call that started with high schools in India, and had three months of prep before performing with an invisible castmate -- the digital tiger. Unusually, the movie was shot in sequence, which gave Mr. Sharma and the fillmmakers an added dimension of realism.
"His life and our lives is co-parallel with Pi's journey," Mr. Lee said, "from losing weight to getting used to the ocean, to the tiger, to shooting, all the way down to the spiritual part when he loses his mind. It is quite the unique experience."

HEADLINE: The Role of the Military and Veterans in Politics

BYLINE: TIM HSIA


HIGHLIGHT: The interplay between politics, the military and veterans is a complicated subject matter, writes Tim Hsia who is in the Army Reserves as an R.O.T.C. instructor at Santa Clara University. 

 BODY:
The recent death of Senator Daniel K. Inouye, a celebrated World War II veteran, coincided in many ways with the waning influence of veterans in American politics. There are now only three World War II veterans in Congress: Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, Representative Ralph Hall of Texas and Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan. Over all, the number of veterans joining Congress has perpetuated a four-decade-long slide. 
But military veterans still have significant political clout. Former Senator John Kerry, a Vietnam veteran, was recently confirmed as secretary of state, and former Senator Chuck Hagel, also a Vietnam veteran, has been nominated for defense secretary. If Mr. Hagel is confirmed,President Obama's cabinet will have three Vietnam veterans (the third being Eric Shinseki, secretary of the Department of Veteran Affairs.) 
Although the overall number of veterans in Congress has decreased, the election of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans is on the rise. Of the 89 military veterans in the House, 17 are veterans of Iraq or Afghanistan. Of the 18 senators who are military veterans, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is the only veteran of Iraq or Afghanistan. 
The interplay between politics, the military and veterans is a complicated subject matter. Although war is supposed to be an extension of politics, we don't want service members associated with politics. Some historians surmise that Lincoln removed Gen. George B. McClellan, the top Union Army general, partly because General McClellan showed too great of an interest in politics. 
Throughout American history there have been notable American political leaders who have served in the military. Some veterans turned legislators played down their military backgrounds or made it a point that they could also view the military through a critical lens. Eisenhower is remembered for his warning of the "military industrial complex."
This trend continues. Joyce Tsai, in Stars and Stripes, found that many veterans who ran for office this past election played down their military experience. Chris Fields, a Democrat who ran for a House seat, said, "We don't try to wrap ourselves in the flag and say the opposition is less patriotic because they didn't go into the military service, because that, in my opinion, would be false." 
In the past, some veterans have highlighted their military service when running for office, including Senator John McCain in the 2008 election. But Senator Bob Dole did not make it a point when running for the presidency in 1996.
Veterans and military service also played a significant role in the past election cycle. Many observers noticed that Mitt Romney did not bring up the topic of the war in Afghanistan during the speech in which he accepted the Republican nomination. William Kristol, a conservative writer, questioned "the civic propriety of a presidential nominee failing even to mention, in his acceptance speech, a war we're fighting and our young men and women who are fighting it." By contrast, the Democratic National Convention prominently highlighted a tribute to the nation's veterans.
Nevertheless, a vast majority of veterans in Congress identify as Republicans. More military veterans ran for election to the current Congress - and won - as Republicans than as Democrats. Out of the 89 military veterans in the House, only 20 are Democrats. 
Additionally, of the newly elected Iraq and Afghanistan combat veterans, 14 are Republicans and only 2 - both female - are Democrats. In the past election cycle, according to Joyce Tsai of Stars and Stripes, there were 42 candidates for Congress who had war zone experience (38 House and 4 Senate candidates). Of the 42 candidates, 13 were Democrats.
Interestingly, in the last presidential election, Ron Paul received more in donations from military veterans than any other candidate. 
Although there is a preponderance of military veteran members of Congress who are Republicans, some recent research suggests that political affiliation among current service members is more diverse. Jason Dempsey, an Army officer and a former White House fellow, found from his research that "there is no monolithic 'military vote.'" He found that "on most social issues and questions of how the government should spend money, the attitudes of service members largely tracked those of the civilian population." Although "older generations of veterans remain solidly Republican," "among the youngest service members and veterans ... there is an even split in party identification with 36 percent identifying themselves as Democrats and 41 percent as Republicans." 
Heidi Urben, an Army officer and American politics professor at West Point, found that of the officer corps, "60 percent identify with the Republican Party," but that a "majority of those who called themselves Republican were less partisan and more centrist." Ms. Urben states that most service members "are weak partisans or independents. And that's something you don't hear reported as much." Ms. Urben also found that "people are leaving the military with pretty much the same views they had going in."
Jim Golby, Kyle Dropp and Peter Feaver have done research on the impact of high-profile endorsements from retired military personnel on presidential campaigns. The study is important because the trend of candidates' seeking endorsements of general and flag officers is only likely to continue, given the overall decrease of prominent veterans in politics and as military service becomes a more rarefied career. Their research found that:
While military endorsements do not provide a statistically significant boost in overall support for candidates, our research indicates that they may persuade a small but significant portion of two groups - independent voters and voters who report low levels of foreign policy interest - to favor President Barack Obama. 
These researchers also say that their survey suggests that such high-profile general officer endorsements "do affect the way the public views the military and that endorsements may undermine trust and confidence in the military over the long term. The public already views the military as having something of a partisan cast." They also believe such endorsements may "undermine military recruiting efforts and hinder effective civil-military relations." They support eliminating veteran endorsements because veterans - "be they privates or generals - always cross a line when they claim to speak for the military institution itself ... by attaching their partisan political causes and candidates to the reputation of the military."
In recent decades the number of military veterans in Congress has greatly diminished, but this trend will somewhat reverse as Afghanistan and Iraq veterans come of age. Although this past election cycle was focused on domestic issues and the economy, it will be interesting to analyze whether veterans running for office place a great emphasis on their military service in an election cycle in which foreign policy is a major issue. It will also be interesting to note how veterans of my generation contextualize their service and explain what lessons they learned from our recent wars. Veterans are not a homogenous group, and every veteran takes away a different lesson from military experience.

HEADLINE: It All Adds Up To an Odd Festival

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
Art in Odd Places, which presents visual and performance art in unexpected public spaces in New York, is inviting proposals for its coming annual festival. 
The theme of this year's event -- which takes place Oct. 11 through Oct. 20 on 14th Street from Avenue C to the Hudson River -- is number.
To wit: "How numbers crowd us. Hurrying us, burying us, buoying us, worrying us. Dates to remember and forget, time to make, numbers in funds, pools, mints, checks, and balances, a lucky promise, the first, the last, boom and dip, growth and decline, profit and loss, debt and depression, taxes, tolls, polls, inflation, treasure and foreclosure, precision, penury, exactitude, excess, codes, ciphers, coins, currency, rhythm and cycles, counting and accounting, counting votes, counting cards, counting all his money, counting the hours, counting sheep, counting down, count your blessings, don't count your chickens, stand up and be counted, discounts and recounts, but who's counting? ... "
You get the gist.
And if you're short on ideas, a news release about the festival provided some possible inspiration:14 - #1 - 10 - 100 - 3.14 - 69 - 99 - 212 - 718 - 7eleven - 9/11 - 911 - 3/11 - 24/7 - 365 - 10-4 - 13 - 666 - 1492 - 1776 - 1857 -1968 -1984 -1989 - 12/21/2012 - 47% - 99% - 1% - 0 - â[#x2c6][#x17e] - 2013

HEADLINE: Car Sales Climb Sharply In Strong Start to 2013

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Automakers said new vehicle sales in the United States rose sharply in January, indicating that the industry's steady recovery is not slowing despite weak job growth and an uncertain economy.
A total of 1.04 million cars and trucks were sold during the month, a 14 percent increase from January 2012, according to the research firm the Autodata Corporation.
Analysts said the strong demand surpassed their expectations. They cited improved sales of pickup trucks as a sign that construction contractors and other businesses were optimistic about the economy. 
''Sales were at the high end of the forecast,'' said Jesse Toprak, an analyst at the auto research site TrueCar.com. ''The main reason was the truck segment outperformed for the most part.''
In 2012, the industry turned in its best performance in five years, with sales of 14.5 million vehicles -- a 13 percent increase over 2011.
Auto executives and analysts are forecasting sales this year as high as 15.5 million vehicles. They attribute the positive outlook in part to consumers' need to replace aging vehicles, a factor that has driven strong industry sales since last year, and in part to improvements in housing starts.
While Toyota had the best month among the major automakers, all of the Detroit car companies reported solid gains.
General Motors, the largest of the Detroit manufacturers, said it sold 194,700 cars and trucks in January, a 16 percent increase from a year ago. All four of the company's domestic brands -- Chevrolet, Cadillac, GMC and Buick -- had double-digit increases for the month, it said.
G.M. has also rebounded from tepid sales of its core pickup trucks in recent months. It said sales of its Chevrolet Silverado pickup increased 32 percent from January 2012, and sales of the GMC Sierra improved 35 percent.
''The year is off to a very good start for General Motors,'' said Kurt McNeil, head of G.M.'s United States sales operations. ''There's a sense of optimism among our dealers that only comes when you pair a growing economy with great new products.''
Ford Motor, the second-biggest American automaker, said its sales in January rose 22 percent, to 166,500 vehicles. The company's passenger cars did particularly well, with an increase for the month of 34 percent. Sales of the recently redesigned Ford Fusion midsize sedan, which had been hampered by safety recalls, rose 64.5 percent.
''Much hand-wringing has taken place over early recalls of the Ford Escape and Ford Fusion,'' said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with the car research site Edmunds.com. ''But that doesn't appear to matter to consumers, who bought those models in big numbers.''
Executives at Ford said the company expected consumer demand to grow consistently in 2013.
''The biggest driver of the year is going to be replacement,'' said Kenneth M. Czubay, Ford's United States sales and marketing chief.
Chrysler, the smallest Detroit car company, said it sold 117,700 vehicles in January. That was a 16 percent increase from the same month in 2012, and it extended Chrysler's year-over-year sales gains to 34 consecutive months.
The company said sales of its cars rose about 50 percent, while sales of its sport utility vehicles and trucks increased 3 percent. Its new small car, the Dodge Dart, had its best performance since being introduced in June.
Toyota, the biggest Japanese automaker, said its sales in January grew 26.6 percent, to 157,700 vehicles. Its bellwether car models generated much of the increase, with a 32.4 percent gain for the Corolla compact sedan and a 36.5 percent rise in sales of the Prius line of gas-electric hybrids.
Toyota also expects to gain market share with edgy redesigns of previously lackluster models like the Avalon sedan, which had a 50.4 percent increase in sales in January.
The other two large Japanese auto companies, Honda and Nissan, lagged the overall industry gains.
Honda said it sold 93,600 vehicles, an increase of 12.8 percent from a year earlier. Nissan struggled even more to keep pace, reporting a 2 percent increase in sales, to 80,900.
Sales also cooled for the German automaker Volkswagen, which was one of the industry's best performers in 2012.
Last year, combined sales of the company's Volkswagen and Audi brands grew more than 30 percent in the United States. In January, however, it reported that sales increased just 7.1 percent.
''The disappointment in the month was probably Volkswagen,'' Mr. Toprak said. ''It's probably not a major worry, as long as these numbers aren't sustained for several months.''

HEADLINE: For Markets, a Strong January Is a Good Sign

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
AS January goes, so goes the year.
That maxim of the American stock market would seem to bode well for the market this year. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index's gain of 5 percent made the month the 12th best January since 1950, and the 19th opening month in that period when the index rose more than 4 percent. 
''If history repeats, we would expect a double-digit percentage increase in the upcoming 11 months,'' said Richard Peterson, an analyst at S&P Capital IQ.
Only once since 1950 has the market fallen in the last 11 months of a year when it rose 4 percent or more in January. That was in 1987, which began with the best January in the history of the index -- up 13.2 percent -- and ended including the worst single day ever for the index, a 20 percent plunge on Oct. 19.
On average since 1950, January gains of at least 4 percent have been followed by rises of 15.1 percent in the remainder of the year. Gains were lower when January gains were smaller, and on average the market has made no headway in years after prices fell in January.
There is, of course, no guarantee that history will repeat. In fact, during the Great Depression the opposite pattern existed. The market rose sharply during the first month of 1929, 1930, 1931 and 1934, only to plunge the rest of each year. Prices fell in the first month of 1935, which turned out to be an excellent year.
The January gains this year reflected generally strong markets around the world. As can be seen in the accompanying charts, all but two of the 20 largest stock markets in the world rose in January, and six of them -- Japan, China, Britain, Switzerland, Sweden and Italy -- rose more rapidly than the American market did. The two that showed losses were Brazil and South Korea.
The ranking of markets is based on World Bank calculations of total market capitalization of each market in 2011. More than half the capitalization of those 20 markets is in just the top three, the United States, Japan and China. The top five -- Britain and Canada in addition to the other three -- have two-thirds of the value.
The United States market is one of 10 that have more than doubled from their credit crisis lows set in 2008 or 2009, the others being Brazil, Germany, India, South Korea, Hong Kong, South Africa, Russia, Sweden and Mexico.
The only three countries in the group that are not at least 50 percent higher than their lows are all in the euro zone, where economies have been stumbling. They are France, Spain and Italy.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: As January Goes, So Goes the Year? January was a good month for the stock market in the United States, which could be a sign this will be a good year. Only once in the last 63 years did the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rise more than 4 percent in January and then end the year lower than it was at the end of January. That was in 1987, which also was the best January in the history of the S. & P. 500. Since its low during the credit crisis, the S. & P. 500 is up 121 percent, more than major indexes in most of the 20 largest markets in the world. (Sources: Bloomberg, World Bank)

HEADLINE: Energy Secretary Is Resigning After 4 Years Focused on Clean Technologies

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Energy Secretary Steven Chu will step down soon, possibly by the end of the month, he said in a statement on Friday, ending a four-year tenure in which he concentrated on fostering research and development of clean energy technologies, and opponents pilloried him over stimulus loans that went bad.
His departure will add to a constellation of vacancies at the top of related agencies: the Environmental Protection Agency, the Transportation Department and the Interior Department. 
President Obama said in a statement that Dr. Chu ''brought to the Energy Department a unique understanding of both the urgent challenge presented by climate change and the tremendous opportunity that clean energy represents for our economy.'' He praised Dr. Chu for expanded support of research into ''groundbreaking innovations that could transform our energy future.''
Dr. Chu presided over a surge in expenditures in which the Obama administration tried to use the Energy Department to stimulate the economy and advance both energy efficiency and clean energy production. Dr. Chu said that some of the money would be used to ''swing for the fences,'' promoting a variety of ventures, of which some were certain to fail. But the successes would more than compensate for the failures, he said, especially in research and development, where breakthroughs could nurture new industries.
As expected, some of the research has failed, and much remains a work in progress. One of the manufacturing failures was Solyndra, a company with an innovative design for solar cells that got a $535 million loan guarantee but built a product too expensive for the market.
''He was given the thankless task of spending $40 billion on energy technology very quickly at a department with little existing capacity to do so productively, so it's something of a miracle there weren't more Solyndras,'' said Paul Bledsoe, an energy aide in the Clinton White House. Mr. Bledsoe praised Dr. Chu's focus on the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy program, known as Arpa-e, an energy version of the better-known Darpa, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
Representative Darrell Issa, the California Republican who is the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, offered a more critical assessment of the administration's approach to new technologies. ''I found taxpayer losses on projects like Solyndra and the department's deeply misguided effort to use taxpayer dollars as an investment bank for unproven technologies to be the most problematic aspects of his legacy,'' he said. The next energy secretary, he said, should focus on ''removing barriers for the safe use of proven technologies.''
The commercial verdict on the department's investments may not be delivered for years to come. The initial outlook for the Obama administration's wind and sun programs has been dimmed by the success of an Energy Department initiative of the 1990s: the development of a method for drilling horizontally in shale formations and fracturing the rock to liberate natural gas, known as fracking, which cut the price of fossil energy just as renewable technologies appeared poised to reach price parity.
Dr. Chu, a physicist, was the first cabinet secretary to come into office with a Nobel Prize (an honor he shared in 1997 for his work with supercooled atoms) and was the first scientist to lead the department. His 14 predecessors as secretary included a dentist, an admiral from the nuclear Navy, a former electric utility lobbyist and a variety of political figures.
Several people have been mentioned as potential replacements: Christine O. Gregoire, a former governor and attorney general of Washington State, who once sued the Energy Department to force a cleanup of nuclear waste, and whom Dr. Chu mentioned in his departure announcement; Dan Reicher, an assistant energy secretary in the Clinton administration; and Ashton B. Carter, a deputy secretary of defense, whose prior experience is well suited to the department's main mission, the management of nuclear weapons. But it is not clear if the White House would move him from the Defense Department.
Dr. Chu had the political skills to manage the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and its 4,000 employees before being chosen by Mr. Obama, but he also showed a physicist's penchant for speaking the truth plainly.
In September 2008, before Mr. Obama was elected, Mr. Chu told The Wall Street Journal, ''Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe,'' a statement that Republicans in Congress used to criticize him. Three months earlier, in a lecture he gave in Washington on energy, he said that new houses could be made energy efficient with an investment of $1,000, ''but the American consumer would rather have a granite countertop.''
His science focus was still clear after four years on the job. On Thursday, speaking to reporters at the Washington Auto Show, he was asked whether sequestration, the across-the-board spending cuts scheduled to take place in March, would interrupt progress on energy problems. He replied by describing how it would still be necessary to sequester carbon dioxide from power plants.
When the questioner clarified that the issue was not carbon capture and sequestration, but sequestration of federal money, he smiled and responded, ''See what a nerd I am?''

HEADLINE: Manufacturing Activity Rises For Second Month in a Row

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Manufacturing activity in the United States grew at a faster pace in January, driven by an increase in new orders and more hiring at factories.
The Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of supply management professionals, said Friday that its index of manufacturing activity jumped to 53.1 in January from 50.2 in December. It was the highest reading since April, when the index hit 54.1. 
Any reading above 50 indicates expansion.
In another positive economic report, the Commerce Department said spending on construction projects rose in December, ending a year in which construction activity increased for the first time in six years.
The second straight monthly increase in the manufacturing index showed that activity was starting to grow again after struggling through most of 2012. Uncertainty about tax increases and deep government spending cuts led many companies to reduce orders for machinery and equipment earlier this year. And a weaker global economy dampened demand for American exports.
The report was also encouraging because it showed that demand for factory goods increased while consumers started to pay higher Social Security taxes. That left them with less take-home pay, which could hurt consumer spending.
The survey came hours after the Labor Department reported that employers added 157,000 jobs in January. Manufacturers added 4,000 jobs last month, the fourth straight monthly increase.
''There's a fair bit of optimism here to start the year,'' said Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG LLC, a trading firm based in New York.
Mr. Greenhaus said the solid manufacturing gains, especially in new orders and employment, suggested that ''the larger story remains intact, of a moderate, ongoing recovery.''
The I.S.M. report showed that 13 of the 18 industries surveyed had an increase in activity last month. They included manufacturers of plastics and rubber, textiles, furniture, printing, and apparel. Four industries reported contraction: minerals, computers and electronics, wood and chemicals.
The survey's new orders index returned to growth, rising to 53.3 in January from 49.7 in December. Companies reported adding to their inventories in January after two months of declines, a sign that factories are preparing to increase production.
Slower growth in stockpiles was a major reason the economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.1 percent in the quarter from October to December, the first contraction in three and a half years.
Construction spending rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $885 billion in December, up 0.9 percent from November when spending increased a revised 0.1 percent. For all of 2012, construction spending totaled $850.2 billion, a gain of 9.2 percent from 2011, when construction spending had fallen 3.3 percent. Even with the increase, construction activity is 27.2 percent below its high of $1.17 trillion in 2006 at the peak of the housing boom.
Construction has been posting a slow recovery, led by housing gains. In December, housing and nonresidential construction posted gains but spending on government projects fell.

HEADLINE: As Growth Lags, Some Press Fed To Do Still More

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In the five months since the Federal Reserve started a campaign to increase growth and reduce unemployment, the economy has slowed and unemployment has increased.
The Labor Department said on Friday that the jobless rate rose to 7.9 percent last month, up from 7.8 percent in December, in the latest evidence that the economy still is not growing fast enough to repair the damage of a recession that ended in 2009.
Some economists found the disappointing data an indication the Fed had reached the limit of its powers, or at least of prudent action. But there is evidence that the Fed is not trying as hard as it could to stimulate growth: it is allowing inflation to fall well below the 2 percent pace it considers most healthy.
Inflation, unlike job creation, is something the Fed can control with some precision. Higher inflation could accelerate economic growth and job creation by encouraging people to spend more and make riskier investments. 
Yet annualized inflation fell to 1.3 percent in December, and asset prices reflect an expectation that the pace will remain well below 2 percent in the next decade.
''By their own framework, they're not doing enough,'' said Justin Wolfers, an economist at the University of Michigan. ''They said that they were going to expand the economy and keep inflation around 2 percent, and they just haven't done it.''
The rest of the government is making that task more difficult. Federal spending cuts, tax increases and the prospect of further cuts March 1 are hurting growth. The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has warned repeatedly that monetary policy cannot offset such fiscal austerity.
And it is likely that the latest economic data does not reflect the full impact of the Fed's efforts. Despite the rise in unemployment, job creation has increased in recent months, consumer spending has strengthened and the housing market is healing. Partly because monetary policy is slow-acting, most forecasters expect modest growth this year.
But the Fed also is acting with a clear measure of restraint. Mr. Bernanke and other officials have made clear that they believe the central bank could do more to increase the pace of inflation and bolster growth and job creation. They simply are not persuaded that the benefits outweigh the potential costs -- in particular, the risk that their efforts will distort asset prices and seed future financial crises.
The Fed is constrained in part because it already has done so much. The central bank has held short-term interest rates near zero since December 2008, and it has accumulated almost $3 trillion in Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities to push down long-term rates and encourage riskier investments.
Under its newest effort, announced in September and extended in December, it will increase its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage bonds by $85 billion a month until the job market improves. The Fed also said that it planned to hold short-term rates near zero even longer, at least until the unemployment rate fell below 6.5 percent.
In normal times, the Fed would respond to flagging inflation and growth by cutting interest rates. At present, it could still increase the scale of its asset purchases. The two policies work in a similar way, stimulating economic activity by reducing borrowing costs and encouraging risk-taking. But asset purchases are a less direct method to reduce rates, and the available evidence suggests that the effect is less powerful.
The Fed's holdings of mortgage bonds and Treasuries also are growing so large that it could begin to distort pricing in those markets, and some transactions could be disrupted by a dearth of safe assets. Some Fed officials are concerned that asset prices for farmland, junk bonds and other risky assets are being pushed to unsustainable levels. As a result, Mr. Bernanke has said, the Fed is doing less than it otherwise would.
''We have to pay very close attention to the costs and the risks and the efficacy of these nonstandard policies as well as the potential economic benefits,'' Mr. Bernanke said last month, in response to a question about the low pace of inflation. ''Economics tells you when something is more costly, you do a little bit less of it.''
The Fed to some extent may be a prisoner of its own success in persuading investors over the last three decades that it was determined to keep inflation below 2 percent. It said in December that it would let expected inflation in the next two to three years rise as high as 2.5 percent. But expectations have not budged.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland calculated in a January report that average expected inflation over the next decade was just 1.48 percent per year.
Fed officials themselves generally expect somewhat higher inflation, but their most recent predictions, published in January, still show that none of the 19 policy makers expected inflation to exceed 2 percent over the next two years.
''It's been harder to create expected inflation than I thought before this crisis,'' said Mark Thoma, a professor of economics at the University of Oregon. ''Probably because of their own credibility, nobody believes them even if they say it.''
But Professor Thoma and others also note that the Fed could be trying harder. Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials have been careful to say that they will tolerate inflation expectations above 2 percent while also insisting that it is not a Fed goal to push expectations above 2 percent.
At the meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee last week, none of the 12 voting members supported stronger action to increase inflation or growth. One member voted in opposition to continuing the existing efforts.
''They are doing $85 billion a month in purchases. Well, there's a number that's twice as large as 85 and twice as large as that,'' said Professor Wolfers. ''It's clear that they can do more. But they keep saying one thing and doing another.''
That reluctance ultimately reflects the enduring conviction of many Fed officials that their most important responsibility is maintaining stable inflation in the long run.
When inflation rises unpredictably, it disrupts economic activity by making it impossible for companies to tell the difference between increased demand for their products and generally higher prices. High inflation also taxes wealth, rewarding borrowers at the expense of lenders by eroding the value of fixed payments.
''We, the Federal Reserve, have spent 30 years building up credibility for low and stable inflation, which has proved extremely valuable in that we've been able to take strong accommodative actions in the last four, five years,'' Mr. Bernanke said last year, when asked why the Fed would not push inflation higher to hasten the pace of the economic recovery. ''To risk that asset for what I think would be quite tentative and perhaps doubtful gains on the real side would be, I think, an unwise thing to do.''

HEADLINE: A Nigerian Spring -- Long Overdue

BYLINE: By MAY AKABOGU-COLLINS

 BODY:
Paris
I was a visiting professor in Paris last fall and it was the first day of class. I was making copies for my 10:30 class at the faculty lounge where two female professors were kibitzing by the coffee machine.
''Oh, yeah,'' one said. ''Soon as I learned he's Nigerian, I discounted everything he'd said as fraud.'' 
''Smart move,'' agreed the other, nodding, ''nothing good's ever come out of that country. ...''
I cringed, held my breath and skedaddled on to my classroom, where my students wanted to know my nationality. I'm American. ''Bot Professa,'' an African student's hand flew up, ''ware you from originally? I hear the voice of Africa.''
I inhaled deeply, chuckled but ignored that question.
When I left Nigeria for the United States in 1980, the plan was to earn an M.B.A., a doctorate in economics, and then return. It was my moral obligation to help develop my country, whose oil wealth financed my education. An M.B.A., a Ph.D. and 32 years later, I'm still here, abroad. In 1992, when I applied for a position at my alma mater, the University of Ibadan, the dean replied, ''Why on earth would you want to return when everybody's trying to escape?'' No one's been paid for over three months, he explained, and universities are on strike half the time.
Twenty years later, Nigeria can still bring the crazy.
In 1980, the naira had a very favorable exchange rate against the dollar. En route to the United States, I stopped over in London. All along King's Road, the shopkeepers beckoned: ''Nigerian? Welcome. Come inside.'' I was proud to be from Nigeria and was offended when the country was confused with Niger. But, today, if I can pass for someone from Niger -- sadly, I would be glad.
Is there a person on the planet who remains unfamiliar with the Nigerian e-mail scam? As a Nigerian living abroad, I've become embarrassed -- indeed scared -- after learning that in February 2003 a Czech victim of an Internet fraud murdered an innocent Nigerian in Prague.
That isn't the scariest narrative -- not by a long shot. In recent years, Nigerians abroad have been warned: ''Don't come home. Just send money.'' But if one must, say, attend a wedding, a funeral or take a chieftaincy title, it is necessary to hire prearranged police protection from the moment you land at the airport until the moment you depart.
Last summer, my ailing 87-year-old mother, worried that her days are numbered, called a family reunion for Christmas. My three U.S.-based siblings and I made plans to return home with all our kids. At the last minute, my brother sent an e-mail canceling the reunion. ''What?'' my daughter said, her glass of iced tea slipping out of her hands and shattering on the tile floor. Uncle Tony can't guarantee our safety in Nigeria, I explained.
''What about hired armed security like the last time?'' she inquired. I showed her the link to the news report my brother had sent headlined, ''Gunmen Kill U.S. Returnee in Enugu,'' his hometown in Nigeria.
Ogbo Edoga had returned from the United States to attend the meeting of an organization of Nigerian professionals in the United States to raise funds for an ultramodern medical diagnostic center in his ancestral village. On his way, he was robbed and shot and killed with an AK-47. He had hired police protection, as had many Nigerians who visited our motherland only to be robbed and murdered. The lucky ones got kidnapped and released after their families paid a huge ransom. And now, Mom's joined the choir: ''Don't come home.''
Here's what is shameful: This is the Nigeria that has been one of the world's top 10 oil exporters for decades; the presumed ''Giant of Africa'' when I was leaving in 1980. But three decades later, despite a half-century of billions of petrodollar inflow, in March 2011, at a World Bank-O.E.C.D. conference in Paris, I found myself sliding down my chair to hide my face behind my laptop as a fellow economist explained why Nigeria was excluded in a comparative study thusly: Since Nigeria (with South Africa) dominates the Sub-Saharan African economy and since Nigeria does so poorly at wealth creation, if included, it would render Sub-Saharan Africa's genuine savings dwarfish vis-à-vis East Asia and Latin America.
Here's the thing: One doesn't need a Ph.D. in economics to understand the correlation between poverty and today's high crime rate in Nigeria. When corrupt politicians persistently embezzle public funds rather than produce proper policies, the result is a stagnant economy and its attendant human misery -- high unemployment and massive poverty. Marginalized youths resort to Internet scams, kidnapping, or join Boko Haram. When the police go unpaid for months, the citizens become the logical prey.
That's where Nigeria is today. It will not change until we, the people, join in a mass outrage against corruption, demand transparent accounting of our oil revenues and economic justice. Only then will an honest leadership emerge to invest a fair share of the oil revenues in capital in such a way as to permanently raise the consumption level of the masses. Otherwise we Nigerian expatriates -- the most educated immigrant group in the United States -- will remain in exile, and Nigeria will remain a breeding ground for terrorism.
Is there an Honest Ernest among Nigerians who is able to galvanize us? Can something that good come out of Nigeria? That's a palm reader's guess.
May Akabogu-Collins is a visiting professor of economics at the American Business School in Paris.

JOHN Kerry's overwhelming confirmation as the next U.S. secretary of state presents a welcome opportunity to consider what the point of the job is. Now that Hillary Clinton has left Foggy Bottom for a well-earned rest, it's worth stating that public diplomacy -- even of the remarkably successful kind that she embodied -- was not Thomas Jefferson's idea of being the country's chief diplomat, nor, one suspects, Clinton's.
An extraordinarily able and shrewd politician with an unmatched global Rolodex, Clinton accepted early on a circumscribed definition of the role for reasons that probably only she truly knows. For the United States, and the world, however, it has left a legacy of diplomatic detachment from a range of conflicts and challenges that require more than occasional presidential rhetoric and judicious reserve about the use of military force. 
Looking back, it is clear that the role of secretary of state in the Obama administration was constructed around primarily domestic priorities: first, managing successfully the poisonous political rivalry between the two giants of the Democratic Party; second, reassuring the American public that the ''era of wars'' was indeed coming to an end; and third, that when America would project its power and influence to neutralize national security threats, it would be far more in the form of drones and special forces than diplomats.
The great promise of a president uniquely prepared by heritage, intellect and experience to guide America's 21st century global mission with a global perspective gave way to a largely reluctant, conventional -- and highly militarized -- form of engagement with the world.
Underlying these political motivations was the deeply held belief that in the aftermath of the Great Recession the country's global position was defined entirely by its economic strength. ''Foreign policy begins at home'' became a mantra as familiar in the era of economic crisis as ''Yes, we can'' was during the 2008 campaign.
Generals were quoted approvingly stating that the greatest threat to U.S. national security was the budget deficit. Bank bailouts, debt-ceilings and fiscal cliffs consumed not only the attention and energy of the White House -- for electoral as much as national reasons -- but defined sharply down the priority of new foreign policy initiatives (beyond, that is, the vastly expanded secret campaign of targeted assassinations of suspected Al Qaeda terrorists).
What this legacy bequeaths to Kerry are two false choices that he must confront without alienating that same White House from which he will ultimately derive his influence. First, it is time to recognize that foreign policy begins just as often, and just as importantly, abroad. To be sure, from the earliest days of the Republic through World War II it has been understood that America's global influence is built on its ability to back words with resources, and diplomacy with arms, investments and trade agreements.
Even so, Chinese nationalism, terrorism in the Sahel, a savage civil war in Syria, climate change, cyberwarfare, the Iranian nuclear program and the E.U. crisis are challenges with distinct roots and reasons far beyond the shores of America. They need to be encountered and understood out there -- through patient, strategic and often uncomfortable negotiations that recognize the value of listening as much as talking.
Otherwise, the risk of surprise on the scale of the one that struck on that cloudless day in New York a decade ago will remain -- and indeed increase -- in a fragmenting, rapidly changing world.
Second, Kerry must mount a new challenge to Washington's ossified debate about intervention as an instrument of foreign policy. Syria will soon present him with the best (or worst, as the case may turn out) reason to do so. For the president's critics, the U.S. should have taken a much more active, military, role far sooner -- including arming the opposition, imposing a no-flight zone and conducting targeted strikes against the regime.
President Obama in an interview with The New Republic this week elaborated on why all of these options seem to him deeply unpalatable -- dwelling on everything from the risk of triggering the use of chemical weapons, to the impact on operations in Afghanistan, to the relative merits of acting in Syria vs. acting in the Congo in order to save lives.
Of course, the fact that there isn't a simple military solution to the Syria crisis is precisely what makes a dramatic and sustained diplomatic initiative so urgent -- and its absence so troubling (and the same argument can be made in relation to the Iranian nuclear challenge). One need have no illusions about the Russian or Chinese views of the crisis to appreciate that without a genuine negotiation where they will have to get in order to give, the slaughter will continue -- and risks of regional escalation spike.
But such has been the near-complete militarization of U.S. foreign policy over the past decade that for all intents and purposes the only alternative presented to an invasion of the country is a combination of drone strikes and targeted killings. The tried and tested principle of diplomacy backed by the threat of force has seen a near-total inversion. Axiomatic now as the only alternative to doing nothing is the use of lethal force backed by the occasional choice of diplomacy as clean-up job.
This is unworthy of a great power -- and a great foreign service. During his confirmation hearings, Kerry stated that ''American foreign policy is not defined by drones and deployments alone.'' If that remark is to be remembered as more than one man's expression of hope over experience, he will have to make it so.
To engage, to cajole, to give and take, to offer incentives to allies and enemies alike in pursuit of interests global and national, political and economic, to wield diplomatic power and influence as only America can: That is Kerry's opportunity now -- and his challenge.

HEADLINE: Buying Wine on the Web

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

 BODY:
PARIS -- In an ever more digital world, there are a few things that remain reassuringly analog. Wine, for example. The mysteries of a Montrachet or the magic of a Margaux remain too complex and too nuanced to reduce to the zeros and ones of digital DNA, though I imagine someone must be trying. Although technology has its limitations in the making of wine, it is increasingly useful in the buying and selling of it.
The Internet accounts for only a tiny fraction of worldwide wine sales. Most people buy their wine at local shops or supermarkets. But online sales have been growing strongly for a few years in Britain, Germany and some other European markets, as well as China and Japan. There are signs of progress in the United States, where regulatory hurdles have been a problem.
At the end of last year, Amazon opened an online wine shop in the United States. Presumably the e-commerce giant hopes to do for Bordeaux or Barolo what it has done for books: Make a previously unimaginable selection available to anyone, anywhere, at any time and at a bargain price. 
But Internet wine sales in the United States have been complicated by Byzantine rules. Some states forbid online sales, others restrict cross-border shipments. Others maintain monopolies over distribution. So Amazon is starting with only a handful of states and the District of Columbia.
Europe, so fragmented and divided in other ways, is more coherent and unified in this niche of the economy. From my home in France I can order wine online from almost any other European Union country and expect it to show up at my door in a few days.
The only variable is cost. For some reason, Italian parcel services tend to charge more than &#x20ac;50 to ship a 12-bottle case of wine to France, about $70. German delivery companies often do the job, faster, for less than &#x20ac;20. There you have the euro crisis in a nutshell -- or a case of wine. Still, my cellar would be a lot poorer without those occasional deliveries from the sunny south.
The most advanced online wine market is probably Britain. Wine Intelligence, a research firm in London, estimates that up to 15 percent of all retail wine sales in Britain take place online -- perhaps five times the U.S. percentage.
Growth in Britain has been led by supermarket chains like Tesco, which have been using wine as a way to promote Internet grocery shopping services. But specialist British wine merchants like Berry Brothers & Rudd were also early online innovators, opening e-commerce sites well over a decade ago.
''Not only do we like wine, but we also like the Internet,'' said Antonia Branston, an analyst at the research firm Euromonitor in London. More and more British online wine specialists, like Laithwaites, Slurp and Naked Wines, are expanding to other countries in Europe, the United States or Asia. Slurp, for example, opened sites in Germany and France last year. While the prospect of a British Web site trying to sell wine to the French might sound a bit like carrying coals to Newcastle, Slurp insists there is a place for it.
''Basically, France is very focused on French wine,'' said Audrey Bouttier, who oversees Slurp's Continental European sites. ''We are trying to do something a little bit different. Especially among young people, it's becoming very hip to bring something other than the traditional bottle of Bordeaux to a dinner party.''
So Slurp offers a vast selection of what the French call ''vins du monde'' (wines of the world), or imported wines.
Greater choice is one of the biggest benefits of Internet wine shopping, but beware of exaggerated claims. While I often buy wine via the Internet, I rarely use generalist sites that promise a bit of everything -- some Burgundy, some Bordeaux, some Australian shiraz and maybe a bit of Napa Valley cabernet, too.
Why? Isn't the promise of anything, anywhere the raison d'être of the Web? Perhaps, but wine continues to confound the algorithm-writers' efforts to commoditize it. Many of the best wines are made in quantities too small to suit the national or global scale of the Internet.
Many big wine Web sites simply offer the same bottles you see on the supermarket shelves, at the same prices. To get the best wines, retailers need local knowledge and connections. Many of the best online wine sellers are offshoots of local shops, located in wine regions.
While small shops struggled initially with the challenge of the Internet, many of them now sell wine online. That means even more consumer choice, though you'll need help navigating the maze. This is where perhaps the most useful Internet wine site of all, Wine-Searcher, comes in.
Wine-Searcher, based in Auckland doesn't actually sell wine but helps you find it. It lists the offerings of tens of thousands of merchants around the world and links to their Web sites. Whether you're looking for something as ubiquitous as Mouton Cadet Bordeaux or something as rare as a Riesling Trockenbeerenauslese from Egon Müller in Germany, Wine-Searcher will point you to the right place, and show you the prices.
There is something reassuring about buying wine from retailers with a track record. In France, some online-only retailers have employed questionable business models. Several customers of 1855.com, a French site that is named after the year of the first classification of Bordeaux chateaus, have filed lawsuits and won court judgments against the company over delayed or unfilled orders.
The problem appears to have been that 1855 offered for sale wines that it did not actually own. When a customer bought one, the company tried to acquire it elsewhere, at a lower price. But certain wines, like prized vintages of Bordeaux, instead surged ahead. Like a hedge fund caught in a ''short squeeze,'' 1855 found itself having to pay more to buy wine than it had made selling it.
1855 said it was dealing with the problems. ''The peak of complaints is now behind us, and all should be cleared within six months,'' the company said in a statement.
But some investors seem to have doubts. A leading shareholder in 1855, Jean-Pierre Meyers, son-in-law to the L'Oréal heiress Liliane Bettencourt, sold his stake and severed his ties to the company.
Elsewhere, however, online shops are sometimes seen as more reliable than the bricks and mortar kind. Yes My Wine, a Chinese Web site that has been growing rapidly, is an example. Consumers apparently trust the site more than their local shops in China, where fake wines abound -- the transport and storage of real ones is shoddy as well.
As a result, online wine sales are starting to take off in China, a potentially enormous market, given the enthusiasm for the Internet and, as of the past few years, for fine wine. Wine Intelligence estimates that about five million Chinese shop for wine online -- about a quarter of those who say they are regular buyers of imported wine.
So, while big players like Amazon dominate many areas of the digital economy, there doesn't appear to be a universally successful approach to online wine selling.
''It's not like insurance or flights,'' said Richard Halstead, chief operating officer of Wine Intelligence. ''There's a lot of local variation.''
As there is with what's in the bottle.

HEADLINE: A Stock Rally in Japan, the Likes of Which It Hasn't Seen for Decades

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- The year 1959 was in many ways remarkable. America granted Alaska and Hawaii statehood, Fidel Castro took power in Cuba and Singapore gained its independence from Britain. The Barbie doll and pantyhose went on sale for the first time; Miles Davis recorded ''Kind of Blue'' at a New York studio.
Until Friday, 1959 was also the last time the Nikkei 225 stock index rallied for 12 straight weeks, driven by the quickening pace of Japan's postwar economic boom. Now the index has repeated that feat, rising 0.47 percent to 11,191.34 on Friday to finish the week up 2.5 percent. The Japanese business media have been quick to jump on the historical tidbit, trumpeting the Nikkei's best weekly run in 54 years. The rally in 1959 actually lasted 17 weeks. 
This time around, the Nikkei's rally was motivated by the new Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe. Mr. Abe has galvanized markets by encouraging bold monetary measures to beat deflation, and hefty government spending to jump-start the economy. The result has been a weakening of the yen by 15 percent over the past three months, a boon for Japanese exporters, and a 25 percent surge in the stock market over the same period.
''The expectations pinned on Prime Minister Abe's drive to tackle deflation and the strong yen are the driving force pushing stocks toward this postwar record,'' the Nikkei newspaper said.
The market's climb comes despite lackluster earnings by Japanese companies. Of the 54 companies on the Nikkei index that had posted results for the October-to-December quarter by Thursday, nearly two-thirds missed market expectations, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, the investment research service. And for now, households have remained cool to the market buzz. Japanese household spending fell 0.7 percent in December from a year earlier in price-adjusted real terms, government data released Friday showed.
Nevertheless, Mr. Abe's policies, dubbed ''Abenomics,'' are having ''a positive psychological effect'' on investors and corporate executives, Yasushi Hoshi, director of capital markets at the Daiwa Institute of Research, wrote in a note published Friday. ''And the exchange rate and stock prices, if sustained, could themselves push up corporate earnings, leading to better corporate and consumer sentiment in a positive cycle.''
There are already signs that the weaker yen is bolstering some earnings. The video game maker Nintendo raised its profit forecast for its current financial year on Thursday even as the company reported disappointing sales of its game consoles.
Overall investor optimism is giving companies the benefit of the doubt. Honda Motor surprised investors Thursday by trimming its profit outlook, citing sluggish demand in China and Europe, but they still snapped up Honda shares early on Friday, and the stock finished the day 0.3 percent higher.
Still, there are budding concerns that Mr. Abe's drive will bring about a dangerous bubble. ''The results in the near term are an investment boom and bubble, but the longer-run consequences could be soaring inflation and fiscal crisis, followed by lengthy economic stagnation,'' Ryutaro Kono, chief economist for Japan at BNP Paribas Securities, wrote in a recent report.
From a historical perspective, the Nikkei index and other asset prices remain far below the heights seen during Japan's last economic bubble, in the late 1980s. For many global investors, the recent rally has only begun to reverse a slump in Japanese equities that has taken them to levels seen as ridiculously low. Shares on Tokyo's broader Topix index long traded below their book value, meaning that prices were less than what the companies would fetch if they were dissolved and their parts sold off.
Now, foreign investors are leading the charge, having poured a net ¥248.6 billion, or $2.7 billion, into Japanese stocks in the fourth week of January alone.
''We think there is latent demand because supply in this space has dwindled over the years and investors are thinking about coming back,'' Patric de Gentile-Williams of Financial Risk Management, told the Hedge Funds Review on Wednesday, after making a $25 million investment in a Japanese equity fund run by Arena Capital Management. ''If the new prime minister's actions have a big effect, they might come back in a big way.''
Is Japan, then, on course for a wider recovery?
Not so fast, Yusuke Shimoda, an economist at the Japan Research Institute in Tokyo, wrote in a note to clients this past week. Japan's recovery could sputter, he said, if the government cannot match its asset-inflating moves with growth strategies for the real economy. ''It will be critical to put a growth strategy in action that will start a self-sustained recovery,'' Mr. Shimoda said.
Nevertheless, Japan forecast Monday that its economy would grow by 2.5 percent in the fiscal year that starts in April, raising an earlier projection of 1.7 percent -- an impressive rate for the world's third-largest economy after the United States and China. Impressive, that is, unless investors look back to Japan's rate of gross domestic product growth in 1959, which was 12.1 percent.

HEADLINE: Message Mixed From Factories in China

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Asian manufacturers face a challenging business climate in the coming months, surveys released Friday suggested, with China's huge factory sector managing only a shallow rebound at the start of 2013 as feeble foreign demand dragged on sales.
Two surveys of Chinese factory purchasing managers showed that industrial output in the world's fastest-growing major economy rose in January but that the pace of the rebound in activity was uneven. 
China's official purchasing managers' index, or P.M.I., released by the government's statistics bureau, showed that factory output had grown more slowly than expected in January, with a reading of 50.4 points, easing from 50.6 in December and below a forecast for a nine-month high of 50.9.
The official P.M.I. has been above 50 points, the level that separates growth from contraction, since last August, though its failure to break above 51 indicates that the economic expansion it signals is moderate.
The Chinese factory P.M.I. from the British bank HSBC, which is more focused on smaller, privately held businesses than its official counterpart, rose to a two-year high of 52.3. HSBC's preliminary figure for the month, released Jan. 24, had put the measure at 51.9.
Trade prospects in China, the world's biggest exporter, appeared darker than those elsewhere. The manufacturing reports showed that export orders either grew marginally or shrank in January as shoppers in the United States and Europe, the two biggest buyers of Chinese goods, cut back spending.
Domestic demand, on the other hand, was the main force behind China's gentle economic rebound, driving growth in new orders in January to the highest in several months. The official P.M.I. showed growth in new orders at a nine-month high of 51.6, while the same measure in the HSBC survey climbed to a two-year high of 53.7.
However, price pressures were shown to be building in China, with the both surveys indicating input prices at their highest since mid-2011.
''January's P.M.I. does raise some red flags about the state of the economy,'' Alistair Thornton, an economist at IHS Global Insight in Beijing, said in reference to the Chinese economy. ''Things look a little shaky.''
The patchy nature of the recovery on Chinese factory floors was repeated in other P.M.I.'s released across Asia.
Surveys showed that manufacturing output had slowed or declined in India and South Korea. Factories in Indonesia, the star emerging economy of the past year, experienced a decline in business in January for the first time in eight months, while manufacturers in Taiwan reported the fastest growth in 10 months.
Indonesian manufacturers said they had received more orders from abroad, but output at factories there still declined for the first time since last May. The P.M.I. retreated to 49.7 in January from 50.7 in December as domestic demand in the Indonesian economy, Southeast Asia's largest, dragged.
''Strong export orders appear to have offset a moderation in domestic orders, which may have been partially impacted by the Jakarta floods,'' said Su Sian Lim, an economist at HSBC, referring to widespread flooding in the Indonesian capital last month.
In Taiwan, the P.M.I. reached a 10-month high of 51.5 as factories raised output markedly. In South Korea, factories reported their first growth in export orders in eight months, but the P.M.I. edged down to a seasonally adjusted 49.9 in January from 50.1 in December.
The data released Friday showed that India was as vulnerable as China to an export slump, especially as demand from Europe crumbled. Growth in Indian factory output eased to a three-month low of 53.2 in January, retreating from the six-month high in December of 54.7 as new export orders slowed.
''The growth momentum in the manufacturing sector eased in January as a slower expansion in new orders slowed output growth,'' Leif Eskesen, an economist at HSBC, said of the Indian purchasing managers' survey.

HEADLINE: Critics Say Proposed Guidelines for Japan's Nuclear Industry Will Hinder Business

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Proposed new safety guidelines for Japan's nuclear industry -- strict enough that they could keep reactors shuttered for years for emergency upgrades -- have set off intense political maneuvering by those who say the regulations will cripple business just as hopes were rising for economic relief.
The relatively stiff requirements by a panel that included nuclear power supporters appeared to take Japan's nuclear industry and its backers in government by surprise, and pose a challenge to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe just weeks into his term. 
Mr. Abe has made it clear that he wanted to restart Japan's scores of idled reactors -- all but two of which remain offline in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima plant disaster -- and has even said that he wanted to build new ones. But he and his Liberal Democratic Party, the architect of Japan's nuclear industry, already faced significant opposition from a population that was traumatized by the nuclear crisis that spread radioactive materials over a wide swath of the country's northeast.
The crisis at the Fukushima plant, which led to meltdowns in three reactors, started after a 9.0 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami that swept through the plant, knocking out the electrical power needed to run crucial cooling systems.
The guidelines require a secondary command center away from the reactor buildings so that workers can control emergency cooling systems and vents even if they are forced to pull back from the heart of the plant during an emergency. They also call for power companies to prepare for worse tsunamis than they had previously planned for, forcing at least some oceanside plants to raise sea walls, a costly endeavor.
The rules also ban power companies from building or operating reactors on top of active faults, but continuing contentious discussions over what an ''active'' fault consists of might allow the government to avoid closing such plants for good.
Many of the proposed regulations bring Japan in line with standards in the United States.
The new guidelines are the latest step in Japan's struggle to chart its energy future after the disaster. Previous governments led by the Democratic Party had given vague promises to phase out nuclear power as polls indicated that many people feared nuclear power and remained worried that the collusive ties between government and the industry that left the country vulnerable to disaster were ones that could not be broken.
But Mr. Abe has argued that keeping the reactors idle would hinder a recovery he is trying to jump-start with promises to tackle deflation that have already led to a weakening in the yen welcomed by struggling exporters. Nuclear energy had provided 30 percent of the nation's electricity needs before the disaster.
With virtually all of its reactors offline, Japan has been forced to import more fossil fuels, driving resource-poor Japan to a record annual trade deficit last year. Before the accident, the country consistently posted large trade surpluses.
Still, Mr. Abe's ability to sway the panel -- or try to overrule it -- might be limited. The regulatory body has been given significant autonomy, and is able to take a wide range of actions without government approval, partly as a result of maneuvering by Mr. Abe's own party when it was out of power. Fearing the anti-nuclear agenda of some in the then-ruling Democratic Party, the Liberal Democrats had demanded that the body be insulated from political pressure.
But supporters of Japan's powerful nuclear industry appeared to be starting a campaign Friday to ensure that the rules did not go into effect as they were.
''If we don't have a stable energy supply, how are businesses supposed to invest and help Japan grow?'' Hiromasa Yonekura, chairman of the Japan Business Federation, told reporters Friday.
Japan's ten nuclear operators, including Tokyo Electric Power, the operator of the ravaged Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, could pay a total of 1 trillion yen to make the required reinforcements, the Nikkei business daily reported Friday, quoting estimates from the power companies.
The panel is expected to finalize the rules in July after a public hearing process, and there are lingering suspicions among anti-nuclear activists that the new panel will ultimately go easy on the country's nuclear operators. Though nuclear power plants must meet the new guidelines before reactor restarts are cleared, the panel has left open the possibility that some standards could be suspended to allow limited reactor restarts.
The five-member nuclear authority was put in place after complaints that previous regulators were too close to industry.

HEADLINE: Job Growth Still Steady, But Rate Rises to 7.9%

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
Political gridlock over fiscal policy didn't push the economy off a cliff. But it certainly isn't helping anything, either.
Despite the chaos and uncertainty hovering over tax rates and government budget cuts at the turn of the year, job growth accelerated at the end of 2012 and was even faster than originally estimated, the Labor Department said on Friday. Job growth also continued at a steady if modest pace in January, with employers adding 157,000 payroll positions, though the unemployment rate ticked up to 7.9 percent.
Better readings on construction spending, manufacturing and consumer sentiment released on Friday also allayed fears that had arisen from a sour report on the nation's economic growth earlier in the week.
The upward revisions to job growth, in particular, encouraged traders on Wall Street, sending the Dow Jones industrial average over 14,000 for the first time since 2007. 
''The economy, sales, employment and the stock market are all higher in spite of the bickering and rancor in Washington,'' said Bernard Baumohl, the chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group. The latest numbers ''all point to an economy that is building steam and a private sector that seems almost dismissive to the sequestration and debt ceiling threats from Washington.''
Still, job growth has been modest compared with previous recoveries, and the unemployment rate has been stuck just below 8 percent since September. And Washington is gearing up for yet another showdown over fiscal policy, with severe spending cuts kicking in on March 1 if Congress fails to reach a budget bargain, just as Americans are starting to notice the larger tax bite in their paychecks from higher payroll and income taxes.
''Negotiations over the debt ceiling and the budget resolution and sequestration have the potential to be very messy and very extended,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomic Advisors. Businesses still seem ''very vulnerable to surprises. I don't think we've got the solidity and robustness and willingness to look beyond these short-term disturbances yet,'' he said.
Within January's employment report, construction was one of the more encouraging areas, adding jobs in each of the last four months. This was probably the result of rebuilding from Hurricane Sandy, unseasonably warm weather that led to fewer work stoppages and the nascent housing recovery, said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR.
Retailing, health care and the wholesale trade also added positions in January, while the government again shed jobs. Government payrolls shrank in most months over the last four years. The pullback in government spending, especially on the military, led to a slight contraction in fourth-quarter gross domestic product, reported on Wednesday. The decline in military spending was partly caused by uncertainty over the fiscal impasse, which eased temporarily with a compromise in Washington at the start of the year.
Friday's employment report was ''a reminder of the importance of the need for Congress to act to avoid self-inflicted wounds to the economy,'' Alan B. Krueger, the chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, said in a statement. Republican leaders countered with attacks on Mr. Obama's economic track record, with Representative Kevin Brady, the incoming chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, saying that ''a run-in-place jobs report and unemployment stuck near 8 percent'' is ''Obama's new normal.''
The revisions for the fourth quarter would seem to disprove accusations that the Obama administration inflated job growth ahead of the November election, since the original estimates were recalculated to show there was even more growth. The economy added 335,000 more jobs than originally estimated during all of 2012, including an additional 150,000 in the last quarter of the year. That was on top of the previously reported fourth-quarter job growth of 453,000 and 2012 growth of 1.8 million.
Still, hiring growth has been uninspiring in the last year, trudging along just barely fast enough to keep up with population growth but not nearly quickly enough to put a major dent in unemployment. A backlog of 12.3 million idle workers remains. The average worker who is unemployed has been pounding the pavement for 35 weeks.
''I have been working for 40 years and I have looked for jobs many times in the past, including in bad economies, and I've never experienced anything like this,'' said Mary Livingston, a human resources professional in Wayland, Mass. She was laid off two years ago on Friday.
She said she believed that employers were reluctant to hire her because of her age -- she is 63 -- and because she hadn't held a permanent job in so long. But she said they also seemed unwilling to hire anyone.
''I've seen positions posted two years ago that still have not been filled,'' she said. ''There seems to be this tremendous fear of making a decision. A lot of my colleagues will go for 15, 20, 23 interviews with the same company.''
Uncertainty over fiscal policy and the fragility of the economy still seem to be holding back employers, despite a number of underlying sources of growth in places like the housing market and auto sales. Economists are forecasting job growth of around 170,000 a month for the rest of 2013, comparable to job growth over the last year.
Exactly what this pace of job growth means for the unemployment rate depends on whether many of the workers sitting on the sidelines decide to join, or rejoin, the labor force. Right now, labor force participation rates -- that is, the share of people of working age who are working or looking for jobs -- is 63.6 percent, close to a 30-year low.
Only those who are actively looking for work are counted as unemployed, so if labor force participation stays low, even modest job growth can cause the unemployment rate to fall quite a bit. It has come down several percentage points since peaking at 10 percent in October 2009.
''The decline in the unemployment rate really masks how protracted the crisis really is,'' said Christine L. Owens, the executive director of the National Employment Law Project, a labor research and advocacy group. ''It's coming down largely for the wrong reason: because people are dropping out of the labor market or not entering it.''For the long-term unemployed -- who now represent nearly 40 percent of all jobless workers -- the opportunities still seem few and far between. Millions have exhausted their unemployment benefits, and many more will roll off the government's system in the coming months with no options in sight.
''Who are these people who are getting jobs? Where are they? I don't know them,'' said Karen Duckett, 51, who was laid off from her job as director of housekeeping at a retirement community in late 2011. She recently received a letter saying her benefits would end in two weeks because the unemployment rate in Maryland, where she lives, had fallen below 7 percent, so the state no longer qualified for the third tier of federal emergency benefits.
''I am just so angry right now,'' said Ms. Duckett, who has been invited for only two job interviews despite submitting dozens of applications. ''How do you expect for me to find a job in two weeks if I haven't been able to find one in a year and a half?''

HEADLINE: Dow Tops 14,000 for the First Time Since 2007

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 14,000 on Friday for the first time in more than five years, raising hopes for some investors and causing others to worry about an overheated market. 
The Dow had been rising steadily for about a month. With auto sales strong and optimism about the jobs market high, the index was only 155 points away from its highest nominal close.
''There's a newfound enthusiasm for the equity market,'' said Jim Russell, regional investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.
The Dow ended Friday 149.21 points higher, at 14,009.79. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 15.06 to 1,513.17, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 36.97, to 3,179.10.
Auto sales helped. Toyota, Ford, General Motors and Chrysler all reported double-digit gains for January. The government jobs report that was released Friday was mixed, but traders seemed to focus on the positive.
The Labor Department said 157,000 jobs were added in January, which was in line with expectations. Unemployment inched up to 7.9 percent from 7.8 percent in December, but many economists were encouraged because the government now says that hiring over the last year was higher than originally thought.
The jobs number is based on a survey of employers, and the unemployment rate is based on a separate survey of households, which is why they can diverge.
Market watchers were divided over what the potential for a new high really meant for the Dow. To some, it was a reason for optimism.
''The Dow touching 14,000 -- it matters psychologically,'' said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York. ''It attracts smaller investors.''
Those investors had been shying away from stocks. Since April 2011, investors have pulled more cash out of stock mutual funds than they have put in, according to the Investment Company Institute, a trade association. In the last three weeks, though, that trend has reversed, which could make January the first month in nearly two years when stock-focused funds had more money flowing in than flowing out.
To others, 14,000 was nothing but a number, and not even the best number on the board. Professional investors usually pay more heed to the S.& P. 500.
Joe Gordon, managing partner at Gordon Asset Management in Durham, N.C., says he does not think the gains will last. The fact that small investors are piling back in, he said, is a sign that the market has attracted too much optimism and is headed for a fall.
After the Dow hit its high in 2007, it fell almost steadily for the next year and a half, losing more than half its value before starting to tick back up.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 9/32, to 96 15/32, and the yield rose to 2.03 percent from 1.98 percent Thursday.
Before Friday, the Dow had closed above 14,000 just nine times. The first time was in July 2007; the rest were in October of that year.

HEADLINE: In a Memphis Cheating Ring, the Teachers Are the Accused

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH; John Branston contributed reporting from Memphis, and Alain Delaquérière from New York.

 BODY:
MEMPHIS -- In the end, it was a pink baseball cap that revealed an audacious test-cheating scheme in three Southern states that spanned at least 15 years.
Test proctors at Arkansas State University spotted a woman wearing the cap while taking a national teacher certification exam under one name on a morning in June 2009 and then under another name that afternoon. A supervisor soon discovered that at least two other impersonators had registered for tests that day.
Ensuing investigations ultimately led to Clarence D. Mumford Sr., 59, who pleaded guilty on Friday to charges that accused him of being the cheating ring's mastermind during a 23-year career in Memphis as a teacher, assistant principal and guidance counselor.
Federal prosecutors had indicted him on 63 counts, including mail and wire fraud and identify theft. They said he doctored driver's licenses, pressured teachers to lie to the authorities and collected at least $125,000 from teachers and prospective teachers in Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee who feared that they could not pass the certification exams on their own. 
Mr. Mumford pleaded guilty to two counts of the indictment, just a week after he rejected a settlement offer. At the time, he said that its recommended sentence of 9 to 11 years was ''too long a time and too severe''; the new settlement carries a maximum sentence of 7 years.
Mr. Mumford appeared in Federal District Court here on Friday wearing a dark suit and a matching yellow tie and pocket handkerchief. He said little more than ''Yes, sir'' in answer to questions from Judge John T. Fowlkes.
Another 36 people, most of them teachers from Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee, have been swept up in the federal dragnet, including Clarence Mumford Jr., Mr. Mumford's son, and Cedrick Wilson, a former wide receiver for the Pittsburgh Steelers. (Mr. Wilson paid $2,500 for someone to take a certification exam for physical education teachers, according to court documents.)
In addition to the senior Mr. Mumford, eight people have pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the investigation into the ring, and on Friday, a federal prosecutor, John Fabian, announced that 18 people who confessed to paying Mr. Mumford to arrange test-takers for them had been barred from teaching for five years.
The case has rattled Memphis at a tumultuous time. The city's schools are merging with the suburban district in surrounding Shelby County, exposing simmering tensions over race and economic disparity. The state has also designated 68 schools in the city as among the lowest-performing campuses in Tennessee, and is gradually handing control of some of them to charter operators and other groups. And with a $90 million grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the district is overhauling how it recruits, evaluates and pays teachers.
District officials say that the test scandal does not reflect broader problems, and that none of the indicted teachers still work in the Memphis schools. (At least one teacher is working in Mississippi.) ''It would be unfair to let what may be 50, 60 or 100 teachers who did some wrong stain the good work of the large number of teachers and administrators who get up every day and go by the book,'' said Dorsey Hopson, the general counsel for Memphis City Schools who this week was named the district's interim superintendent.
''A teacher's job is very hard. I know it is,'' said Threeshea Robinson, a mother who waited last week to pick up her son, a fourth grader at Raleigh-Bartlett Meadows Elementary School, where a teacher who has pleaded guilty taught until last fall. ''But I would not want a doctor who did not pass all his tests operating on me.''
The tests involved are known as Praxis exams, and more than 300,000 were administered last year by the nonprofit Educational Testing Service for people pursuing teaching licenses or new credentials in specific subjects like biology or history.
By and large, they are considered easy hurdles to clear. In Tennessee, for example, 97 percent of those who took the exams in the 2010-11 school year passed.
Robert Schaeffer, the public education director of FairTest, the National Center for Fair and Open Testing, said that the testing service had had problems with cheating before.
Ray Nicosia, the executive director of the testing service's Office of Testing Integrity, said episodes of impersonation were rare. ''More than 99 percent of the people take the test honestly with no problems at all,'' he said.
In the case of the Mumford ring, the testing service spent a year conducting an inquiry before turning over its information to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, which worked with the Secret Service and referred the case to Edward W. Stanton III, the United States attorney for the Western District of Tennessee.
According to court documents, Mr. Mumford began soliciting teachers to take the Praxis exams for others in 1995, and continued to do so until at least 2010, when he retired from the Memphis schools and went to work as a guidance counselor at a small district in Arkansas. He paid the teachers from $200 to $1,000 per test. In Friday's hearing, Mr. Fabian said one client who paid Mr. Mumford $6,000 for multiple exams never got a successful result.
Mr. Mumford's personnel file in Memphis, which was reviewed by The New York Times, shows that he received above-average performance ratings. Not long after he began hiring the test-takers, a mother accused him of abusing her son with a paddle. (Corporal punishment is legal in Tennessee.) Mr. Mumford was suspended without pay for two years until a judge cleared him of the abuse charges, and he returned to Memphis as a guidance counselor in 1999. He applied for several jobs as a principal -- describing himself in cover letters, misspellings and all, as an ''experienced school administerator'' -- but he never rose any higher in the ranks.
Yet he continued to recruit teachers to take the Praxis exams, according to court documents. Felippia Turner-Kellogg, who until recently was an elementary school teacher in Memphis, made about $4,000 for taking tests over an 18-month period, according to the documents. Ms. Turner-Kellogg, who describes herself on her Twitter account as ''on my way to millionaire status,'' told federal prosecutors that Mr. Mumford urged her to tell the authorities that he worked with test candidates because ''he was tutoring teachers.'' Ms. Turner-Kellogg, who has entered a guilty plea and awaits sentencing, declined to comment.
In some instances, Mr. Mumford recruited teachers with troubled track records. Carlos Shaw, who has pleaded guilty to taking tests for others, received a string of weak performance evaluations and resigned in 2007 after he was reprimanded for writing inappropriate notes to a 17-year-old female student. Mr. Shaw did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment, and his lawyer did not return telephone calls.
Court papers portray Mr. Mumford as a con man who persuaded reluctant teachers to join his scheme. Shantell Shaw, a Memphis high school science teacher, told federal investigators that she initially turned down Mr. Mumford's offer, then agreed once he introduced her to another teacher who he said had failed a Praxis exam 11 times and needed help ''so she could keep her job.''
Ms. Shaw's lawyer declined to comment.
It was Ms. Shaw's pink ball cap that drew particular attention on that June morning in 2009.
Four people, including Ms. Shaw, arrived late at the testing site, arousing suspicions. Proctors did not know she was taking a test in another woman's name, but when they went to look for her -- believing she would be taking another test in the same name -- they found John Bowen, a Memphis substitute teacher, taking the examination instead. The police at Arkansas State confiscated counterfeit driver's licenses that Mr. Bowen was carrying and referred the matter to the testing service. ''I kind of regret the people who are getting caught up in this,'' Mr. Bowen said in a brief telephone interview, ''including myself.''
Mr. Mumford declined requests for comment, but his lawyer, Coleman W. Garrett, said in an interview that ''it never dawned on him that he was a criminal.'' ''In his mind he was helping somebody,'' Mr. Garrett said.
Judge Fowlkes set Mr. Mumford's sentencing for May 13.

HEADLINE: Signs That It's Time for a New Broker

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER. 
Twitter: @ronlieber

 BODY:
Every so often, a story so perfectly illustrates what can go wrong when you trust someone with your money that it serves as a kind of user's manual for any investor who comes along afterward.
And so it is with the tale of Philip David Horn, the Wells Fargo broker who recently pleaded guilty to trading in clients' accounts, canceling the trades and helping himself to the profits. He may very well end up in jail, just as soon as the federal judge can figure out how much money is at stake and how to make those clients whole.
All the juicy stuff is here, as my colleagues Jessica Silver-Greenberg and Susanne Craig laid out in a front-page article last month. There are the country club solicitations (and confrontations), the brokerage firm that finally figured out what was going on after more than two years and the chastened Mr. Horn putting 800 hours into volunteer work and begging the judge to keep him out of prison.
But on the other side of those trades were sophisticated clients, including a lawyer and retired pharmaceutical and aerospace executives. They didn't notice what was going on, something that Wells Fargo's lawyer pointed out four times in just a few minutes at a hearing last month in Los Angeles. 
So should Mr. Horn's clients have seen this coming? Perhaps not. But could they have? In hindsight, there were four signs that things weren't quite right.
BROKER BRAGGING Mr. Horn reportedly bragged on the Braemar Country Club golf course in Tarzana, Calif., about his trades and then pulled paper records out of the trunk of his car in the country club parking lot to back up his boasts.
This is objectively odd behavior. Pitches should take place in an office or at a meeting spot of a potential client's choosing, over a sober deck of PowerPoint slides perhaps.
And if financial advisers are going to toot their own horns about the good they've done for others, you should be hearing about how they persuaded clients not to sell all of their stocks in the first quarter of 2009 when stocks were at their nadir, even though they desperately wanted to. Or you should be hearing that the adviser regularly informs clients of perfectly legal tax-saving maneuvers that they never even knew about. And you should be looking for an emotionally intelligent counselor who can negotiate a truce between you and your spouse over spending disputes.
If brokers want to brag about past performance, however, ask them this: Can you show me audited, long-term results across every part of all of your clients' portfolios? And can you guarantee that your good calls were related to skill and not luck?
BROKER TRADING The couple who suffered the most losses had multiple accounts with Mr. Horn, and their monthly statements, in aggregate, often ran more than 300 pages. Mr. Horn hid his in-and-out trading among all that verbiage.
Like it or not, if you're putting your money in somebody else's hands, you have the responsibility to read every line of your statements every month. People like Mr. Horn, who was a friend to many of his clients until he wasn't, count on the fact that you won't.
''I think the victims were picked because they weren't paying attention to their accounts, because each and every trade was documented,'' said Stephen Young, Wells Fargo's outside counsel in this case, according to a court transcript of a sentencing hearing in January.
Then if there is a lot of trading going on, you have the right to ask why. In a 1999 paper in the American Economic Review titled ''Do Investors Trade Too Much?'' Terrance Odean, now a professor the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, answered in the affirmative.
His 1999 research, which examined a group of discount brokerage customers, found that on average the things investors buy actually underperform the things they held in the first place. Their returns are reduced through trading.
In a 2009 paper that Mr. Odean wrote with three others, the group tried to figure out exactly how much individual investors lose by trading. Using data from Taiwanese investors, they determined that the answer was a whopping 3.8 percentage point penalty annually on overall portfolio performance. In an e-mail this week, Mr. Odean said that he believed that these conclusions could be extended to brokers trading actively for their clients, though he has never studied this explicitly.
The question for your gunslinging broker, then, is this: What makes you so much smarter than everyone else in the market? And is it even remotely possible that, on average, you'll be on the correct side of large numbers of trades?
BROKER FLAMBOYANCE In 2011, Mr. Horn invited some of his clients to his 1970s-themed 50th birthday party. It was at his country club, and he handed out CDs that said ''Phil's Saturday Night Fever'' on it with his head pasted in where John Travolta's should have been.
This is all in good fun, but the moment I saw it I immediately thought of the classic investing book ''Where Are the Customers' Yachts?'' (by Fred Schwed Jr.) named for the question asked by a curious visitor to New York who had seen bankers' and brokers' boats in the harbor and thought something might be amiss.
Financial advisers are free to charge as much as the market will bear, and there is no law against living comfortably and throwing themselves parties while they're at it. But if I had gotten an invitation like this, I would have wondered where my broker was when the self-awareness genes were being handed out.
YOUR COMPLACENCY Some of Mr. Horn's clients considered him their friend. But that's what confidence men count on, because they know that the most trusting among their clients will let their guards down.
Others figured that because he worked for a big brokerage shop, there must be people looking over his shoulder. ''This wasn't just Schlepper & Schlepper,'' as one client put it to The Times last month. But if we've learned anything at this point, it's that we should be more wary of people who work for large financial institutions, not less.
Mr. Horn's marks were themselves sophisticated in any number of ways. Once you've achieved a certain station in life, it's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that you know a thief when you see one or that you'll recognize a crooked scheme before the crook has taken you in. But most successful people do not, in fact, know enough about the ins and outs of investing to see through fraud when it's happening.
This is no sin, though it sure looked like Mr. Young, Wells Fargo's outside lawyer, was blaming the clients. During last month's hearing, he noted that not one customer ever complained to the company, that every improper trade was documented and that one customer knew nothing about the exchange-traded funds in his account.
''I'm not here to blame the victims because it's not their fault,'' he said at the hearing. ''But it does show up on their confirmation slips, it does show up on their monthly statements, and it was never caught by any of the 16 victims.''
So what was Mr. Young trying to accomplish by pointing all this out repeatedly, then? He would not answer the question, even though I put it to him repeatedly.
Mr. Horn was not legally bound to act in his clients' best interests in this case and was only required to provide ''suitable'' investments. Still, according to Raschelle Burton, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, ''the clients' needs should always come first'' regardless of the level of duty required.
So that's a good place to start with anyone who wants to manage your money. Are they willing to sign a fiduciary oath like the one that the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors helpfully provides to assist its members, who compete against garden-variety stockbrokers?
This won't keep everyone from falling in with a criminal. The federal government brought fraud charges against a former president of the financial adviser group last year. And as the federal judge in the hearing last month, Gary Allen Feess, testily pointed out to Mr. Young after he made his remark about all the customers who never complained to Wells Fargo, ''The idea of a fraud scheme is to conduct it in a way that the victims don't know they're being defrauded.''
Still, the warning signs were there. If you happen to run into an adviser prone to bragging, trading and disco parties at country clubs, check yourself to see whether you may have been just a bit too complacent.

HEADLINE: The Operatic Walt Disney, Delivered by Philip Glass

BYLINE: By ZACHARY WOOLFE

 BODY:
MADRID -- Peter Stephan Jungk's novel ''The Perfect American'' is a surreal, meditative, episodic account of the last days of Walt Disney.
It seems at first glance to be an ideal source for an opera by Philip Glass, whose surreal, meditative, episodic explorations of the lives of famous men -- always men -- have formed the bulk of his prodigious operatic output.
Avoiding the long arm of the Disney Company's lawyers by using only the most stylized versions of its subject's famous images, the opera, a pleasure to listen to but dull as drama, had its premiere at the Teatro Real here last week. It has been one of the crowning events of the past year's globe-trotting celebration of Mr. Glass's 75th birthday. (He turned 76 on Thursday.)
At the fourth performance on Wednesday, the subtle, moody score, at war between its propulsive and serene impulses, felt more than equal in quality to the festive occasion. While criticisms of Mr. Glass's music as cookie-cutter have always been misguided, ''The Perfect American'' finds him in especially unpredictable form, experimenting with sonorities, textures and pacing. 
Led by the Glass veteran Dennis Russell Davies with careful attention to both its underlying pulse and its twists of temperament, the opera opens with an ominous, low murmur punctuated by sharp, syncopated percussion snaps. The sound gradually expands through the orchestra and warms into something that, under Mr. Davies, has more gentle swing than the relentless forward motion generally associated with Mr. Glass.
The music often seems devised to trail off, to run out of steam as it expresses Disney's struggle with the cancer from which he died in 1966 at 65. But there is nothing exhausted about its inventiveness. Simultaneously eclectic and cohesive, the score incorporates strange, fractured brass fanfares out of Janacek's ''Makropulos Case'' and lilting, seductive rhythms that feel almost foxtrotty, like a misty echo of the 1930s.
Appropriately, for this birthday year, there is a stentorian, Wagnerian choral setting of ''Happy Birthday to You,'' directed at Disney within the opera but perhaps also a wink from Mr. Glass.
His version of ''The Perfect American'' was commissioned during the adventurous impresario Gerard Mortier's brief stint at the helm of New York City Opera. When Mr. Mortier's hiring fell through in the fall of 2008, a year before his tenure was officially to begin, he decamped to the Teatro Real.
With him traveled many of his plans for City Opera, including a grand production of Messiaen's ''St. François d'Assise'' in 2011; a version of Mozart's ''Così Fan Tutte,'' directed by Michael Haneke, that opens later this month; and, next season, Charles Wuorinen's new adaptation of ''Brokeback Mountain.''
And, not least, ''The Perfect American,'' which has been directed by Phelim McDermott, who a few years ago with Julian Crouch created a vibrant version of Mr. Glass's 1980 masterpiece, ''Satyagraha,'' that came to the Metropolitan Opera from the English National Opera in London. (''The Perfect American'' travels to London in June.)
Mr. Jungk's novel, originally published in German in 2001, is told from the perspective of Wilhelm Dantine, an Austrian-born Disney animator who, after being curtly fired, stalks his old boss through his final months. Like a more malignant version of the investigator whose inquiries frame the story of ''Citizen Kane,'' Dantine has sought out Disney's family, friends, colleagues and acquaintances, from Salvador Dalí to Peter Ustinov, reconstructing a bizarre narrative of Disney's illness and death.
Dantine's telling advances rumors, some more substantiated than others, that Disney, far from the genial uncle persona he cultivated in public, was a cruel, adulterous alcoholic, as megalomaniacal and racist as he was visionary and inspiring. In his great strengths and great weaknesses, Mr. Jungk implies, he is a potent symbol for 20th-century America.
Archetypal and specific, good and bad, Disney is, in other words, an ideal operatic character. But Mr. Jungk's tight, strange novel has been transformed into a slack, mild pageant with an alluring soundtrack.
Each inspired turn in the music is countered by Rudy Wurlitzer's stodgy libretto. The prosy text takes us from Disney's hometown, Marceline, Mo., to his Bel Air mansion to his hospital bed without ever coming together in a narrative, whether a traditional one or something in the abstract, ritualized mode that Mr. Glass has long favored.
The opera is a score in search of a story. Dantine has gone from narrator to bit player; the tension between him and Disney, Old World and New, has vanished without being replaced by another drama. The book's most striking set pieces -- Disney's dialogue with an animatronic Abraham Lincoln; the unexpected arrival of a frightening girl in an owl mask -- retain their mysterious power onstage but don't connect to their surroundings.
Matters are not helped by Mr. McDermott's uncharacteristically vague, inert production, though a disclaimer should be attached to that assessment: a technical malfunction before Wednesday's performance prevented rigs above the stage from rotating properly. Though the problem was not announced to the audience, it evidently had an impact on some of the projections that form a large part of the production's visual style.
Even if the technical side had been running smoothly, the show might well have still proved unsatisfying. Mr. McDermott and the designers Leo Warner and Joseph Pierce adroitly found their way around Disney's copyright restrictions by settling on a look for the show's projected animations that is more William Kentridge than Walt Disney. Deliberately rough and sketchy, the projections have the sober effect of Mr. Glass's music, full of scratches, erasures and humans melting into animals and back again.
But not enough use has been made of Mr. McDermott's extraordinary Improbable Skills Ensemble, whose puppetry and acrobatics formed the core of his ''Satyagraha.'' And little attention seems to have been paid to the singers' interactions, which often feel awkward and unevocative.
The tenor Donald Kaasch powerfully fills out Dantine's intense lines. But while the baritone Christopher Purves sounds firm, he is far too blandly affable as the misanthropic yet magnetic Disney. Neither he nor the opera's creators seem to have known what to do with their protagonist, how to make a character who both repels and attracts.
Mr. Jungk's book offers no pat conclusions, but it arouses emotion in a way that Mr. Glass's opera, despite its searching, resourceful music, does not. It would be fine if we were to leave ''The Perfect American'' feeling ambivalent about Disney, but we shouldn't feel nothing.
''The Perfect American'' runs through Wednesday at the Teatro Real in Madrid; www.teatro-real.com.

HEADLINE: Conceived By Students, A Portfolio That Pays

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
Squeezed by historically low interest rates, a wide range of investors -- from retirees living on fixed incomes to huge endowments and pension funds trying to meet budgets -- are trying to figure out how to generate income.
Some Duke University undergraduates think they have the answer.
Business and economics programs at American colleges and universities have long sponsored stock- and other asset-picking contests for their students. But last semester, faced with the current ultralow interest rate environment, Duke's undergraduate economics department ran a competition in asset allocation for the first time. Students had to decide what percentage of assets to put in fixed-income investments and what percentage to invest in other categories. The asset management firm BlackRock was a co-sponsor of the contest, which was open to any Duke sophomore or junior.
''Where is someone supposed to get yield these days?'' said Emma B. Rasiel, an associate professor of economics. ''That's what got us thinking.'' 
It's a pressing question for nearly every investor, and has left even professional financial advisers scratching their heads. The United States is now in the fifth year of a low interest rate environment. Ten-year Treasuries, the benchmark United States interest rate, yielded 5 percent in July 2007, just before the recession began. This week, the rate was below 2 percent, and last July, 10-year rates were the lowest ever recorded. This week, the one-month Treasury bill, the lowest-risk bond investment because of its short duration, was yielding practically nothing: 0.04 percent.
How much of their assets to allocate to bonds and other categories may well be the most important decision investors make. The mutual fund giant Vanguard advises, ''Research shows that your asset mix -- how you spread your money across stocks, bonds and cash -- has a far greater impact on long-term returns than your individual investments.''
For many years, the rule of thumb for most long-term investors was ''60/40,'' a 60 percent allocation to stocks and 40 percent to bonds. Besides having the virtue of simplicity, less volatile and lower-return bonds were meant to smooth out the ups and downs of the riskier stock market while giving investors some of the greater possible gains of stocks. Vanguard estimates that an investor with a 60/40 allocation can expect an average annual return of 8.6 percent, based on data going back to 1926. That allocation resulted in a decline in 21 of the next 86 years. In the worst year, 1931, it resulted in a drop of 26.6 percent, while in the best year, 1933, it produced a gain of 36.7 percent.
By comparison, a 100 percent allocation to stocks produced an average annual gain of 9.9 percent, with a decline in 25 of the 86 years and much greater volatility. A 100 percent allocation to bonds resulted in an average gain of 5.6 percent, with a decline in just 13 of the 86 years.
But those are long-term averages. The results can vary substantially depending on the starting point. In the decade ending in 2009, stocks had average annualized returns of negative 3 percent and lagged bond returns by more than 9 percent, a record disparity, according to T. Rowe Price.
Hardly anyone expects those high bond returns now. Despite the paltry yields, fixed-income investors have been cushioned for the last few years by falling interest rates, which allowed the value of their bonds to increase as yields declined. (Bond prices move inversely to interest rates.) But with short-term rates now near zero and longer-term rates still at historical lows, it's almost impossible for rates to decline any further. Indeed, they have been creeping up in recent months. And if and when rates rise more substantially, bond investors will be stuck with not only slim yields, but also losses on their principal.
Given this, should investors abandon the tried-and-true 60/40 approach and move more aggressively into stocks?
''The traditional 60/40 approach to building a portfolio is on the way out,'' said Michael Fredericks, head of retail asset allocation for BlackRock and lead portfolio manager for the BlackRock Multi-Asset Income Fund. It is being replaced, he said, by ''tactical'' asset allocation, a strategy in which investors change their allocation based on the current pricing of asset classes.
If bonds are overpriced, as many now believe, and stocks are underpriced, at least relative to other assets, then the allocation should shift toward stocks. ''We're not telling clients to sell all their bonds,'' Mr. Fredericks said. ''They do balance out the riskier assets in a portfolio. But most investors need to consider putting more in stocks.''
In his own Multi-Asset Income Fund, which has traditionally focused on fixed-income assets, Mr. Fredericks said he had reduced the amount invested in high-yield bonds and moved into stocks that pay high dividends, using an options strategy to lock in gains and protect against market drops. The fund had more than 25 percent of its assets in equities at the end of the year, with the remainder in various forms of fixed income. Last year, it returned just over 13 percent.
For the Duke contest, the students were asked to design a portfolio for an investor who was expecting to retire or begin withdrawing assets around 2020, just seven years away. That time frame ordinarily calls for a conservative -- that is, bond- and cash-oriented -- allocation to minimize volatility and the potential for loss. A traditional rule of thumb for older investors is that the percentage of assets in bonds should equal their age. So, 70-year-olds should have 70 percent of their assets in bonds.
Alex Kim, a Duke junior from New Zealand majoring in economics, told me that he and his teammates -- Yuefeng Du and Yuci Zhang -- faced the same quandary as most investors: how to generate income while minimizing risk and preserving assets for retirement. They examined model portfolios from Fidelity, Vanguard and BlackRock. ''We looked at historical returns for each asset class and then adjusted those for current market conditions,'' Mr. Kim said.
As the members of the team formulated their strategy last fall, they shared the concerns of many experts that bonds were overvalued. But they saw little risk in the short term to principal, given the Federal Reserve's public commitment to keep interest rates low until the economy improves. At the same time, they worried that the Fed's easy money policy would lead to inflation, which has traditionally eroded fixed-income returns.
They were bullish on United States stocks, especially those of large companies, based on their predictions of a continuing recovery in housing, rising consumer confidence, strong retail sales and the continuing impact of the Fed's quantitative easing program. They were also optimistic that Congress would avoid the so-called fiscal cliff and other threatened political calamities. But they were pessimistic about Europe and emerging markets, given the euro zone crisis and what they saw as slowing growth in countries like China and Brazil.
The team's contest entry called for allocating 43 percent to United States stocks -- 30.3 percent to a Russell 2000 index fund and 12.7 percent to a Russell 2000 fund that invests in midsize companies. They made no allocation to international stocks. Like more traditional models, they maintained a large allocation to fixed income, but weighted it heavily toward Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, whose yields rise with inflation. They allocated 32.1 percent to TIPS and 24.9 percent to an aggregate bond fund.
The result was a 9.7 percent projected annual return, with less volatility than the model funds they examined. The team ran projected returns for cases including both bull and bear markets, and their allocation outperformed the BlackRock model ''in all scenarios,'' Mr. Kim said.
Professor Rasiel winnowed the field of more than 30 entrants to 10 finalists, who presented their strategies to BlackRock executives in late November. The executives announced the winner a few weeks later: Mr. Kim's team. BlackRock praised the team's research, its modeling in bull and bear market assumptions and its ''strong understanding of macroeconomic drivers.''
The prize was an interview and a shot at an internship at BlackRock this summer. Mr. Kim is waiting to hear if he got one, and said he was aiming for a career in investment banking.
The runner-up team embraced a similar strategy to Mr. Kim's team, but was even more concerned about inflation. It put 68.2 percent of its assets into TIPS. It was also bullish on riskier equities from emerging markets, with a 16 percent allocation. The remainder was in United States equities. The projected annualized rate of return was 10 percent, with slightly lower projected volatility than the winning entry.
Before investors rush to replicate either approach in their own portfolios, they might want to consider that these are college undergraduates, however talented and motivated they may be. It's much too early to assess the winning team's results, but so far they have been right about United States stocks: the market has rallied strongly since they made their submission.
But projections and models are only as good as the underlying assumptions. Given the heavy allocation to currently low-yielding TIPS, the students are likely to outperform more traditional portfolios only if inflation picks up in the next seven years. Mr. Kim conceded that his team's projected return for TIPS (5.66 percent) and bonds (5.91 percent) ''may be optimistic, given current market conditions.''
Financial advisers stress that all asset allocation plans need to be tailored to each investor's circumstances and risk tolerance. Faced with the same low interest rate environment, professional asset allocators with the same time horizon as the Duke contestants have emphasized stocks over bonds.
The Fidelity Freedom 2020 Fund, for example, had almost 56 percent of its assets in stocks at the end of last year, including more than 15 percent in international equities. Only 8 percent was in TIPS. Vanguard's Target Retirement 2020 Fund was even more weighted toward stocks, with an allocation of just under 64 percent, nearly 20 percent of which was in international equities.
After all the models and projections, they've ended up pretty close to the old 60/40 approach.

HEADLINE: Blast at U.S. Embassy in Turkey Stirs Fear for Diplomats' Safety

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO and SEBNEM ARSU; Reporting was contributed by Rick Gladstone from New York, Michael R. Gordon and Eric Schmitt from Washington, and Nicholas Kulish from Berlin.

 BODY:
ISTANBUL -- A man approached a visitor's gate at the American Embassy in the Turkish capital, Ankara, on Friday afternoon and detonated an explosives-packed vest, killing himself and a Turkish security guard, blowing a gaping hole in the wall and raising new fears about the protection of American diplomats serving in this region.
Within hours, the Turkish authorities had blamed the attack on a homegrown Marxist organization, and on Friday evening Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the issue had ''pretty much been clarified'' because the bomber had been identified, by a skin mark on his head, as a former prisoner once jailed for domestic terrorism. Mr. Erdogan said DNA testing was under way and would be announced on Saturday. 
A White House official said that it was too early to determine who was behind the attack and that the United States would conduct its own investigation.
The bombing immediately called to mind the attack on an American diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya, more than four months ago that was carried out by Islamist extremists and killed the American ambassador there and three others. That episode touched off a politically charged debate in Washington about the protection of diplomats in the Middle East, and it led to the tightening of security and heightened fears about Islamist militant extremism.
On Friday, after the Ankara attack, the State Department immediately warned American citizens to temporarily avoid American diplomatic offices in Turkey.
Just after lunchtime, according to images captured on a security camera and reported by the Turkish television channel NTV, a man entered a security checkpoint near the consular section and began to panic as the metal detector buzzed. When he reached for his midsection, a Turkish guard yelled, ''Run away, a bomb!'' according to NTV. The footage then went black.
Ambulances and the police rushed to the scene. A Turkish journalist on her way to have tea with the American ambassador, Francis J. Ricciardone Jr., was critically wounded.
Alaaddin Yuksel the governor of Ankara, told reporters in televised remarks that the explosion took place at a security entrance to the embassy grounds. He spoke in front of the main embassy building, which appeared undamaged. ''We've had hundreds of phone calls, in the first minutes, hundreds of text messages of condolences and support,'' Mr. Ricciardone told reporters, standing with Mr. Yuksel. ''We feel we are among friends. We feel safe. Thank you for sharing our pain and sorrow on this occasion. We will continue to fight terrorism together.''
Hours after the attack, Interior Minister Muammer Guler said an initial investigation had identified the bomber as having been a member of an outlawed leftist group that Mr. Erdogan later identified as the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front, a Marxist-Leninist organization that was responsible for attacks on American targets in Turkey in the early 1990s.
Still, the White House spokesman, Jay Carney, said in a briefing with reporters in Washington, ''We do not know at this point who is responsible or the motivations behind the attack.'' And the findings by the Turks were treated with suspicion by some terrorism experts.
''I'm rarely stumped on these things, but I am stumped,'' said Bruce Hoffman, a specialist in terrorism at Georgetown University in Washington. He explained that Islamic terrorism would seem far more likely, and the swift manner in which the Turks said they had solved the case raised skepticism. ''When a terrorist crime is solved within 24 hours it is suspicious,'' he said.
The State Department warning told Americans to avoid United States diplomatic missions in Turkey ''until further notice.'' It told them ''to be alert to the potential for violence, to avoid those areas where disturbances have occurred, and to avoid demonstrations and large gatherings.''
The group that Turkish officials blamed for the attack is on the State Department's list of terrorist organizations and has mainly targeted Turkish officials and generals. It was held responsible for the assassination of a former prime minister in 1980 and a suicide attack on a police station in Istanbul in September. It was also played a role in the political violence that convulsed Turkey in the late 1970s and prompted a military coup in 1980 to restore order.
Ali Nihat Ozcan, a senior fellow at the Ankara-based Economic Policy Research Foundation, said the group had in the past received support from Syria and suggested the attack -- if the group's involvement is confirmed -- may have been related to Turkey's support for the insurgency in Syria.
''We are talking about a highly marginal but dedicated urban terror group that has a large Arab Alawite membership, and tied to the Syrian intelligence with strong historical links since 1980s,'' Mr. Ozcan said.
There also was some speculation that the bombing might have been meant to protest the recent deployment here of American-made Patriot antimissile systems, which were requested by Turkey after Syria lobbed shells across their border. But Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta, in an interview with CNN, said there was no evidence of such a connection. ''Obviously we've got to find out what the motive is here,'' he said. ''But as far as I know it was not linked to them.''
Turkish-American relations are strong and friendly, but Turkey has not been immune to anti-American attacks in recent years. In 2008, three gunmen attacked security guards outside the American Consulate in Istanbul in a shootout that left the attackers and three police officers dead. In 2003 truck bombs targeted the British consulate, HSBC bank and two synagogues in Istanbul, killing dozens.

HEADLINE: A Simple Way to Invest Grows More Complicated

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
THIS week was the 20th anniversary of the creation of the first exchange-traded fund, the Standard & Poor's Depositary Receipts E.T.F., which tracks the performance of the S.& P. 500 index and is bought and sold like a single stock. Even now, what is known as the SPDR S.& P. 500 remains the largest, with nearly $130 billion in assets.
Its selling point is its simplicity: the shares are liquid, the fees are low and the holdings are easy to see. It and the many exchange-traded funds that followed were the foundation for the movement toward low-cost, passive investing that aims to increase returns by eliminating the inconsistent performance of many active investors: the fund will track whatever index it is following.
At a lunch to observe the anniversary, Jim Ross, a senior managing director at State Street Global Advisors and one of the creators of the Standard & Poor's E.T.F., which trades as SPY, said that the funds would continue over the next 20 years to be vehicles that allow people to invest in increasingly sophisticated ways. 
The funds now represent a nearly $2 trillion industry, which promotes itself as easy for the average investor to understand but, as Mr. Ross indicated, is becoming ever more complex.
HISTORY The genesis of SPY was a report on the causes of the 1987 stock market crash that said that a way to trade a marketbasket of stocks would have lessened the impact of the crash. From that, an executive at the American Stock Exchange got the idea to bring together a group of commodity traders, index managers, accountants, economists and a specialist trading firm to work out the logistics of trading an entire index as if it were a single stock.
After State Street created SPY, iShares followed three years later with a host of funds that tracked different indexes in large economies, like Britain, Japan and Australia. State Street countered in 1998 with a series of funds that invested in sectors, like technology and energy, and the race was on.
Today, there are over 1,200 exchange-traded funds in the United States alone, and another 1,700 in Europe, according to ETF Global, a data provider. Many track indexes or baskets of stocks for a particular country or industry.
The funds have allowed clients and advisers to easily take a broad position. Pooneh Baghai, a senior partner at McKinsey & Company, said that simplicity had allowed advisers to act more like chief investment officers, focused on asset allocations, and not stock pickers in search of a couple of winning investments.
Like most financial products, exchange-traded funds started out simple and have grown complex. The newest innovations are funds that offer enhanced returns -- known as levered, or leveraged, funds -- and manage volatility. The E.T.F. label gives the funds the veneer of simplicity, but they can produce outcomes that investors did not expect.
One example is a fund that resets its leverage each day. Greg Peterson, director of research at Ballentine Partners, said he showed clients how they could end up losing more money than they expected.
Consider a regular S.& P. 500 E.T.F. and an S.& P. 500 E.T.F. that doubles the gains or losses. Both have $100 on Day 1. On the second day, the S.& P. index drops 25 percent. The regular fund is down to $75; the levered one is down to $50. The following day the S.& P. is up 50 percent. The regular fund rises to $112.50, and the levered one is at $100. On the fourth day, the S.& P. drops 10 percent. The regular fund is down to $101.25, while the levered one is at $80.
''You've got to know what you're buying,'' Mr. Peterson said. ''The E.T.F. will do what it says it will do. But people don't know what to expect.''
ADVANTAGES Low fees and no distribution of taxes are two of the selling points that distinguish exchange-traded funds from mutual funds. But there are caveats.
Exchange-traded funds that allow people to invest in securities that may be less liquid or more complex would be expected to charge higher fees, and they do. The AdvisorShares Active Bear E.T.F., which focuses on betting against securities, charges 1.68 percent of the amount invested, while the average fee for most E.T.F.'s is 0.6 percent, according to ETF Global.
But even funds doing simple things charge differently. Vanguard's S.& P. 500 E.T.F. charges 0.05 percent. The iShares version costs 0.07 percent. But the State Street SPY, which is triple the size of the other two combined, charges the highest fee, 0.0945 percent. (The fee 20 years ago was 0.2 percent.)
''If you hold it for five years, that cheaper E.T.F. may make more sense,'' Mr. Ross said. ''But it's like going into the drugstore: the generics are always cheaper, but they may not be better.''
The funds are also appealing because most of them do not make capital gains distributions the way a mutual fund investing in similar securities does, and so have lower taxes.
A simple way to think about why this is, is that when you buy an exchange-traded fund, you're buying a share of one thing, like a stock, on an exchange. When you buy mutual fund shares, you're buying a basket of other securities that are being bought and sold and thus generating capital gains and losses.
Of course, if you eventually sell E.T.F. shares at a gain, you will pay a capital-gains tax on them. And there are exceptions to the tax efficiencies, like certain fixed-income funds and more esoteric funds that invest in commodities and currencies through futures contracts.
ADVANCES AND CAVEATS There are several trends in exchange-traded funds that could confuse average investors. One is creating portfolios of the funds that are actively managed. Whereas average investors think of the funds as a cheap way to invest in an index, active managers are using them to take positions just the same as any active manager.
''If you have a view of how monetary easing in Japan is going to play out, you can work with a provider to express that view,'' said Pete Quinn, president and chief operating officer of the Riverfront Investment Group, which manages $3.4 billion in E.T.F. strategies.
Another is using the funds to follow trends in the markets. David Kreinces, founder and portfolio manager of ETF Portfolio Management, said his small fund used an algorithm to essentially make investments based on the direction of a market.
Then, there is the complexity of the funds themselves. ETF Global seeks to make sense of the relative merits of various exchange-traded funds, from fees and size to what a fund said it would do versus what it actually did. The goal, said Dan Hickey, a member of the research policy committee at ETF Global, is to provide support to investors overwhelmed by the proliferation of choices.
''For the average investor who wants to be in stocks, buying the SPDR is a great thing,'' he said. ''When you get into the more esoteric products, it requires more knowledge on the part of the person buying them. There are a lot of E.T.F.'s that are troublesome.''
Mr. Peterson at Ballentine said he recalled a social media fund that had only 10 stocks, five of them Chinese media companies. But he said investors also needed to examine the holdings of big players. The largest holding of the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund, the fourth-largest exchange-traded fund by assets, is Samsung, the Korean electronics multinational. While the moves in Samsung's stock price could help or hurt the index, Mr. Peterson said the reasons Samsung would go up or down might not be the same as the reasons that other companies in the index, which get more of their business from the growing middle class in the emerging markets, would move.
''E.T.F.'s have been so successful that people have engineered E.T.F.'s that don't follow the same functions as the original ones,'' Mr. Peterson said. ''Those original E.T.F.'s were broad, stock-based index-traded funds that were really efficient ways to gain core exposure to core markets.''
There is nothing wrong with these advances, of course, as long as investors know what they're getting.

HEADLINE: How Do You Get to Carnegie Hall? Start in Kabul

BYLINE: By ALISSA J. RUBINand DANIEL J. WAKIN; Alissa J. Rubin reported from Kabul, and Daniel J. Wakin from New York.

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- Every night Mohsen, a slight, awkward 13-year-old boy, goes home from school to an orphanage here and does something that would probably have been impossible a dozen years ago: he practices his violin before going to bed.
The instrument, he said, has become his closest friend. ''It has a sad voice,'' he said.
All such voices, happy or sad, were banned by the Taliban from 1996 to 2001, when they imposed their extremist vision of Islam on Afghanistan, a country with a long and rich musical tradition. Musicians were beaten, instruments destroyed, cassette tapes smashed.
But since 2010 an Afghan music scholar trained in Australia, aided by a Juilliard-educated violinist and with government backing, has kept a small music school going in Kabul, putting musical instruments into the hands of street kids and striving to make space for girls in a country where education is often denied them. 
The very existence of the school, the Afghanistan National Institute of Music, is a significant achievement. Now it is sending a group of youngsters, ages 9 to 21, to the United States for a 13-day tour. They arrive on Sunday, with performances scheduled for the Kennedy Center in Washington (on Thursday) and Carnegie Hall (on Feb. 12), not to mention an ice-skating trip to Yonkers and a visit to ''The Lion King'' on Broadway.
''It's the responsibility of a musician to defend the right of human beings everywhere to be musical and to express themselves through music,'' said William Harvey, the American violinist who is the conductor of the school's Afghanistan Youth Orchestra. ''We're celebrating a victory: the return of music.''
The 48 Afghan students on the tour will perform in traditional ensembles and in a Western-style orchestra in tandem with players from the Maryland Classic Youth Orchestra and the Scarsdale High School Orchestra, which helped raise money for the tour.
The Afghans will also play at the State Department, the Italian Embassy and the World Bank. They will stay together in hotels, traveling under the eyes of security guards. United States Embassy officials here have warned the students not to abscond.
The organizers say the tour has special significance in a country so marked by violence and misery. ''We are taking the message of peace and stability to the international community to show what a positive change has occurred,'' said the school's founder and driving force, Ahmad Sarmast, who has a Ph.D. in music from Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.
Yet worries linger. Music in Afghanistan still draws strident censure from the many conservative mullahs, who insist that it is un-Islamic. And once the American military withdraws next year, the school's existence could become precarious if such conservative forces come to power.
For now, though, the school is pushing ahead with its ambitious plans. Altogether it will cost $13 million to run the school for the next 11 years, including the construction of a concert hall, rehearsal space and dormitories for the students, who attend free, Mr. Sarmast said. At least six embassies -- including that of the United States -- contribute to the school's annual costs, along with the Goethe Institut, the British Council and Afghanistan's religiously conservative Ministry of Education (a shield against accusations that the institute is ''un-Islamic'').
The American tour is primarily sponsored by the United States Embassy, which is spending slightly more than $300,000, according to embassy officials. The World Bank, which is underwriting the school's new concert hall and dormitory, is putting up more than $100,000 for the tour; other contributors include the Carnegie Corporation and the Asian Cultural Council.
Carnegie Hall and Kennedy Center officials have also thrown their weight behind the concerts. Carnegie will bring schoolchildren to the performance in Stern Auditorium and has helped with publicity. The Kennedy Center has lent a hand with costs and is putting the Afghan orchestra in its Millennium Stage series in the main concert hall.
''This is a moment that they can grab,'' said Garth Ross, the Kennedy Center's vice president for community engagement. ''They're doing so in such a positive, public, global way. That's super inspiring.''
Besides training in music theory and Western and Afghan instruments, the school offers its 141 students the ministry's curriculum, which includes religious and Koranic studies. Significantly, a third of the students are girls, who often struggle to receive basic education in Afghanistan. Half the students are from orphanages or are former street kids. Few had any musical knowledge before they arrived.
The students come from almost every province and include members of the country's three main ethnic groups, the Pashtuns, the Tajiks and the Hazaras, Mr. Sarmast said. ''We have a wonderful mosaic of Afghanistan here,'' he said. ''Part of our commitment is to promote musical diversity in Afghanistan.''
The faculty includes a half-dozen Westerners.
The school offers something else: a place of security. For many students this is simply the first time in their lives that an adult has paid attention to them and encouraged their talent.
In fact, it might just be the happiest place in Kabul.
At midday recently, chattering children poured out of the red two-story building, each grasping a plastic-foam lunch container in one hand and a water bottle in the other. They wolfed down their food and raced back to class, showing a level of engagement rarely seen in Afghan schools.
In a cramped rehearsal room where the children and teachers were crowded in chairs barely an inch apart, Mr. Harvey was trying in vain to quiet the students so that they could begin rehearsing both the Afghan and Western pieces for their Carnegie Hall concert.
''We start from silence,'' he shouted over the din. When he had quiet, he counted in Dari, ''Yak, du, sei, char,'' prompting the first soft notes of Ravel's ''Bolero.''
In another practice room two girls were playing a raga on sitars, their faces rapt in concentration. Next door three boys practiced the Western flute as a teacher supervised. At the end of the corridor, where the rooms have upright pianos, a thin lad, Arson Fahim, 14, played a Mozart sonata.
An organization that works with orphans, the Afghan Child Education and Care Organization, brought Arson to the school. Speaking in hesitant but clear English -- English is a required course -- he said he had no idea how he came to love Western classical music. ''I had never had any hope I would ever see a piano,'' said Arson, who was introduced to the keyboard just a year ago.
Now, after devouring recordings on the Internet by different pianists, he sounds like a savvy conservatory student. ''I like the way Richter plays Mozart,'' he said, referring to the Soviet pianist Sviatoslav Richter. Another pianist, Milad, 18, also in English, declared himself partial to Bach. Both said they were in awe of the pianist Glenn Gould and carried on a 10-minute conversation about his technique.
''Glenn Gould was a genius because he could watch 12 movies at the same time, and that's why he plays Bach so well,'' said Milad. ''Because you have to have five voices at the same time with Bach. I can listen to two, but five is almost impossible.''
Marjan, a 14-year-old girl with a face at once tough and sad, came to the school through Aschiana, a nongovernmental organization that works with Afghan street kids and displaced people. She has been playing the violin for three years. Mr. Harvey, the youth orchestra's conductor, said her story encapsulates the hope of music.
''When you see a little girl who was selling chewing gum on the street because her father was beaten by the Taliban with a chain so badly that he couldn't work, and her mother does laundry to bring in enough money,'' he said, ''this is really a historic moment.''
Americans are weary, even cynical, after reports of so much violence, he said. ''But with these two big concerts in New York and Washington, we are showing people not to give up on Afghanistan.''

HEADLINE: Building a Job Network

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''In Hiring, a Friend in Need Is a Prospect, Indeed'' (front page, Jan. 28) highlights a critical gap in our education system. If getting a dream job requires networks, then we need to teach skills to build those relationships alongside courses in engineering, finance and marketing. 
High schools and colleges should equip students with the tools for creating connections: how to write a proper thank-you note; how to ask for an informational interview (or even know what one is); and how to pay it forward by giving back to others in their network.
If whom you know is as important as what you know, then we need to help young people of all backgrounds meet people who can help them in their careers. And all students need access to internships, even those who can't afford to take an unpaid job.
Many upper- and middle-class children learn these ''soft skills'' around the family dinner table. Many start professional networks through their families and friends. But other bright, ambitious students, especially those from low-income homes or first-generation Americans, miss out on essential career opportunities because of their backgrounds.
It is unfair to them. And in an increasingly competitive global economy, we can't afford to lose high-potential employees simply because we don't know them yet.

HEADLINE: A Robot at My Side, to Help and Advise?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Talking, Walking Objects'' (Sunday Review, Jan. 27), Carla Diana suggests that we humans want to be nurtured and served by robotic servants that anticipate our needs and alter our bad habits. She implies that we humans are incapable of adjusting our own eating habits and want a wiggling robo-fork to scold us. 
Too lazy to check if it's raining, we require a talking raincoat to inform us.
Rather than praise and comfort me, my vacuum cleaner should simply suck up dirt. Since the 1950s, artificial intelligence experts have promoted their work with the same vision of the fun-filled robotic utopia that awaits us. It hasn't happened. In fact, robots have helped create an unemployment dystopia.
As for robot servants waiting on me, I really don't want to live in a robotic version of ''Downton Abbey.''
DAN DINELLO Chicago, Jan. 28, 2013
The writer is the author of ''Technophobia! Science Fiction Visions of Posthuman Technology.''
To the Editor:
I was fascinated reading about how the robot revolution will change our way of living. What really got me excited was the prospect of a smart fork that tells me to slow down while eating my dinner.
The only problem I find with that is that I'll probably switch to a spoon instead.

HEADLINE: Washington Post Says It Will Seek New Home

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
The Washington Post, another newspaper struggling to trim costs, is planning to move out of the District of Columbia headquarters where its news staff has worked for nearly four decades. 
Katharine Weymouth, the paper's publisher, sent a memo to the staff on Friday morning announcing that the company was looking into a move and had hired two real estate firms, Studley Inc. and JM Zell Partners, as advisers. The company is also interviewing space planners and architects for guidance.
"Our preliminary analysis suggests that a move will make good operational and economic sense, however we have not yet decided on where or when," Ms. Weymouth said in her memo.
Since the company removed its presses more than a decade ago, Ms. Weymouth said, "we are no longer tied to this particular location."
According to the company's Web site, a $5 million printing plant was built at the current location on 15th Street NW in 1950, and The Post's $25 million headquarters building was officially dedicated there in October 1972. Katharine Graham, the former publisher and Ms. Weymouth's grandmother, originally wanted I. M. Pei to design the building in the shape of a typewriter, according to Dave Kindred, a former Post columnist who wrote a 2010 book about the paper, "Morning Miracle: Inside The Washington Post." But that plan proved too costly.
Over the years, The Washington Post newsroom has been a destination for heads of state, business executives and Hollywood moguls and stars. An article in The Post in April 1975 about the filming of "All the President's Men" said the newspaper allowed filmmakers to shoot only the building's exterior. But film crews passed through repeatedly to "soak up authenticity, rub elbows with newspaper people and learn the routine of a daily newspaper."
Mr. Kindred recalled that when he was reporting his book between 2007 and 2009, he rode an elevator with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who had been visiting Donald E. Graham, Ms. Graham's son and chief executive of the Washington Post Company. Mr. Kindred also recalled a day when the actor Brad Pitt stopped by to glean inspiration for a movie he was working on.
"Everyone has passed through at one time or another," said Mr. Kindred.
Newspapers around the country are trying to find ways to cut costs as they battle a troubled advertising environment and their readers migrate to digital news sources. The Post underwent a major shake-up last fall when Ms. Weymouth abruptly replaced the paper's executive editor, Marcus Brauchli, with Martin Baron, editor of The Boston Globe.
Andrew J. Asbill, a Washington-based director of the capital markets group at Cushman & Wakefield, said that whoever purchased the headquarters would most likely tear it down and rebuild because it's an older building and relatively far from the Metro.
Ms. Weymouth's memo did not say where the company was looking to relocate.

HEADLINE: A 3-Term Mayor as Brash, Shrewd And Colorful as the City He Led

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
Edward I. Koch, the master showman of City Hall, who parlayed shrewd political instincts and plenty of chutzpah into three tumultuous terms as New York's mayor with all the tenacity, zest and combativeness that personified his city of golden dreams, died Friday. He was 88.
Mr. Koch's spokesman, George Arzt, said he died of congestive heart failure at 2 a.m. at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia hospital.
The former mayor had experienced coronary and other medical problems since leaving office in 1989. But he had been in relatively good health despite -- or perhaps because of -- his whirlwind life as a television judge, radio talk-show host, author, law partner, newspaper columnist, movie reviewer, professor, commercial pitchman and political gadfly.
Ebullient, flitting from broadcast studios to luncheon meetings and speaking engagements, popping up at show openings and news conferences, wherever the microphones were live and the cameras rolling, Mr. Koch, in his life after politics, seemed for all the world like the old campaigner, running flat out. 
Only his bouts of illness slowed Mr. Koch, most recently forcing him to miss a screening on Tuesday of ''Koch,'' a documentary biographical film that opened in New York City on Friday.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg praised him as ''an irrepressible icon, our most charismatic cheerleader and champion,'' calling him ''a great mayor, a great man and a great friend.''
Mr. Koch's 12-year mayoralty encompassed the fiscal austerity of the late 1970s and the racial conflicts and municipal corruption scandals of the 1980s, an era of almost continuous discord that found Mr. Koch caught in a maelstrom day after day.
But out among the people or facing a news media circus in the Blue Room at City Hall, he was a feisty, slippery egoist who could not be pinned down by questioners and who could outtalk anybody in the authentic voice of New York: as opinionated as a Flatbush cabby, as loud as the scrums on 42nd Street, as pugnacious as a West Side reform Democrat mother.
''I'm the sort of person who will never get ulcers,'' the mayor -- eyebrows devilishly up, grinning wickedly at his own wit -- enlightened the reporters at his $475 rent-controlled apartment in Greenwich Village on Inauguration Day in 1978. ''Why? Because I say exactly what I think. I'm the sort of person who might give other people ulcers.''
His political odyssey took him from independent-minded liberal to pragmatic conservative, from street-corner hustings with a little band of reform Democrats in Greenwich Village to the pinnacle of power as the city's 105th mayor from Jan. 1, 1978, to Dec. 31, 1989. Along the way, he put an end to the career of the Tammany boss Carmine G. De Sapio and served two years as a councilman and nine more in Congress representing, with distinction, the East Side of Manhattan.
With his trademark -- ''How'm I doin?'' -- Mr. Koch stood at subway entrances on countless mornings wringing the hands and votes of constituents, who gave him 21 electoral victories in 26 years, with only three defeats: a forgettable 1962 State Assembly race; a memorable 1982 primary in a race for governor won by Mario M. Cuomo; and a last Koch hurrah, a Democratic primary in 1989 won by David N. Dinkins, who would be his one-term successor.
Led New York Into Prosperity
In retrospect, how did he do?
By the usual standards of measuring a former mayor's legacy -- the city he inherited, the challenges he faced, the resources available to meet those challenges and the extent to which his work endured beyond his term -- historians and political experts generally give Mr. Koch mixed-to-good reviews.
Most important, he is credited with leading the city government back from near bankruptcy in the 1970s to prosperity in the 1980s. He also began one of the city's most ambitious housing programs, which continued after he left office and eventually built or rehabilitated more than 200,000 housing units, revitalizing once-forlorn neighborhoods.
Politically, Mr. Koch's move to the right of center was seen as a betrayal by some old liberal friends, but it gained him the middle class and three terms in City Hall. He was also the harbinger of a transformation in the way mayors are elected in New York, with candidates relying less on the old coalition of labor unions, minority leaders and Democratic clubhouses and more on heavy campaign spending and television to make direct appeals to a more independent-minded electorate.
In the end, however, he was overwhelmed by corruption scandals in his administration and by racial divisions that his critics contended he sometimes made worse.
Mr. Koch, for whom the headline ''Hizzoner'' seemed to have been coined, was a bachelor who lived for politics. Perhaps inevitably there were rumors, some promoted by his enemies, that he was gay. But no proof was offered, and, except for two affirmations in radio interviews that he was heterosexual, he responded to the rumors with silence or a rebuke. ''Whether I am straight or gay or bisexual is nobody's business but mine,'' he wrote in ''Citizen Koch,'' his 1992 autobiography.
Mr. Koch was New York's most colorful mayor since Fiorello H. La Guardia. Tall, squinty-eyed, baldish, with a nimbus of gray and a U-shape smile more satanic than cherubic, Mr. Koch told a story like a raconteur in a deli, kvetching and ah-hahing with the timing of a Catskill comic. He loved to clown for photographers on the streets of New York, on a camel in Egypt or on a mechanized sweeper in China.
His image on television, his high-pitched voice on the radio, his round shoulders and gangly arms and baggy pants, and especially his streetwise gusts of candor -- saying what people said over the dinner table in Queens, the Bronx and Brooklyn -- gave New Yorkers the illusion that he was a rumpled, familiar acquaintance. But for all his self-promoting stream of consciousness, he was an intensely private man who revealed little about himself and had no patience for introspection.
Even at the small dinner parties he gave for close political associates and inner-circle friends, whether at Gracie Mansion or in his postmayoral apartment at 2 Fifth Avenue, there were few real intimacies, some participants recalled. The conversations were eclectic, a dance of politics, public affairs and Mr. Koch's city of art and culture.
His first term, students of government say, was his best. Confronted with the deficits and the constraints of the city's brush with bankruptcy in 1975, he held down spending, subdued the municipal unions, restored the city's creditworthiness, revived a moribund capital budget, began work on long-neglected bridges and streets, cut antipoverty programs and tried to reduce the friction between Manhattan and the more tradition-minded other boroughs.
Re-elected in 1981 with 75 percent of the vote -- he became the first mayor in the city's history to get both the Democratic and the Republican nominations -- Mr. Koch markedly improved the city's finances in his second term. Helped by a surging local economy, state aid and rising tax revenues, the city government, with a $500 million surplus, rehired workers and restored many municipal services. He also made plans for major housing programs, improvements in education and efforts to reduce welfare dependency.
A Troubled Third Term
Mr. Koch, riding a huge crest of popularity, was elected in 1985 to a third term, with an amazing 78 percent of the vote. Only two other mayors in modern times, La Guardia and Robert F. Wagner Jr., had achieved third terms, and both found them to be quagmires.
For Mr. Koch, the storm clouds had already begun to gather.
Less than two weeks after Mr. Koch's inauguration, his ally Donald R. Manes, the Queens borough president, attempted suicide -- he succeeded two months later -- in a troubling prelude to one of the worst corruption scandals in city history.
What followed was a series of disclosures, indictments and convictions for bribery, extortion, perjury and conspiracy that touched various city agencies. Much of the skulduggery centered on the Transportation Department and the Parking Violations Bureau. Stanley M. Friedman and Meade H. Esposito -- the Democratic bosses in the Bronx and Brooklyn, respectively, and Koch supporters -- were convicted. Mr. Friedman went to prison, and Mr. Esposito, who was in ill health, received a suspended two-year sentence and a fine.
Anthony R. Ameruso, the transportation commissioner, was forced to resign, and the scandal snared businessmen, lawyers, parking meter attendants, sewer inspectors and others. Scores of convictions were obtained by the United States attorney in Manhattan, Rudolph W. Giuliani.
No one accused Mr. Koch of any wrongdoing. Most of the accused were not his appointees, and none were senior advisers; he had always kept a distance from his commissioners, letting them run their departments with relative independence.
Mr. Koch said that he was shocked, that he had been blindsided by subordinates and associates whose schemes he could not possibly have divined. He always said he had befriended Mr. Friedman, Mr. Esposito, Mr. Manes and others because they controlled votes that could make or break legislation he wanted approved or killed.
But critics said Mr. Koch had become too close to the Democratic bosses in pursuit of his own ambitions, and accusations of complacency and cronyism dogged him for the rest of his tenure.
Mr. Koch was also harshly criticized for what was called his slow, inadequate response to the AIDS crisis in the 1980s. Hundreds of New Yorkers were desperately ill and dying in a baffling public health emergency. (By the end of his mayoralty, more than 5,000 AIDS patients had died in New York City.) Critics, especially in the gay community, accused him of being a closeted gay man reluctant to confront the crisis for fear of being exposed.
For years, Mr. Koch was upset and defensive about the criticism. In a 1994 interview with Adam Nagourney, a New York Times correspondent and co-author, with Dudley Clendinen, of ''Out for Good: The Struggle to Build a Gay Rights Movement in America,'' Mr. Koch said that New York had done more than San Francisco for people with AIDS. ''But that never got through to the gay community,'' Mr. Koch said. ''They were brainwashed that they were getting shortchanged in New York City and in San Francisco they were getting everything. And it wasn't true, but you could never convince them.''
The scandals and the scourges of crack cocaine, homelessness and AIDS were compounded by a widening rift between Mr. Koch and black New Yorkers. The mayor traced his contentious relationship with black leaders to his first-term decision to close Sydenham Hospital in Harlem, where, he said, the city was paying too much for inadequate care. He would regret the decision.
''It was the wrong thing to do,'' Mr. Koch, who rarely second-guessed himself, said in 2009. Closing the hospital saved $9 million, he said, but ''there was such a psychological attachment to Sydenham, because black doctors couldn't get into other hospitals -- it was the psychological attachment that I violated.''
Black leaders were also unhappy with Mr. Koch's decision to purge antipoverty programs and comments he made that they considered insensitive. He said, for example, that busing and racial quotas had done more to divide the races than to achieve integration, and that Jews would be ''crazy'' to vote for the Rev. Jesse Jackson in his 1988 presidential campaign after Mr. Jackson's 1984 reference to New York as ''Hymietown'' and his call for a Palestinian homeland in Israel.
In a city where minorities had long held grievances against a largely white police force, Mr. Koch's 1983 appointment of Benjamin Ward as New York's first black police commissioner hardly appeased critics, and a series of ugly episodes came to symbolize mounting racial troubles.
In 1984, a white officer with a shotgun killed a black woman, Eleanor Bumpurs, 66, as she was being evicted from her Bronx apartment; he was acquitted. In 1986, a gang of white teenagers assaulted three black men in Howard Beach, Queens, chasing one, Michael Griffith, to his death on a highway. And in 1989, a black youth, Yusuf K. Hawkins, 16, who went to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, to see a used car, was attacked by white youths and shot dead.
Mr. Hawkins's death came just a month before Mr. Koch faced Mr. Dinkins, the Manhattan borough president and the only black candidate, in the 1989 Democratic primary. By then, City Hall was lurching from crisis to crisis. The racial divisions, the corruption scandals, the failures to cope with crack and homelessness all contributed to a sense it was time for a change. Mr. Dinkins, pledging to bring the city together again in a ''gorgeous mosaic,'' narrowly defeated Mr. Koch in the primary and went on to beat Mr. Giuliani, who ran on the Republican and Liberal lines, by a slender margin in the general election.
''I was defeated because of longevity, not because Yusuf Hawkins was murdered six weeks before the election, although that was a factor,'' Mr. Koch wrote in New York magazine. ''People get tired of you. So they decided to throw me out. And so help me God, as the numbers were coming in, I said to myself, 'I'm free at last.' ''
Son of Immigrants
Edward Irving Koch was born in Crotona Park East in the Bronx on Dec. 12, 1924, the second of three children of Louis and Joyce Silpe Koch, Polish Jews who had immigrated to New York separately in the early 1900s. Louis was a furrier and a partner in a shop until it folded in the Depression in 1931.
The family then moved to Newark, sharing an apartment with Louis's brother, who ran a catering business. At age 9, Edward, like his humbled father, began working for his uncle in a hat-and-coat-check concession. He later worked as a delicatessen clerk and went to South Side High School in Newark.
One day, when he was 13 and vacationing in the Catskills, he leapt into a lake, swam out and saved his sister, Pat, 6, from drowning. Though a B student, he was president of his school debating society. While his brother, Harold, was athletic, Edward pursued stamp collecting and photography.
After Edward's graduation in 1941, the Koches, back on their feet in the fur business, moved to Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn. For the next two years, the young man went to City College in Manhattan and worked as a shoe salesman.
He was drafted into the wartime Army in 1943 and earned two battle stars in Europe as an infantryman. After V-E Day, because he could speak German, he was sent to Bavaria to help remove Nazi public officials from their jobs and find non-Nazis to take their place. He was a sergeant when discharged in 1946.
After the war, he moved back in with his parents but did not return to undergraduate studies. (City College awarded him a bachelor's degree in 1981.) Instead, he went to law school at New York University. He received his law degree in 1948, was admitted to the bar in 1949 and over the next 20 years practiced law in New York City, becoming a founding partner of Koch, Lankenau, Schwartz & Kovner in 1963.
Mr. Koch began his life in politics in 1952 as a street-corner speaker for Adlai E. Stevenson, who lost the presidential election to Dwight D. Eisenhower. In 1956, already in his 30s, Mr. Koch moved out of his parents' home, took an apartment in Greenwich Village and joined the Village Independent Democrats, a club opposed to Mr. De Sapio and the Manhattan Democratic organization known as Tammany Hall.
Mr. De Sapio, a power broker whose dark glasses gave him a sinister air, could make or break legislators, judges, even mayors. But as district leader in Greenwich Village, he had a narrow base. He had lost his post in 1961 to a reformer, James Lanigan. But it was Mr. Koch, supported by Mayor Wagner, who ended the De Sapio era, thwarting his return to power in the district primary elections in 1963 and 1965. Heading a growing reform movement, Mr. Koch won a City Council seat in 1966 and befriended liberal causes, like antipoverty programs and rent controls.
By 1968, he was ready to move up. An opponent of the Vietnam War and a supporter of Senator Eugene J. McCarthy's presidential candidacy, Mr. Koch, with Democratic and Liberal backing, upset Whitney North Seymour Jr. in what was called a classic American race -- a son of immigrants versus the scion of a family rooted in national history -- and became representative for the 17th Congressional District, the first Democrat to occupy the seat since 1934.
The seat, representing the affluent Upper East Side, parts of Midtown and Greenwich Village, was held by John V. Lindsay until he became mayor in 1966. Mr. Koch later represented the 18th District after a redistricting.
Mr. Koch, in Congress from 1969 to 1977, became known as a hard-working, independent liberal able to work with conservatives. He co-sponsored a law that gave citizens access to their government files and introduced legislation for a national commission on drug abuse. He supported public transportation and housing, Social Security and tax reform, home health care for the elderly, aid to Israel, amnesty for draft resisters, solar energy research, federal financing of abortions and consumer protection measures.
He was re-elected to the House four times by majorities of 62 percent to 77 percent. While in Congress, he stayed in Washington two weekends. He said he got ''the bends'' when outside New York too long. Every Thursday night, he went home for a weekend of campaigning and meeting constituents.
Still, he was almost unknown outside his district when he ran for mayor in 1977, facing six people in the Democratic primary, including the incumbent, Abraham D. Beame; Mario Cuomo, then New York's secretary of state; Representatives Herman Badillo and Bella S. Abzug; the Manhattan borough president, Percy E. Sutton; and Joel W. Hartnett, a businessman and civic watchdog.
But there was wide dissatisfaction with Mayor Beame's handling of the fiscal crisis in 1975; Time magazine put him on the cover as a beggar with a tin cup. Many New Yorkers were also worried about rising crime and spending on social programs.
Mr. Koch benefited from support by The New York Post, but he made the crucial moves. In one master stroke, he hired the consultant David Garth to run his campaign. Sensing the city's rightward drift, Mr. Garth devised a more conservative image for Mr. Koch, a formidable task because the candidate had portrayed himself as a liberal, and he had no wife and children with whom to pose for the decorous voter.
To the rumors about his sexuality, his standard answer was that it was no one's business but his own. Placards sprouted in the 1977 mayoral campaign saying, ''Vote for Cuomo, Not the Homo.'' Mr. Koch did not respond at the time, but 12 years later, in his book ''His Eminence and Hizzoner,'' he recalled, ''When I first saw those posters, I cringed, and I wondered how I would be able to bear it.''
Although Mr. Cuomo always disclaimed responsibility for the posters, Mr. Koch never forgave him, as he made clear with a pointedly disparaging reference to Mr. Cuomo in a recorded interview with The Times that was not to be made public until Mr. Koch's death.
Asked on a WMCA radio show in 1989 about his sexuality, Mr. Koch said that he was heterosexual. ''I happen to believe that there is nothing wrong with homosexuality,'' he said. ''It's whatever God made you. It happens that I'm heterosexual, but I don't care about that. I do care about protecting the rights of 10 percent of our population who are homosexual and who don't have the ability to protect their rights.''
Mr. Koch appeared often in the 1977 race with his close friend and adviser Bess Myerson, a former Miss America and a popular former city commissioner of consumer affairs.
In the campaign, Mr. Koch attacked Mayor Beame's ''clubhouse politics'' and proclaimed himself a ''liberal with sanity'' -- a competent manager who would see the city right.
He made frequent campaign trips to the boroughs outside Manhattan, where he denounced welfare abuse, unconscionable demands by municipal unions and wasteful spending by city agencies. He vowed to crack down on crime, advocated the death penalty in some cases and promised to abolish the Board of Education as ''a lard barrel of waste.''
It worked. Mr. Koch received 20 percent of the primary vote to Mr. Cuomo's 19 percent. Mr. Koch then won a runoff against Mr. Cuomo and went on to take the general election against State Senator Roy M. Goodman, a Republican; Barry Farber, a Conservative; and Mr. Cuomo, who had the Liberal Party line and the dubious distinction of losing three times to Mr. Koch that autumn.
Tackling Financial Ills
Resigning his House seat, Mr. Koch took the reins of a city government that faced a $400 million deficit, crumbling streets and bridges, heavy demands from labor leaders and a bond market that put city securities somewhere between unreliable and unsalable. Many businesses and middle-class residents were leaving, with concomitant losses in tax revenues and jobs.
The mayor rolled up his sleeves. After reaching a settlement with the unions, he scaled down the budget, ordered the attrition of 10 percent of the city's 200,000-member work force and, with state officials, revised a fiscal recovery plan that sought the aid of banks and the state and federal governments. Congress approved loan guarantees of $2 billion, enabling the city to get back into the bond markets, and the road to recovery was paved.
Mr. Koch cut city services and patronage-laden antipoverty programs. There were outcries from some black and Hispanic leaders that he was favoring the middle class, but he balanced the budget in his first term. He also issued an order prohibiting discrimination in city jobs on the basis of sexual orientation, and proposed laws to limit smoking in public places and to provide public financing of political campaigns.
But he had little success in taking back some of the power that had been diffused in previous administrations. He failed to gain control of the quasi-independent Health and Hospitals Corporation and the Board of Education. But he got his man, Frank J. Macchiarola, hired as schools chancellor, and his former deputy mayor -- Robert F. Wagner Jr., son of former Mayor Wagner -- named president of the school board.
After winning his second term, Mr. Koch ran for the Democratic nomination for governor. It was a mistake, compounded by campaign blunders, he conceded later. In an interview with Playboy magazine, he called suburbia ''sterile'' and rural America ''a joke.'' The comments provoked an uproar from insulted suburbanites and upstate residents whose votes he needed.
Mr. Cuomo, the lieutenant governor, won the primary and went on to become governor. ''In the end,'' Andy Logan wrote in The New Yorker, ''the joke was on Koch.''
He had always been frank, leaving himself open to charges of callousness. At various times he skewered and provoked the wrath of Jews and gentiles, business and union leaders, blacks and whites, feminists and male chauvinists. He vilified his Tammany foes as ''crooks'' and ''moral lepers,'' good-government panels as ''elitists,'' black and Hispanic leaders as ''poverty pimps,'' neighborhood protesters as ''crazies'' and Ms. Abzug as ''wacko.''
He was never a man of deep intellect or great vision, students of government and even his associates conceded. But, they said, he was more complex than his blurted assessments and gratuitous insults implied. Critics said he could be petty, self-righteous and a bully when his ideas or policies were attacked.
But associates and admirers, pressed to explain how the mayor could be so popular while reducing city services and apparently alienating so many groups, insisted that Mr. Koch had extraordinary political instincts and theatrical flair, and that his candor only reflected what many New Yorkers had long thought themselves.
It was one thing for a politician to offer excuses for litter, crime and poor transit service, as so many did. But it was another to say, as Mr. Koch did, ''It stinks.'' Over time, many New Yorkers, especially the middle class, came to accept, and relish, his puckish candor.
The honeymoon lasted two terms. After the corruption scandals broke, however, the politics of candor paled, and critics said the mayor began to lose his touch, flip-flopping on issues as political winds shifted. He first sought more accountability from his commissioners, then softened; he first opposed, then supported immunity for those who confessed to bribing public officials.
Mr. Koch's third-term agenda was ambitious: plans to improve education and to cut the welfare rolls, and a 10-year, $5.1 billion capital proposal to attack homelessness and the housing shortage by building or rehabilitating hundreds of thousands of units.
The housing plan, based on dozens of city financing and ownership programs, would become a notable and long-lasting success. It began with a stock of 10,000 properties abandoned by owners or seized by the city for tax delinquency.
By the end of the Koch administration, 3,000 apartments had been created in formerly vacant buildings, 13,000 more were under construction, and design work had begun on 20,000 more. In the next 15 years, over four mayoral administrations, 200,000 more units were built or restored, the number of vacant lots dropped sharply, and the original stock of 10,000 abandoned buildings was reduced to under 800.
But in Mr. Koch's final years in office, his programs were all but overshadowed by scandals. As the mayor waffled, prosecutors charged that thousands of parking meter attendants and sewer, electrical and housing inspectors had taken graft. An avalanche of indictments and convictions ensued.
And the administration's troubles multiplied: 50,000 homeless people crowded into shelters and roamed the streets and subways, and there was a surge of crack-related crimes and growing outrage in minority communities over claims of police brutality.
Then, in 1987, the stock market collapsed, and even the prosperity that had sustained the treasury and the mayor's popularity began to flag. Mr. Koch had a mild stroke that August, and associates said he seemed for a time to lose heart.
By the end of his third term, Mr. Koch was tired. His original faith in government's capacity to solve the problems of families and communities had been eroded; the old liberal had embraced the new creed of Reaganesque reliance on self-help, and it seemed that he had lost some of his old self-confidence.
''It's a big city; you don't know how to get your arms around it, and government becomes the enemy,'' he told Sam Roberts of The Times a few months before he left office. ''Twelve years ago, if someone attacked me, I wouldn't let them get away with it. I'd take them on. I now perceive my job to include allowing people to vent their rage.''
After leaving office, Mr. Koch gave up his rent-controlled flat for a two-bedroom apartment on lower Fifth Avenue, but he gave no thought to retiring. He instead became a one-man media show, with forums on television and radio and in newspapers, magazines and books, besides being a lawyer, endorsing commercial products, lecturing and teaching. He earned over $1.5 million a year.
Mr. Koch had occasional medical problems. He suffered what doctors called a moderate heart attack in 1999, and in 2009 he underwent quadruple bypass surgery and replacement of his aortic valve. He had worn a pacemaker since collapsing with an irregular heartbeat in 1991. There were subsequent hospitalizations for various ailments.
On March 22, 1999, he was briefly hospitalized with low blood pressure hours before he was to be arrested with scores of others in protests organized by a onetime foe, the Rev. Al Sharpton, over the police shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed immigrant from Guinea. Getting himself arrested for a cause raised only a few eyebrows; Mr. Koch, almost a decade out of office, still wanted to march at the head of the parade.
In 2008, approaching 84, he was still pitching -- endorsing Barack Obama for president, shaking the hand of the visiting Pope Benedict XVI, even generating publicity with his own burial plans. ''Koch, Resolved to Spend Eternity in Manhattan, Buys a Cemetery Plot,'' a Times headline said.
In 2010, Mr. Koch took on his most ambitious fight in years, leading a coalition, New York Uprising, against what he called ''a dysfunctional Legislature'' in Albany. He traveled the state on a mission to shame lawmakers who failed to sign a pledge to promote reforms.
''Throw the bums out!'' he shouted in Buffalo. ''You're either on the side of angels or you're a bum. And if the angels betray their pledges, I'm going to run around the state screaming, 'Liar, liar, pants on fire!' ''
At various times he wrote columns for The Post, The Daily News, the online magazine Jewish World Review and the right-wing Web site NewsMax.com. He also wrote movie and restaurant reviews for local weeklies.
He made regular appearances on WCBS-TV, had talk shows on Fox television and on WNEW and WABC radio, teamed with former Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato for a Bloomberg Radio program and was a frequent commentator on the local news television station NY1.
His remarks often sounded like pronouncements by an officeholder, proposing policy changes and oozing invective for political opponents and journalistic rivals. Mr. Koch denied he was wreaking vengeance on old foes, but, as he told New York magazine, ''It's a lot more fun being a critic than being the one criticized.''
Political Influence Lasted
Out of office, Mr. Koch remained influential in New York politics. He crossed party lines to support Mr. Giuliani in the 1993 mayoral election, an endorsement crucial to Mr. Dinkins's defeat. But Mr. Koch later turned against Mr. Giuliani, flaying him as ''a good mayor but a terrible person'' and refusing to endorse him for a second term.
Mr. Koch endorsed Mr. Bloomberg's successful races for mayor as a Republican in 2001 and 2005, calling him about ''as Republican as I am.'' (Mr. Bloomberg later refashioned himself as an independent.) And when Mr. Bloomberg engineered a legislative finesse of term-limits laws to run for a third term in 2009, Mr. Koch backed him and called for an end to term limits.
In presidential races, Mr. Koch went back and forth. He supported the losing Democratic ticket of Al Gore and Joseph I. Lieberman in 2000, but joined the Bush-Cheney re-election bandwagon in 2004 and promoted the Republican National Convention in New York, urging New Yorkers to ''make nice'' to conventioneers. By 2008, he was back with the Democrats, supporting Hillary Rodham Clinton's bid for the nomination and, when she lost, switching to Mr. Obama.
Mr. Koch's only official work in recent years was a 2007 appointment to a panel examining the state comptroller's office after a scandal that forced out Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi.
Mr. Koch appeared, mostly as himself, in a score of movies, including ''The Muppets Take Manhattan'' and ''The First Wives Club,'' and in cameo roles on television shows, including ''Sex and the City.''
And he was the star, of course, of ''Koch,'' the documentary film by Neil Barsky that had its premiere on Tuesday at the Museum of Modern Art. Mr. Koch, hospitalized, was forced to miss the event.
For years Mr. Koch worked out with a personal trainer almost every morning at a gym. He became a partner with Robinson, Silverman, Pearce, Aronsohn & Berman, which in a 2002 merger became Bryan Cave, an international law firm and one of the largest real estate practices in New York. He provided advice and brought in many clients.
He became an adjunct professor at New York University, Brandeis University and Baruch College of the City University of New York, and gave lectures across the country and abroad, with minimum fees of $20,000 for off-the-cuff talks on race relations, drugs, anti-Semitism or ''Koch on the City,'' ''Koch on the State'' or ''Koch on Everything.''
From 1997 to 1999, he was the judge on the nationally syndicated show ''The People's Court,'' hearing small claims and ribald testimony like that of a man who claimed he suffered whiplash from a topless dancer's breasts. Mr. Koch was done in by the competing ''Judge Judy'' -- Judith A. Sheindlin, a retired New York City Family Court judge -- and was replaced by her husband, Gerald Sheindlin, a retired State Supreme Court justice. Mr. Koch had appointed both to the bench.
He wrote more books -- 17 in all -- murder mysteries, commentaries on politics, and other subjects. Most were a blend of his insights, experiences and observations with co-authors providing the workaday prose. In office, he produced ''Mayor'' (1984), ''Politics'' (1985) and ''His Eminence and Hizzoner'' (1989). Later came ''All the Best: Letters From a Feisty Mayor'' (1990), ''Ed Koch on Everything'' (1994), ''I'm Not Done Yet'' (2000) and ''Buzz: How to Create It and Win With It'' (2007).
Mr. Koch and his sister, Pat Koch Thaler, wrote ''Eddie: Harold's Little Brother,'' a children's book that appeared in 2004. His brother, Harold M. Koch, a carpet distributor, died in 1995. Besides his sister, a former dean at N.Y.U. whom he saw regularly in later years, Mr. Koch is survived by New York itself, as an old friend put it a few years ago.
''The city was and is his family,'' said Maureen Connelly, a former press secretary and veteran political adviser. ''We used to be scared about what would happen to Ed if he lost. We said it would be best if he just died in the saddle. But he never had any intention of getting off the horse.''
Funeral Arrangements: Edward I. Koch's funeral will be held at 11 a.m. on Monday at Temple Emanu-El, Fifth Avenue and 65th Street in Manhattan. The funeral will be televised by NY1. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said a private shiva for Mr. Koch would be held on Tuesday at Gracie Mansion.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 16, 2013 

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an obituary on Feb. 2 about Edward I. Koch, the former mayor of New York, referred incorrectly to ''Koch,'' the new documentary film about his life. It opened on Feb. 1 in New York City, not nationwide, and illness forced Mr. Koch to miss a prerelease screening of the film on Jan. 29 -- not the premiere, which took place on Jan. 10 at the Walter Reade Theater as part of the New York Jewish Film Festival.
The obituary also referred incorrectly to a suicide attempt by Donald R. Manes, the Queens borough president and a Koch ally. Mr. Manes, who committed suicide in March 1986, first tried to kill himself either late on Jan. 9 or early on Jan. 10 of that year, less than two weeks after Mr. Koch was inaugurated for a third term -- not ''weeks'' after the inauguration.
In addition, the obituary referred imprecisely to the number of elections Mr. Koch won between 1963 and 1989. While he did win 21 elections in that period, many of them were primaries; it was not the case that his constituents ''elected him 21 times in 26 years.''

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths ANDERSON, RICHARD RICHARD ANDERSON

 BODY:
ANDERSON--Richard Richard Anderson, beloved impresario, art dealer, aesthete, host, philanthropist, and maritime preservationist died on Monday, January 21st in Nyack, NY after a brief illness. Several dear friends, including his partner Ian Danic, were at his side. Richard was of Iranian, Swedish, English and Irish heritage, the son of George Albert Anderson and Keyhan Farian. 
He was born on September 19, 1962 in Brooklyn, NY, and grew up in Brooklyn Heights. Richard moved to Nyack as a teenager and graduated from Nyack High School in 1980 and Columbia College in 1984 with degrees in Economics and History. Upon graduating, he worked in banking, accepting postings in London and Paris. In Europe, he indulged his lifelong passion for art, embarking on building his private collection. On his return to the States, he opened a series of galleries in Tribeca, Chelsea and Soho. As an art dealer and gallerist Richard helped to establish the career of many emerging artists, earning wide respect in the New York Art world. Richard's other great passion was historic boats. At age 10 he was a constant presence as a young volunteer at the nascent South Street Seaport Museum. In recent years he founded the SS Columbia Project whose goal is to bring the oldest surviving American passenger steamship to the Hudson River Valley. This project beautifully dovetails his love of art, ships and the river, on the banks of which sits the home he enjoyed so much with family and friends. He is predeceased by his father and his adored mother, Dr. Keyhan Farian and his aunt Parvin. He is survived by a sister Farah Gharavi, his dear aunts, Homma, Zoreh, Nahid, Hidokht and friends beyond measure. His appreciation for the beauty around him will inspire us forever.

HEADLINE: Safe Driver, High Costs

BYLINE: By ANN CARRNS

 BODY:
Some big insurance companies charge higher auto rates for lower-income drivers, even if the drivers have safe driving records, an analysis from the Consumer Federation of America finds.
The federation, a nonprofit comprising 250 consumer groups, has argued that insurers often give nondriving-related factors, like occupation and education, more weight than driving-related factors, and that such practices unfairly penalize lower- and moderate-income drivers. Occupation and education, the federation says, are proxies for income.
In its latest report, the federation obtained insurance quotes in 12 different cities from the public Web sites of five big auto insurers, using information for two hypothetical women. The insurers -- State Farm, Allstate, Geico, Farmers and Progressive -- represent more than half of the private auto insurance market, the federation said. 
Both drivers shared certain characteristics: Each was 30 years old; had been a driver for 10 years; lived in a ZIP code with a median income of $50,000; owned and drove a 2002 Honda Civic; drove 7,500 miles per year; and carried the minimum auto liability insurance required by state law (minimums vary from state to state).
The first driver, however, was a single receptionist with a high school education who had a 45-day gap in her insurance coverage, but had never had an accident or moving violation. (Gaps in coverage often occur because drivers can't afford their premiums, said Robert Hunter, the federation's director of insurance and a former Texas state insurance commissioner.)
The second driver was a married executive with a master's degree who owned a home, had continuous insurance coverage and one at-fault accident with $800 of damage in the last three years.
In two-thirds of the 60 quotes, the receptionist was quoted higher premiums, even though her driving record was clean. And in more than three-fifths of the cases, the premium quoted the receptionist exceeded the quote for the executive, who wasn't as safe a driver, by at least 25 percent.
The federation argues that "largely uncontrollable" factors, like education and occupation, are often given greater weight in rate setting than actual losses.
Robert Passmore, senior director of personal lines for the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America, said in a telephone interview that it was reasonable to use such factors because "they are predictive of loss." Different insurers give different weights to different factors, he said, depending on what they saw as the best way to predict a given driver's risk.
During a conference call with reporters, Mr. Hunter and Stephen Brobeck, the federation's executive director, were asked why the analysis didn't include smaller automobile insurers as well. They said it was because the analysis was time consuming and because the largest companies tend to offer the lowest rates, even though the federation still considered many of them to be unreasonably high for lower-income drivers.
The federation argues that the wide disparity in rates quoted, from company to company and market to market, suggests that the auto insurance market is not truly competitive, but the insurance industry rejects that position.
"Auto insurance provides important, cost-effective financial protection to millions of Americans, and most drivers have dozens of auto insurers constantly competing for their business," said Steven Weisbart, chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group, in a prepared statement. "The price is risk-based and always will be."
The federation's analysis found that in every case, Geico and Progressive quoted the safe driver -- the receptionist -- a higher premium than the driver who had caused an accident. In several cases, companies refused to provide a quote to the "good" driver, but offered one to the executive.
"We work to price each driver's policy as accurately as possible, so that every driver pays the appropriate amount based on his or her risk of having an accident," said Jeff Sibel, a spokesman for Progressive, in an e-mail. "We use multiple rating factors, which sometimes include nondriving factors that have been proven to be predictive of a person's likelihood of being involved in a crash."
Geico didn't respond to an e-mail seeking comment.
State Farm, however, charged the receptionist (the good driver) less than the bad driver in all 12 cities. In addition, in all the markets, State Farm's quotes were either the lowest or the second lowest.
That suggests, said Mr. Hunter, that State Farm gives less weight to nondriving factors than other companies. A State Farm representative declined to comment.
Mr. Hunter said states should insist that insurance companies make the factors used in setting their rates transparent, so consumers know how their applications for coverage were being considered.
Do you think factors like education and occupation should be used to set auto insurance rates?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Another Reset of Relations With Russia in Obama's Second Term

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and ANDREW E. KRAMER; Peter Baker contributed reporting from Washington, and Nicholas Kulish from Berlin.

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Four years ago, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. used an audience of world leaders at an annual security conference in Munich to propose a ''reset'' with Russia, the Obama administration's first big foreign policy statement. But as Mr. Biden arrives in Germany for the same conference this weekend, the United States is quietly adopting a new approach to its old cold war rival: the cold shoulder.
The intense engagement on the reset led to notable achievements, including the New Start nuclear arms treaty and Russia's entry into the World Trade Organization. But after more than a year of deteriorating relations, the administration now envisions a period of disengagement, according to government officials and outside analysts here and in Washington.
The pullback -- which may well be a topic of discussion when Mr. Biden meets with the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, on the sidelines of the conference -- is a response to months of intensifying political repression in Russia since Vladimir V. Putin returned to the presidency last May and a number of actions perceived by Washington as anti-American. 
Because American officials do not want to worsen the relationship and still hope for cooperation, they declined to publicly describe the plans. But within the administration it is taken for granted that the relationship with Russia is far less of a priority.
''We have real differences, and we don't hide them,'' said Tony Blinken, who has served as Mr. Biden's national security adviser and is now joining the president's national security team.
Briefing reporters before the Germany trip, Mr. Blinken said: ''We have differences over human rights and democracy. We have differences over -- in a number of areas that have been in the media in recent days and weeks.''
The distancing began with the recent withdrawal by the United States from the ''civil society working group,'' one of 20 panels created in 2009 to carry out the reset between Moscow and Washington under an umbrella organization known as the Obama-Medvedev Commission.
If that step was barely perceptible outside diplomatic circles, the strategy will soon become far more obvious. American officials say President Obama will decline an invitation -- publicly trumpeted by Mr. Lavrov and the Russian news media -- to visit Moscow on his own this spring. Instead, he will wait until September, when the G-20 conference of the world's largest economies is scheduled to take place in St. Petersburg, Russia.
And while Secretary of State John Kerry has yet to select his first overseas destination, officials said Russia had been ruled out.
The main goal seems to be to send a message that the United States views much of its relationship with Russia as optional, and while pressing matters will continue to be handled on a transactional basis, Washington plans to continue criticizing Russia on human rights and other concerns. As for the anti-Americanism, the new approach might be described as shrug and snub.
Nevertheless, Mr. Blinken said there was real potential to work through the differences. And American officials are clearly betting that Mr. Putin desires a prominent role on the world stage and will ultimately decide to re-engage.
But the chances of that seem slim. Mr. Putin's spokesman, Dmitri Peskov, warned that a pullback would be a shirking of American responsibility to work with Russia to maintain global stability. He said that Russia wanted to improve economic ties and build a stronger relationship, but that the United States must stay out of Russia's affairs.
''We have heard numerous times the word in Washington that Russia's domestic affairs are not satisfactory,'' Mr. Peskov said. ''Unfortunately these voices cannot be taken into account here, and we cannot agree with them. We are a genuine democratic country, and we are taking care of ourselves.''
In the nearly three years since the signing of the New Start treaty, followed by Russia's vote two months later at the Security Council in support of sanctions on Iran, American officials say only one major thing has changed: the return of Mr. Putin to the presidency.
Confronted by the emergence of a potent political opposition movement among Moscow's urban middle class, Mr. Putin has taken steps since his inauguration last May to suppress political dissent. Many of those steps were also seen in Washington as anti-American and undermining human rights.
These included the prosecution and jailing of members of the punk band Pussy Riot; the decision to end more than 20 years of cooperation on public health programs and civil society initiatives run by the United States Agency for International Development; cancellation of a partnership to dismantle unconventional weapons; and approval of legislative initiatives clamping down on pro-democracy groups and other nonprofit organizations.
The final straw appeared to be a law signed by Mr. Putin in December prohibiting the adoption of Russian children by American citizens, which the Kremlin said was retaliation for a new American law punishing Russian human rights violators. Senior Obama administration officials viewed the adoption ban not only as geopolitically disproportionate, but so utterly cruel in denying orphans the chance to join a family that it left many speechless and some near tears.
That the Russian government would put children in the political cross-fire convinced American officials that they were not confronting political theatrics, as they believed when Mr. Putin was running for re-election, but rather an increasingly idiosyncratic government driven by Russian domestic concerns, especially Mr. Putin's fears of popular unrest.
''It's a feeling of frustration that Putin and company are unnecessarily imposing strains on the Russian and American relationship,'' Zbigniew Brzezinski, a former national security adviser, now a trustee of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in a telephone interview.
''I would not construe that as saying that Russia needs to be downgraded, or is irrelevant,'' Mr. Brzezinski said, but that ''we do not need it for everything.''
Even Russia's most critical role in the global economy, as a major supplier of oil and gas -- particularly to American allies in Europe -- has ebbed, given the rise of the United States as a major producer of shale gas and the return of Iraq as a big oil producer.
At the same time, outside its borders, Russia remains indisputably relevant on a range of global issues, including the threats and opportunities from climate change in the Arctic and the political uncertainty in North Korea, that prevent the United States from pulling back too far.
''We can manage these issues effectively together, or end up shouting at each other,'' said James F. Collins, who was ambassador to Russia from 1997 to 2001 under President Bill Clinton. ''Anybody who suggests we are going to disengage and let them stew just doesn't get it. We will have to deal with them.''
Matthew Bryza, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for Eurasian affairs, said it would be best to deal dispassionately with Moscow.
''Every American president in my career has come into office thinking that they are going to be the great communicator that makes a breakthrough with Russia,'' Mr. Bryza said. ''As their terms have continued, every president has been disappointed.''
He added: ''Russia behaves like Russia. Russia pursues its own hard-core national interests. That is realpolitik. We should de-sentimentalize our relations.''

HEADLINE: Cockroach Ideas

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: They keep coming back. 

 BODY:
Three decades ago, when I went off for my year in the U.S. government, an old hand explained to me the nature of the job: it was mostly about fighting bad ideas. And these bad ideas, he went on to explain, were like cockroaches: no matter how many times you flush them down the toilet, they keep coming back. 
Lovely image, isn't it? But I'm feeling a bit grumpy this morning, and have been noticing a lot of cockroaches lately.
Thursday night I gave a book talk at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, which was actually a lovely event. But sure enough, there were people in the audience insisting that Barney Frank, as part of a powerless minority in the House, nonetheless somehow caused the housing bubble and the whole crisis; years of careful, evidence-based refutations have made no impact at all on these people. Although I have to admit that I'm a bad person; after one questioner finished his peroration with "Am I wrong?", I did kind of enjoy saying, "Yes, you're wrong".
And then there's the "Keynesians said the stimulus would fix the economy, and it didn't, so Keynes was wrong" -- Dean Baker points us to Joe Scarborough on the subject, and carefully walks us through what we knew and when we knew it. But here's an even easier takedown: just look at what I was writing in early 2009, here and here. What part of "the Obama plan just doesn't look adequate to the economy's need" is so hard to understand?
To paraphrase an old line about Vietnam, sometimes it seems to me that we haven't spent four years discussing the response to economic crisis; we've spent one year discussing the crisis, four times, with the discussion starting up each year as if nobody can remember or learn from what went before, and with constant repetition of the same old errors and fallacies.
Sometimes I get comments from people accusing me of repeating myself in the column; no doubt I do make the same arguments multiple times. But that's because people keep forgetting!
OK, rant for the morning over.

HEADLINE: The Boys at the Back

BYLINE: CHRISTINA HOFF SOMMERS


HIGHLIGHT: Boys are being left behind in educational advancement. We need to address the reasons. 

 BODY:
Boys score as well as or better than girls on most standardized tests, yet they are far less likely to get good grades, take advanced classes or attend college. Why? A study coming out this week in The Journal of Human Resources gives an important answer. Teachers of classes as early as kindergarten factor good behavior into grades - and girls, as a rule, comport themselves far better than boys.
The study's authors analyzed data from more than 5,800 students from kindergarten through fifth grade and found that boys across all racial groups and in all major subject areas received lower grades than their test scores would have predicted.
The scholars attributed this "misalignment" to differences in "noncognitive skills": attentiveness, persistence, eagerness to learn, the ability to sit still and work independently. As most parents know, girls tend to develop these skills earlier and more naturally than boys. 
No previous study, to my knowledge, has demonstrated that the well-known gender gap in school grades begins so early and is almost entirely attributable to differences in behavior. The researchers found that teachers rated boys as less proficient even when the boys did just as well as the girls on tests of reading, math and science. (The teachers did not know the test scores in advance.) If the teachers had not accounted for classroom behavior, the boys' grades, like the girls', would have matched their test scores.
That boys struggle with school is hardly news. Think of Shakespeare's "whining schoolboy with his satchel and shining morning face, creeping like snail unwillingly to school." Over all, it's likely that girls have long behaved better than boys at school (and earned better grades as a result), but their early academic success was not enough to overcome significant subsequent disadvantages: families' favoring sons over daughters in allocating scarce resources for schooling; cultural norms that de-emphasized girls' education, particularly past high school; an industrial economy that did not require a college degree to earn a living wage; and persistent discrimination toward women in the workplace.
Those disadvantages have lessened since about the 1970s. Parents, especially those of education and means, began to value their daughters' human capital as much as their sons'. Universities that had been dominated by affluent white men embraced meritocratic values and diversity of gender, race and class. The shift from a labor-intensive, manufacturing-reliant economy to a knowledge-based service economy significantly increased the relative value of college and postgraduate degrees. And while workplace inequities persisted, changing attitudes, legislation and litigation began to level the occupational playing field.
As these shifts were occurring, girls began their advance in education. In 1985, boys and girls took Advanced Placement exams at nearly the same rate. Around 1990, girls moved ahead of boys, and have never looked back. Women now account for roughly 60 percent of associate's, bachelor's and master's degrees and have begun to outpace men in obtaining Ph.D.'s.
There are some who say, well, too bad for the boys. If they are inattentive, obstreperous and distracting to their teachers and peers, that's their problem. After all, the ability to regulate one's impulses, delay gratification, sit still and pay close attention are the cornerstones of success in school and in the work force. It's long past time for women to claim their rightful share of the economic rewards that redound to those who do well in school.
As one critic told me recently, the classroom is no more rigged against boys than workplaces are rigged against lazy and unfocused workers. But unproductive workers are adults - not 5-year-olds. If boys are restless and unfocused, why not look for ways to help them do better? As a nation, can we afford not to?
A few decades ago, when we realized that girls languished behind boys in math and science, we mounted a concerted effort to give them more support, with significant success. Shouldn't we do the same for boys?
When I made this argument in my book "The War Against Boys," almost no one was talking about boys' academic, social and vocational problems. Now, 12 years later, the press, books and academic journals are teeming with such accounts. Witness the crop of books in recent years: Leonard Sax's "Boys Adrift," Liza Mundy's "The Richer Sex," Hanna Rosin's "The End of Men."
In a revised version of the book, I've changed the subtitle - to "How Misguided Policies Are Harming Our Young Men" from "How Misguided Feminism Is Harming Our Young Men" - and moved away from criticizing feminism; instead I emphasized boy-averse trends like the decline of recess, zero-tolerance disciplinary policies, the tendency to criminalize minor juvenile misconduct and the turn away from single-sex schooling. As our schools have become more feelings-centered, risk-averse, collaboration-oriented and sedentary, they have moved further and further from boys' characteristic sensibilities. Concerns about boys arose during a time of tech bubble prosperity; now, more than a decade later, there are major policy reasons - besides the stale "culture wars" of the 1990s - to focus on boys' schooling.
One is the heightened attention to school achievement as the cornerstone of lifelong success. Grades determine entry into advanced classes, enrichment programs and honor societies. They open - or close - doors to higher education. "If grade disparities emerge this early on, it's not surprising that by the time these children are ready to go to college, girls will be better positioned," says Christopher M. Cornwell, an economist at the University of Georgia and an author of the new study, along with his colleague David B. Mustard and Jessica Van Parys of Columbia University.
A second reason is globalization. Richard Whitmire, an education writer, and William Brozo, a literacy expert, write that "the global economic race we read so much about - the marathon to produce the most educated work force, and therefore the most prosperous nation - really comes down to a calculation: whichever nation solves these 'boy troubles' wins the race." That's probably an overstatement, but we do know that the large-scale entry of women into the work force paid large economic dividends. It stands to reason that raising male academic achievement is essential to raising labor productivity and, ultimately, living standards.
A third reason: improving the performance of black, Latino and lower-income kids requires particular attention to boys. Black women are nearly twice as likely to earn a college degree as black men. At some historically black colleges, the gap is astounding: Fisk is now 64 female; Howard, 67 percent; Clark Atlanta, 75 percent. The economist Andrew M. Sum and his colleagues at the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University examined the Boston Public Schools and found that for the graduating class of 2007, there were 191 black girls for every 100 boys going on to attend a four-year college or university. Among Hispanics, the ratio was 175 girls for every 100 boys; among whites, 153 for every 100.
Young men from middle-class or more comfortable backgrounds aren't lagging quite as far behind, but the gender gap exists there, too. Judith Kleinfeld, a psychology professor at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, analyzed the reading skills of white males from college-educated families. She showed that at the end of high school, 23 percent of the these boys scored "below basic," compared with 7 percent of their female counterparts. "This means that almost one in four boys who have college-educated parents cannot read a newspaper with understanding," she wrote.
WHAT might we do to help boys improve? For one thing, we can follow the example of the British, the Canadians and the Australians. They have openly addressed the problem of male underachievement. They are not indulging boys' tendency to be inattentive. Instead, they are experimenting with programs to help them become more organized, focused and engaged. These include more boy-friendly reading assignments (science fiction, fantasy, sports, espionage, battles); more recess (where boys can engage in rough-and-tumble as a respite from classroom routine); campaigns to encourage male literacy; more single-sex classes; and more male teachers (and female teachers interested in the pedagogical challenges boys pose).
These efforts should start early, but even high school isn't too late. Consider Aviation High School in New York City. A faded orange brick building with green aluminum trim, it fits comfortably with its gritty neighbors - a steelyard, a tool-supply outlet and a 24-hour gas station and convenience store - in Long Island City, Queens.
On a visit to Aviation I observed a classroom of 14- and 15-year-olds focused on constructing miniaturized, electrically wired airplane wings from mostly raw materials. In another class, students worked in teams - with a student foreman and crew chief - to take apart and then rebuild a small jet engine in just 20 days. In addition to pursuing a standard high school curriculum, Aviation students spend half of the day in hands-on classes on airframes, hydraulics and electrical systems. They put up with demanding English and history classes because unless they do well in them, they cannot spend their afternoons tinkering with the engine of a Cessna 411.
The school's 2,200 pupils - mostly students of color, from low-income households - have a 95 percent attendance rate and a 90 percent graduation rate, with 80 percent going on to college. The school is coed; although girls make up only 16 percent of the student population, they appear to be flourishing. The New York City Department of Education has repeatedly awarded Aviation an "A" on its annual school progress reports. U.S. News & World Report has cited it as one of the best high schools in the nation.
"The school is all about structure," an assistant principal, Ralph Santiago, told me. The faculty emphasizes organization, precision, workmanship and attention to detail. The students are kept so busy and are so fascinated with what they are doing that they have neither the time nor the desire for antics.
Not everyone of either sex is interested in airplanes. But vocational high schools with serious academic requirements are an important part of the solution to male disengagement from school.
I can sympathize with those who roll their eyes at the relatively recent alarm over boys' achievement. Where was the indignation when men dominated higher education, decade after decade? Isn't it time for women and girls to enjoy the advantages? The impulse is understandable but misguided. I became a feminist in the 1970s because I did not appreciate male chauvinism. I still don't. But the proper corrective to chauvinism is not to reverse it and practice it against males, but rather basic fairness. And fairness today requires us to address the serious educational deficits of boys and young men. The rise of women, however long overdue, does not require the fall of men.

HEADLINE: We Can Be Healthy and Rich

BYLINE: EZEKIEL J. EMANUEL


HIGHLIGHT: Controlling health care costs will help, not hurt, the economy. 

 BODY:
Just about everyone agrees that health care in America is too expensive, and that something must be done to control the rising costs. Except for one group: hospitals and the unions representing hospital workers.
They believe that controlling health care costs will hurt the economy and increase unemployment. They point out that hospitals are among the largest employers in many communities and that, unlike other employers, they are adding jobs at a good clip.
But the truth is that bending the health care cost curve will actually spur the economy forward. According to the Council of Economic Advisers, reducing health care cost increases by just 1 percentage point every year would lead to a 4 percent increase in G.D.P. by 2030. In today's dollars, that would mean an extra $600 billion for our economy and an extra $7,000 for the average family. 
In some ways, it's easy to sympathize with the hospitals' worries: their concern is that competition in the new insurance exchanges and other changes catalyzed by the Affordable Care Act will result in lower premiums. To stay profitable, insurance companies will have to pressure hospitals to reduce their rates. And since 60 percent of an average hospital's costs are labor, employees will be laid off and wages cut. At a time when hospital support jobs pay about 10 percent more and typically come with more generous benefits than comparable jobs in other industries, it's understandable that health care employees are resistant.
But this line of reasoning is misguided. First, cost control is not the same thing as cost reduction. The financial goal of reforms like reducing hospital readmissions and hospital-acquired infections and encouraging competition among insurance companies is to stem the rate of growth in health care spending. We spent about $2.8 trillion on health care last year, and the system wastes approximately $700 billion annually, but no one is proposing that these expenditures decline to even $2.6 trillion. Cost control is simply about staving off the date when health care spending exceeds $4 trillion.
In addition, even if hospitals had to restructure their operations to deliver care more efficiently, it wouldn't necessarily mean fewer health care workers over all - any decline in hospital jobs would probably mean an increase in other health-related jobs like home health aides.
Where the opponents of cost control really go wrong is on the macroeconomics. Layoffs in the health care industry would increase unemployment and lower wages, they argue, thereby reducing consumer spending and hurting the economy. But both liberal and conservative economists agree that ever rising health care spending is a huge drag on the economy. As one of the Heritage Foundation's fellows wrote: "If Americans could attain the current level of health for a lower total cost, the resources saved could be used for some other beneficial purpose, and U.S. economic well-being would undoubtedly improve."
There is a good parallel in the agriculture industry. The introduction of tractors with internal combustion engines in the early 20th century caused unemployment among farmworkers, but it also increased productivity and made food cheaper. In 1920, about 40 percent of an American family's income went to purchasing food. Today the average family spends approximately 10 percent of its income on food, which means more disposable income to spend on other rewarding items - education, appliances, smartphones, computers - and more jobs in these industries.
Health care will follow a related path. Savings won't just disappear. They'll go into other purchases, often ones that are more valuable, like higher education or rapid transit, creating construction jobs while making our commutes easier. Small businesses, if they don't have to cover ever increasing insurance costs, could instead pay higher wages and hire more workers. The estimated reduction in health care premiums because of the Affordable Care Act will mean that in 2019 average families will pay about $2,000 less than they would have without cost control, freeing up money for purchases or retirement.
Some people may argue that they would take a lower G.D.P. and slower growth if it meant that we were healthier. But this, too, is wrong. There is no link between how much we spend and how healthy we are. Many other countries, including Australia, France and Germany, spend less but perform better on many health care measures. It's true even for different regions in the United States: there is no link between higher spending and better health.
It's clear that, far from creating unemployment and hurting the economy, the more we can control health care costs, the more Americans will prosper. Ultimately, however, this debate should be irrelevant. Health care is about keeping people healthy or fixing them up when they get sick. It is not a jobs program.

HEADLINE: The Early Word: Push and Tug

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, the president's weekly address, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
 In Today's Times 

        
President Obama proposed a compromise on contraceptive coverage on Friday that would allow women employed by religious organizations that do not want to provide birth control coverage to obtain it separately from their insurers. But Robert Pear writes that the proposal did not end the political and legal battles in a tug of war over birth control that has left Mr. Obama struggling to balance women's rights, health care and religious freedom.
 

        
Binyamin Appelbaumlooks at the deliberations among the monetary policy makers at the Federal Reserve over how to manage the economy in the face of stagnant employment and dropping inflation.

        
Jennifer Steinhauer points out how the testy Senate hearings on the nomination of Chuck Hagel, a former Republican senator, to be secretary of defense revealed to a striking degree the erosion of decorum in the upper chamber. The phenomenon has set veterans from both parties on edge. And while Democrats expect to confirm Mr. Hagel, the discord is only expected to grow as Republicans face competitive primaries and add to their ranks more new and deeply conservative members who have less regard for the old rules of comity and respect for elders.

        
Energy Secretary Steven Chu's decision to leave the Obama administration soon will add to a slate of vacancies at departments dealing with energy and the environment. Matthew L. Wald reviews Dr. Chu's science-focused tenure and runs through a shortlist of possible successors topped by former Gov. Christine O. Gregoire of Washington State.

        
Former Senator Scott P. Brown's decision to stay out of the June 25 special election for the Senate seat John Kerry vacated to become secretary of state leaves Massachusetts Republicans without a prize horse in the race. But Katharine Q. Seelye writes that Mr. Brown is privately flirting with a run for governor in 2014 and has the campaign money to back himself up. While Republicans scout a viable Senate candidate, two Democratic congressmen, Edward J. Markey and Stephen F. Lynch, are headed for a primary on April 30.

        
A century and a half after Charles Darwin published "The Origin of Species," evolution continues to be politically divisive among Christians. Using the opposing views of Representative Rush D. Holt, Democrat of New Jersey, and Paul Broun, Republican of Georgia, Mark Oppenheimer looks at the role Darwin and his theories have played in Christian politics.
 The Weekly Address 

        
President Obama used his weekly address to call for a balanced approach to the federal budget. Citing a recent falloff in economic growth attributed to inaction in Washington, Mr. Obama called for investments in education and infrastructure and an overhaul of entitlement programs like Medicare as part of a deal to reduce the federal deficit. He said that "2013 can be a year of solid growth, more jobs, and higher wages. But that will only happen if we put a stop to self-inflicted wounds in Washington."
 Happenings in Washington 

        
Among the guests on the Sunday television talk shows are Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Leon E. Panetta, the departing secretary of defense. The topics include gun control, immigration, the war in Afghanistan and Super Bowl XLVII.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths KOCH, EDWARD I

 BODY:
KOCH--Edward I. On behalf of the LaGuardia Community College community I offer condolences to the family and friends of one of New York's most popular and beloved mayors. We mourn the loss of a great man, but reflect with gratitude on the honor he bestowed upon us to preserve his legacy of public service in the Koch Collection housed in the La Guardia and Wagner Archives here on campus. As one of the College's earliest and most passionate advocates, Mayor Koch was larger than life and passionate about improving life for all residents of the city he loved. His love for New York was evident not only in his exuberant engagement with his constituents, but in his diligence in facilitating the city's economic rebound in the wake of the fiscal crisis of the 1970s. LaGuardia is committed to ensuring that students and scholars study this historic city leader's legacy for years to come. Dr. Gail O. Mellow, President

HEADLINE: Learning From Failure

BYLINE: By SAM LOEWENBERG. 
Sam Loewenberg was a 2012 Nieman Foundation global health reporting fellow at Harvard. Financial support for this article was provided by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.

 BODY:
AMERICANS love success stories. Go to the Web sites of the United States Agency for International Development, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation or a plethora of global health and development organizations, and you'll find articles, charts and videos documenting their triumphs and innovations, with the promise of more on the way.
Beyond simply doing good, there's an impetus to show success: nongovernmental organizations, contractors and researchers want a good track record, funding officials must show they are spending wisely, and journal editors want to highlight breakthroughs. 
But ''success stories'' are rarely the whole story. Global health and development projects frequently go off course, and it's not unusual for them to fail outright. What is unusual is for researchers to openly discuss their failures. That's a shame, because it's a basic principle of science that you get things right by analyzing what went wrong.
So it was a pleasant surprise when, last summer, researchers at Mumbai's City Initiative for Newborn Health published, in the journal PLoS Medicine, the disappointing results of their three-year effort to implement a community-based maternal- and infant-health initiative in the city's slums.
It was a textbook global health project: community-based, empowering the beneficiaries, focusing on women and children. And the model was successful elsewhere, reducing newborn mortality rates in other parts of India, as well as Bolivia and Nepal, and by 30 to 40 percent.
But those programs were in rural areas. This was the first time the effort was tried in an urban setting.
It turned out to be a major hurdle. While urban areas have the advantage of more infrastructure and health services, there are also unexpected variables and unanticipated dynamics. Much of the global health boom since the 1990s has focused on rural areas; far less work has been done on urban programs, in part because those situations are difficult.
And Mumbai is not just any big city. More than half its nearly 13 million people are jammed into the concrete and corrugated-metal mazes of the city's slums. In 2005, the researchers began gathering data in 48 slum communities. They set up 244 women's groups, which met biweekly with social workers to discuss maternal and child health problems, counsel one another and work to develop solutions.
While that worked in rural villages, in the city slums, mothers were hesitant to depend on neighbors. At some meetings, residents from one street would not sit with hosts from a block away.
The researchers tried using innovative approaches to engage the women. In one case, they had them play a game, using cards that presented various social and health problems. The women then devised their own solutions within the game. But such prompting didn't lead to substantial action back in the real world.
Measuring improvement in rural infant health is also easier than in urban areas. In the former, the situation is often so dire that almost any well-devised intervention will bring substantial improvements. In cities, people have access to urgent care through public hospitals. It is more in the pre-emergency period, before it becomes simply a matter of life or death, where change is needed.
Yet mothers in slums see issues like stunting and chronic disease as part of life and think ''that's how children will grow up in this environment,'' said Neena Shah More, a researcher with the Society for Nutrition, Education and Health Action, a member of the consortium behind the project. Instead, water and sanitation were top priorities. But those long-term issues were beyond the project's scope.
Last year they rebooted. They set up small centers that offer basic health services like immunization, feeding, family planning and help navigating the city's convoluted health and social service systems. So far, providing concrete services, rather than just advice on collective organizing, seems to be more in tune with the needs of people in the slums.
The travails of the Newborn Health project aren't unique. What is noteworthy is that when the project did not work as planned, the team reported it openly and in detail, providing potentially valuable information for other researchers.
The risk is that too few people will follow. Especially in tough economic times, the pressure is on to show that they are getting bang for their buck. Last year an Obama administration official called on the aid community to adopt a ''permanent campaign mind-set,'' in which fund-raising and promotion are on the front burner. This creates an incentive to go for easy victories, highlight successes and bury failures. Even with the new fad in the aid world for metrics and impact assessments, their public reports are rarely forthcoming about missteps.
That's bad science. While aid organizations must be accountable for outcomes, that pressure for positive results should not be an encouragement to skimp on the truth. Making a difference in the world is hard, often messy work. Pretending otherwise is no help at all.

HEADLINE: The Mouse That Roars

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEELE

 BODY:
TESTED Nissan Versa SL
WHAT IS IT? An entry-level subcompact sedan distinguished mostly by its price: the base model is America's cheapest new car.
HOW MUCH? The base S with a manual transmission is $12,780 including the destination charge, up $1,000 from last year. The top-shelf SL starts at $17,680.
WHAT'S UNDER THE HOOD? A 1.6-liter in-line 4-cylinder that is, in the case of the tested SL, bound and gagged by a highly erratic continuously variable transmission. 
IS IT THIRSTY? The E.P.A. rating is 31 miles per gallon in the city, 40 on the highway and 35 combined.
ALTERNATIVES Ford Fiesta, Honda Fit, Hyundai Accent, Thomas Built school bus.
The directions to Long Island ought to have been easy -- drive east until you see water -- but it was the Friday before a holiday weekend and I'd gotten tangled in late afternoon traffic. As I approached an exit for the Belt Parkway, the Nissan Versa's five-inch navigation screen resembled an anatomical chart of an inflamed knee.
My G.P.S. advised me to keep right, but a twinge in my vestigial sense of direction told me to bear left. I coasted for a few seconds, tapped the brakes and decided to go with instinct. I spotted a narrow opening to my left and pressed the gas.
Suddenly the engine let out a pained roar and I felt the Versa seize up as if it had been shot from under me. The car had lost its momentum and I was stuck between lanes, with what seemed like a stampede of S.U.V.'s charging past on either side. I edged into the left lane on blind faith -- only through pure luck did the Versa not get trampled.
I hadn't felt so unsettled behind the wheel in ages, perhaps not since I was 16. Back then I was still learning to drive a stick shift, and when I'd miss a gear the same thing would happen: a howl of objection from the engine and a terrifying second or two of being completely at the mercy of my fellow drivers.
The culprit in this case was the Versa's Next Generation Xtronic continuously variable transmission, or C.V.T. In theory, a C.V.T. should do a better job of choosing the most efficient engine speed for a car's given velocity than a conventional automatic (or a gearshift-mangling teenager) would. But the Versa's C.V.T. offers gear selection so arbitrary that one imagines not so much a pair of conical pulleys as a roulette wheel.
It's not that Nissan can't build a decent C.V.T.; I found the transmissions mostly unobtrusive in the Juke and the Rogue. But time and again the Versa's engine would over-rev without any corresponding input from my right foot, at 40 m.p.h. on a flat road or accelerating from a rolling stop. Remember that terrible driver's ed feeling of shifting into second when you meant to shift to fourth? The Versa's C.V.T. makes those mistakes for you.
Perhaps this is fitting, because the Versa is every bit an entry-level vehicle. The 4-cylinder engine musters a mere 109 horsepower, which is low enough that I can actually picture the horses; after a strenuous uphill climb I was tempted to thank each of them by name. The car is tuned for beginners, with firm braking and steering that's not too sensitive. You can point it dead ahead on straightaways and take your hands off the wheel, freeing them to wave other cars past.
There's nothing wrong with entry-level if it's done right. And the Versa does have its selling points. It's fairly roomy, especially the back seat. Trunk space is more than adequate. And appearance-wise it's perhaps no worse than your typical stubby subcompact sedan. Its mileage claims were right on the money: I averaged a little over 33 m.p.g. over a weekend of combined city-highway driving in the 2012 SL. The 2013 model gets low-rolling-resistance tires and a few design tweaks that lift the combined fuel economy estimate to 35; a conventional 4-speed automatic is now offered as well, but only on the bare-bones S.
Indeed, part of the SL's problem may be that it's not entry-level enough. Its nicer touches seemed out of place -- mixed in with the cloth seats and plasticky controls were chrome door handles, brushed-steel steering wheel trim and a tech package with satellite radio and the aforementioned navigation system.
The premium touches can push the SL above $18,000. For that money you might as well buy something like a Ford Fiesta, which offers finer interior appointments, a sportier profile and a powertrain that, while modest, is at least predictable.
Still, Nissan must be doing something right. Last year, the Versa family (including the hatchback, which is being reintroduced for 2014 as the Versa Note) was the sales leader among subcompacts by a substantial margin.
And who knows -- if I were the father of a teenage driver I might consider buying him a Versa sedan. But if so, I'd call Nissan's bluff and buy the base car with the 5-speed manual.
It can't be any worse than the C.V.T., and besides, I think there's still real value in forcing a young driver to grapple with a stick shift. Give him a feel for the car before he learns to ignore it in favor of the latest app. Make him understand that driving is not a thing that happens on a computer screen -- that every merge into traffic is a make-or-break moment.

HEADLINE: Of Rates and Bubbles

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''A New Housing Boom? Don't Count on It'' (Economic View, Jan. 27), Robert J. Shiller said it was hard to know whether home prices might be surging anytime soon, contrary to recent noises in the market. 
I agree that the market's uncertainties are considerable. Say a homebuyer takes out a $300,000, 30-year mortgage at 3.5 percent interest, resulting in a monthly payment of $1,347. Then suppose that this same homebuyer wants to sell seven years from now, and that rates have climbed to 7 percent. A new buyer with a $300,000 mortgage would have a payment of $1,996 a month, or 48 percent higher. Unless incomes increase commensurately, that new buyer will be able to afford much less.
Artificially low mortgage rates are inflating a housing bubble with potentially difficult consequences. A helpful government policy would be, for a small premium, to make loans assumable, thus allowing a future seller to pass on low rates, and thus maybe avoid a collapse.

HEADLINE: Self-Reliance, Learned Early

BYLINE: By CAROL COLOMBO. 
As told to Patricia R. Olsen.

 BODY:
I'M the oldest of six. My dad was an engineer at Xerox and started his own medical technology company on the side, which was ahead of its time and did well. When I was an adolescent, we moved from Rochester to Arizona, where he started a second company, which sold an oil-based product used in items like sinks and bathtubs. That company failed as a result of the 1970s oil embargo.
It was a difficult time for my family. I had to help with my siblings and eventually buy my own clothes and a car, but it gave me a sense of inner strength. I realized I'd always be able to take care of myself and that no job was beneath me. I also believed that no job was above me, so I didn't put any limits on myself. 
In 1983 I graduated from Northern Arizona University with a degree in political science, then attended George Washington University Law School. While job-searching during my final year, I interviewed with five harried partners of a New York law firm over lunch; they peppered me with questions. When I scooped up some cantaloupe, it flew off my spoon and hit a nearby diner in the face. All five partners turned as one to look, then turned back in unison. No one said a word or even smiled. I wrote them off because they were working so hard that they'd forgotten how to laugh.
After graduating in 1986, I joined a different law firm, then called Brown & Bain, working in corporate law. In 1992, my friend Anthony Bonacci and I started our own law firm, Colombo & Bonacci. I focused on corporate investment opportunities in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America. In 2000, we started another company, Axon Capital, to provide business advisory services in the United States and Latin America.
We dissolved Axon Capital in 2007, and we don't practice law anymore, either. But I've stayed involved in international economic development.
While at Brown & Bain, I led a trade mission to bring together several United States C.E.O.'s with Carlos Salinas de Gortari, then Mexico's president, to discuss the North American Free Trade Agreement. In the last 20 years, I've served in more than 10 organizations involving public policy and trade. Currently, I'm the Arizona representative to the Office of the United States Trade Representative and serve on its Intergovernmental Policy Advisory Committee.
I learned about Amber Alert GPS when a friend introduced me to Russ Thornton, who founded it after his young son became lost in an amusement park for the better part of an hour. Tony Bonacci and I invested in the company, and in 2011 I became chairwoman of the parent, Alert GPS Holdings. That year, Russ asked me to become C.E.O. of Alert GPS Holdings and Amber Alert GPS so he could focus efforts on mobile applications for the company.
Our global positioning device fits into a child's backpack or is attached to his or her clothing. Parents can either log into a portal on our Web site to monitor their child's whereabouts, or do so from a Web-enabled smartphone. Children can signal their parents by pressing an S.O.S. button on the device.
The year I joined, we bought most of the assets of Amberalert.com, which included a technology called LEAP, for Law Enforcement Alerting Portal. It enables law enforcement organizations to issue Amber Alerts when a child is missing. We provide the technology free to coordinators in participating states.
Our headquarters are in Utah, but I live in Arizona and often work at home when I'm not in our corporate office. I've had a huge learning curve in this job because it's in a new industry for me. It was a bit terrifying, but I realized that you can't allow technology to intimidate. You just have to jump in, which is actually part of the fun.

HEADLINE: Parcells Is Chosen For Pro Football Hall; Strahan Falls Short

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN HOFFMAN

 BODY:
NEW ORLEANS -- Bill Parcells, the only coach to lead four teams to the playoffs and the winner of two Super Bowls with the Giants, highlighted a class of seven inductees to the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Saturday.
Joined by Larry Allen, Cris Carter, Jonathan Ogden, Warren Sapp and two senior candidates, Parcells will go in without another prominent Giant, Michael Strahan, who failed to make the cut in his first year of eligibility. 
''It's just unbelievable,'' Parcells said in a phone interview that was played during the presentation. ''It's a great thrill.''
The members of the voting committee present at the announcement said Parcells inspired the longest and liveliest debate of the 17 finalists, with the discussion over his candidacy lasting more than one hour.
''I don't think there's any question that Bill Parcells is a Hall of Fame coach,'' said Tom Coughlin, the current Giants coach. ''He has Hall of Fame accomplishments throughout his entire career.
''Parcells coached for a long time, he worked for a lot of different franchises. It was kind of surprising to me, after the first go-round, I thought, 'Why isn't he in?' ''
John Mara, the Giants' president and chief executive, concurred. ''I'm very happy for Bill,'' he said. ''This is long overdue. He's one of the best coaches in N.F.L. history.''
Parcells, 71, ever the irascible coach, engaged in some repartee with a fellow inductee.
''You were one of the finest coaches to ever coach in the N.F.L.,'' Ogden, a longtime left tackle for the Baltimore Ravens, said of Parcells. ''I want to congratulate you.''
''I guess I have a different perspective on you,'' Parcells replied. ''I always thought you were a pain in the neck.''
Ogden and Allen were on the ballot for the first time, and the two low-key offensive linemen seemed happy and relaxed onstage, saying they had not considered their chances all that much and that they were happy to be there.
Their casual demeanor served as a sharp contrast to Carter and Sapp, both of whom displayed plenty of dramatics.
Carter seemingly had the most cause to be excited because it was his sixth time on the ballot. His enshrinement makes him the first of three high-profile wide receivers -- the others are Tim Brown and Andre Reed -- to break through after failing to make the Hall in recent years despite excellent statistics.
''One of us had to get in,'' Carter, the longtime Minnesota Vikings star, said to laughs from everyone on stage. ''It's becoming very difficult to judge the skill of a wide receiver in today's game. But one thing you can judge them on is the numbers.''
In terms of numbers, Carter's candidacy was hard to argue with. He retired second to Jerry Rice in nearly every receiving category and is still in the top five in receptions and receiving touchdowns.
His 13,899 receiving yards are ninth in N.F.L. history.
Over the past few years, Carter, Brown and Reed had appeared on the ballot a combined 17 times without getting in. The writers cited the inflation of statistics as the main reason for the struggles of wide receivers in the voting.
The fifth modern candidate, Sapp, was his typical boisterous self, but he took time to credit his Tampa Bay Buccaneers teammates, saying that without Derrick Brooks, John Lynch and others, he knew he would not be sitting there.
Still, he did take time to congratulate himself as well.
''Marshall said it was heaven,'' Sapp said his co-worker at the NFL Network, Marshall Faulk, had told him of being elected. ''Where's my wings at? I want to fly.''
A larger-than-life personality, Sapp was a dominant defensive tackle for Tampa Bay, helping turn around the fortunes of a moribund franchise while collecting 96.5 sacks. He was named to the N.F.L.'s All-Decade team for both the 1990s and the 2000s, a feat also accomplished by Allen.
The two senior candidates, Curley Culp and Dave Robinson, were not part of the broadcast, but their careers were just as impressive as those of the modern candidates. Culp, a defensive star for the Kansas City Chiefs and the Houston Oilers, was a six-time Pro Bowler and was the 1975 defensive player of the year. Robinson, a member of Vince Lombardi's Green Bay Packers, was a first-team All-N.F.L. player three times and was named to the N.F.L.'s All-Decade team of the 1960s.
For Strahan, the only first-time finalist who did not get in, enshrinement will have to wait another year despite the fact that he holds the single-season sacks record and that he led the Giants to one of the biggest upsets in Super Bowl history, the 17-14 defeat of the New England Patriots on Feb. 3, 2008. Also not making the cut were the former owners of both of the franchises set to face off in Sunday's Super Bowl, with neither Edward DeBartolo Jr. of the San Francisco 49ers nor Art Modell of the Ravens making it in.
The seven new Hall of Famers will be officially inducted Aug. 3.

HEADLINE: The Virtual Middle Class Rises

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN. 
Ross Douthat and Maureen Dowd are off today. Nicholas D. Kristof is on book leave.

 BODY:
NEW DELHI
I ENCOUNTERED something on this trip to India that I had never met before: a whole new political community -- India's ''virtual middle class.'' Its emergence explains a lot about the rise of social protests here, as well as in places like China and Egypt. It is one of the most exciting things happening on the planet. Historically, we have associated democratic revolutions with rising middle classes achieving certain levels of per capita annual income -- say, $10,000 -- so people can worry less about basic food and housing and more about being treated as citizens with rights and with a voice in their own futures. But here's what's fascinating: The massive diffusion of powerful, cheap computing power via cellphones and tablets over the last decade has dramatically lowered the costs of connectivity and education -- so much so that many more people in India, China and Egypt, even though they're still just earning a few dollars a day, now have access to the kind of technologies and learning previously associated solely with the middle class. 
That's why India today has a 300-million-person middle class and another 300-million-person virtual middle class, who, though still very poor, are increasingly demanding the rights, roads, electricity, uncorrupted police and good governance normally associated with rising middle classes. This is putting more pressure than ever on India's elected politicians to get their governance act together.
''Thanks to technology and the spread of education, more and more people are being empowered at lower and lower levels of income than ever before, so they think and act as if they were in the middle class, demanding human security and dignity and citizens' rights,'' explained Khalid Malik, the director of the U.N.'s Human Development Report Office and author of the book ''Why Has China Grown So Fast for So Long?'' ''This is a tectonic shift. The Industrial Revolution was a 10-million-person story. This is a couple-of-billion-person story.''
And it's not just driven by the 900 million cellphones in use in India today or the 400 million bloggers in China. The United States Agency for International Development office here in New Delhi connected me with a group of Indian social entrepreneurs the U.S. is supporting, and the power of the tools they are putting in the hands of India's virtual middle class at low prices is jaw-dropping. Gram Power is creating smart microgrids and smart meters to provide reliable, scalable power for Indian rural areas, where 600 million Indians do not have regular (or any) electricity with which to work, read and learn. For 20 cents a day, Gram Power offers villagers a prepaid electricity card that can power all their home appliances. Healthpoint Services is providing safe drinking water for a family of six for 5 cents a day and telemedicine consultations for 20 cents a visit. VisionSpring is now distributing examinations and eyeglasses to India's poor for $2 to $3 each. The Institute for Reproductive Health is alerting women of their fertile days each month with text messages, indicating when unprotected sex should be avoided to prevent unwanted pregnancies. And Digital Green is providing low-cost communications systems for Indian farmers and women's groups to show each their best practices through digital films projected on a dirt floor.
These technologies still need scale, but they are on their way. And they are enabling millions more Indians to at least feel as if they are middle class and the political empowerment that goes with that, says Nayan Chanda, who runs the YaleGlobal Online Magazine and is co-editor of ''A World Connected: Globalization in the 21st Century.''
In December, a 23-year-old Indian woman -- whose father worked double shifts as an airport baggage handler, making about $200 a month so his daughter could go to school to become a physiotherapist -- was gang-raped on a bus after she and a male friend had gone to a movie. She later died from injuries sustained in the rape.
She was a high-aspiring member of this new virtual Indian middle class, and her brutal rape and subsequent death triggered nationwide protests for better governance. ''It is one of those turning points in history when a citizenry, so far pleased with economic gain, wants more than material comfort,'' said Chanda. ''They want recognition of their rights; they want quality of life and, most importantly, the good governance they have come to expect by watching the world.''
Ditto China. In December, noted Chanda, ''when a Chinese censor in Guangzhou committed the unprecedented intrusion by physically entering the premises of Southern Weekend paper and rewriting their New Year editorial -- turning a critical one into a panegyric of the Communist Party -- Chinese journalists exploded. For the first time in history, they publicly demanded the resignation of the censor and China's Twitter, Weibo, lit up with anger.''
And, of course, the Arab Awakening was triggered, not by middle-class college students, but by an aspiring-to-be-in-the-middle-class Tunisian vegetable seller who was abused by corrupt police. Leaders beware: Your people don't need to be in the middle class anymore, in economic terms, to have the education, tools and mind-set of the middle class -- to feel entitled to a two-way conversation and to be treated like citizens with real rights and decent governance.

HEADLINE: Banks, at Least, Had A Friend in Geithner

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
TIMOTHY F. GEITHNER left the Treasury Department last week after four years as secretary. So how did he do?
As financial adviser to the president in the tumultuous years immediately after the credit crisis, Mr. Geithner had immense sway over the government's approach to all things economic. For everyday Americans, his major tasks included responding to the home foreclosure mess, unwinding federal bailouts under the Troubled Asset Relief Program and tackling the problem of financial institutions that are too big to manage and too interconnected for America's good.
But in scanning these agenda items, a pattern of winners and losers emerges. Let's just say the financial institutions that dominate the United States were rarely on the losing end in the Geithner years. 
I wanted to speak with Mr. Geithner to allow him to respond to his critics and to get his take on his years in the job. A spokeswoman said he was on vacation and unavailable.
So I turned to the Treasury's Web site, where I found a list of 75 facts about Mr. Geithner's tenure. Among other things, I learned that on his watch the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network assessed its two biggest penalties against banks for money-laundering and that the Treasury Department cracked down on offshore tax evasion. I also found he has logged more than 600,000 miles on international trips, played basketball in China and cricket in India, and has his signature on $17 billion of United States currency.
Clearly, Mr. Geithner was busy. He had to deal with severe financial troubles overseas, navigate relationships with China and Europe and negotiate with Congress on contentious tax matters.
Mr. Geithner has spoken to other journalists about the work that he and his colleagues did in the aftermath of the financial crisis. He said that this work ''was incredibly effective for the broad interest of the economy and the financial system,'' and that he believed his financial reform efforts ''will significantly reduce the probability and the intensity of crises for a long period of time.'' He also denied that bankers have too much political influence in Washington.
That's news to Jeff Connaughton, who was chief of staff to Ted Kaufman, a former Democratic senator from Delaware. Mr. Connaughton, author of ''The Payoff: Why Wall Street Always Wins,'' said he believed that Treasury's kid-glove treatment of the big banks would have the lasting effect of ensuring future crises.
While banks recovered quickly and the Dow is around 14,000, he said last week, ''the economy is still sputtering for millions of Americans whose livelihoods were devastated by the financial crisis.'' He added: ''The legal and regulatory framework that Geithner leaves behind for preventing a future financial crisis inspires little confidence, especially amid scandals emerging almost weekly at banks too big and complex to manage, regulate, police and fail.''
How did Treasury favor the banks? Consider its answer to the foreclosure mess. After promising to help four million borrowers, its Home Affordable Modification Program at last count had helped about one-quarter of that number.
One reason for this is that the program was flawed from the start.
First, the Treasury made the program voluntary, awarding funds to participating banks but failing to penalize those that did not. The program was all carrot, no stick.
Worse, the initial plan didn't require the banks to write down second liens they may have held -- like home equity lines -- from borrowers whose original loans were modified. This let the banks put their interests ahead of both borrowers and those who held the first mortgages.
Unwinding the Troubled Asset Relief Program was another area where the department fell short. Eager to trumpet the success of TARP and other bailout programs, for example, Treasury boasted last spring that taxpayers would likely make money on them.
Such a claim, said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, should ''immediately discredit the teller.''
Treasury's accounting for TARP and the other programs didn't factor in the below-market rates the recipients paid on these loans. ''We did them an enormous favor,'' Mr. Baker said in an interview last week, ''at a time when liquidity commanded an incredible premium.''
Neither, critics say, was Treasury transparent about TARP or willing to provide data to Congress on the program's progress. ''Under Secretary Geithner's leadership, Treasury consistently overstated the results of its actions, painting a rosier picture than reality,'' said Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee. ''Without the special inspector general, the public wouldn't have a clear, numbers-driven point of view on TARP.''
FINALLY, there's the matter of Treasury's response to the weightiest issue of all: banks that are too large to succeed.
Back in 2010, Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, and Mr. Kaufman were co-sponsors of the Safe Banking Act, which proposed placing tough limits on banks' size. If it had passed, it would have imposed a strict 10 percent cap on any bank holding company's share of United States deposits and set a 6 percent limit on leverage.
The act was a way to begin reining in the huge institutions that had caused so much trouble in the credit debacle. It could also have protected taxpayers from having to make future rescues.
A good thing for Main Street, in other words.
But it was not to be. Among the bill's most aggressive opponents was, yes, the Treasury.
''We were disappointed,'' Mr. Brown said in an interview on Thursday. ''Not only did Treasury oppose it, but they proudly opposed it. If the Treasury had spoken out for it we could have gotten very close to winning.''
Thankfully, Mr. Brown has not given up on the idea of reducing big banks' size and threat to taxpayers. He and Senator David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican, have asked the Government Accountability Office to quantify the size of the advantages -- and implied taxpayer subsidies -- that large financial institutions enjoy over their smaller brethren. The study is expected to take about a year to complete.
''I like Tim personally,'' Mr. Brown said of Mr. Geithner. ''But he was better at putting out the fire than preventing the next one.''

HEADLINE: So, How'd He Do?

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
Ed Koch, the blunt-spoken and theatrical three-term mayor of New York City, who became a national emblem for the way New Yorkers talk and behave, often asked straphangers at subway stops to assess his record with a ''How'm I doin'?''
With his death on Friday at 88, it seemed only fitting to ask that question once more -- in retrospect.
There is no doubt that Mr. Koch restored the spirit of the city after years of urban decay that had crystallized in the city's near bankruptcy, and that reached a nadir of sorts in 1977 with the Son of Sam killings, a blackout and riots. Mr. Koch, a Democrat, took office in January 1978 and, with his moxie, was able to quickly create a sense among New Yorkers that someone was fighting to turn the city around. 
''The city needed hope, it needed a champion, it needed a voice,'' said Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban policy at New York University. ''Ed Koch became that voice.''
Even the Rev. Calvin O. Butts III, the pastor of Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, who tangled frequently with Mr. Koch over what he felt was the mayor's insensitivity to African-Americans, said Mr. Koch was the right mayor for his time.
''If you've got to have a mayor for New York City, you need a guy like Ed Koch because he's a rough-and-tumble kind of guy who speaks up and fights back,'' he said.
The Koch-era legacy is substantial. Experts cite the investment of billions of dollars in rebuilding abandoned housing, which revived desolate areas of the South Bronx, Harlem and central Brooklyn; the restoration of the city's fiscal integrity to the point where banks and government watchdogs were ready to let it manage its own finances; the rehabilitation of neglected parks; the genesis of Times Square's transformation from a sleazy, dangerous crossroads to a family-friendly entertainment and office center; the trading in of federal money designated to build a new West Side Highway for money that would buy subway trains and buses; the pressure on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to virtually eliminate subway graffiti; and the enacting of a campaign finance law in 1988 under which candidates would limit their spending in exchange for receiving public matching funds.
On the ledger's deficit side, experts say Mr. Koch needlessly antagonized African-American New Yorkers and allowed his reputation for let-the-chips-fall-where-they-may integrity to be tarnished by corruption scandals that started in the Parking Violations Bureau and raised questions about his alliances with political bosses. Together, those failures might have cost him a fourth term.
While opinions about the former mayor may vary, there is no doubt he left a notable mark in several areas.
HOUSING
To grasp the scope of Mr. Koch's accomplishment, consider the visit that President Jimmy Carter made in 1977 to the South Bronx, where he stood with Mayor Abraham D. Beame in a rubble-strewed patch of Charlotte Street against a backdrop of ghostly, gutted buildings. That characteristic landscape changed dramatically starting in 1986 with a 10-year plan by Mr. Koch that led to the spending of more than $5 billion on building low- and moderate-income housing and on rehabilitating vacant buildings. The program eventually created more than 150,000 affordable apartments, according to Ted Houghton, executive director of the Supportive Housing Network of New York. Charlotte Street itself was turned into a row of suburban-style ranch houses that a few years ago were selling for $500,000 apiece. There are few lots in the Bronx that sit empty anymore.
''When you walk through today's vibrant neighborhoods in Harlem, Bed-Stuy and the South Bronx, thank Ed Koch,'' Mr. Houghton said in an e-mail. ''If it wasn't for his 10-year housing plan, we'd still be looking at acres and acres of abandoned buildings, like one continues to see in a lot of less fortunate, older Eastern cities.''
PARKS
In the years before Mr. Koch became mayor, many of the city's signature parks had gone to seed -- partly as a result of lack of money, but also because of a poorly administered and patronage-ridden bureaucracy. Central Park had become so dangerous it was ridiculed by late-night comedians.
''In the Koch administration, the parks took on an elevated position that they hadn't really had since the Robert Mosesera,'' said Holly Leicht, executive director of New Yorkers for Parks.
Parks commissioners like Gordon J. Davis and Henry J. Sternde centralized their department, delegating more authority to officials in the boroughs and appointing new parks administrators for Central Park and Prospect Park. Those administrators ultimately cobbled together public-private partnerships that have rejuvenated both parks. The Sheep Meadow, virtually a dust bowl when Koch took office, was turned into a green carpet, and the crumbling Bethesda Fountain into an aesthetic jewel. Adrian Benepe, who was a park ranger when Mr. Koch took office and eventually became the commissioner under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, said a key moment was ''having Simon and Garfunkel do a concert in Central Park in the early '80s, because it showed that Central Park was safe and fun at night.''
CRIME
Mr. Koch's record on crime is more mixed. A few years into his tenure, crime began to recede, with murders declining to 1,386 in 1985 from 1,818 in 1980. Jeremy Travis, president of John Jay College of Criminal Justice, who was a special adviser to Mr. Koch during his third term, said gains were made by techniques like concentrating police personnel on open-air drug markets where people were brazenly lining up to buy drugs. But the unseen rise of the crack cocaine epidemic in the mid-1980s led to a resurgence, as easy profits enticed many amateurs into drug dealing and neighborhood wars broke out. The administration's response was ''heroic,'' Mr. Travis said, but hobbled by understaffing in the Police Department -- about 26,000 officers at the time -- as a result of the layoffs demanded by the 1970s fiscal crisis.
''If you dialed 911, you couldn't get a car to the scene in time,'' Mr. Travis said. ''An under-resourced department is not effective in fighting crime.''
By 1990, the year after Mr. Koch left office, murders hit a historic peak of 2,251. The situation did not begin to be reversed until the city hired 5,000 more officers late in the administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins. Another form of crime, corruption, was spawned in Mr. Koch's Parking Violations Bureau. There were no revelations suggesting that Mr. Koch personally profited, but the scandals left a stain because they indicated he was sometimes willing to make patronage appointments to sustain the backing of Democratic bosses like Meade H. Esposito, Donald R. Manes and Stanley M. Friedman.
HEALTH
Larry Kramer, the gay rights advocate who wrote the play ''The Normal Heart"about the AIDS epidemic, recently accused Mr. Koch of ignoring the disease's spread in a city with a large gay population because ''he was terrified everyone would find out he was gay and he would lose his support from the real estate industry.'' Mr. Kramer said Mr. Koch did not ''tell people to change their behavior'' and refused to meet with or finance gay activists. (Though he once responded to a questioner that he was heterosexual, Mr. Koch repeatedly said that his love life was nobody's business but his own.)
Stanley Brezenoff, the chief executive officer of Continuum Health Partners and a former deputy mayor under Mr. Koch, offered a different picture of Mr. Koch's response to the AIDS epidemic. ''It took a long time to recognize what was going on,'' Mr. Brezenoff said, ''and as we came to grips with it we became more focused on identifying concrete steps to take.'' Mr. Koch, he said, agonized over a step like closing bathhouses used for promiscuous sex because it meant having to dispatch ''investigators into bathhouses and spying on people in their most private moments.''
One health policy decision Mr. Koch came to regret was the closing -- for reasons of poor performance -- of Sydenham Hospital in Harlem. Mr. Koch said in recent years that he had not fully appreciated how important the hospital was to black doctors, who often had trouble receiving admitting privileges elsewhere.
Mr. Brezenoff, who was president of the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation from 1981 to 1982, credited Mr. Koch for spurring ''the renaissance'' of the agency, which had been in disarray, and for focusing its mission on primary care.
RACE RELATIONS
From the beginning, Mr. Koch frequently found himself at loggerheads with black ministers and politicians. The Sydenham closing stirred enormous resentment in Harlem. So did Mr. Koch's abrasive style, which led him to call antipoverty organizers who were abusing the system ''poverty pimps.'' He might also have realized that more than a few of his white supporters appreciated such tough talk.
''He was a politician and he knew what crowd he had to play to,'' Mr. Butts, pastor of Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, said.
But David R. Jones, president of the Community Service Society of New York and a former Koch adviser, pointed out that Mr. Koch assembled the most diverse team of deputies and commissioners City Hall had ever seen, includingBasil A. Paterson,Herman Badillo and Mr. Jones. Later, he appointed Benjamin Ward as the city's first black police commissioner.
Mr. Koch also suffered because of racially charged episodes that sprang up on his watch: the 1984 shooting death of a 66-year-old black woman, Eleanor Bumpurs, by a white police officer during an eviction; the 1986 beating of three black men by a white gang in Howard Beach, Queens; the shooting death of Yusuf K. Hawkins by white youths weeks before the 1989 election.
Despite his condemnation of the mob beatings, it was hard to tamp down a sense among blacks that his public rhetoric -- in the 1988 presidential campaign, for example, he said Jews would be ''crazy'' to vote for Jesse Jacksonbecause of his ''Hymietown'' slur about New York and his support for a Palestinian homeland -- may have helped foster an atmosphere in which some young whites felt emboldened to commit such assaults.
Still, Mr. Koch seemed to redeem himself in his post-mayoralty. The Rev.Al SharptonJr. became a friend, and Mr. Butts, who once said Mr. Koch was ''worse than a racist, he was an opportunist,'' said last week: ''I never got the impression that he was a racist. He had his prejudices like everybody else and he allowed his temper and his I-know-what's-best-for-everybody attitude to get in the way of sound judgment.''
TRANSIT
With its graffiti-coated subway cars and frequent breakdowns, the transit system Mr. Koch inherited had become one of the bleakest symbols of the city's tailspin. Ridership had fallen to its lowest level since 1917, even before the modern subway system had been completed, according to Gene Russianoff, staff attorney for the Straphangers Campaign.
While he had few direct powers to change matters, Mr. Koch harangued the Transportation Authority for its crackling, inaudible announcements; doubled, to $200 million, the city's contribution for rebuilding; and urged that dogs patrol the subway yards, an idea that was barely tried. While originally a proponent of the West Side Highway, Mr. Koch eventually fought for trading in the federal highway funds for $1 billion to buy new subway cars. The last graffiti-marked car was taken out of service in his last year in office.

HEADLINE: Raging (Again) Against the Robots

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL. 
An economics reporter and theater critic for The New York Times.

 BODY:
THE robots are coming! Word is they want your job, your life and probably your little dog, too.
Robots have once again gripped the nation's imagination, stoking fears of displaced jobs and perhaps even a displaced human race. An alarmist segment on ''60 Minutes'' was only the most vivid of a recent series of pieces in respected magazines and news outlets warning about widespread worker displacement. Professors at Cambridge University and a co-founder of Skype are creating a new Center for the Study of Existential Risk, which would research a ''Terminator''-like scenario in which supercomputers rise up and destroy their human overlords, presumably plotting the whole caper in zeros and ones.
In New York alone, there are four plays running this month with themes of cybernetics run amok. One is a revival of ''R.U.R.,'' a 1920 Czech play that was the granddaddy of the cybernetic revolt genre and that originated the current meaning of the word ''robot.'' 
Such android anxiety has a long history. John Maynard Keynes wrote about ''technological unemployment'' during the Great Depression. In the Industrial Revolution, disgruntled laborers -- including the original Luddites -- smashed automated looms and threshing machines that ''stole'' their jobs. In the 15th century, scribes protested the printing press, with a futile zeal rivaled perhaps only by that of modern journalists.
Even Aristotle foretold that automation would expunge the need for labor, observing that if ''the shuttle would weave and the plectrum touch the lyre without a hand to guide them, chief workmen would not want servants, nor masters slaves.''
Throughout the 20th century, science fiction writers created pop culture touchstones about technological tyranny. Among the most resonant is Kurt Vonnegut's 1952 ''Player Piano,'' about a dystopia in which mechanization has displaced the lower classes and assigned the world's wealth to engineers and managers.
You might even carbon-date this literary line to the Golem of Prague, a 16th-century Jewish legend about a clay automaton that ultimately destroyed those it was designed to protect. That story, too, recently enjoyed a revival on the New York rialto.
There is something almost Freudian in these robot takeover terrors, which foretell that the technology we fathered will rise up against us, rendering us obsolete or even extinct.
It's not exactly clear, though, what triggers these fears, which seem to come in both good economic times and bad. It might be actual accelerations in technical change. But Andreas Bauer, an official with the International Federation of Robotics and a German robotics company executive, says that such fears are unheard-of in the equally mechanized economies of contemporary Japan and Europe.
In Japan, he says, people love the anthropomorphic robots that give Americans the willies. Factories in Germany have big, splashy media junkets to announce their latest automation investments, moves their North American counterparts dare not publicly divulge.
Labor also has more protections in these other developed countries, making it harder to fire workers when more efficient manufacturing processes are developed; in fact, labor contracts in Japan have traditionally banned laying off workers displaced by automation. In the 1980s, economists credited these contract provisions with helping make Japanese manufacturing so productive, since workers had an incentive to suggest efficiency improvements.
In hindsight, historical fears of technological change look foolish, given that automation has increased living standards and rendered our workweeks both safer and shorter. In 1900, when nearly half the American labor force was employed in backbreaking agriculture, the typical worker logged 2,300 hours a year, according to Joel Mokyr, an economic historian at Northwestern University. Today that number is 1,800. (If you believe ''The Jetsons,'' by 2062 we'll be working only two hours a week; Keynes had similar forecasts.)
That said, creative destruction is undoubtedly painful. Historically, the children of displaced workers have benefited from mechanization, but the displaced workers themselves have often been permanently passÃ©.
''Every invention ever made caused some people to lose jobs,'' says Mr. Mokyr. ''In a good society, when this happens, they put you out to pasture and give you a golf club and a condo in Florida. In a bad society, they put you on the dole, so you have just enough not to starve, but that's about it.''
And many economists today believe the transition will be even more difficult this time around.
Erik Brynjolfsson, an economics professor at M.I.T. and co-author of the book ''Race Against the Machine,'' argues that we have reached a sort of inflection point in productivity growth. It took expensive capital equipment to revolutionize farming and manufacturing; the marginal cost of the technologies (software and so on) producing the most recent gains in efficiency is near zero. Any job that can be reduced to an algorithm will be, leading to the displacement of workers in industries as diverse as retail and radiology.
That's not to say there will be no new jobs to fill the void: we can scarcely imagine the industries and occupations that will flower as the economy adjusts, just as prior deep thinkers could not have conceived of today's nanophysicists or social media consultants. The challenge, of course, is training or retraining workers quickly enough to take on new, higher-skilled roles.
An optimist like Mr. Mokyr might note that the economy is actually becoming unusually good at scaling up retraining programs just as we need them most. The technological shocks that have affected manufacturing and office administration, after all, are now infiltrating education: with online courses, an expert can teach 60,000 students at a time rather than the 60 Mr. Mokyr lectured on Tuesday.
Mr. Mokyr is not too worried about what this will mean for his own livelihood, despite the mass layoffs that similar cybernetic developments have wrought over every other industry he has studied.
''I can be displaced by technology, but they still can't fire me,'' he says. ''I have tenure.''

HEADLINE: Data Protection Laws, an Ocean Apart

BYLINE: By NATASHA SINGER

 BODY:
OVER the years, the United States and Europe have taken different approaches toward protecting people's personal information. Now the two sides are struggling to bridge that divide.
On this side of the Atlantic, Congress has enacted a patchwork quilt of privacy laws that separately limit the use of Americans' medical records, credit reports, video rental records and so on. On the other side, the European Union has instituted more of a blanket regulatory system; it has a common directive that gives its citizens certain fundamental rights -- like the right to obtain copies of records held about them by companies and institutions -- that Americans now lack.
Even so, United States officials maintain that the divergent approaches are equal. ''The sum of the parts of U.S. privacy protection is equal to or greater than the single whole of Europe,'' says Cameron F. Kerry, general counsel of the Commerce Department. He is overseeing an agency effort to help develop voluntary, enforceable codes of conduct for industry groups, like app developers, whose collection and use of consumer data are now unregulated.
Europe begs to differ. 
''Yes, we share the basic idea of privacy,'' says Peter Hustinx, Europe's data protection supervisor. ''But there is a huge deficit on the U.S. side.''
Alas, the data-control divide appears to be widening.
A year ago, the European Commission proposed comprehensive reforms to strengthen online privacy rights -- changes that could have big repercussions for American technology companies and marketers that operate in the European Union. American officials, trade groups and tech executives have responded by taking frequent treks to Brussels and other cities, where they have urged regulators and legislators to reconsider the one-regulation-fits-all-data approach. What's at stake, American industry representatives say, is nothing less than a free and commerce-friendly Internet.
''The ecosystem of the Internet is very delicate,'' says Kevin Richards, senior vice president of federal government affairs at TechAmerica, a trade group that represents companies like Google and Microsoft. ''It's not wise to have an overly broad, prescriptive, one-size-fits-all approach that would hinder or undermine the ability of companies to innovate in a global economy.''
European Union members already have data protection laws in place, based on a directive from 1995 that laid out principles for the collection of personal information. The proposed new rules would strengthen some existing provisions. They would standardize data protections across the 27 member states. They would also provide some new rights, such as ''data portability'' -- the right of consumers to easily transfer their text files, photographs and videos from one social network, or e-mail or cloud storage service, to another. And they would subject companies that violate the rules to penalties of up to 2 percent of their annual global revenue.
Asked for comment, Viviane Reding, the vice president of the European Commission and the architect of the proposed regulation, said in a statement: ''The main problem is that our rules predate the digital age and it became increasingly clear in recent years that they needed an update.'' She continued: ''That is why I have proposed a root-and-branch reform of the E.U.'s data protection rules -- currently under discussion in the European Parliament and the Council of the E.U. -- that will both protect citizens' rights and facilitate business in the digital age.''
BUT some provisions seem too rigid to United States officials and trade groups. They argue that the American approach -- sector-specific privacy laws, in addition to industry self-regulation and enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission -- is more nimble.
''We hope that Europe will move in the direction of those multistakeholder standards, and not standards which are not flexible and don't move at Internet speed,'' says Mr. Kerry, who has taken at least four trips to European cities in the last year to discuss these issues.
From the perspective of some European legislators, however, United States representatives seem more interested in protecting commerce than consumers. The full-court American effort may have backfired, they say, pushing some European officials toward even broader measures. Last month, Jan Philipp Albrecht, a representative of the European Parliament who reviewed the draft regulation, proposed additional rights for citizens -- like the right not to be subject to consumer profiling.
''My impression is that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Commerce Department are mostly just following the interests of Silicon Valley,'' he says. ''This leads to heavy pressure on the European regulator, I can say.''
But Mr. Kerry says the United States must make its views known if the systems are to work in concert.
''I know that some people have raised eyebrows at our involvement; I make no apologies,'' Mr. Kerry says. ''We in the United States and countries and businesses around the world are stakeholders in this process. This has an important impact on the global economy.''
The solution to this trans-Atlantic clash may simply be American ingenuity.
Last year, President Barack Obama proposed a ''Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights'' that would give Americans many of the same baseline protections that the draft European rule proposes to reinforce. These include the right of access to records that companies hold about them, the right to correct those records and the right to have limits on the personal data that companies collect and keep. Administration officials said they would work with Congress on legislation based on those rights and to extend oversight to industries not currently covered by federal privacy laws.
A coalition of more than a dozen American advocacy groups said it would send a letter on Monday to senior Obama administration officials, seeking a meeting to ensure that American policy makers' efforts in Europe ''are not averse to the views expressed by the president.'' The coalition includes the Electronic Privacy Information Center and the Center for Digital Democracy.
''Does the Obama administration really want to be on the opposite side of the European effort to upgrade and modernize its privacy law which is at its core about the protection of a fundamental freedom?'' asks Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center.
European officials hold out hope that Congress will enact baseline consumer privacy protections for Americans.
''This development -- which is much welcomed in Europe -- shows that we have much in common,'' Ms. Reding of the European Commission said in her statement, speaking of the privacy bill of rights. ''Convergence is springing up and synergies are possible.''

HEADLINE: Q. and A. With Viviane Reding

 BODY:
Viviane Reding, the vice president of the European Commission and the justice commissioner of the European Union, was asked to comment on trans-Atlantic data protection issues for the Slipstream column by Natasha Singer in the Sunday Business section. The following is Vice President Reding's full statement, sent on Jan. 31, 2013.
Q. Why do Europeans feel so strongly about privacy and data rights? Why was it important for you to make data protection one of your signature issues?
A. Data protection legislation has a long history in Europe: the European Union has had common rules to protect personal data since 1995. Personal data protection is a fundamental right for all Europeans -- this is inscribed in the E.U.'s Charter of Fundamental Rights. 
The principles on which our laws are found are still valid. The main problem is that our rules predate the digital age and it became increasingly clear in recent years that they needed an update. Seventy-two percent of Europeans have told us in surveys that they are concerned about how companies use their personal data. They are especially worried about online privacy and this is one of the most frequent reasons why people don't buy goods and services online.
People's trust in using digital services depends on whether they know that their data will be safely protected. We have a single trade area in Europe -- the Single Market with 500 million potential customers -- and we need strong, clear and uniform data protection rules for Europe's digital single market. That is why I have proposed a root and branch reform of the E.U.'s data protection rules -- currently under discussion in the European Parliament and the Council of the E.U. -- that will both protect citizens' rights and facilitate business in the digital age.
Until recently, there was a common belief that the E.U. and U.S. have different approaches on privacy and that it would be difficult to work together. This can no longer be argued in such simple terms. In March 2011, the White House announced that it is working with Congress to produce ''a privacy bill of rights.'' This development -- which is much welcomed in Europe -- shows that we have much in common. Convergence is springing up and synergies are possible.
Strong laws on both sides of the Atlantic would be good for trans-Atlantic cooperation. I hope my proposal will be the E.U. foundation of a data bridge that will link the U.S. and Europe. It's better to have steady footing on a bridge than to worry about the tide in a harbor.
Q. What is your view about the differences in data protection offered by the proposed European data protection regulation and by the U.S. sectoral/self-regulatory system?
A. The self-regulatory approach may have its benefits but it also has its limits. U.S. lawmakers are increasingly realizing this. There have been several attempts in the U.S. to develop a regulatory approach. Most recently, Senators Kerry and McCain proposed a bipartisan legislative initiative, and last year the White House announced baseline consumer privacy legislation. There have also been repeated calls from U.S. consumer associations and the Federal Trade Commission in favor of such legislation. I will pay close attention to the debate across the Atlantic and look forward to seeing what the fruits of these initiatives will be.
I believe that not everything can be left to the good will of industry. The interests of industry and consumers may be quite different. Online giants collect personal information about us for their business purposes while we are becoming more and more concerned about the use of this data. The issue of confidence and trust in online services is not only a concern in Europe: a new U.S. survey has just shown that nearly half (45 percent) of U.S. citizens feel that they have little or no control over the personal information companies gather while they are browsing the Web or using online services such as photo sharing, travel or gaming. Twenty-one percent of citizens have even stopped using these online services because of data protection concerns. I believe that policy makers need to provide a solution. It is important both for consumers and businesses.
Adopting legislation in this area does not mean that businesses will not be able to come up with their own self-regulatory initiatives. For instance, our proposed law foresees voluntary codes of conduct. The main difference with the U.S. system is that in Europe, such codes of conduct have a strong backbone -- they must be in line with our data protection legislation. This anchor in law is essential for the codes to be effective and inspire trust.
Q. What is your view of the American efforts to influence the proposed European data protection regulation and directive? Once the regulation is enacted, what impact do you think it will have on data protections in countries outside of the European Union?
A. Online privacy and personal data protection are global challenges and we are not the only ones grappling with these issues. We have had a high level of interest from across the Atlantic, but I would add that many other countries and regions are also following closely what we are doing on data protection in Europe. Europe is the largest economy in the world and we have close trading relationships with other parts of the world.
But let me be clear: we are first and foremost making rules for European citizens and European businesses. This is my mandate as Europe's justice commissioner. This does not mean Europe's data protection rules will not have an impact elsewhere. Indeed, the proposed E.U. data protection law will be a real market-opener for companies outside Europe which want to do business on our single market. It will cut costs and increase legal certainty by replacing the current patchwork of laws in Europe with a single uniform set of rules for all 27 European Union countries. By the way, a similar issue exists in the U.S. Take the definition of ''personal information.'' In Florida, not a single law defines the term, but in Arizona there are five such laws. I believe a single rule is better for business.
And we are cutting red tape by introducing a one-stop shop for businesses to deal with regulators. In the future, companies will only have to deal with the data protection authorities in the E.U. country in which they are based: one interlocutor, not 27. We have calculated that the revamped rules can save companies up to $3 billion per year because they will not need to familiarize themselves and comply with 27 different national laws if they want to do business in Europe.
Another important issue that our proposed rules address and which matters for countries outside Europe is the issue of international data transfers. The new E.U. data protection rules will improve the current system of binding corporate rules to make these types of exchanges less burdensome and more secure. And under the new legislation the adequacy procedure will better specify the criteria and requirements for assessing the level of data protection in a third country or an international organization. Rules which recognize the adequacy of data protection standards make life easier for businesses by providing legal certainty in their international operations. There are benefits for the economy and trade.

HEADLINE: Brothers, Romans, Filmmakers

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

 BODY:
Nearly 40 years ago the brothers Paolo and Vittorio Taviani wrote and directed ''Allonsanfan,'' starring Marcello Mastroianni as a revolutionary in the Napoleonic era. After its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival Mr. Mastroianni met with reporters, and when they asked him about the unusual experience of working with two directors on the same film, he feigned surprise. ''Were they two?'' he asked.
The Tavianis are now in their 80s, but at an age when most of their contemporaries have retired they continue making films, and in seamless unity. Their latest effort, ''Caesar Must Die,'' which opens on Wednesday, is one of their most artistically ambitious productions: a fictional feature with elements of a documentary and the theater, about the staging of Shakespeare's ''Julius Caesar'' in a maximum-security prison in Rome. 
''What kind of film is this?'' Vittorio Taviani, 83, asked rhetorically during an interview last fall, when ''Caesar Must Die'' was shown at the New York Film Festival. ''It's a true film, a fiction film in which the reality of the prison is physically palpable.'' Paolo Taviani, 81, completed the thought: ''The energy of this film is born of pain, you see the walls and the bars before you, the authentic pain of the people living inside the prison.''
The Tavianis, who have written or directed 22 films together, are not the only pair of siblings making films together of course. In Europe there are also the Dardenne brothers of Belgium, while the United States has the Coens, the Wachowskis, the Farrellys and the Hugheses. But the Tavianis have been doing it longer than anyone else -- since 1954 -- and have developed a working method that minimizes friction by alternating the direction of individual scenes.
''The crew that knows us asks, 'Who's the first today?' '' Paolo explained. ''And while that person is at the helm the crew has to answer only to the director in charge at that moment. They can't go ask Paolo something they want to do. When it's finished, I come and look at the video.''
Vittorio continued: ''The other is at the monitor, watching the video. We have a very acute nonverbal, telepathic communication. If the one at the monitor starts to scratch his head, the other understands. So we have a silent meeting, we correct it, and then we go off again.''
Writing scripts works in much the same fashion. They live within walking distance of each other in Rome, so they will often meet at a park and discuss whatever their current project happens to be while walking their dogs together and then go to one or the other's house and get down to work, seated across from each other at a table.
For ''Caesar Must Die'' the brothers brought in a collaborator, Fabio Cavalli, to help distill and shape the Shakespearean text into a screenplay. In a bit of meta playfulness Mr. Cavalli, who directs a theater troupe at Rebibbia prison in Rome, was cast as the director of the play within the movie.
''The themes of guilt and friendship, betrayal and conspiracy are at the center of Shakespeare's play, and also at the center of the life experience of the actors,'' many of whom are serving terms for Mafia- or Camorra-related crimes, Mr. Cavalli said. ''So many actors and directors had come to Rebibbia,'' he continued, but until the Tavianis came along, ''nobody understood that here was an opportunity to make a movie about this extraordinary environment so full of art, the hope of freedom, and consciousness.''
''Caesar Must Die'' was born when a journalist friend of the Tavianis urged them to visit a performance by the Rebibbia troupe. They were reluctant at first. ''We thought, oh, it's going to be the same old thing,'' Paolo said. But once they saw the prisoners performing Dante and Pirandello, they changed their minds.
''We immediately had this sense that this was a great idea come down to us from the heavens,'' Vittorio said. ''These compatriots of ours are tragic figures, really. They know crime and conspiracy, so let's let them tell the tragedy of Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, which is an Italian story, a Roman story that's part of the collective imagination of the Italian people.''
The Tavianis have a long history of adapting works from the Western literary canon. Since releasing the semi-autobiographical ''The Night of the Shooting Stars,'' an international hit 30 years ago, they have twice made films drawing from Pirandello (''Kaos'' and ''You Laugh'') and Tolstoy (''Night Sun'' and ''Resurrection'') and also adapted Goethe's ''Elective Affinities'' for the screen. In addition they made a mini-series for Italian television, ''Luisa Sanfelice,'' based on a novel by Alexandre Dumas.
''They are very literary sort of intellectuals, but not university-type intellectuals,'' said Peter Bondanella, an emeritus professor at Indiana University and author of ''Italian Cinema: From Neorealism to the Present.'' ''They have this background that was typical of their time, but isn't so common these days. They come not from film school but from a more intellectual direction, and I think that is because of their politics, that they saw film as a way of changing people's minds.''
In several other respects, though, ''Caesar Must Die'' represents a conscious circling back by the Tavianis to their origins. ''At a certain moment we said to ourselves, 'Wouldn't it make more sense to shoot with the same daring with which we shot our very first films?' '' Paolo recalled. ''This is also because we shot the film in 21 days, with very little money, just like when we were very young. So from the economic point of view we were returning to our earliest state.''
''It was exciting,'' he continued. ''There was no time or need to reflect on anything, this or that, to the producer. We were free. This really helped the film. No stars, and we shot digitally. It's the first time we shot in digital, so that was a novelty for us.''
Early in ''Caesar Must Die'' there is a scene in which prisoners are auditioning for the play, and as they perform the camera moves in tight on their faces, which are full of expression and character. That fondness for magnifying the features of ordinary faces has long been a trademark of the Tavianis, who were inspired by Italian Neo-Realist films like Roberto Rossellini's ''Paisan.''
Carmelo Cantone, Rebibbia's warden, said he had favored allowing the Tavianis to shoot there because he hoped their film would show how ''living in this kind of space affects the prisoners.'' Mr. Cantone, who is a bit of a cinephile, watched some of the scenes being filmed but said he was nevertheless startled when he saw the images on a screen.
''When Wim Wenders made his film about the last days of Nicholas Ray, he said that 'through the camera lens I see things I could never see with my naked eye,' '' Mr. Cantone recalled during a telephone interview from Italy. ''Well, it was through the lens of the Tavianis that I came to understand the prisoners and what is going on around me. This is cinema of great pictorial value, a cinema of portraiture done in painterly style.''
Of the many Taviani films the one that shares the closest kinship to ''Caesar Must Die,'' they said, is ''Padre Padrone,'' a compelling tale of an illiterate Sardinian shepherd boy who transforms himself into a professor of linguistics, which won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 1977. Both films mix professional and nonprofessional actors, use documentary techniques and share a similar sensibility, the brothers explained.
Encouraged by the critical and commercial success of ''Caesar Must Die,'' which won the top prize at the Berlin Film Festival last year, the Tavianis plan to begin work on another film as soon as possible. ''When our sense of amazement is exhausted, when we don't feel those strong emotions anymore, then and only then will we stop,'' Paolo said.
His brother concurred, adding: ''We're sure that another one will come along, just as we're sure about death. I'm saying that in a beautiful realistic sense, considering our age.''

HEADLINE: Washington or D.C.?

BYLINE: By LATOYA PETERSON. 
Latoya Peterson is the editor of the blog Racialicious.com.

 BODY:
Washington, D.C., is a city of divides. There are racial divides, most notably a black D.C. and a white D.C. There are ethnic enclaves, with a Salvadoran D.C. sharing space with the Ethiopian D.C. There are the geographic boundaries that came to represent economic boundaries, like "east of the river" and "west of the park," or the image divides between the tony Northwest section of the city and the formerly gritty Southeastern quadrant.
But to me, the most telling divide is a verbal one - does one live in D.C. or Washington? 
Calling the city "Washington" reveals a certain experience. There are thousands of people who live and work in Washington - people with high-powered jobs, the transient class, the chattering class, the politicos, the folks who watch (or are guests on) "Meet the Press." They rotate in and out of the White House or spend years bouncing through various continents before settling into an N.G.O. or nonprofit. Often, these are the people who refer to the city as a revolving door. Many have told me they've never met anyone "from here" before. (See aforementioned racial divide.)
Seemingly a world away are the lifelong residents, the multigenerational city dwellers, the folks who staff federal offices. This is D.C.: the city and surrounding suburbs are the site of the nation's most visible and vocal black middle class. In D.C., people listen to go-go and jazz and look for long-term stability in a government job that will not change with administrations. This D.C. is where I grew up.
These two cities exist in the same space, but often hold completely different lives.
In some ways, the boundaries can feel stark and unyielding. I remember trying to meet up with a new friend of mine, an editor I'd worked with once or twice, somewhere near the U Street Corridor. As often as we both hung out around U Street, that should have been a simple task. Yet as we volleyed the names of different bars and lounges, it was almost as if we were describing two different places. She wasn't familiar with my regular hangouts: Jin lounge, Lounge of Three. I hadn't heard a thing about hers; since when was there a cowboy bar on U Street? We finally decided to go to one of her favorites, a low-key spot called Axis Bar (which no longer exists in a rapidly changing city). I was stunned to see it was next door to Tabaq, one of my haunts. We'd been partying next door to each other, and yet our worlds had stubbornly refused to overlap.
Other times, the boundaries are more porous. Close to a decade ago, Columbia Heights, a neighborhood in the north of the city where I now live, boasted not much more than houses, some small, run-down local businesses, and a large field that announced it was the impending site of a new Target. Strolling around the streets revealed the scars left from the riots in the late 1960s and the crack-fueled chaos of the 1980s and '90s. But the complicated mix of Spanish, English and Amharic and the friendly corner stores also revealed the camaraderie of a small neighborhood. One day, my then-boyfriend and I were cruising around the area and were shocked to see an outcropping of young white people at an outdoor restaurant, a strange oasis in a mostly black and brown neighborhood. Their presence was jarring, not simply because of the racial dynamics but because it foretold a more dramatic shift to come.
Now that change has come to pass. Washington has crept into much of D.C. Last summer, I brought my dog out to play with our neighbors' dog. My little mutt bounced around with their little purebred and we looked out at the bars and restaurants of the new Columbia Heights, filling with people out for a good time. We talked about the petty annoyances the newcomers brought, the peeing on the streets, the drunken screaming, the smashed CÃ®roc bottles. Our neighborhood was changing, we agreed, for better or for worse. The outsiders we spoke of were white. But so were my neighbors. The boundaries had shifted yet again.
What does it mean to have these conflicting, overlapping, imagined dividing lines? Is there an us and them? How can a city change every four to eight years, yet still remain fundamentally the same? Time washes over the old boundaries and creates new ones. Fresh alliances are forged.
All I can do is smile every time I pass Sunshine, the first Ethiopian-Tex Mex fusion restaurant I've ever seen. Yet there is also a sadness in that smile - lately the Ethiopian community has been expanding around 9th Street and down Georgia Avenue toward the suburbs of Silver Spring, in pursuit of more reasonable rent and a better quality of life.
â[#x20ac]ªMy block today looks completely different from the way it did when I moved in just a few years ago. Italian wine bars and trendy street food arrived, bringing a diversity-lite mix of patrons. Washington is taking over, yet vestiges of D.C. remain. Grown men still jump the fence of the local elementary school to play soccer on sunny days, women still sell sliced fruit by the road and children still play in the public fountain, which continues to be more of a neighborhood gathering place than any of the five coffee shops that vie for that position.â[#x20ac]¬
Is this place Washington or D.C.? The question reveals the indelible truth: which city you live in depends on who you are.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Plenty of Money In State Coffers, But Not to Spend

BYLINE: By ROSS RAMSEY. 
rramsey@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Ross Ramsey, the executive editor at The Texas Tribune, writes a column for The Tribune.
Two years ago, Texas lawmakers didn't have enough money to spend. Now, it seems, they can't spend all the money they have.
Back in 2011, they were forced to cut programs and services -- in part by their own promises not to raise taxes and fees. 
Now they're fenced in by self-imposed spending caps, the need to fill some of the gaps in the current budget, and a school finance lawsuit that could require a multibillion-dollar remedy this year.
The lead budget writers two years ago said the money wasn't available for everything the state was already doing. They didn't expect the state to bring in enough to keep existing programs and services, and they wrote a budget that fit those expectations.
Those leaders now -- Representative Jim Pitts, Republican of Waxahachie, and Senator Tommy Williams, Republican of The Woodlands -- say they have enough money to make some repairs to the current budget, and to take care of some long-ignored infrastructure needs as well. They want to hold money back as insurance against the school lawsuits. And they are bound by law to keep their spending within a legal growth limit that takes into account current spending and a multiplier for the state's economic growth.
They're allowed to break that law, but only by coaxing a majority of those tightfisted conservatives elected by voters who told them to shrink government.
The list of important programs and services begging for dollars -- in 2011 and now -- is about the same: education, health care, transportation and water, to name a few.
Last time, the solution was to play some accounting tricks and ignore certain expenses. A monthly payment from the state's education endowment to public schools was moved from the last day of the current budget to the first day of the next -- the equivalent of ducking your landlord until your next paycheck puts enough money in the checking account to cover your rent.
Legislators decided to delete five months of Medicaid expenses from the back of the budget in the hope that the money to cover those costs would arrive before the bills did.
Two years later, the comptroller said the state had $8.8 billion left, unspent, in its current accounts. Lawmakers will need most of it to fill that Medicaid hole and for other expenses that have surfaced since the budget was written.
The comptroller said the state would have almost $12 billion available in its Rainy Day Fund during the next budget period. State leaders have informally but firmly agreed not to use that for continuing expenses. And it takes a two-thirds vote from legislators to go into that account. Neither Mr. Pitts nor Mr. Williams, who spoke last week at a forum held by The Texas Tribune, was willing to say whether they would have the votes to do that, whether for infrastructure, tax cuts or something else.
There is even an esoteric argument over which kind of spending is limited by the legal cap; Mr. Williams and Mr. Pitts maintain that it doesn't apply to money from the Rainy Day Fund. That might give them a little leeway, but not as much as some might want.
''We're going to run out of room under the spending cap before we run out of money,'' Mr. Williams said.
Then there are the courts to consider. Mr. Pitts and Mr. Williams would like to hold back some money -- $2 billion or so -- in anticipation of the school finance lawsuits. Both said the Legislature would not have cut education financing two years ago if it had known the money would be available, as it turned out. But Mr. Pitts said last week that he doesn't think public schools are underfinanced -- and why would he, in the middle of a court fight?
The budget writers and other state leaders expect an expensive loss in the school suits. They will hold back on spending until some future session to consider those results. ''I'm looking for an epic battle in 2014 on school finance,'' Mr. Williams said.
That puts an odd spin on the budget being written now, at a time when the state's economy is pretty good. To those seeking support for particular programs or services, things haven't changed.
The money is not there when the state's fortunes are bad, and it is not there when the state's fortunes are good.

HEADLINE: We Can Be Healthy And Rich

BYLINE: By EZEKIEL J. EMANUEL. 
An oncologist, a former White House adviser, a vice provost at the University of Pennsylvania and a contributing opinion writer.

 BODY:
Just about everyone agrees that health care in America is too expensive, and that something must be done to control the rising costs. Except for one group: hospitals and the unions representing hospital workers.
They believe that controlling health care costs will hurt the economy and increase unemployment. They point out that hospitals are among the largest employers in many communities and that, unlike other employers, they are adding jobs at a good clip.
But the truth is that bending the health care cost curve will actually spur the economy forward. According to the Council of Economic Advisers, reducing health care cost increases by just 1 percentage point every year would lead to a 4 percent increase in G.D.P. by 2030. In today's dollars, that would mean an extra $600 billion for our economy and an extra $7,000 for the average family. 
In some ways, it's easy to sympathize with the hospitals' worries: their concern is that competition in the new insurance exchanges and other changes catalyzed by the Affordable Care Act will result in lower premiums. To stay profitable, insurance companies will have to pressure hospitals to reduce their rates. And since 60 percent of an average hospital's costs are labor, employees will be laid off and wages cut. At a time when hospital support jobs pay about 10 percent more and typically come with more generous benefits than comparable jobs in other industries, it's understandable that health care employees are resistant.
But this line of reasoning is misguided. First, cost control is not the same thing as cost reduction. The financial goal of reforms like reducing hospital readmissions and hospital-acquired infections and encouraging competition among insurance companies is to stem the rate of growth in health care spending. We spent about $2.8 trillion on health care last year, and the system wastes approximately $700 billion annually, but no one is proposing that these expenditures decline to even $2.6 trillion. Cost control is simply about staving off the date when health care spending exceeds $4 trillion.
In addition, even if hospitals had to restructure their operations to deliver care more efficiently, it wouldn't necessarily mean fewer health care workers over all - any decline in hospital jobs would probably mean an increase in other health-related jobs like home health aides.
Where the opponents of cost control really go wrong is on the macroeconomics. Layoffs in the health care industry would increase unemployment and lower wages, they argue, thereby reducing consumer spending and hurting the economy. But both liberal and conservative economists agree that ever rising health care spending is a huge drag on the economy. As one of the Heritage Foundation's fellows wrote: "If Americans could attain the current level of health for a lower total cost, the resources saved could be used for some other beneficial purpose, and U.S. economic well-being would undoubtedly improve."
There is a good parallel in the agriculture industry. The introduction of tractors with internal combustion engines in the early 20th century caused unemployment among farmworkers, but it also increased productivity and made food cheaper. In 1920, about 40 percent of an American family's income went to purchasing food. Today the average family spends approximately 10 percent of its income on food, which means more disposable income to spend on other rewarding items - education, appliances, smartphones, computers - and more jobs in these industries.
Health care will follow a related path. Savings won't just disappear. They'll go into other purchases, often ones that are more valuable, like higher education or rapid transit, creating construction jobs while making our commutes easier. Small businesses, if they don't have to cover ever increasing insurance costs, could instead pay higher wages and hire more workers. The estimated reduction in health care premiums because of the Affordable Care Act will mean that in 2019 average families will pay about $2,000 less than they would have without cost control, freeing up money for purchases or retirement.
Some people may argue that they would take a lower G.D.P. and slower growth if it meant that we were healthier. But this, too, is wrong. There is no link between how much we spend and how healthy we are. Many other countries, including Australia, France and Germany, spend less but perform better on many health care measures. It's true even for different regions in the United States: there is no link between higher spending and better health.
It's clear that, far from creating unemployment and hurting the economy, the more we can control health care costs, the more Americans will prosper. Ultimately, however, this debate should be irrelevant. Health care is about keeping people healthy or fixing them up when they get sick. It is not a jobs program.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

OUTSIDE SHOTBig Dreams, Hard Times, and One County's Quest for Basketball Greatness
By Keith O'BrienIllustrated. 309 pp. St. Martin's Press. $25.99.
The marvel of Keith O'Brien's first book -- a chronicle of a high school basketball season in Kentucky -- is that the basketball scenes are not especially strong, occasionally sinking into clunkiness, and it doesn't matter one bit. Like a jump shooter with shaky form who still finds a way to dominate, O'Brien weaves such rich detail into his narrative that one feels petty for even bringing this up.
So forgive ''Outside Shot'' its minor flaws and its junior varsity title, and celebrate it for what it is: a reporting tour de force and an utterly gripping account of the Scott County High Cardinals, who hail from the hill country north of Lexington, home of the fabled University of Kentucky Wildcats, and are renowned in their own right, winning two state titles over the last 14 years. It is a legacy that imposes immense expectations on the Cardinals coach, Billy Hicks, and his kids, a tension that is sustained throughout the book: the Scott County players are at once admired and burdened by a community that derives way too much of its identity and esteem from the fortunes of a bunch of boys in shorts. 
O'Brien, a former Boston Globe reporter, spent almost a year in Scott County researching the story, the latest entry in the growing season-with-a-team genre most famously mined by Buzz Bissinger (''Friday Night Lights''), Madeleine Blais (''In These Girls, Hope Is a Muscle'') and Michael Lewis (''The Blind Side''). Not unlike his forerunners, O'Brien finds his best material in the individual stories, in this instance of Hicks and four of his seniors, as well as in some finely examined detours: the successful wooing of Toyota to the county (bringing an automotive plant and badly needed jobs); the horticultural roots of bluegrass; the county's fight to stay dry; the rise of Kentucky's Tea Party; the perils of premature acclaim (Dakotah Euton, Scott County's 6-8 center, once heralded as one of the best prep players in the state, was recruited by Kentucky, only to be un-recruited and vilified for not being as good as he was built up to be); and the twin scourges of poverty and crack cocaine, the demon that robbed Chad Jackson, a gifted 6-4 Cardinals forward, of his father, who was just 39.
All of this comes to us in a prose style that is fresh and even lyrical. O'Brien writes of a Scott County senior ''with fists the size of coffee cans.'' Hicks's hometown is described as having ''just one road into Ages, one road out and one reason primarily for being there: thick, black seams of rich American coal.'' O'Brien's keen reportorial eye yields so many nuggets a reader may wonder if he didn't actually spend 10 years in the county, not just one. We learn that Dakotah Euton was baptized in the Ohio River, and that Dr Pepper was the preferred beverage of the University of Kentucky coach Billy Clyde Gillispie, lauded briefly as a savior before being run out of Lexington for losing too much. We learn, too, that when the local economy soured, a war veteran put his prosthetic leg up for sale in Dan's Discount Jewelry and Pawn Shop.
Curiously, O'Brien devotes almost no attention to Adolph Rupp, the legendary and controversial Kentucky coach, though he delves into the construction of the arena that bears Rupp's name. O'Brien might also have dug deeper into how it came to be that three top players transferred into Scott County in their sophomore year. In the end, though, ''Outside Shot'' unmistakably triumphs, with the reader rooting hard for the Cardinals -- and delighted that O'Brien has brought his considerable skills to telling their story.

THE DAWN OF INNOVATIONThe First American Industrial Revolution
By Charles R. MorrisIllustrated. 368 pp. PublicAffairs. $28.99.
In 1886, according to Charles R. Morris in ''The Dawn of Innovation: The First American Industrial Revolution,'' ''Bloomingdale's catalog -- 160 pages, stuffed with some 1,700 products, from ladies' corsets to pistols -- advised its clients to send a follow-up inquiry if they had not received an order confirmation within 10 days after they had posted it, but to allow 15 days if they lived on the Pacific Coast.'' The variety of goods offered by Bloomingdale's and also the ease of ordering and transporting them were results of a century of rapid development of the country's factories, canals, railroads and telegraph lines. 
To the often-told story of America's initial industrial development, Morris, the author of ''The Trillion Dollar Meltdown'' and ''The Tycoons,'' adds fresh data and insightful revisions. He begins ''The Dawn of Innovation'' with a fascinating account of how the rivalry of the early United States and Britain to dominate the Great Lakes produced a ''shipbuilders' war'' that helped trigger industrial development here. While generations of historians have pointed to how military production techniques inspired civilian innovations before the Civil War, Morris argues that mass production in manufacturing industries from clocks to furniture began earlier and was more crucial than is often thought.
Because the goal of American economic development in the 19th century was to catch up with Britain, Morris devotes an early chapter to industrial Britain as the first ''hyperpower'' from which Americans acquired advanced technology, sometimes by theft. And America did more than play catch-up. ''In 1800, the output of American factories and mines was only a sixth that of Great Britain; by 1860, it was a third, and by 1880, two-thirds,'' he writes. ''In 1860, Great Britain accounted for about 20 percent of world industrial output and the United States only about 7 percent; by 1913, the American share was 32 percent, while Great Britain's had slid to 14 percent.''
Of the late-19th-century tycoons like Carnegie and Rockefeller, Morris argues that their role was palpable but limited. ''If they had never lived, the course of American industrialization would certainly have been different,'' he concedes, ''but the long American boom would have happened anyway and on roughly the same scale. The country was just too productive, too entrepreneurial, too inventive, too original not to burst into the front rank of world powers, almost regardless of its leadership.'' While he tells the stories of those entrepreneurs, throughout ''The Dawn of Innovation'' he emphasizes the role of the government in providing not only public goods but public procurement to spur economic development.
Morris neglects the role of import substitution policies, which allowed 19th-century American producers to exploit economies of scale in the domestic market at the expense of foreign competitors, who were walled out by tariffs. But he is persuasive in arguing that America grew so rich so rapidly in part because it was largely born free. In contrast to precursors like Britain and emulators like modern China, the United States outside of the slave South lacked a backward and unfree agrarian sector that could retard modernization. Perhaps America's ''greatest advantage,'' Morris writes, ''was that it was born as a middle-class country, settled primarily by people looking to better their lives and achieve economic independence, delighted to be freed from the encrusted ways of the countries and fellow citizens they had left behind.''

HEADLINE: The World Is Their Workplace

BYLINE: By CECILIA CAPUZZI SIMON

 BODY:
IT'S the kind of job a business major might dream about: marketing executive for a Fortune 500 medical supplies company.
After a year of stateside training, Andrew Gamertsfelder, 23, will head for São Paulo, Brazil, in June to cover South America for Stryker Orthopaedics -- a position, he says, that perfectly fits his academic training and the international work experience that came with it.
Mr. Gamertsfelder, who graduated from the University of Pittsburgh last spring, was one of the first students to take part in Pittsburgh's International Internship Program. He took four weeks of prep, including a course in Portuguese, followed by a 10-week full-time internship in the marketing department of Dow Chemical in São Paulo. That internship led to another at the United States Embassy in Brazil that he arranged independently. And that led to the job at Stryker.
Mr. Gamertsfelder's success is exactly what J. P. Matychak, director of career services for the business school, was hoping for when he began the program three years ago. He saw that employers placed a premium on international experience, but the study-abroad students he counseled were unable to articulate how their programs prepared them for global work. 
And so he upended the traditional study-abroad experience, as many colleges have done. He made work the focus of the summer program, which this year is open to the School of Arts and Sciences. ''We put internships at the foundation and academics on the perimeter,'' he says.
Such a focus might make a liberal arts dean shudder, but these are different times. International internships are growing. In 2000-1, 7,000 students traveled abroad for work and college credit. In 2010-11, the number was 16,400, with another 8,700 working without credit, according to the Institute of International Education.
Students want to study abroad (a record 274,000 did so for credit last year), but they also know that in a soft job market and increasingly global economy, they need an international work record and the connections that can bring. Study abroad may no longer be enough to make them stand out, nor does it shed light on a country's business culture. Work-study abroad does double duty.
It would be hard to find a college today that does not have some version of a for-credit international internship, or the means to find one. Boston University has been at it since 1984, its offerings booming in the past decade. Of the 2,550 B.U. students who studied abroad last year, 66 percent took part in an internship in one of 27 countries. Syracuse University's destinations include Dubai, Beijing and Hong Kong. The University of Pennsylvania has a partnership in Botswana and India among other countries. Workplaces range from multinational corporations (Pricewaterhouse Coopers) to government (British Parliament) to scientific laboratories (European Organization for Nuclear Research) to not-for-profit groups (International Organization for Migration).
International work-study is most common in business schools. Jonathan Doh, an associate professor of business at Villanova and director of the Center for Global Leadership, tells students to start early and intern often -- at home or abroad. Promising freshmen are invited to take part in the Global Citizens Program, which includes a yearlong course geared toward understanding business practices in either London or Singapore, where they spend 10 weeks in classes (15 credits) and 6 weeks at a full-time internship (3 credits) during their second semester.
Jay Tighe, a senior economics and international business major, worked and studied in London as a freshman in the program. He is interested in nongovernmental organizations and did his internship in London with AfricaRecruit, a nonprofit group where his responsibilities included calling African Embassies around the world in a campaign to encourage professionals to return to the continent to help rebuild after political upheaval.
Getting London ''under my belt,'' he says, gave him confidence. ''The logical progression was to do it again.'' Which he did, in the fall of his junior year in Argentina, where he worked at a community center teaching English. He has applied for a Fulbright to teach English in Thailand after he graduates this spring.
FOR the most part, international internships are not paid. But students do pay. Tuition and housing is usually equivalent to on-campus charges, but extras can add up. For London, Villanova estimates $7,700 in fees (meals, airfare, local transportation, books, passport, visa costs, health insurance and about $2,500 in spending money), in addition to $21,000 covering housing and tuition for 18 credits. Pittsburgh charges about $9,000, including housing, for its six-credit summer program but gives the first 70 enrolled students a $1,600 scholarship. It estimates $3,500 more in expenses.
Baruch College, part of the City University of New York, provides every international intern with a scholarship that covers airfare. ''Baruch is a city school and the young men and women here are not wealthy,'' says Terrence Martell, the director of the Weissmann Center for International Business, which sends about 30 students abroad each summer. Baruch's students, he says, come from immigrant communities and have the language skills and cultural understanding that appeal to international employers. It's important, he says, to help them ''leverage'' that background. But Baruch does not offer credit, or supplemental academics. It works with about a dozen companies that design and administer internships, vetting workplaces and matching students with potential employers.
These types of companies are widely used by students whose campuses do not have their own program or the kind of program a student is looking for -- or, increasingly, by unemployed recent graduates who want to build their résumés. One such company, Intrax, out of San Francisco, can help students identify placements, apply for their internships and oversee them once abroad. For a package that includes housing, local excursions and fees like visa processing and insurance (but not meals or airfare), Intrax charges independent students between $5,950, for a semester's internship in Chile or China, and $8,150 for a post in London.
Dr. Martell cautions independent students to research companies carefully, not only for cost but also for program oversight and solid track records in placing students with reputable companies in meaningful jobs. Internship-only programs do not confer credit, but companies may be able to help students work with schools to arrange it.
Although internships abroad can be pricey, students are taking the long view. ''It used to be that a company would train you and then transfer you overseas,'' says Melanie Vuynovich, a spokeswoman for Intrax. ''Students who intern overseas are doing it because they need it. Often global understanding indicates maturity.''
That maturity was thrust upon Mr. Gamertsfelder. Dow managers included him in market-research trips to Chile, Peru and Brazil. He sat through marketing meetings and was expected to ask customer-relations questions, in English and, at first, halting Portuguese. He then wrote up his findings for management in so-called SWOT reports, as in ''strength, weakness, opportunity and threat.''
''That gave me a firsthand perspective on what Dow was doing and where the market was going,'' he said. He became fluent in Portuguese, mostly by socializing with Brazilians, listening to music and television, and through Facebook chats. Bitten by the international bug, he also did two Semesters at Sea, financing much of his travels with scholarships. ''With the amount of experience I had in Brazil and abroad, and my achievements at Pitt, I figured it would be hard for Stryker to find anyone else who was better qualified.''

HEADLINE: Off Off Off Campus: The Friday cry at suitcase schools: Don't go!

BYLINE: By ABIGAIL SULLIVAN MOORE. 
Abigail Sullivan Moore is co-author of ''The iConnected Parent.''

 BODY:
ON any given Saturday, Central Connecticut State University is nearly empty. No Frisbee flinging, no lingering over lattes at Jazzman's Cafe and Bakery. The library closes at 3:45, the cafeteria at 6:30 sharp.
''It's like this almost every weekend,'' says Andrew Pegg, a sophomore, sitting under blue skies at a gracious plaza at the heart of campus, in sleepy New Britain. A few like-minded friends have stuck around. But ''it's hard to play a pickup football game with only four guys,'' he says. ''I watch a lot of TV. I've got Netflix.''
Almost half of Central's 7,700 full-time undergraduates live in dorms or near campus. But most vanish each Friday, joining the army of undergraduates at ''suitcase schools'' around the country who desert their campuses on weekends. 
They head home for the same reasons suitcase students always have: favorite meals, moms (and now dads) still willing to do their laundry, high school friends and sweethearts, and jobs. The refrain ''There's nothing to do on campus'' is self-fulfilling. With events sparsely attended on weekends (homecoming excluded), little is scheduled. And the exodus is increasingly facilitated by a seamless arc of tweets, texts and calls between dorm and hometown and friends elsewhere.
According to the 2012 end-of-year survey by the Higher Education Research Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, 39 percent of first-year students at less selective campuses said they had gone home frequently.
Home is usually not far away: 52 percent of freshmen who attend four-year public colleges live within 50 miles of campus, the institute reports. At Central, which has a large commuter population, about 75 percent of students live within that radius. The smaller the state, the easier it is to get home.
For students nervous about venturing too far from home, or unable to get into or afford the elite institutions that attract students from across the country (and are thus less able to slip away), suitcase schools are a reliable option -- a last choice or a precious chance or something in the middle.
But the suitcase culture has educators concerned, and many regional campuses are working to reverse it.
''When students go home with their high school friends on weekends, they are not being challenged,'' says Patricia A. Perillo, who as director of student life at University of Maryland, Baltimore County, helped revive its moribund campus. ''In these social situations on weekends, when they are having to meet new people, it challenges them a little bit and stretches them a bit.'' That emotional and social growth helps students do better in and outside of the classroom, says Ms. Perillo, now vice president for student affairs at Virginia Tech.
In contrast to the independent stance taken by past generations of students, who valued their freedom, or at least the lack of parental curfews, attitudes have softened about spending weekends with the family. ''There's less stigma,'' says Sarah Bordeleau, the associate director of student activities at Curry, a private college in Massachusetts, who recently wrote about ways to change suitcase-school culture for Campus Activities Programming magazine. ''Everyone relates to the tightness and closeness of families and more dependency on parents,'' she says. ''It's not: 'Why would you go home this weekend?'''
Now, when a student posts plans on Facebook, others follow. ''It's like a reverse 'Field of Dreams,' '' says Samantha Desmond, a recent graduate of Seton Hall, a private university in New Jersey that draws 75 percent of its students from the state. ''If you leave, everybody else will leave.'' Ms. Desmond implored classmates in an op-ed piece in the student newspaper to make day trips if they're so bored, but to return to campus at night.
The cycle is hard to break. ''In some ways I wish parents would say -- but it's hard to do -- 'We really want you to stay when you're away. We want you to make a commitment,' '' says David P. Coates, president of the New York State Association for College Admission Counseling.
In this post-recession economy, though, some students have no choice. They are holding onto their hometown jobs, say administrators at Central and at Bridgewater State University in Massachusetts, which bears the luggage label, too.
Keeping a job year-round makes sense, given the scarcity of summer posts, says Beth Moriarty, director of resident life at Bridgewater. ''So if they had a job at Old Navy since they turned 16 and so Old Navy is willing to keep them on the payroll, it's a lot easier than coming to Bridgewater and finding a job on campus.''
The economic need is evident. A 2011 survey by the Higher Education Research Institute found that 74 percent of Bridgewater freshmen relied on savings from work to help finance their education; the figure for students at similar institutions is 60 percent, a percentage in line with a 2010 survey of freshmen at Central.
Margaret Gumowski, a junior, has a weekend job at a farm near her home in Naugatuck, Conn., though she lives in a dorm at Central. Most Fridays she heads home, chugging down the interstate for 30 minutes in a 1997 Mercury Grand Marquis. She has worked at the farm for seven years, summers full time, selling produce and earning a bit more than minimum wage to pay for books (used or rented), gas (two gallons one way), clothing (imitation North Face) and any extras. Her parents scrimp to pay her tuition and that of her younger sister, a freshman at Central whose grades won scholarship help.
During the cool months, Ms. Gumowski works only on Saturdays, with a hiatus from January to April. Even so, she returns every other weekend to the tiny bedroom she painted lime green (with purple curtains). Her home is just off the highway with a yard big enough for a chicken coop, two dogs and her rescue tabby, Simba -- ''She's a comfort.'' And her parents? A source of comfort, too, against school stress. ''They are very chill and relaxed,'' she says.
Ms. Gumowski could have halved her costs by commuting. But she wouldn't consider it. She enjoys the residential college experience, she says, and the lifelong friends it can bring -- ''Who would walk down the aisle at your wedding?''
MOST colleges don't like the suitcase label. It can spell admission and retention troubles.
''The reality is that the less engaged students are, the more likely they are to leave, to drop out or to do poorly in courses,'' says Jillian Kinzie, the associate director of the Center for Postsecondary Research and National Survey of Student Engagement Institute. Before, she says, students would go home every weekend and ''have a just-kind-of-not-so-great college experience.'' But they wouldn't leave the institution. ''Now what I think we're seeing is more students will leave.''
Alexandra Shagoury thinks about transferring from Central. Freshman year, after the first three weekends on campus, she ''just couldn't do it anymore,'' she says. ''It was boring.'' And lonely. ''Coming from a family -- always having people around me -- when I am alone I'm out of my comfort zone.'' She talks daily to at least three family members.
Now a sophomore, she heads home to Cheshire, 25 minutes away, almost every Friday. Her best friend since kindergarten is at Quinnipiac University, 10 minutes from Ms. Shagoury's home. She attends cultural events at Yale with her father, a fellow history buff. Her mother makes salmon, ravioli and a shrimp and zucchini pasta -- ''whatever I want.''
At Central, ''they try to make us stay more.'' But, she complains, ''there's nothing to do here.''
So how do you keep students on campus when there are compelling reasons to go home?
''It's particularly an issue for us and most of the public colleges in New Jersey,'' says Peter Philip Mercer, president of Ramapo College of New Jersey, which draws 95 percent of its undergraduates from the state, most of them within commuting distance. Once a commuter student, Dr. Mercer is passionate about the learning that comes from campus life. In 2011, Ramapo instituted a ban on cars for freshman residents, and empowered students to plan events every Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday night. The result? More students on campus -- even those allowed to have cars.
Widener University in Chester, Pa., where a little more than half the student body lives in campus housing, is also trying to ''shed the suitcase mentality,'' says Dave Eng, the new director of student engagement. A recent poll of 275 students who left on weekends found that only 10 percent did so for a job; the rest cited family and friends. Mr. Eng hopes to tempt them with new weekend fare, like a recent late-night Day-Glo party at which he personally sprayed fluorescent paint on dancers.
At Central, Laura Tordenti, vice president for student affairs, jokes with parents about getting their children to commit to campus: ''Gee, you can always change the locks at home and make it a little bit more difficult for them.''
Last summer she and student leaders began a campaign to revitalize weekends. ''We are hellbent on changing the culture and doing it in a positive way by getting students involved in the planning,'' Ms. Tordenti says. The school has created a $20,000 pool from which to award mini-grants to help students subsidize events. Each resident adviser is required to plan a weekend activity once a month. In a recent success, a Saturday flag football game drew more than 200 to the usually empty campus center.
''You could see the difference that night at dinner; you were waiting in line,'' says Ian Mangione, a senior and president of Central's Inter-Residence Council.
Taking a cue from Stony Brook University on Long Island, a Division I rival that has used the Seawolves to help erase a suitcase legacy, Central has been re-energizing its sports image. In 2010 it hired Paul C. Schlickmann, the executive associate director of athletics at Stony Brook. Pep rallies are popping up on campus, and on ''Blue Fridays'' students are beginning to sport their school color. Central has also transformed its old Blue Devil logo, which resembled the label on a can of deviled ham, into a fiercely cool creature. Unfortunately, the Blue Devils have yet to match the Seawolves' winning record.
Mr. Mangione is not convinced official initiatives can make much of a difference if student attitudes don't change.
''If you say, 'You know what? I'm going to stay and I'm going to have my roommate stay,' that's what it takes. They have to think of the university as their home rather than just some place to stay while taking classes.''
He could be describing Mr. Pegg, the Central sophomore, whose family lives a half-hour away. ''You always hear about people going to UConn,'' Mr. Pegg says, ''or people going to literally any other school -- 'I'm going to Boston for the weekend.' Everyone leaves.'' And he tells them, '''Come on, just stay here. We can do things.' It's kind of sad, actually.''
Mr. Pegg, who wants to teach high school biology, says he likes his school: ''It's not expensive. It's in-state. It has really good programs that I need.''
Besides, he says, ''I don't want to go home and see the same people I've known since fourth grade.''

HEADLINE: North Dakota Went Boom

BYLINE: By CHIP BROWN

 BODY:
Long before the full frenzy of the boom, you could see its harbingers at the Mountrail County courthouse in Stanley, N.D. Geologists had pored over core samples and log signatures and had made their educated guesses, and now it was the hour of the ''landmen,'' the men and women whose job was to dig through courthouse books for the often-tangled history of mineral title and surface rights.
Apart from a few fanatics who sometimes turned up at midnight, the landmen would begin arriving at the courthouse around 6 a.m. In the dead of winter, it would still be dark and often 20 or 30 below zero, and because the courthouse didn't open until 7:30, the landmen would leave their briefcases outside the entrance, on the steps, in the order they arrived. And then they would go back to their cars and trucks to wait with the engines running, their faces wreathed in coffee steam. Sometimes there were more than 20 briefcases filed on the courthouse steps. The former landman who told me this -- Brent Brannan, now director of the North Dakota Oil and Gas Research Program -- said he sometimes thought he could see the whole boom in that one image, briefcases waiting for the day to start, and it killed him a little that he never took a picture. 
For many years North Dakota has been a frontier -- not the classic 19th-century kind based on American avarice and the lure of opportunity in unsettled lands, but the kind that comes afterward, when a place has been stripped bare or just forgotten because it was a hard garden that no one wanted too much to begin with, and now it has reverted to the wilderness that widens around dying towns. In a way, of course, this kind of frontier is as much a state of mind as an actual place, a melancholy mood you can't shake as you drive all day in a raw spring rain with nothing but fence posts and featureless cattle range for company thinking, Is this all there is? until finally you get out at some windswept intersection and gratefully fall on the fellowship of a dog-faced bar with a jukebox of songs about people on their way to somewhere else.
All of which may explain the shock of coming around a bend and suddenly finding a derrick illuminated at night, or a gas flare framed by stars, or dozens of neatly ranked trailers in a ''man camp,'' or a vast yard of drill pipe, or a herd of water trucks, or tracts of almost-finished single-family homes with Tyvek paper flapping in the wind of what just yesterday was a wheat field. North Dakota has had oil booms before but never one so big, never one that rivaled the land rush precipitated more than a century ago by the transcontinental railroads, never one that so radically changed the subtext of the Dakota frontier from the Bitter Past That Was to the Better Future That May Yet Be.
It's hard to think of what oil hasn't done to life in the small communities of western North Dakota, good and bad. It has minted millionaires, paid off mortgages, created businesses; it has raised rents, stressed roads, vexed planners and overwhelmed schools; it has polluted streams, spoiled fields and boosted crime. It has confounded kids running lemonade stands: 50 cents a cup but your customer has only hundreds in his payday wallet. Oil has financed multimillion-dollar recreation centers and new hospital wings. It has fitted highways with passing lanes and rumble strips. It has forced McDonald's to offer bonuses and brought job seekers from all over the country -- truck drivers, frack hands, pipe fitters, teachers, manicurists, strippers. It has ginned up an unreleased reality show called ''Boomtown Girls,'' which follows the lives of ''five bold and brave sisters'' in the formerly drowsy farm center of Williston, N.D. Williston, whose population has tripled in the past 10 years, lies in the middle of the 150,000-square-mile Williston Basin, a depression in the crust of the earth that geologists now believe contains one of the largest oil fields in the world.
In the fall of 2011 in Crosby, N.D., Continental Resources, the oil company with the most acreage leased in the basin, erected a self-congratulatory granite monument celebrating its work in the so-called Bakken Formation, the Williston Basin rocks that, as Continental put it, ushered in ''a new era in the American oil industry.'' The number of rigs drilling new wells in North Dakota's part of the basin reached a record 218 last May. It has now leveled off at around 200, as thousands of wells have been completed under deadline pressure to secure expiring mineral leases. Many thousands more will be spudded in the next two years as the boom moves from discovery to production and crews drill ''infill'' wells, complete pipelines, fortify roads, enlarge refineries and build natural-gas pumping stations and oil-loading train yards.
North Dakota's last oil boom, 30 years ago, collapsed so quickly when prices crashed that workers in the small city of Dickinson left the coffee in their cups when they quit their trailers. Apostles of ''Bakken gold'' insist that what's different this time is that this time is different, the history of frontier avarice notwithstanding. This is the boom that is going to change everything without the remorse and misgivings that have marked the aftermath of so many past orgies of resource extraction. This is the boom that won't leave the land trashed, won't destroy communities, won't afflict the state with the so-called Dutch Disease in which natural-resource development and the sugar rush of fast cash paradoxically make other parts of the economy less competitive and more difficult to sustain. This is the boom being managed by local people certain they know how to look after their interests and safeguard the land they live on. This is the Big One that North Dakota has been waiting for for more than a century.
''This is our time,'' Clay S. Jenkinson told me one morning over coffee at a Bismarck Starbucks, where he often goes to write. Jenkinson, a humanities professor, is a North Dakota author and columnist best known for his impersonation of Thomas Jefferson on public radio. ''It's our gold rush, our Silicon Valley. It reverses decades of anxiety about out-migration and rural decline and death. Suddenly the state that never had anything is in the middle of an oil boom that is larger than anybody could have predicted. We aren't going to do anything to jeopardize it. People aren't interested in stepping back.''
You won't find a better ambassador of what the oil industry calls ''the play'' in western North Dakota than Loren Kopseng. Kopseng -- 65, a deer hunter, a Bud Light drinker, a profane churchgoer with four kids and two ex-wives -- refers to himself as a ''petro-preneur.'' The oil company he started almost 30 years ago is headquartered in Bismarck, but the thrilling part of his billion-dollar business is based 100 miles northwest in the Williston Basin. Kopseng is a conservative Republican, and like many North Dakotans, he includes government regulation in the same category of pleasant experiences as droughts, floods, grasshoppers and prairie fires. But he's honest enough to concede (with an anguished moan) that his private-enterprise principles aren't hypocrisy-free, given that his own bacon has been saved ''many times'' by the state-owned Bank of North Dakota, which became prominent when North Dakota was a bastion of radical agrarian populism in the 1930s.
It was with a touch of truant glee that Kopseng skipped out of his office to fly me around the oil fields on a windy morning last spring. He pulled on a green Fighting Sioux sweatshirt and climbed into the cockpit of his Aviat Husky, a maroon-and-yellow single-engine plane with two seats, one behind the other.
And then we were off, banking over the low-slung rooftops that ring the state's Capitol, an 18-story stone-and-concrete landmark built in 1934. North Dakotans are as proud of their Capitol as they are of their boom-based unemployment rate (3.2 percent, lowest in the nation), and many were stung when a Minnesota state legislator last spring compared it to the headquarters of an insurance company.
We crossed the Missouri River, the plane beating on above a sea of grass. Infinity nagged at the scale of things. It was almost possible to imagine the land as it appeared to Lewis and Clark when the Corps of Discovery came up the Missouri in 1804 -- but only if you looked past the toy-size trucks crawling west on Interstate 94 with drill pipe and water tanks; and the locomotives lumbering east with hundred-unit trains of black oil-tanker cars in tow. The westward march of American industry was written in the quarters of plowed earth and section line roads, in the power-transmission towers and smoke-signal steam puffs drifting from a Tesoro refinery; it was visible even on the far horizon, at the edge of a fretted but still bracing emptiness, in the shape of giant windmills and the silhouette of a coal gasification plant. Each and all were contemporary manifestations of an economic imperative that dates back to the triumph of the treaty breakers who usurped the Native Americans and commodified the land, and to the waves that came in their wake, the great white hunters who cleaned out the buffalo, the agents of the bone boom that followed who sent trainloads of buffalo skeletons back East to be used to refine sugar, the iron-horse magnates, the immigrant farmers and pioneer ranchers ruined by the ''dirty '30s,'' and later the first oil and lignite coal barons and the government dam builders who tamed the Missouri.
''Keep an eye out for radio towers,'' Kopseng said over the headset.
Flying was Kopseng's dream job before he got the idea of building an oil company. He began studying for his pilot's license as a freshman in college. When he graduated (sidetracked for a year and a half by a stint in the Army that included seven months in Vietnam), one of his first jobs was flying a small plane for a highway contractor. He always worked -- he helped his parents run apartment buildings in Bismarck, and for six summers starting at age 12, he fed the chickens and pigs and bucked hay and branded cattle at his grandparents' ranch in Slope County in the western part of the state.
Kopseng first came down with oil fever in the late 1970s, when fortunes were being made domestically in the wake of the OPEC oil embargo. He struggled for five years, learning expensive lessons. ''I had a lot of lemonade wells,'' he sighed. He went broke twice, maxed out his credit cards and even borrowed money from his mother -- loans that came with sharp remarks about his clothes and hair. After he married and started a family, it was his wife's friends who looked at him sideways. While they were buying houses and investing in mutual funds, he was in debt-work-out negotiations with Halliburton.
''I embarrassed myself,'' he said.
In 1984, at a particularly low ebb, he met Don Russell, a merchant from Mandan, who'd done well in the not-obviously-related businesses of peddling tires and packing meat. Russell, who died in 2011, also wanted to get into oil and gas. The timing might not have seemed auspicious; companies were quitting the Williston Basin, unable to sell their product for more than it cost to produce. But with Russell handling the financial end, Kopseng began accumulating distressed oil and gas wells. He brokered oil-field equipment; he bought and sold leases; he jumped into the natural-gas market just as it was being deregulated. In 1997 he and Russell consolidated various energy-related businesses into the privately held United Energy Corporation.
U.E.C. hasn't drilled a well of its own since 1998, but today it holds a nonoperating interest in close to 2,000 oil and gas wells. It transports by rail 82,000 barrels of oil a day to refineries. In 2012 the company earned a net profit of $44.8 million on revenues of $5.7 billion. Best of all, in a state where until recently young people often had to leave to find work, his two sons -- Ryan, an oilman, and Sander, a lawyer -- joined the company and built successful careers down the hall.
As the Husky droned west, the land began to change, growing drier, farms giving way to ranches. Below was the country of the Missouri Slope, where homesteaders discovered the fallacy that rain followed the plow.
And then suddenly there were oil wells. Well after well, 6,000 or more. Many were production wells -- weathered pump jacks pulling up oil (or natural gas and natural-gas liquids) from holes drilled over the years. New or freshly painted pump jacks were nodding over recent discoveries. At that moment, 209 rigs were drilling fresh holes. Wells being hydraulically fractured were ringed by 20 or more water tanks spread out on square mounds of brick-red ''scoria'' -- a clay sintered by underground coal fires and used for drill pads and roads in North Dakota. Some well sites were tucked in the lee of ravines or perched on bluffs or strung out along the line of a county road, one per mile, like square coasters on a bar.
North of the Missouri River, around the town of Parshall in Mountrail County, the wells started almost on a line that coincided roughly with the 102nd meridian. South of the river, the boundary was marked by Highway 49.
''That's the line of death,'' Kopseng said. ''The edge of the thermally mature part of the oil field. If you drill to the east of that, you're dead.''
He banked the Husky over a pennant of flare gas fire, and from the size of the flame estimated the well was producing 1,500 barrels of oil per day. More than a third of the gas that comes out of the oil wells in the basin was being flared off, but that percentage is declining as pipelines and facilities to process it come online. Night satellite photographs that were once pitch-black now show a massive gas flare luminance in the northwest corner of the state. In July the World Bank reported that flared gas from the Williston Basin was the main reason the United States has jumped to 5th from 14th (behind Russia, Nigeria, Iran and Iraq) on the list of gas-flaring nations. This practice raises the atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide, the gas primarily responsible for global warming.
Yet in the midst of so much empty, untrammeled land, the roaring fires and messy drill pads didn't evoke images of industrial blight like the apocalyptic black wastes of the Alberta tar-sands operations or the eaten-off mountaintops of West Virginia coal country, or for that matter, the landscape of New Jersey around the port of Newark. From the Husky, it was easy to overlook environmental issues and fathom the appeal of oil development -- easy to see the allure of a derrick dressed up in lights and looming 10 stories over a desolate landscape where the leading academic solution to social and economic stagnation had been to surrender and let the land lapse into buffalo commons.
We circled around the southern end of the basin above Dickinson, then flew west and north above the willows in the ravines and coulees of the Little Missouri River. Green junipers blazed on the broken rainbow clay and sandstone cliffs of the North Dakota Badlands, where 26-year-old Theodore Roosevelt came in 1884 to recuperate after the deaths of his wife and his mother on the same day. The two ranches he acquired are now part of Theodore Roosevelt National Park.
We skimmed along the Montana border, then banked east over the confluence of the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers. Kopseng took pictures -- he'd done all the aerial photography for U.E.C.'s annual report. Rodeo winds were bucking the Husky all over the sky, but nothing could dampen his enthusiasm for the sights of the basin -- nothing save my stomach. There was undisguised horror in Kopseng's voice when he realized I had been obliged to open an airsickness bag in the back seat.
We put down at the Williston airport and hiked across a dirt lot full of mud-caked water trucks. Two dozen horn-handed men were bent over their lunches in an airport-motel restaurant; the only women in the place were the waitresses.
''People asked me why I don't gamble,'' Kopseng said, digging into his lunch. ''I don't need to gamble because the oil and gas business is gambling. But it's also geology, chemistry, business. Every day is different.''
After the plane was replenished with $147 worth of aviation gas, we headed east toward Bismarck. Down below, dust clouds were boiling around a convoy of trucks hauling frack water and equipment on a county road. A decade ago you could have spread a picnic blanket on a lot of back roads in western North Dakota and safely taken a nap.
They have been through this before, the people of North Dakota, first in the '60s, a decade after oil was discovered in the state. And then again in the late '70s, when the boom was driven by rising oil prices. Monthly oil production, which peaked in 1984 at 4.6 million barrels, fell to half and then went sideways for nearly a quarter-century. By February 1999, there wasn't a single rig drilling new wells in the state, and oil development looked to be yet another cautionary tale in the familiar boom-and-bust history of the region -- no better than previous resource bonanzas at stemming the exodus of young people, or at halting the decline of prairie towns, or at doing much of anything to ameliorate the image of a place where the Legislature brooded over the icy connotations of the word ''North'' and twice entertained the idea of simply calling the state ''Dakota.''
And then around seven years ago -- driven by technological refinements that have made North Dakota a premier laboratory for coaxing oil from stingy rocks -- the state's Bakken boom began in Mountrail County. At the time, North Dakota was ranked ninth among U.S. oil-producing states. By 2010 it had climbed to fourth. In July 2012, monthly oil output reached 20.97 million barrels, and North Dakota was the largest oil producer in the country after Texas.
Viewed in the global market, the state's oil output isn't huge -- Saudi Arabia produces about 10 million barrels a day -- but North Dakota's oil boom now accounts for 11 percent of U.S. oil production, and it is the main reason the state government currently has a $3.8 billion surplus.
What may be even more remarkable than the growth of the past two years is the extent to which the oil comes from one group of rocks. Of the 20 oil-producing geological formations in the Williston Basin -- including some like the Madison that have yielded large volumes of oil for decades -- the Bakken Formation now accounts for 91 percent of North Dakota's oil production.
None of the Bakken rocks are visible on the surface -- at their deepest they lie more than two miles underground -- but outcrops of the brand can be seen everywhere in restaurants like Bakken Buffet, Bakken Residence Suites and a plague of Rockin' the Bakken bumper stickers. The formation, named for Henry O. Bakken, a farmer who leased his land for an early well, consists of three layers, sandwiched, in a commonly used analogy, like an Oreo cookie. The Middle Bakken layer, a band of grayish dolomitic sandstone and siltstone from 30 to 70 feet thick, sits between the Upper and Lower Bakken intervals, carbon-rich beds of black shale between 20 and 50 feet thick.
Petroleum geologists have known the cookie was full of light, sulfur-free oil since 1953, but they didn't know exactly how much or how to extract it economically. Most of the Bakken oil is ''tight.'' The rocks are not porous and permeable enough for the oil to flow on its own. If you hold a piece of Middle Bakken, it's hard to believe it contains oil at all, or that it could function as a ''reservoir'' for oil migrating under pressure from the carbon-rich shale around it. It feels as hard as a flagstone terrace. But under ultraviolet light, you can see telltale ''oil shows,'' and it has a faint smell of diesel fuel.
Significant amounts of Bakken oil were produced from conventional vertical wells beginning in 1961, but for many years the formation was considered problematic: you had to be lucky or skillful enough to find an area of the shale that was naturally fractured. Generally the formation was too thin to provide a worthwhile pay zone for a vertical well.
What made people rethink the viability of the Bakken was horizontal drilling. The first horizontal well in the Bakken was spudded by Meridian Oil in 1987, long before the current boom. Meridian engineers went down more than 10,000 feet and then burrowed sideways into a bed of Upper Bakken shale that was only eight feet thick. Later, as improved instruments gave drillers a more precise sense of where they were and what kind of rock they were in, they were able to steer drill bits between the black halves of the Oreo. The sandstone of the Middle Bakken retained the shape of the drill bore better than the Bakken shale. Approached from the side with a horizontal shaft, the reservoir rock could be contacted for thousands of feet rather than for the hundred or so feet a vertical well would afford. The Bakken today contains some of the longest horizontal wells in the world, ''laterals'' that extend as far as three miles from the drill pad to otherwise unreachable oil under Lake Sakakawea or beneath the Williston airport.
Impressive as it is to execute a 90-degree turn in a well bore thousands of feet underground, horizontal drilling alone was not enough to tap the tight oil in the Bakken. About 95 percent of the Bakken won't yield its oil unless millions of gallons of pressurized water full of sand and various chemicals are pumped down the well to crack open hairline channels. (The sand, or proppant, props the channels open.) The first areas of the Bakken to be hydraulically fractured were on the Montana side of the Williston Basin in the Elm Coulee Field, where oil was discovered in 2000. Early treatments there were called ''Hail Mary fracks'' because geologists and engineers would just drill a well, pump in frack fluid and pray for a robust result. The technique is more exact now. Certain grades of sand or sometimes proppant made of ceramic beads are matched to certain kinds of rock, and the wells are fracked in stages, as many as 40 stages per well.
Just how much oil is in the Bakken is still unknown. Estimates have been continuously revised upward since a 1974 figure of 10 billion barrels. Leigh Price, a United States Geological Survey geochemist, was initially greeted with skepticism when, about 13 years ago, he came to the conclusion that the Bakken might hold as much as 503 billion barrels of oil. Now people don't think that number is as crazy as it seemed.
''Right now our best guess is there are 169 billion barrels of oil in the Bakken, and that's undoubtedly wrong,'' says Ed Murphy, state geologist at the North Dakota Geological Survey. ''There's no way to be right. It's like guessing how many jelly beans are in a jar.''
The current recovery rates for Bakken reserves typically range from 1 to 6 percent, but recovery rates are a function of both technology and market prices. ''With the best technology, we can recover 4 to 8 out of every 100 barrels of oil in the Bakken,'' says Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council. ''Every 1 percent increase in the rate of recovery means another billion barrels.''
As long as prices stay above $60 a barrel or so, oil will be a mainstay of the North Dakota economy for a generation or more. After drilling companies finish securing leased acreage, it will take 20 years to develop the 35,000 to 40,000 production wells needed to fully exploit the ''thermally mature'' part of the Bakken shale, an area about the size of West Virginia. Production from a typical Bakken well declines rapidly but on average produces modest amounts of oil for 45 years and earns a profit of $20 million. But as the volume of oil in the Bakken shale is still a moving target, and recovery techniques are increasingly sophisticated, some estimates put the life of the Bakken play, and the attendant upheaval it is causing in North Dakota, at upward of a hundred years.
One rainy May morning, I headed out to see the oil patch by car, driving north from Bismarck 110 miles to Minot, then west on Route 2. Some of the most tangible effects of the boom have been tattooed into the roads. Officials calculate that each well in western North Dakota requires about 2,000 truck trips in its first year of operation. Multiply that by hundreds of annual new wells, and it's clear why county and state highway departments are engaged in an epic struggle against potholes, rutting, asphalt shoving, alligator cracking and other pavement maladies. The biggest danger on many dirt and gravel roads is blinding plumes of dust. Many potions have been concocted to suppress the stuff. The dust busters in Williams County discovered that spraying a soy-based oil works well, but it isn't practical because it makes the roads taste so good that cows come out of the fields and try to eat them.
Traffic used to be so scarce that drivers would wave as they passed an oncoming car; now there are record numbers of accidents. To assess the impact, the state highway department has a special van that drives around with an onboard computer, an infrared detector and six cameras and produces a ride rating for every mile of the region's highways; the higher the number, the worse the ride. ''I said I was just going to coast into retirement, and then all hell broke loose,'' says Walt Peterson, the Williston district engineer for the highway department.
The rain lifted outside Stanley at the junction of Route 2 and Highway 8 -- stretches of which had the worst road ratings in the state. I stopped for gas at a Cenex convenience store called Bakken Central, where help was wanted for all days, all shifts. Water trucks in the parking lot wore petticoats of mud. Inside, sooty-faced roughnecks with pale circles around their eyes and dazed expressions wandered through the aisles with armloads of beef jerky and 20-ounce cans of malt liquor. The store was selling showers: a half-hour of hot water for 10 bucks; $15 for a couple. Across the highway, workers were pouring concrete for a new Fuel Force gas station and rolling out sod on a fresh tract of homes.
Seventy-two miles beyond Stanley, I pulled into Williston, which proudly advertises itself as the boyhood home of the N.B.A. coach Phil Jackson. It's all but impossible to find a place to stay in Williston, but on weekends many oil workers clear out, and I was lucky to get a motel room with a cracked plastic bathtub that had been cleverly patched with duct tape. Pickup trucks were waiting in long lines for drive-through dinners at Hardee's.
One morning, Ward Koeser, president of the Williston City Commission, offered to show me around. Koeser, a 63-year-old former math teacher whose grandfather came to North Dakota to farm in 1901, started a communications company that sold field radios during the oil boom of the early '80s. He was elected to the Board of Commissioners in 1994 and returned to office five times.
''We had 12,500 people in the 2000 census, and we wanted to grow beyond that,'' he said, heading to the northern edge of town. ''We tried to diversify our economy and create more permanent jobs. We brought in a plant to split and polish peas. We hosted events for developers and growers -- farmers in the area grow lentils and potatoes and durum wheat -- but we couldn't get beyond 12,500. The downtown area was struggling for 25 years. Young people were leaving and not coming back, and farmers were moving to town and retiring. We were a graying community. Now. . . . ''
He seemed stunned by the pace of change; or maybe just exhausted. The twice-a-month town-commissioner meetings that used to take 45 minutes can now run from 6 p.m. to midnight. ''We have 800 to 900 new houses coming onto the city tax rolls by the end of the summer,'' Koeser told me as we drove around some of the embryonic neighborhoods. They had names like Bakken Heights and Harvest Hills. The city had to be careful, he said, because during the last boom, Williston got stuck with $28 million in debt after putting in streets and sewers for housing developers who bailed when oil prices collapsed. But now, land near the airport that was $500 an acre a decade ago was selling for as much as $180,000 an acre; the airport itself was slated for relocation. The town bought a 20-room apartment complex so that new city workers could have a place to live and was obliged to offer prospective police officers a housing allowance of $350 a month. Williston has hired nine cops in the last two years, trying to keep up with the crime rate, which was booming along with everything else. (Aggravated assaults in the oil patch doubled in four years.)
Koeser pulled over in the middle of a neighborhood that was nothing but curbs and driveways and empty lots.
''This whole area was a field two years ago,'' he said. ''By this fall every one of these lots will have a house. I love construction and new buildings. It's new life, new families moving in. But it's just happening too fast. Every master plan the city has prepared is obsolete by the time it's printed. You'd like to have more time to think things through, but everybody is in such a rush.''
One of the more curious aspects of oil development in North Dakota is that the people making arguments against rampant growth, environmental degradation and the messy business of extracting oil are somewhat few and far between, proverbial voices in the wilderness. Probably the loudest of these is John Heiser, a fourth-generation North Dakotan rancher and part-time park ranger who lives near Grassy Butte, and who has been railing against the pace of the boom from the start. Last February he wrote in The Bismarck Tribune that the state's politicians were not hearing what ''everyday people out here are saying -- that is, stop the oil madness wreaking havoc with the land, wildlife and Western heritage we've long cherished.'' Not long before, the Crosby Journal editor Cecile Krimm called the region an ''economic disaster area,'' citing swamped sewage systems, crumbling roads, dizzy rents and labor shortages as reasons that officials ought to be trying to brake a runaway train.
But oil development, and fracking in particular, raises little of the hue and cry it does in Eastern states sitting above the natural gas in the Marcellus shale. Even a well-publicized investigation by the news Web site ProPublica that reported that there were more than ''1,000 accidental releases of oil, drilling wastewater and other fluids'' in North Dakota in 2011 passed without much fuss.
A more typical attitude is represented by Harold Hamm, chief executive of Continental Resources. ''Why do [critics] always start talking about the challenges?'' Hamm said in a speech he gave at Williston Basin Petroleum Conference in Bismarck in May. ''What challenges? Spending all the money?'' Hamm, who is known as the Baron of the Bakken by virtue of having more than a million acres leased for drilling, led Mitt Romney's energy committee, which proposed giving states control of oil leases on federal lands.
One reason for the lack of dissent may be that there just aren't that many people in North Dakota -- the state has a population density of less than 10 per square mile; Pennsylvania has 284, New York 411 -- and the people who are there appear to have weighed the benefits against the costs. And perhaps, given the state's history of hardship, they don't feel entitled to qualms about social and environmental costs; maybe ambivalence about fat years seems self-indulgent, a failure to appreciate how lean life on the frontier once was and could well be again.
It may also be that the lack of dissent reflects the way North Dakotans idealize themselves as more inclined to endure than to complain, certain it takes a special temperament to live in such forbidding country, where winters are brutal and culture is thin. North Dakotans are among the most prudent people in North America -- even amid record surpluses, the electorate last year rejected a proposal to abolish property taxes -- and their history tells them that after the tumult of a boom, the landscape, in the words of former Gov. Arthur A. Link, will ''be quiet again.''
Link, who died in 2010, was a popular, plain-spoken Democrat who was born in the tiny town of Alexander in the heart of the Williston Basin -- a town that once opposed a bypass fearing it would dry up and die if Highway 85 were routed around it, and now is on the verge of choking to death on boom-truck traffic. Nearly 40 years ago, when the boom of the moment was lignite coal, not oil, Link gave a speech at an annual meeting of the North Dakota Rural Electric Association. It's been called ''North Dakota's Gettysburg Address.''
''We do not want to halt progress,'' the governor said. ''We do not plan to be selfish and say, 'North Dakota will not share its energy resources.' . . . We simply want to ensure the most efficient and environmentally sound method of utilizing our precious coal and water resources for the benefit of the broadest number of people possible. And when we are through with that and the landscape is quiet again, when the draglines, the blasting rigs, the power shovels and the huge gondolas cease to rip and roar. . . . when the last bulldozer has pushed the last spoil pile into place, and the last patch of barren earth has been seeded to grass or grain, let those who follow and repopulate the land be able to say, our grandparents did their job well. The land is as good and, in some cases, better than before.''
It's hard to say whether the hope and grandeur of that vision are deeper than its delusions. In truth, it seems less an assessment of what humanity can expect when it is done devouring the earth's nonrenewable resources than a prayer that reflects a faith unique to the place where Link was born, faith that all those caved-in cabins, withered towns and stillborn dreams -- and whatever is left when the oil is gone -- can be redeemed.

HEADLINE: Organize This

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is co-founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
For 25 years, Monty Newcomb has worked at the same chemical plant in Calvert City, Ky., making products that hold pills together and remove sediment from beer. In his early years, Newcomb watched his union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, lose one battle after another in its ongoing struggle with management. In the '80s and '90s, workers throughout the country justifiably feared that their plants might close and move to a union-free state. Or that they might simply import products from low-wage, nonunionized countries like Mexico and China. Newcomb told me that at his company, International Specialty Products, workers were disgruntled and the work suffered -- for example, more than 20 percent of one chemical they produced didn't pass inspection. 
As a union steward, Newcomb feared that unless something changed, the plant would shut down and everyone would lose his job. So in the mid-'90s, his union asked management to attend its High Performance Work Organization Partnership program, which was creating a revolution in labor-management relations. In addition to regular collective bargaining, union members and their managers engaged in trust-building exercises and developed plans to collaborate on improving conditions, products and profits. After a tough few years (''I mean really tough,'' Newcomb said), the union persuaded management to provide an incentive program and improve the pension and insurance plans. When management requested more efficiency, Newcomb helped them downsize not by firing workers but by not replacing retiring ones. These changes helped it thrive despite two recessions in a decade. And although the plant, now owned by Ashland Inc., currently exports about 50 percent of its product, it's keeping production in Kentucky, where it recently invested $15 million in upgrades. ''We make things so much cheaper than anyplace now,'' Newcomb explained. Ninety-nine percent of that particularly pesky chemical now passes inspection.
For decades, the growth of technology and the global market has created an existential crisis for U.S. labor unions. While the country's manufacturing output continues to grow steadily, it no longer produces significant job growth. Factories compete against low-wage foreign labor by investing in automated machinery and implementing new techniques -- like the aptly named Lean system, which focuses on efficient work flow -- to make them far more productive. Since 2000, factories have shed more than five million jobs. Last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed that union membership is at a 97-year low of 11.3 percent.
Workers have obviously chafed at these job-shrinking strategies, but Matt Vidal, a labor sociologist at King's College London, told me that Lean actually works best for everyone (executives, employees, customers) when managers work with unions to preserve jobs and foster worker support. This tends to lead to more worker self-management. ''In my research, it was clearly the case that the leanest factories I saw in the U.S. were largely union factories,'' he said. In 2010, Bob King, the president of the United Automobile Workers, embraced this when he called for a new age of union-management collaboration.
Collaboration, however, is definitely not the only technique being used to successfully combat the perceived existential threat. Stuart Appelbaum, the president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, has become something of an organized-labor star by employing the old-school approach of unifying workers in distrust of rapacious managers in new ways. And his successes have come in unlikely places: vulnerable, often immigrant workers in low-skill, itinerant jobs. He recently organized the workers at five New York City carwashes and at a poultry plant in Alabama, a state particularly allergic to unions. ''We don't argue to owners, 'We're doing this for your sake,' '' he said. ''We're not going to be the ones who say, 'We think you have to cut back on things to make your stockholders more profitable.' ''
Unlike factory workers, Appelbaum's members don't have any incentive to cozy up to management. They work in what economists call the nontradable sector: jobs that can't be moved easily to a low-wage country. Low-skill workers in nontradable jobs actually have one small but important organizing advantage. U.S. cars can be made in Mexico, after all, but they have to be washed here. As a result, unions are seeking growth in other nontradable fields, like carpentry, plumbing and transit drivers. The top prize is a group that comprises the single largest number of jobs that must be done on American soil: Walmart workers.
Unfortunately neither of these approaches -- collaboration or defiance -- has solved the fundamental challenges of organized labor. Union membership has been falling since 1954, when about 35 percent of the U.S. work force was organized. (When excluding comparatively successful public-sector unions, less than 7 percent of workers are now organized.) It's also hard to find anyone with a convincing explanation of how membership could grow. Many recent union fights, in fact, have been waged over issues that seemed settled long ago, like the bulwark against anti-union right-to-work legislation in Rust Belt states. Even Appelbaum's great successes are modest. One of his biggest accomplishments, a 17-week strike at a Mott's applesauce plant, prevented a wage cut but brought few new benefits to workers.
In France and Germany, where union coverage is drastically higher and protections are stronger, there has been a steady erosion in the past few years. President François Hollande of France recently brokered a master contract with the three largest unions that will make it easier for companies to lower salaries or to lay off workers when business drops. Most of the labor scholars I spoke to -- all broadly sympathetic to the union movement -- said the decline of private-sector unions will continue. Gary Chaison, a labor-relations specialist at Clark University, in Massachusetts, was especially blunt. ''There's no way of really dealing with the global impact. There's very little you can do.'' Those machinist and autoworker jobs will grow ever more scarce, leaving workers to compete for lower-skill, lower-pay work. Subsequently, those nontradable service-sector jobs, like retail and washing cars and carpentry, will become overcrowded.
What will an America with no private-sector unions look like? For many on the left, this is a dystopian future of inevitable worker misery. For many on the right, it would mean more competitive companies and a healthier economy. One thing seems fairly clear, though: where there is no collective bargaining, there is only individual bargaining. And that means each worker, sitting down with a manager, making an argument for a job or a raise or against some form of bad treatment.
A lot has been written about the growing disparity between the top income levels and the rest of the country, but inequality has been growing at every skill level. That suggests a reversal of decades in which there was far less disparity, in which some plumbers, say, or lawyers made a huge amount while others made far less. Unions have been a brake on this version of inequality, and a unionless future suggests more inequality everywhere, even on the shop floor. In this new world, it is pretty likely that Monty Newcomb would not spend so much time trying to make life better for all his union brothers and perhaps their managers and customers, too. But you imagine he might spend all his energy figuring out how to make life better for Monty Newcomb.
Deep thoughts this week:
1. Organizing has been successful in some of the least likely industries.
2. But a world without unions is not hard to imagine.
3. And that could make our inequality problem much worse.

HEADLINE: Which Way Did the Taliban Go?

 BODY:
WHICH WAY DID THE TALIBAN GO?
Luke Mogelson's article on a unit of the Afghan National Army could have easily been written 40 years ago in Vietnam. A corrupt central government that does not serve its people, a largely inept army with some good leaders and some good units, plans by the U.S. to pull back from the countryside as part of the process of leaving, a lack of understanding of the culture and surrendering large swaths of the countryside to the enemy are all reminiscent of when we left Vietnam. There has never been any doubt as to the outcome of our endeavor: failure. MARK WEIMER, Austin, Tex.
Truly, one of the most interesting and thoughtful pieces on Afghanistan I have read. I feel for brave men like Lt. Col. Mohammad Daowood, who is fighting for what he believes in: education, women, etc. If there were enough men like him in government, Afghanistan would have a real chance to defeat the Taliban. I do support the coalition forces' leaving, but I, too, fear that the Taliban will be back in the game sooner rather than later. APARNA TANTRI, Ossining, N.Y., posted on nytimes.com 
If Lt. Col. Daowood indeed supports education for women, he is progressive. But what did our money and training really provide? Ragtag standards (and a blind eye toward drug use)? A leader who plays everyone off one another? I doubt that the ill-equipped, cold, hungry men of the Afghan Army are going to succeed on their own. DEARREADER, New York, posted on nytimes.com
KARAOKIA
One night in Portland in 1996, I was at Chopsticks singing karaoke with some indie rockers, including Janet Weiss and Elliott Smith. Smith sang John Lennon's ''Jealous Guy'' in a way that made us all verklempt. I chose ''With or Without You,'' by U2. The only way to cover the fact that I couldn't sing a lick was to go totally overboard. Deep breathing into the mike, bellowing, the whole deal. Afterward, Janet Weiss touched my arm and said with a wry smile, ''That was really intense.'' I can still feel the chill that came over me right then, and I probably spent the next 10 years trying to reproduce that ecstatic moment. ARNE JOHNSON, San Francisco, posted on nytimes.com
Unless we're just oblivious to the cultural significance of semiregular Willamette Week staff outings to slur ''Closing Time'' to empty chairs at Mazatlán, Dan Kois's suggestion that Portland might be ''one of the most exciting music scenes in America'' seems a little spurious (perhaps not as spurious as then-mayor Sam Adams's claim that Portland's love of karaoke could be owed to the city's ''connection'' with Japan). Still, the piece centers on a well-written profile of Baby Ketten's John Brophy, and the Portland in the story actually sounds vaguely like the city with which you're familiar, rather than some kind of hipster Neverland that exists only in the mind of East Coast food and travel writers. RUTH BROWN, Willamette Week, on wweek.com
THE GREAT DIVERGENCE
Adam Davidson points out that economists disagree about ''which policy is the right one'' to address our widening inequality, but then he asks, ''What do we value more: growth or fairness?'' This is a false choice. There is no contradiction between economic growth and economic equality. The U. S. experienced its most sustained and rapid growth during the three decades following World War II, a period that also saw a dramatic increase in the overall standard of living and a sharp decline in income inequality. Likewise, many other affluent nations -- including Germany and the Scandinavian countries -- have much less inequality than the United States, a higher quality of life and living standard for its typical working family, and faster growth.

HEADLINE: Iceland, Fervent Prosecutor of Bankers, Sees Meager Returns

BYLINE: By ANDREW HIGGINS

 BODY:
REYKJAVIK, Iceland -- As chief of police in a tiny fishing town for 11 years, Olafur Hauksson developed what he thought was a basic understanding of the criminal mind. The typical lawbreaker, he said, recalling his many encounters with small-time criminals, ''clearly knows that he crossed the line'' and generally sees ''the difference between right and wrong.''
Today, the burly, 48-year-old former policeman is struggling with a very different sort of suspect. Reassigned to Reykjavik, the Icelandic capital, to lead what has become one of the world's most sweeping investigation into the bankers whose actions contributed to the global financial crisis in 2008, Mr. Hauksson now faces suspects who ''are not aware of when they crossed the line'' and ''defend their actions every step of the way.''
With the global economy still struggling to recover from the financial maelstrom five years ago, governments around the world have been criticized for largely failing to punish the bankers who were responsible for the calamity. But even here in Iceland, a country of just 320,000 that has gone after financiers with far more vigor than the United States and other countries hit by the crisis, obtaining criminal convictions has proved devilishly difficult. 
Public hostility toward bankers is so strong in Iceland that ''it is easier to say you are dealing drugs than to say you're a banker,'' said Thorvaldur Sigurjonsson, the former head of trading for Kaupthing, a once high-flying bank that crumbled. He has been called in for questioning by Mr. Hauksson's office but has not been charged with any wrongdoing.
Yet, in the four years since the Icelandic Parliament passed a law ordering the appointment of an unnamed special prosecutor to investigate those blamed for the country's spectacular meltdown in 2008, only a handful of bankers have been convicted.
Ministers in a left-leaning coalition government elected after the crash agree that the wheels of justice have ground slowly, but they call for patience, explaining that the process must follow the law, not vengeful passions.
''We are not going after people just to satisfy public anger,'' said Steingrimur J. Sigfusson, Iceland's minister of industry, a former finance minister and leader of the Left-Green Movement that is part of the governing coalition.
Hordur Torfa, a popular singer-songwriter who helped organize protests that forced the previous conservative government to resign, acknowledged that ''people are getting impatient'' but said they needed to accept that ''this is not the French Revolution. I don't believe in taking bankers out and hanging them or shooting them.''
Others are less patient. ''The whole process is far too slow,'' said Thorarinn Einarsson, a left-wing activist. ''It only shows that 'banksters' can get away with doing whatever they want.''
Mr. Hauksson, the special prosecutor, said he was frustrated by the slow pace but thought it vital that his office scrupulously follow legal procedure. ''Revenge is not something we want as our main driver in this process. Our work must be proper today and be seen as proper in the future,'' he said.
Part of the difficulty in prosecuting bankers, he said, is that the law is often unclear on what constitutes a criminal offense in high finance. ''Greed is not a crime,'' he noted. ''But the question is: where does greed lead?''
Mr. Hauksson said it was often easy to show that bankers violated their own internal rules for lending and other activities, but ''as in all cases involving theft or fraud, the most difficult thing is proving intent.''
And there are the bankers themselves. Those who have been brought in for questioning often bristle at being asked to account for their actions. ''They are not used to being questioned. These people are not used to finding themselves in this situation,'' Mr. Hauksson said. They also hire expensive lawyers.
The special prosecutor's office initially had only five staff members but now has more than 100 investigators, lawyers and financial experts, and it has relocated to a big new office. It has opened about 100 cases, with more than 120 people now under investigation for possible crimes relating to an Icelandic financial sector that grew so big it dwarfed the rest of the economy.
To help ease Mr. Hauksson's task, legislators amended the law to allow investigators easy access to confidential bank information, something that previously required a court order.
Parliament also voted to put the country's prime minister at the time of the banking debacle on trial for negligence before a special tribunal. (A proposal to try his cabinet failed.) Mr. Hauksson was not involved in the case against the former leader, Geir H. Haarde, who last year was found guilty of failing to keep ministers properly informed about the 2008 crisis but was acquitted on more serious charges that could have resulted in a prison sentence.
Meanwhile, an investigative commission appointed by Parliament first reported to it in April 2010 and later published a nine-volume account of the financial crash, including a study of what philosophers charged with investigating ethical issues behind the crisis called a ''moral void'' at the heart of Icelandic finance.
Vilhjalmur Arnason, a philosophy professor at Iceland University who worked on the study, described the exercise as ''very important for reasons of justice and for reconciliation'' in a society traumatized by a crash so severe that it threatened to capsize the country. But, he added, bankers alone were not responsible, as ''the whole society was so intoxicated'' by values that put profit ahead of morality, the law and even common sense.
After the crash, the new government pushed to restructure the failed banks, purging their former management and owners and prodding them to write off a big chunk of their loans to homeowners burdened with big mortgages. The government declined to bail out foreign bondholders, who lost about $85 billion. Iceland now has a growing economy.
But it is not entirely clear that Iceland deserves its reputation as a warrior against Wall Street orthodoxy. In time, Iceland won praise from the International Monetary Fund for sharp cuts in spending and tax increases that slashed the government's deficit and helped put the country back on an even keel.
Certainly Iceland, in contrast to the United States and most other countries, has pursued not only little-known financiers but also many of the country's biggest names in banking and business. ''We have been aiming at the upper levels rather than the lower levels,'' Mr. Hauksson said.
His biggest scalp so far is that of Larus Welding, the former chief executive of Glitnir, one of the trio of banks that failed in 2008. Mr. Welding and a second former Glitnir executive were found guilty of fraud over a $70 million loan to a company that owned shares in the bank.
Mr. Welding, who is now standing trial in a second case along with one of the country's most prominent business tycoons, Jon Asgeir Johannesson, was sentenced in December to nine months in prison, six of which were suspended.
The light sentence enraged many Icelanders, but, Mr. Hauksson said, ''the important thing is that we got a conviction.'' By contrast in Ireland, which put taxpayers on the hook for tens of billions of dollars owed by failed banks, the former chief of the failed Anglo Irish Bank has been charged with financial irregularities but so far no senior bank executive has yet been found guilty of a crime.
Prosecuting bankers was never going to be easy, particularly in a country like Iceland, which is so small that nearly everybody in the capital has a friend or family member who worked at one time in finance. When Iceland's Justice Ministry first advertised for applicants for the new post of special prosecutor, nobody responded.
Mr. Hauksson, an outsider with no network of friends and relatives in Reykjavik, was then urged to apply during a second attempt to fill the post and was given the job.
''I thought this was something that had to be looked into,'' Mr. Hauksson said. ''If we prosecute small cases we also have to look into big cases.'' But, he added, this risks ''opening up a Pandora's box'' that can escalate even relatively simple cases ''into something very big.''
The high stakes have also left some investigators vulnerable to temptation: two former members of Mr. Hauksson's staff were placed under criminal investigation last year for selling confidential information for 30 million Icelandic krona (around $233,000) to the administrator of a bankrupt company who was trying to locate missing assets.
That episode has not dented Iceland's heroic image among antibanker campaigners abroad. Mr. Sigfusson, the minister of industry, said he was regularly invited to speak on how Iceland dealt with its banking crisis. Iceland, he said, has ''no magic solution'' but has managed to push through unpopular cuts in spending in part because it managed to curb public anger by pushing for the prosecution of its bankers.
Today, Iceland's bankers are both mocked for their recklessness during the boom years and reviled for pushing the country to the brink of economic ruin.
Mr. Sigurjonsson, the former Kaupthing banker, said a ''big umbrella of suspicion'' has opened up over anybody who worked in finance and unfairly stigmatized ''highly educated and very able people who can lend a hand in resurrecting the country.''
He said he was shocked recently when he heard the young daughter of a friend, also a former banker, ask, ''Daddy, why are bankers all criminals?''

HEADLINE: Giving Credit, But Is It Due?

BYLINE: By KEVIN CAREY. 
Kevin Carey is director of the New America Foundation's education policy program.

 BODY:
JOB listings on Craigslist these days are full of companies looking for young people willing to work for no salary. In New York, internships are available at businesses ranging from advertising agencies in midtown to a ''cake studio'' in Brooklyn. They want people who are ''positive'' and ''energetic.'' And one more thing: they want college students. As one agency looking for an unpaid videographer put it, ''PLEASE NOTE: You must be in school and receive school credit in order to join us.''
Why would companies care about college credit? Because employers, students and colleges have all been caught in the complex web of credentialing, job training and financial self-interest that increasingly characterizes American higher education.
Interning has become the norm: a survey of the class of 2012 by the National Association of Colleges and Employers found that a majority had graduated with an internship or cooperative education experience. (Co-ops are traditionally tightly integrated into academic programs, run full time and can add a year to attaining a bachelor's degree; internships tend to be relatively short, one-off stints.) 
The rise of college internships reflects tectonic shifts in the structure of the American economy. Even as globalization helped eliminate large numbers of well-paying blue-collar jobs, new industries evolved, but with jobs requiring a college degree. In 1971, American colleges and universities granted about 155,000 bachelor's degrees in the social sciences and history, compared with some 115,000 in business. By 2011, the number of social science and history degrees had increased to only about 177,000, though the total number of graduates had more than doubled. Degrees in business, by contrast, swelled to more than 365,000, making it by far the most popular undergraduate major.
Even bastions of the humanities are feeling the pressure. A recent study from Albion College and Michigan State University reported that of 212 institutions identified as a liberal arts college in 1990, only 130 still meet that definition today. Most had moved toward offering more business and professional courses.
This presents a challenge for colleges. The best way to learn history involves reading books and attending history classes led by historians. The best way to learn business often involves working in a business. But while tuition is paid in exchange for credit for history classes, that's not the case with jobs in businesses. Thus, the academic internship, in which colleges get tuition to not teach students and businesses pay little or nothing for students' work. Tuition for for-credit internships is free money. Instead of receiving no wages, students are, in effect, receiving a negative wage. They are paying for the privilege of working. (At the New America Foundation, where I work, it's up to interns whether to seek credit; most are unpaid. At The New York Times Company, interns must be compensated or receive credit; some academic interns also receive a stipend.)
In 2010, the Department of Labor became so concerned about exploitation of interns that it clarified the rules for using them without compensation. ''The more an internship program is structured around a classroom or academic experience,'' the department said, ''the more likely the internship will be viewed as an extension of the individual's educational experience (this often occurs where a college or university exercises oversight over the internship program and provides educational credit).'' There were other criteria as well: unpaid internships are illegal if the student is doing work that has ''immediate advantage'' for the business.
Companies seem to have seized on the educational credit provision as a way of minimizing their legal liability. It's a legitimate concern. Former interns have filed class-action lawsuits against the Fox Entertainment Group and the Hearst Corporation demanding back pay. In December, Charlie Rose and his production company settled a similar suit for $250,000.
The government's rules put colleges in a bind. A group of prominent college leaders quickly wrote a letter to the secretary of labor protesting regulation of internships, assuring they took ''great pains to ensure that students are placed in secure and productive environments that further their education.''
Almost half of all internships provide credit, but elite schools, whose credits are valuable currency, are sometimes reluctant to award them for internships. Yale, for example, has a stated policy of not awarding credit for internships to undergraduates. Columbia's policy says it gives unpaid interns ''registration credits,'' which don't count toward graduation and as such aren't really credits at all. While Harvard undergraduates can't get credit for internships alone, they can make them part of credit-granting independent study.
Ivy League interns are, presumably, in demand. For less prestigious institutions, denying credit could jeopardize internships, which provide a crucial bridge to the workplace. Getting tuition while students learn on the job is a good deal for colleges financially, but it also creates new oversight responsibilities that, research suggests, many colleges are ignoring.
Intern Bridge, a recruiting and consulting company, surveyed 8,939 undergraduates at 234 colleges who had been interns. Of those getting credit, only 15 percent reported that an adviser or faculty member visited their work site; 41 percent were not required to submit documentation about the experience; and 33 percent did not receive a formal supervisor evaluation. For noncredit internships, oversight was usually an afterthought: a majority of colleges require no documentation or evaluation of any kind.
This should not be surprising. Because contemporary notions of academic freedom grant professors wide latitude to teach what, and how, they like, most colleges haven't developed systems to objectively evaluate student learning in individual courses. They can, however, rely on the academic culture of the institution and the general professionalism that goes along with scholarly credentials. With internships, no such built-in safeguards exist. Some colleges and universities require interns getting credit to write an essay and complete coursework related to the internship, while others rely only on a supervisor evaluation -- or, as the Intern Bridge research indicates, nothing at all.
Supervisors, moreover, aren't educators, and receive no training in evaluating learning. Internships sometimes come with a grade, a chunk of which is based on a one- to two-page form filled out by a company supervisor -- evaluating attributes like dependability and punctuality on a five-point scale (check a box, from ''outstanding'' to ''unacceptable'') and a few general characterizations of the quality of the intern's work. This is a far cry from the rigorous examinations and thoroughly graded essays that characterize the best college courses.
The college internship as we know it today has evolved into an awkward marriage between organizations with very different missions. Both sides are offering something of legitimate value -- from the workplace, experience and connections; from colleges, credits that lead to degrees -- even as they also help their bottom lines. Students, meanwhile, are faced with a system whose rules vary widely among different colleges, or even departments within colleges, as they try to reach a goal that can be all too elusive: a good job that pays a good wage.
Of 8,939 interns surveyed by Intern Bridge in 2011:
Received credit: 47%
For those receiving credit:
Average credits awarded: 2
Had to pay tuition for credit: 56%
No pay received for work: 83%
Did not receive a formal supervisor evaluation: 33%
No guidance given by adviser or faculty member: 45%
No presentation or paper required: 52%

HEADLINE: The Way Out

BYLINE: By BRYAN MEALER. 
Mark Ovaska's photographs focus on social issues. Bryan Mealer's latest book is ''Muck City: Winning and Losing in Football's Forgotten Town.''

 BODY:
WHEN the Baltimore Ravens and the San Francisco 49ers take the field during the Super Bowl today, the teams will have five players who come from a small, conflicted region in the northern Everglades known as Muck City. The dark, silty soil surrounding the Florida towns of Belle Glade and Pahokee, some 45 miles west of Palm Beach, creates a fertile region for agriculture. 
Many of the black residents of the area were drawn there by the opportunity to work in the vegetable fields that surrounded the towns. The migrant workers, who by and large settled in run-down boardinghouses, began participating in two extraordinary football programs. The public high schools in Belle Glade and Pahokee, located eight miles apart, have sent at least 60 players to the National Football League, including the five who will suit up today: for Baltimore, Anquan Boldin, Deonte Thompson, Damien Berry and Pernell McPhee; for San Francisco, Ray McDonald.
But even more extraordinary is the world that produced these players. Official unemployment in Belle Glade hovers around 16 percent, although the town's mayor believes it's closer to 40 percent. In the Glades, the ''official'' jobless rate has always been a joke because so few people are even on the books. Many of the agricultural jobs disappeared as vegetable production turned into sugar growing, now largely mechanized.
In 2010, the Palm Beach County sheriff's office estimated that half of the young men in Belle Glade between the ages of 18 and 25 had felony convictions. The town's migrant quarter resembles something on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, or Kampala in Uganda. Some families have recently resorted to catching rainwater to survive because their utilities have been cut off for nonpayment.
In the '80s, when the towns began exporting receivers and running backs to elite college programs far and wide, the region was notorious for having a very high AIDS rate. Drugs and shootings are inescapable.
In 2008, Norman Griffith, the captain of the Pahokee Blue Devils, was killed in a robbery after a game. In 2000, a linebacker for the Glades Central Raiders, Jyron Seider, was gunned down after a dice game.
In Muck City, the well-worn line that ''football is like religion'' doesn't even begin to convey its importance. Football is salvation itself, a fleeting window of escape from a place where prison or early death are real and likely outcomes.

HEADLINE: Growth Predicted in Home Renovations

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
Homeowners who have been holding off on home improvements, be it a new kitchen or replacement siding, are more likely to call in the contractors in the year ahead.
A report from Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies predicts accelerating, double-digit growth in home improvement spending through at least the third quarter of 2013.
The growth projections reflect rebounding home sales, a rise in construction and low financing costs, according to Kermit Baker, the director of the center's Remodeling Futures program. 
''All the elements are sort of pushing in the same direction,'' Mr. Baker said.
Spending on improvements and maintenance has been on a downward slide since 2007, when, according to the center's data, it peaked at $328 billion. Spending in 2011 was around $275 billion; all the data aren't in yet, but in 2012 it very likely rose about 12 percent.
Discretionary projects, like new kitchens and finished basements, were the first to go, as is typical in a down market. Now they are starting to come back, Mr. Baker said, ''though people are a little more price-sensitive and a little more budget-conscious than, say, five or six years ago.''
A smaller share of improvement projects are likely to be financed this year. ''People have less equity to borrow against,'' he said, ''and for those who do have equity, the banks are hesitant to loan. And also, people don't want to overextend themselves.''
Financing for home improvements through cash-out refinancings and home equity lines of credit is generally available for up to 80 percent of loan-to-value ratio, said Penn Johnson, the president of the Stamford Mortgage Company in Stamford, Conn. A few banks will allow up to 90 percent for borrowers with very high credit scores, he added.
Mark Yecies, an owner of SunQuest Funding in Cranford, N.J., says construction loans for major additions are particularly hard to come by, with lenders typically requiring that the borrower have 25 to 30 percent equity, based on the finished value.
Borrowers with negative equity -- that is, with houses worth less than their mortgage balance -- cannot get any sort of improvement loan, Mr. Yecies noted.
Nationally, as of the third quarter of 2012, about 22 percent of all residential properties with a mortgage had negative equity, according to CoreLogic, a provider of data and business services. As with the other indicators, however, that one has been improving. CoreLogic reports that the equity status of 1.4 million borrowers shifted to positive from negative over the first three quarters of last year.
Greater equity does equate with more spending on home improvements. According to the Harvard study, homeowners with at least 20 percent equity spend an average of 22 percent more on improvements than homeowners with lower equity levels. The difference rises to 30 percent when considering discretionary projects alone.
Affluent households with healthy home values and access to cash are driving remodeling activity for now.
''The middle to upper-middle class is where we are seeing movement,'' said Tom O'Grady, the chairman of the strategic planning and research committee of the National Association of the Remodeling Industry, and the president of O'Grady Builders in Drexel Hill, Pa. ''People are starting to feel better about their jobs.''
Mr. O'Grady noted that his company was just now finishing up a custom basement -- to be refashioned as a ''man cave'' -- for a customer who had put off the project for several years because of economic fears.
The remodeling association's most recent survey of its member companies showed that customer inquiries were up 2 percent in the last quarter of 2012, and the total value of jobs sold was up 4.3 percent.
The decline in home values during the last decade will most likely benefit the remodeling industry in the decade to come. Mr. O'Grady predicted that as baby boomers head toward retirement, more will probably decide to renovate -- perhaps add a first-floor bedroom, for instance -- rather than sell and buy anew.
''The aging-in-place concept will be a huge driver of the market,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Nips, Tucks And Big Budget Cuts

BYLINE: By TYLER COWEN. 
Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University.

 BODY:
UNLESS lawmakers act by March 1, the budget sequestration process will start cutting government spending automatically -- reductions that would amount to $1.2 trillion by 2021. Congress and the White House agreed in 2011 to the sequestration, and many people see it as a kind of political gimmick.
But I believe that it can turn out to be a very good thing -- and that most of these cuts should proceed on schedule, though with some restructuring along the way. 
One common argument against letting this process run its course is a Keynesian claim -- namely, that cuts or slowdowns in government spending can throw an economy into recession by lowering total demand for goods and services. Nonetheless, spending cuts of the right kind can help an economy.
Half of the sequestration would apply to the military budget, an area where most cuts would probably enhance rather than damage future growth. Reducing the defense budget by about $55 billion a year, the sum at stake, would most likely mean fewer engineers and scientists inventing weaponry and more of them producing for consumers.
In the short run, lower military spending would lower gross domestic product, because the workers and resources in those areas wouldn't be immediately re-employed. Still, that wouldn't mean lower living standards for ordinary Americans, because most military spending does not provide us with direct private consumption.
To be sure, lower military spending might bring future problems, like an erosion of the nation's long-term global influence. But then we are back to standard foreign policy questions about how much to spend on the military -- and the Keynesian argument is effectively off the table.
On a practical note, the military cuts would have to be defined relative to a baseline, which already specifies spending increases. So the ''cuts'' in the sequestration would still lead to higher nominal military spending and roughly flat inflation-adjusted spending across the next 10 years. That is hardly unilateral disarmament, given that the United States accounts for about half of global military spending. And in a time when some belt-tightening will undoubtedly be required, that seems a manageable degree of restraint.
The other half of sequestration would apply to domestic discretionary spending, where the Keynesian argument against spending cuts has more force.
But here, too, much of the affected spending should be cut anyhow. Farm support programs would be a major target, and most economists agree that those payments should be abolished or pared back significantly. Regulatory agencies would also lose funds, but instead of across-the-board cuts, we could give these agencies the choice of cutting their least valuable programs -- or, for that matter, we could cut farm subsidies even further.
Of course, much discretionary spending goes toward useful projects -- building or repairing roads, for example, or research toward medical innovation. Limiting these investments would bring the Keynesian argument into play, and perhaps harm productivity, too. So we should look to substitute some areas for others -- and turn to Keynesian macroeconomics for guidance.
THE Keynesian argument suggests that spending cuts do the least harm in economic sectors where demand is high relative to supply. Thus, the obvious candidate for the domestic economy is health care, and the sequestration would cut many Medicare reimbursement rates by 2 percent. We could go ahead with those cuts or even deepen them, because America has had significant health care cost inflation for decades.
We already have huge demand in our health care system, along with a corresponding shortage of doctors. And the coverage extension in the Affordable Care Act will add to the strain. In this setting, cutting Medicare reimbursement rates wouldn't result in fewer health care services over all. Yes, doctors might be less keen to serve Medicare patients but might be more available for others, including the poor and the young. In the long run, the improved access for those groups would yield much return on investment, and would move the health care system closer to many of the European models.
In any case, these Medicare cuts would be unlikely to bring a macroeconomic debacle, and would ease long-term fiscal pressures. We could address the shortage of doctors by removing some barriers to entry into the profession, and, in possible new legislation for immigration, easing the way for more medical professionals to come to the United States.
Most generally, there is an issue of global investor perceptions. As the credit rating agencies have noted, some investors wonder whether spending cuts of any kind are possible in the nation's current political environment. And even if the economic recovery is causing budget deficits to shrink, there are plenty of negative signals about our political ability to address longer-term fiscal concerns, which will become more severe as the population ages.
Simply accepting the automatic spending cuts of the sequestration, without modification, could look like more dysfunctional politics, too. Though many of the reductions have merit, others need orderly renegotiation so the resulting cuts aren't just necessary acts of fiscal restraint, but also net pluses for the economy.

HEADLINE: Colorado Communities Take On Fight Against Energy Land Leases

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
PAONIA, Colo. -- For a glimpse into the complications of President Obama's ''all of the above'' energy policy, follow a curling mountain road through the aspens and into central Colorado's North Fork Valley, where billboards promote ''gently grown'' fruits and farmers sell fresh milk and raw honey from pay-what-you-can donation boxes.
Here, amid dozens of organic farms, orchards and ranches, the federal government is opening up thousands of acres of public land for oil and gas drilling, part of its largest energy lease sale in Colorado since Mr. Obama took office.
In all, leases for 114,932 acres of federal land across Colorado are being auctioned off next month -- a tiny piece of what Mr. Obama lauded during last year's campaign as a historic effort to increase domestic natural-gas production. Those holes have to be drilled somewhere, and the move to lease public lands in this valley has stirred a fierce debate, one that has aligned Republican residents more closely to the government's plans than Democrats. 
Coloradans in solidly red cities west of here are the ones who have written letters to the government supporting the lease sale, saying it will bring jobs and tax revenues. In Paonia, where political lines are more evenly split, residents have come out overwhelmingly against the idea of drilling, saying it threatens a new economy rooted in tourism, wineries and organic peaches.
''It's just this land-grab, rape-and-pillage mentality,'' said Landon Deane, who raises 80 cows on a ranch that sits near several federal parcels being put up for lease. Because of the quirks of mineral ownership in the West, which can divide ownership of land and the minerals under it, one parcel up for bid sits directly below Ms. Deane's fields, where she has recently been thinking of sowing hops for organic beer.
''All it takes is one spill, and we're toast,'' she said.
Paonia takes its environmental debates seriously -- so much so that in 2003, someone upset over insecticide spraying set off a bomb in the headquarters of the town's Mosquito Control District (no one was hurt).
For years, activists in town raged against the century-old coal mines located about 10 miles up the road, before eventually reaching a détente with the industry, which provides hundreds of jobs in the valley. Paonia is also home to an award-winning community radio station and the High Country News, a nonprofit newsmagazine that covers land and environmental issues across the West.
Last week, the forces of government and upset citizens collided like two weather fronts in a packed, stifling town meeting.
Officials from the Bureau of Land Management explained the situation: Under 90-year-old laws, companies and people can nominate public lands for drilling, and the government is obliged to auction them off after months of review and public comment. The officials explained that they had removed some of the most sensitive and contentious pieces of land from consideration and that they were still reviewing which parcels to lease, but said the auction was happening.
About 200 residents sat on the floor, lined the walls and spilled into the hallway, jeering and hooting as officials insisted -- sometimes patiently, sometimes brusquely -- that hydraulic fracturing was safe, and that there would be little environmental impact on the valley. They applauded as town council members pressed federal officials on drilling's effect on the town's air, water and economy -- eliciting responses that were as unsatisfactory to the crowd as a bushel of mealy peaches.
''I can't guarantee you there won't be a spill,'' Lonny Bagley, the land management agency's deputy state director for energy and minerals, told the audience. ''I can't guarantee there won't be a blowout.''
Paonia's mayor, Neal Schwieterman pressed officials on why they had used a 30-year-old resource plan to evaluate whether drilling would mesh with the valley's lifestyle and growing tourism economy. Why not delay any lease sale, he asked, until the bureau could write a new blueprint for land management in the area?
''People would like it if we said, 'O.K., we're just going to stop,' '' Helen M. Hankins, the bureau's state director, told the crowd. ''We really don't have that luxury.''
She added: ''It's not the kind of world everybody would like to see.''
Real estate and tourism groups have also spoken against the leases, saying that gas rigs and a torrent of new truck traffic would drive away second-home buyers and hurt a tourist trade that has sprung up from almost nothing in the last 15 to 20 years. Proposed gas leases near Dinosaur National Monument and Mesa Verde National Park were met with howls of protest, and the Bureau of Land Management changed or withdrew several of the parcels from the sale because they were on steep slopes or had qualities of wilderness lands.
Sitting quietly in the crowd was Bruce Bertram, who monitors oil and gas activity here in Delta County on behalf of the county commissioners. There have been 27 wells drilled in the county over the last decade, and only one on federal land. Like it or not, he said, drilling was already at the doorstep to the valley.
''Some of the folks aren't making a good judgment about what's good and bad,'' he said. ''There's a built-in distrust of government and business. And that permeates through the whole area.''
Even if the land is leased out for drilling, months and years of red tape and public review lie between drillers and the gas-rich rock underneath the tree-covered ridgelines and rolling mesas. Less than one-tenth of the federal lands here in western Colorado leased out for drilling have been developed.
During the presidential campaign,Mitt Romneycriticized Mr. Obama's policies for leading to a drop in drilling on public lands, saying that government regulations had made it too slow and cumbersome for companies to get permits.
But much of the decline in Colorado has been because of rock-bottom natural-gas prices -- which fell in part because of abundant new supplies -- and a boom in oil drilling on private lands in northern Colorado and western North Dakota. In Colorado, the public acres leased out for energy production have fallen, from 97,232 in 2009 to just 4,393 in 2011 and 64,435 last year. Now, with natural gas prices so low, it is an open question whether any energy companies will risk the money and resources to drill in the valley.
But if next month's lease sale is a sign of a turn in the industry, small farmers like Wayne Talmage worry about the future of a place nicknamed ''The American Provence.'' It has been 40 years since Mr. Talmage -- a philosophy student -- left behind academia to move here to start White Buffalo Farm, which grows organic peaches, apples and pie cherries. One afternoon, as he helped a friend pull crates of cider apples out of cold storage, he pointed to ridgelines towering above his property, where gas wells could one day sit.
''We're unbelievably blessed by this place here,'' he said. ''We could be unblessed really quickly.''

HEADLINE: In Hard Economy for All Ages, Older Isn't Better ... It's Brutal

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
Young graduates are in debt, out of work and on their parents' couches. People in their 30s and 40s can't afford to buy homes or have children. Retirees are earning near-zero interest on their savings.
In the current listless economy, every generation has a claim to having been most injured. But the Labor Department's latest jobs snapshot and other recent data reports present a strong case for crowning baby boomers as the greatest victims of the recession and its grim aftermath.
These Americans in their 50s and early 60s -- those near retirement age who do not yet have access to Medicare and Social Security -- have lost the most earnings power of any age group, with their household incomes 10 percent below what they made when the recovery began three years ago, according to Sentier Research, a data analysis company.
Their retirement savings and home values fell sharply at the worst possible time: just before they needed to cash out. They are supporting both aged parents and unemployed young-adult children, earning them the inauspicious nickname ''Generation Squeeze.'' 
New research suggests that they may die sooner, because their health, income security and mental well-being were battered by recession at a crucial time in their lives. A recent study by economists at Wellesley College found that people who lost their jobs in the few years before becoming eligible for Social Security lost up to three years from their life expectancy, largely because they no longer had access to affordable health care.
''If I break my wrist, I lose my house,'' said Susan Zimmerman, 62, a freelance writer in Cleveland, of the distress that a medical emergency would wreak upon her finances and her quality of life. None of the three part-time jobs she has cobbled together pay benefits, and she says she is counting the days until she becomes eligible for Medicare.
In the meantime, Ms. Zimmerman has fashioned her own regimen of home remedies -- including eating blue cheese instead of taking penicillin and consuming plenty of orange juice, red wine, coffee and whatever else the latest longevity studies recommend -- to maintain her health, which she must do if she wants to continue paying the bills.
''I will probably be working until I'm 100,'' she said.
As common as that sentiment is, the job market has been especially unkind to older workers.
Unemployment rates for Americans nearing retirement are far lower than those for young people, who are recently out of school, with fewer skills and a shorter work history. But once out of a job, older workers have a much harder time finding another one. Over the last year, the average duration of unemployment for older people was 53 weeks, compared with 19 weeks for teenagers, according to the Labor Department's jobs report released on Friday.
The lengthy process is partly because older workers are more likely to have been laid off from industries that are downsizing, like manufacturing. Compared with the rest of the population, older people are also more likely to own their own homes and be less mobile than renters, who can move to new job markets.
Older workers are more likely to have a disability of some sort, perhaps limiting the range of jobs that offer realistic choices. They may also be less inclined, at least initially, to take jobs that pay far less than their old positions.
Displaced boomers also believe they are victims of age discrimination, because employers can easily find a young, energetic worker who will accept lower pay and who can potentially stick around for decades rather than a few years.
''When you're older, they just see gray hair and they write you off,'' said Arynita Armstrong, 60, of Willis, Tex. She has been looking for work for five years since losing her job at a mortgage company. ''They're afraid to hire you, because they think you're a health risk. You know, you might make their premiums go up. They think it'll cost more money to invest in training you than it's worth it because you might retire in five years.
''Not that they say any of this to your face,'' she added.
When older workers do find re-employment, the compensation is usually not up to the level of their previous jobs, according to data from the Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University.
In a survey by the center of older workers who were laid off during the recession, just one in six had found another job, and half of that group had accepted pay cuts. Fourteen percent of the re-employed said the pay in their new job was less than half what they earned in their previous job.
''I just say to myself: 'Why me? What have I done to deserve this?' '' said John Agati, 56, of Norwalk, Conn., whose last full-time job, as a merchandise buyer and product developer, ended four years ago when his employer went out of business.
That position paid $90,000, and his résumé lists stints at companies like American Express, Disney and USA Networks. Since being laid off, though, he has worked a series of part-time, low-wage, temporary positions, including selling shoes at Lord & Taylor and making sales calls for a limo company.
The last few years have taken a toll not only on his family's finances, but also on his feelings of self-worth.
''You just get sad,'' Mr. Agati said. ''I see people getting up in the morning, going out to their careers and going home. I just wish I was doing that. Some people don't like their jobs, or they have problems with their jobs, but at least they're working. I just wish I was in their shoes.''
He said he cannot afford to go back to school, as many younger people without jobs have done. Even if he could afford it, economists say it is unclear whether older workers like him benefit much from more education.
''It just doesn't make sense to offer retraining for people 55 and older,'' said Daniel Hamermesh, an economics professor at the University of Texas in Austin. ''Discrimination by age, long-term unemployment, the fact that they're now at the end of the hiring queue, the lack of time horizon just does not make it sensible to invest in them.''
Many displaced older workers are taking this message to heart and leaving the labor force entirely.
The share of older people applying for Social Security early spiked during the recession as people sought whatever income they could find. The penalty they will pay is permanent, as retirees who take benefits at age 62 -- as Ms. Zimmerman did, to help make her mortgage payments -- will receive as much as 30 percent less in each month's check for the rest of their lives than they would if they had waited until full retirement age (66 for those born after 1942).
Those not yet eligible for Social Security are increasingly applying for another, comparable kind of income support that often goes to people who expect never to work again: disability benefits. More than one in eight people in their late 50s is now on some form of federal disability insurance program, according to Mark Duggan, chairman of the department of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.
The very oldest Americans, of course, were battered by some of the same ill winds that tormented those now nearing retirement, but at least the most senior were cushioned by a more readily available social safety net. More important, in a statistical twist, they may have actually benefited from the financial crisis in the most fundamental way: prolonged lives.
Death rates for people over 65 have historically fallen during recessions, according to a November 2011 study by economists at the University of California, Davis. Why? The researchers argue that weak job markets push more workers into accepting relatively undesirable work at nursing homes, leading to better care for residents.

HEADLINE: A Mercedes With Tenure

BYLINE: By JIM KOSCS

 BODY:
HOBOKEN, N.J. -- Though Naomi Harley's 1976 Mercedes-Benz 240D is not exactly the same shade of yellow as the taxis waiting for fares at the train terminal here, it blends in well enough that she can sneak into the line along Hudson Place and pick up a visitor. It's a useful perk of owning the squared-shouldered sedan, but the ruse has occasionally backfired -- when cab-seeking patrons have opened a door to get in.
Dr. Harley -- she earned a Ph.D. in radiological physics in 1971 and is a professor of environmental medicine at the New York University Langone Medical Center -- recalled the reason she and her husband chose the color when they bought the Mercedes in 1976.
''We'd read that yellow cars were in the least accidents, because they're the easiest to see,'' Dr. Harley said. John Harley, who was a renowned researcher and innovator in the field of environmental radioactivity, died in 1993. 
The 240D was one of Mercedes-Benz's entry-level models in 1976, a midsize sedan with a 4-cylinder diesel engine and a 4-speed manual transmission. Dr. Harley's car has rolled up more than 250,000 miles, and she adds about 7,000 more each year. The car was repainted once, in the original color, which, she suggested, matches the hue of maple leaves in the fall.
Wearing a red windbreaker -- and a yellow wool cap that nearly matched the car -- Dr. Harley was taking a break from reviewing scientific manuscripts to show a reporter the car. She had been working from her apartment since the storm surge from Hurricane Sandy swamped the New York City area and inundated her research lab at the Langone complex in Manhattan, near the East River. Among her many research projects, Dr. Harley developed instruments to assess exposure at a former uranium processing facility in Ohio as part of a study of long-term health effects.
The Hoboken high-rise where Dr. Harley lives -- and where she parks the Mercedes -- is on higher ground a few blocks west of the Hudson River, so it was not flooded in the deluge that caused widespread damage and forced evacuations in this mile-square city. The building lost power, but her Mercedes stayed safe and dry.
A glance around the roomy interior of the 37-year-old car showed minimal wear, as well as an absence of the luxury features now associated with the brand. Several details served as reminders that this model was itself widely used in taxi service around the world, much as the Ford Crown Victorias parked nearby have been omnipresent in American cities.
The windows lower with a hand crank, and the outside mirrors are adjusted with short metal levers that extend into the car. Air-conditioning, a standard feature today even on low-price cars, was an extra-cost option on the 240D, one that Dr. Harley said she later regretted not ordering. A crank-operated steel sunroof provides some relief on hot days.
The seats, upholstered in a textured brown vinyl the carmaker called MB-Tex, still felt firm and supportive. She added aftermarket sheepskin covers in front. A stereo from a later-model Mercedes-Benz has been installed, protruding slightly from the dashboard.
Dr. Harley initiated the ritual of starting the 240D, turning the ignition key with her right hand and then grasping a knob marked Engine with her left.
''You pull this out a bit and then wait for the glow plugs,'' she said, referring to a device that preheats the combustion chambers, helping to get ignition under way.
After a few seconds, a light under the speedometer turned red to signal the engine's readiness. She pulled the knob out the rest of the way, and the engine started with a judder that rocked the entire car before settling into the steady loud clatter emblematic of older diesels.
Working the clutch and shifter smoothly enough that gearshifts were barely noticeable, Dr. Harley eased the 240D over the gray Belgian blocks that still cap some Hoboken streets.
''I prefer the control of a manual,'' she said. ''Otherwise, it doesn't feel like you're really driving.''
She took an eastbound route toward Frank Sinatra Drive, named, of course, for the favorite son born here in 1915.
The under-hood cacophony belied the 240D's meager 62 horsepower -- about one-third the output of a modern 4-cylinder family sedan. But the car's lackadaisical acceleration did not seem to bother Dr. Harley (who also holds a private pilot's certificate and is working on a higher rating, she said). The relaxed pace felt appropriate for the impromptu tour, with the car's upright windshield and tall side windows offering an unobstructed view of the Manhattan skyline across the Hudson.
Riverfront luxury residential buildings, parks, restaurants and walking paths have replaced the docks and shipyards that gained infamy for organized crime and corruption in ''On the Waterfront,'' the landmark 1954 film made here. Sinatra could well have ended up as the movie's pugilistic protagonist, Terry Malloy, had the film's producer, Sam Spiegel, not gotten the lead he really wanted: Marlon Brando, who would win an Academy Award for the role.
Dr. Harley, a longtime Hoboken resident, pointed out the sites where Maxwell House coffee, Lipton Tea and Bethlehem Steel factories once stood.
''They're all million-dollar condos now,'' she said.
Taking a curve without drama, she noted the agility of the firm-riding sedan and went on to praise the car's tight turning circle. ''I could make a U-turn right here,'' she said. ''In rental cars I've driven, I'd have to make a K-turn.''
Fuel economy, not sporty handling, was the main reason the Harleys bought the 240D to replace their 1969 Mercedes 220, a similar model with a 4-cylinder gas engine.
''It still gets 30 miles per gallon, just what they promised,'' she said, recalling the original advertising claim.
They bought the 240D for about $9,500 from a Mercedes-Benz dealership in New Jersey, but took advantage of the company's European delivery program, picking up the car at the factory in Sindelfingen, Germany. From there, they drove to Vienna to attend the annual meeting of the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, where her husband gave a presentation.
In a curious twist, the port that Mercedes had arranged for shipping the car home was in a section of Antwerp, Belgium, called Hoboken. A badge indicating the car's European delivery, attached at the factory, can be seen on the grille.
The 240D's reputation for durability -- suggested by its role as a global taxicab -- was another attraction for the Harleys, whose professions depended on reliable, well-made equipment. Replacing the heater's blower assembly and the engine water pump were among the few major repairs the car has required. Dr. Harley credits an independent Mercedes-Benz service shop in Tenafly, N.J., Wolfgang's, with keeping the car in top condition.
''Even little things can cost a lot on this car,'' she said, citing the $300 estimate to replace a faulty clock. Her inexpensive solution: a small, battery-powered clock affixed to the dash. To its right sits a round stick-on thermometer, which on this sunny, mid-40s December day indicated about 62 degrees inside the car.
''If I see it down here in the morning,'' Dr. Harley said, pointing to the 20s on the dial, ''then I know it might be tough to start.''
At least buying fuel is no longer a major challenge.
''Diesel was hard to find in those days,'' she said of driving in the late 1970s. ''We'd carry an extra couple of gallons in a gas can in the trunk. Today, it's everywhere.''
Despite receiving frequent offers to buy the Mercedes, including one from a passer-by once while she was changing a flat tire in Jersey City, Dr. Harley said she had never considered replacing it.
''It's a marvelous piece of machinery, so uncomplicated,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths ANDERSON, RICHARD RICHARD ANDERSON

 BODY:
ANDERSON--Richard Richard Anderson, beloved impresario, art dealer, aesthete, host, philanthropist, and maritime preservationist died on Monday, January 21st in Nyack, NY after a brief illness. Several dear friends, including his partner Ian Danic, were at his side. Richard was of Iranian, Swedish, English and Irish heritage, the son of George Albert Anderson and Keyhan Farian. 
He was born on September 19, 1962 in Brooklyn, NY, and grew up in Brooklyn Heights. Richard moved to Nyack as a teenager and graduated from Nyack High School in 1980 and Columbia College in 1984 with degrees in Economics and History. Upon graduating, he worked in banking, accepting postings in London and Paris. In Europe, he indulged his lifelong passion for art, embarking on building his private collection. On his return to the States, he opened a series of galleries in Tribeca, Chelsea and Soho. As an art dealer and gallerist Richard helped to establish the career of many emerging artists, earning wide respect in the New York Art world. Richard's other great passion was historic boats. At age 10 he was a constant presence as a young volunteer at the nascent South Street Seaport Museum. In recent years he founded the SS Columbia Project whose goal is to bring the oldest surviving American passenger steamship to the Hudson River Valley. This project beautifully dovetails his love of art, ships and the river, on the banks of which sits the home he enjoyed so much with family and friends. He is predeceased by his father and his adored mother, Dr. Keyhan Farian and his aunt Parvin. He is survived by a sister Farah Gharavi, his dear aunts, Homma, Zoreh, Nahid, Hidokht and friends beyond measure. His appreciation for the beauty around him will inspire us forever. In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the SS Columbia Project, 232 E. 11th St., NY, NY 10003.

HEADLINE: Where a Poet's Vision Lives On

BYLINE: By ERIC WEINER. 
Eric Weiner, author of ''Man Seeks God: My Flirtations With the Divine,'' is working on a book about the connection between place and genius.

 BODY:
Great writers often shape our impressions of a place. Steinbeck and Dust Bowl Oklahoma, for instance. Sometimes a writer might even define a place, as Hemingway did for 1920s Paris. Rarely, though, does a writer create a place. Yet that is what the Indian poet and Nobel Prize winner Rabindranath Tagore did with a town called Shantiniketan, or ''Abode of Peace.'' Without Tagore's tireless efforts, the place, home to a renowned experimental school, would not exist.
For Indians, a trip to Shantiniketan, a three-hour train ride from Kolkata, is a cultural pilgrimage. It was for me, too, when I visited last July, in the height of the monsoon season. I had long been a Tagore fan, but this was also an opportunity to explore a side of India I had overlooked: its small towns. It was in places like Shantiniketan, with a population of some 10,000, that Tagore -- along with his contemporary Mohandas K. Gandhi -- believed India's greatness could be found. 
As I boarded the train at Kolkata's riotous Howrah Station, there was no mistaking my destination, nor its famous resident. At the front of the antiquated car hung two photos of an elderly Tagore. With his long beard, dark eyes and black robe, the poet and polymath, who died in 1941, looked like a benevolent, aloof sage, an Indian Albus Dumbledore. At the rear of the car were two of his paintings, one a self-portrait, the other a veiled woman. Darkness infused them, as it does much of Tagore's artwork, unlike his poems, which are filled with rapturous descriptions of nature. As the train ambled through the countryside, Tagore's words echoed in my head. ''Give us back that forest, take this city away,'' he pleaded in one poem.
The son of a Brahmin landlord, Tagore was born in Calcutta, as Kolkata was called back then, in 1861. He began writing poetry at age 8. In 1913, he became the first non-Westerner to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature. The committee cited a collection of spiritual poems called ''Gitanjali,'' or song offerings. The verses soar. ''The traveler has to knock at every alien door to come to his own, and one has to wander through all the outer worlds to reach the innermost shrine at the end,'' reads one.
Tagore became an instant international celebrity, discussed in the salons of London and New York. Today, Tagore is not read much in the West, but in India, and particularly in West Bengal, his home state, he remains as popular -- and revered -- as ever. For Bengalis, Tagore is Mark Twain, Walt Whitman, Andy Warhol and Steven Sondheim -- with a dash of Martin Luther King Jr. -- rolled into one. Poet, artist, novelist, composer, essayist, educator, Tagore was India's Renaissance man. He was also a humanist, driven by a desire to change the world, which is what he intended to do in Shantiniketan. Upset with what he saw as an India that mooched off other cultures -- ''the eternal ragpickers of other people's dustbins,'' he said -- he imagined a school modeled after the ancient Indian tapovans, or forest colonies, where young men meditated and engaged in other spiritual practices. His school would eschew rote learning and foster ''an atmosphere of living aspiration.''
Equipped with this vision -- and unhappy with Calcutta's transformation from a place where ''the days went by in leisurely fashion,'' to the churning, chaotic city that it is today -- Tagore decamped in 1901 to a barren plain about 100 miles north of Calcutta. Tagore's father owned land there, and on one visit experienced a moment of unexpected bliss. He built a hut to mark the spot, but other than that and a few trees, the young Tagore found only ''a vast open country.''
Undaunted, he opened his school later that year, readily admitting that it was ''the product of daring inexperience.'' There was a small library, lush gardens and a marble-floored prayer hall. It began as a primary school; only a few students attended at first, and one of those was his son. Living conditions were spartan. Students went barefoot and meals, which consisted of dal (lentils) and rice, were ''comparable to jail diet,'' recalled Tagore, who believed that luxuries interfered with learning. ''Those who own much have much to fear,'' he would say.
Shantiniketan and its school represented an idea as much as a place: people do their best learning and thinking when they divorce themselves from the distractions of urban life and reconnect with their natural environment. That's not easy to do in India. As my train trundled past rice fields and open space, I was inundated with offers of a shoeshine, pens, biscuits, flowers, jhalmuri (puffed rice), newspapers, musical performances and a magic show that featured the transformation of a Pepsi bottle into a bouquet of flowers.
Before I knew it, the train pulled into a tiny station, and the touts and hawkers were replaced by a few young men meekly asking if I needed a taxi. We drove past a moving collage of small-town India: squat buildings, women in saris riding sidesaddle on motor scooters, men in rickshaws selling banners emblazoned with verses from the Great Poet, tailors working from sidewalk shops, a sign for the ''Tagore Institute of Management for Excellence.'' Fifteen minutes later, I entered the lush grounds of the Mitali inn -- and exhaled. India often takes your breath away; rarely does it give it back.
After settling into my simple room, lined from floor to ceiling with books (including Tagore's), I met the inn's owner, Krishno Dey, a former United Nations official who returned to his native Bengal some years ago. Sitting in a portico with ceiling fans whirling, we dined on chom-chom, or mango pulp (it tastes better than it sounds).
''You're not going to see much here,'' Mr. Dey warned me, ''because there's really not much to see.''
Perfect, I thought. I had just spent three weeks in Kolkata, an unrelenting city of 13 million, and ''not much'' was precisely what I craved. India may have invented the concept of zero, but traveling in the country has more to do with infinity. A seemingly infinite number of people, vehicles, noises, odors, wonders and hassles. Not in Shantiniketan, thankfully, where there are just enough sights to justify a few days' stay.
The perfect activity is to read Tagore, and that's what I did on the veranda, where I stumbled across a poem called ''The Gardener'': ''Let your life lightly dance on the edges of time like dew on the tip of a leaf.''
Tagore, who lived on campus, produced much of his poetry in Shantiniketan (and nearly all of his paintings), taught a few courses and hosted a parade of visitors that included Ramsey MacDonald, a future British prime minister, and Gandhi.
Ridiculed at first, Tagore's new school, which he called Patha Bhavan (''a place for the wayfarer''), became a college in 1921 and attracted thousands, including a young Indira Gandhi, the Nobel Prize winning economist Amartya Sen and Satyajit Ray, the Indian filmmaker.
''If Shantiniketan did nothing else,'' Mr. Ray once recalled, ''it induced contemplation, and a sense of wonder in the most prosaic and earthbound of minds.''
Today, more than 6,000 students attend the university, which is now known as Visva-Bharati. Despite a drop in academic standards, its art school is still considered one of the best in the world.
As the school grew, so did the town. Its streets are lined with stately sal trees (some planted by Tagore), tea stalls and tiny bookstores. The poems and paintings of Tagore are everywhere.
Bicycles, which outnumber cars, are the best transportation. One day, Mr. Dey lent me his clunky bike equipped with a single gear and a bell, which came in handy given that there seem to be no passive-aggressive drivers on Indian roads, only aggressive-aggressive ones. Riding under a blanket of monsoon clouds, I passed schoolgirls in crisp blue uniforms, two or three to a bike. My destination was Rabindra Bhavan, the small museum that celebrates Tagore's life.
Built on his former estate, it consists of a clutch of bungalows separated by raked gravel. Inside the dimly lighted exhibition hall are a few handwritten pages from ''Gitanjali,'' Tagore's most famous poem, and black-and-white photographs of Tagore -- a few of him as a dashing young man, but most of an older Tagore with crinkly eyes, looking off into the distance.
There are photos of Tagore with Helen Keller, Freud and Gandhi. Notable for its absence is the Nobel Prize itself. It was stolen from the museum in 2004, a crime that remains unsolved and that is, some believe, emblematic of a deeper problem.
''Long before the prize was stolen, Tagore was stolen,'' quipped Kumar Rana, an aid worker I met. Reminiscing about Shantiniketan's ''good old days'' is a popular sport here. Everyone I met told me how the air was once cleaner, the streets quieter, the people gentler.
Later that afternoon, I strolled through the sprawling university campus, with its simple concrete buildings and rows of sal trees. In the art studios, students' work was on display: intricate bas-reliefs of Hindu goddesses, a sculpture made from a bicycle rickshaw.
A group of students gestured to me from a dormitory balcony. I climbed some stairs and found them slumped about a simple room -- perhaps not as austere as Tagore had in mind, but close. On the ledge of the balcony sat one of their assignments, a bust of a well-known artist, a Shantiniketan alumna, drying slowly in the humid air.
Tagore left Shantiniketan rarely, but when he fell gravely ill in 1941, he went to Calcutta for treatment. It was there, in his ancestral home, that he dictated his last poem. ''Today my sack is empty. I have given completely whatever I had to give. In return if I receive anything -- some love, some forgiveness -- then I will take it with me when I step on the boat that crosses to the festival of the wordless end.'' Nine days later, the Sage of Shantiniketan died.
Toward the end of my stay, I encountered a baul singer alongside the road, strumming an ektara, a guitarlike instrument with a single string. He waved and I steered my bike toward him.
With their unruly hair, matted beards and saffron kurtas, the singers (baul means ''crazy'') are difficult to miss. Neither Hindu nor Muslim, they are said to be insane with the love of God and wander the countryside, as they have for centuries, singing enigmatic songs about the blessings of madness and the life of a seeker. Tagore adored the bauls, and even declared himself one of them.
I sat on the ground and listened to the hypnotic music. Bauls have grown popular in recent years and, inevitably, poseurs have tried to cash in. So when another traveler, a well-off Kolkatan with an expensive camera, joined us, I asked, ''Do you think he is a real baul singer?''
Clearly displeased with my question, he said after a long pause, ''He's as real as you want him to be.''
Sitting on the hard Shantiniketan earth, a breeze foreshadowing the monsoon rains, I closed my eyes, listened to the music, and asked no more questions.

HEADLINE: Interview With Hillary Clinton

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON and MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton was interviewed by Michael R. Gordon and Mark Landler on Thursday, her second-to-last day as secretary of state. Below are excerpts from the interview, which was conducted in her State Department office. Some of the questions have been edited for brevity.
Q: President Clinton said that one of his greatest regrets was not doing more to stop genocide in Rwanda. We have a situation in Syria where more than 60,000 Syrians have been killed. [U.N. envoy Lakhdar] Brahimi has been making no headway diplomatically. The conflict is beginning to spread regionally with Iran's intervention with its Quds Forces, its arms supplies, Hezbollah's participation and now the Israeli strike on the convoy in Syria. Looking back, can you say that the United States has done everything it could have to stem the killing in Syria? And when you look back on this episode in the book you are going to write, do you think that you might regret that the United States wasn't able to do more in your years here? 
A: I think those are two separate questions, Michael. I think that certainly there will always be regrets when you are in positions like this one when it comes to the horrific slaughter of people trying to express themselves and defend themselves by a government that seems to have lost all sense of responsibility toward their own population. That is definitely a terrible set of facts on the ground that we try to deal with every single day.
However, when you look at it as we have, the United States has been very active. We have worked assiduously, first to create some kind of legitimate opposition presence that we would then serve as the vehicle by which we conducted negotiations and tired to use that to push [President Bashir al-]Assad over the edge of legitimacy.
That turned out to be much harder than it should have. Unlike Libya, where we had a Transitional National Council, despite all of their many difficulties there was an address. There were people I met with. I met them. I looked them in the eye. I was able to go back and say to the president, ''These are people you can count on, you can bet on and we need to help them.''
For the first year, unfortunately, the people who were trying to represent the opposition outside Syria just couldn't gain traction or credibility, and it made it difficult not only for the United States but many other countries to really do what we had hoped we could do.
But we never stopped trying, and we now have a new opposition coalition largely established because of our intensive efforts, my personal efforts, Robert Ford and our team. And yesterday for the very first time [Syria's top opposition leader Moaz] al-Khatib came out and said, O.K., under certain conditions we can actually begin a political dialogue with this regime. That took a long time to get to, unfortunately nearly two years.
Secondly, we have been very active in training and equipping, with nonlethal tools, a lot of Syrian oppositionists who would come out of Syria and go back in. And we think it has made a difference in their ability to coalesce and organize.
Thirdly, we have been the architect and main mover of the very tough sanctions against Assad, which we know are causing problems because Iran has limited ability at this point to replace everything they don't have, like diesel fuel. So we think that's making a difference.
And finally on the humanitarian front, we are the most generous donor. It has been very difficult to get the aid and the money into exactly where it is needed. We have gotten a lot better about that. And we have worked also with our neighbors in the region.
Having said all that, Assad is still killing. The opposition is increasingly being represented by Al Qaeda extremist elements, including representatives of Al Qaeda in Iraq and Al Qaeda in the Maghreb and Al Qaeda, you know, messages coming, we believe, from the FATA [Federally Administered Tribal Areas, a semi-autonomous region in northwestern Pakistan], which is deeply distressing and unfortunately adds to the narrative with the Assad regime.
Now along those lines, I have spent enormous amounts of time and capital working with first Kofi Annan and now Brahimi. They are both very capable diplomats. They each have a lot of successes behind their names.
The role that Russia has played cannot be understated in terms of preventing the kind of action that should have been taken in the Security Council. So I worked with [the initial U.N. envoy on Syria] Kofi Annan. We convened the meeting in Geneva. I personally, literally, wrote and negotiated the accord for the action group. We had every reason when we left there to believe that the Russians were finally going to do something. They wanted airtight language against military intervention, but they were willing to throw in on the political transition. A new executive authority would have to be established. And there were willing to even tighten sanctions on individuals and institutions.
We leave Geneva. We go back to the U.N. And all of a sudden, whether it is because they exceeded their brief in Geneva or they had a change of mind, put on the brakes again. So it has been an ongoing effort to put together, inside and outside of the U.N., enough of an international coalition to actually take some action, and we're still working toward that.
Q: If one looks back at how the Clinton administration handled the Kosovo crisis, it became clear that Russia would not support a new Security Council resolution authorizing intervention to protect the Kosovars. So the United States elected not to seek a new resolution and instead justified intervention on the basis of international law. Why have you and the Obama administration taken the position that a stronger stance on Syria requires a new Security Council resolution, which means the formal endorsement of the Russian government, when that has always appeared to be a highly unlikely proposition?
A: Well, I think that first of all Kosovo, despite the brutality and the horrors of what was happening in the Balkans, was immensely simple in lots of ways than what we're talking about in Syria.
And the approach that the Clinton administration was thinking about was much more focused and possible than the difficulties, the borders and the hostilities taking place in Syria allow.
Secondly, the potential of getting NATO support right now is quite challenging, if not impossible. And that's not a comment on NATO, because NATO did Libya and we did this unprecedented partnership with Arab countries and the Arab League. But there is not the same level of willingness within NATO to do something like that again right now. I think that you can debate whether that should or shouldn't be, but I think that's a fair description.
So part of what the United States really has attempted to do in this situation is what we were able to do in Libya. Because for many nations now, even those in NATO, they don't feel comfortable moving forward without some kind of internationally legally recognized basis for action. So times are difficult. I think that Kosovo was different and the times are different.
And we also are well aware that Russia is an actor in Syria. Russia has a naval base. It attempts to continue supplying weapons to Assad. It has demonstrated its willingness to perhaps do even more to help Assad. So it is not a passive opposition. It is an active one with potential consequences that has to factored in.
Q: On Burma, we have learned that you and your team overcame a certain amount of resistance internally, from the Pentagon on security grounds, from human rights officials, that doing any deal with the generals was unacceptable, and were able to make the case for a diplomatic opening. I am wondering how you made that case. It was described to me as you doing a little bit of an end run and going straight to the president.
A: Well, first of all I believed strongly when I came in that there were some places that we had to test with respect to changing our relationship with them and seeing if we could find ways to incentivize change from within. So in the very early days I made a decision that we wanted to test Burma. And we started sending diplomats there to meet with officials across the board -- N.L.D. [National League for Democracy, a Burmese political party] representatives, generals who would meet with our people, obviously Aung San Suu Kyi in very limited circumstances and Kurt [Campbell, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs] was the point person for me on sending these diplomats out, evaluating their reports and then finally I sent him, which was the highest profile visit we had made to Burma in quite some time.
He came back after a very full set of meetings, including with Aung San Suu Kyi, and said, ''You know, I just feel it. I feel like there is movement here and that we can help push it. And we need to have a formal process at the same time looking at our Burma policy.''
Because I was well aware, as you just said, a lot of people have a very black-and-white view of these situations: why would we engage, why would I send anybody there?
So I did a couple of things. I knew that there were some very strong supporters of Aung San Suu Kyi and of sanctions on Burma in the Senate led by Mitch McConnell, who could scuttle a lot of what I might try to do. I went to see him and I said: ''This is off the record, this is just me talking to you, Mitch. I want to tell you that I am trying to put together an effort to test what is happening in Burma.''
He said, 'I don't think that will work.'' I said, ''It may or may not work, but what I want to know if you will support us trying.''
We talked and he finally said, ''Nothing else has worked. You might as well.'' And on the way out of the office, he stopped, and right before you get to the door of his inner office there is a handwritten letter from Aung San Suu Kyi to him, thanking him for all the support he has given her over the years.
So once I had kind of enough evidence and had developed this plan I said to the White House, ''I think we need to test this and take some chances here.'' And again, you know, debate, debate, debate was happening.
Eventually, I needed to do something very dramatic to demonstrate we were going to do this opening. So I should go. I talked to the president and I said, ''I think this is real. I think we need to test it.'' And the only way for me to feel comfortable advising you on this is to go.
So he was supportive of my going. So we did the announcement that I was going to go, and I went. I was very careful to pay a lot of attention, and spend a lot of time with, the generals. Because I had during the process of thinking this through had some great conversations with the Indonesians. Because [the Indonesian president, Bambang] Yudhoyono had been telling me ''I think, Burma is going to change.'' And he personally had invested a lot in working with the generals. Because he had been a general, taken off the uniform and was a democratically elected president.
There still is a long way to go for Burma's democracy.
Q: What was President Obama's attitude on this?
When I went, we had no idea what was going to happen. The president basically said, ''Look, I'm behind you on this.'' He had people in the White House who were very worried, even negative. ''You're rewarding them. They haven't done enough.'' We dealt with all of that.
So it was really between the president and me, and he trusted me and he said, ''Lets see what happens.'' There was no discussion about him going, until I go.
And what I told the Burmese, ''We're going to action for action.'' You release political prisoners, that we believe is authentic, we send an ambassador. You do economic reforms, we lift sanctions. It was just an action for action agenda. And slowly we saw [Burma's president] Thein Sein and his close advisers moving in that direction.
Q: As you leave office, you now have China and Japan increasingly at odds over the Senkaku Islands. There are other territorial disputes over islands in this region. A lot of foreign policy analysts mention this part of the world as a potential flashpoint. Do you think the South China Sea is an example of the limits of the United States influence? Or do you think you can make the case that that you have actually influenced China's behavior?
I would make the case that we have influenced the behavior of the nations in the region, in a way that has pulled them together, particularly through Asean [the Association of Southeast Asian Nations] to seek a code of conduct, which had been promised but not delivered in years past.
In the last two years, there's been a move toward a rules-based framework that should be used to resolve these disputes. Now having said that, it's going to be very difficult.
Q. But what about China's behavior itself? Do you see any change in their behavior?
I think it has served a very important purpose of helping to create a broader recognition of Chinese behavior that predated our saying anything, but which had led to real anxiety.
We keep saying that we want China to be a responsible stakeholder in a rules-based global order. And being a responsible stakeholder means that you have to present your claims if you can't resolve it between you and the other claimant or you have to negotiate a fair, acceptable compromise. I think there has been some movement on that with respect to some of the nations.
There's still going to be belligerence, and there's going to be a lot of very hot rhetoric, and there's going to be a flotilla of Chinese vessels in the region. But I think we've helped support a strong case of the kind of framework that we believe in.
Q: During the negotiations over Chen Guangcheng [the blind Chinese dissident] the talks became very difficult. Some officials thought it might not be salvageable. What made you think you could resolve this?
I believed we were going to figure out a way through this. Because I knew that the Chinese leadership and our leadership both valued the investments that we all had made, not only in the strategic and economic dialogue, but in creating a more durable framework for our relationship. It was a very, very tough set of negotiations.
And I was pulled into it, as I recall, on Wednesday night when we thought we had a deal. And then Mr. Chen decided that he did not like the deal we had negotiated, which, you know, caused a great deal of anxiety on the part of our team and we had to had to go back and renegotiate, which the Chinese were understandably quite unhappy about. And so there was a lot of drama. And I believed I would eventually have to get into it, but we would have to let a lot of the steam off.
[On Thursday], I had a lunch that include the main negotiators for the Chinese side and then I went to a large event on our people-to-people relationships. There were two incredible, attractive young people, one Chinese and one American, and they stood up and spoke about how important this relationship was and how valuable their experiences had been. Most of the main players on the Chinese side were there. It was a moment when I looked at all of them, and I know they're thinking: ''We don't want this all to break up over this guy. What are we going to do?'' I could just see it.
The next morning we had a pre-existing event with American and Chinese business people, and we were back in one of the big beautiful all-glass pavilions. And I sent a note to Dai [China foreign policy official Dai Bingguo] saying, ''You and I have got to talk.''
I made what I knew would be the kind of final argument about why, but we couldn't risk seeing our relationship founder over this. We would never agree on what happened and why, but we had to resolve it. So then Dai gave the go-ahead for his side to negotiate with ours again and we got an agreement. It was incredibly intense, but I was always confident.

 Tweet of the Week: 
@justinwolfers: Underneath the bad GDP report, we see solid growth in consumption and investment. Actually, it looks like private spending was humming along.
 The Week's Bests: 
 Lewis Edward explains why storytelling is so important in small-business sales: "The best professors that I ever had were ones which engaged the class into the discussion by incorporating real examples into their teaching. By storytelling, my instructors were not only helping me learn and retain the information but also making me enjoy doing so. When explaining how your business can help new clients, engaging them with a good story will prove much more advantageous than simply lecturing them on the benefits."
 Andrea Simon offers six ideas for turning innovation into an actuality, including, "Get out of your office, often, and go explore how people are using your products": "P&G requires their brand managers to get out of their offices and spend time with customers who are actually using their products. What does this do? Try spending a day in the life of your customer and see what you could learn about their pain points, challenges and opportunities where you could play a role in helping their business grow."

HEADLINE: Untouchable in Iraq, Ex-Sniper Dies in a Shooting Back Home

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ and MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ; Manny Fernandez reported from Houston, and Michael Schwirtz from New York. Julie Bosman contributed reporting from New York, and Thom Shanker from Washington.

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- From his perch in hide-outs above battle-scarred Iraq, Chris Kyle earned a reputation as one of America's deadliest military snipers. The Pentagon said his skills with a rifle so terrorized Iraqi insurgents during his four tours of duty that they nicknamed him the ''Devil of Ramadi'' and put a bounty on his head.
The insurgents never collected, and he returned home to become a best-selling author and a mentor to other veterans, sometimes taking them shooting at a gun range near his Texas home as a kind of therapy to salve battlefield scars, friends said. One such veteran was Eddie Ray Routh, a 25-year-old Marine who had served tours in Iraq and Haiti.
But on Saturday, far from a war zone, Mr. Routh turned on Mr. Kyle, 38, and a second man, Chad Littlefield, 35, shortly after they arrived at an exclusive shooting range near Glen Rose, Tex., about 50 miles southwest of Fort Worth, law enforcement authorities said Sunday. The officials said that for reasons that were still unclear, Mr. Routh shot and killed both men with a semiautomatic handgun before fleeing in a pickup truck belonging to Mr. Kyle. 
''Chad and Chris had taken a veteran out to shoot to try to help him,'' said Travis Cox, a friend of Mr. Kyle's. ''And they were killed.''
Mr. Routh was captured a few hours later near his home in Lancaster, a southern Dallas suburb, following a brief pursuit. He will be charged with two counts of capital murder, law enforcement officials said.
Friends of Mr. Kyle's said he had been well acquainted with the difficulties soldiers face returning to civilian life, and had devoted much of his time since retiring in 2009 to helping fellow soldiers overcome the traumas of war.
''He served this country with extreme honor, but came home and was a servant leader in helping his brothers and sisters dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder,'' said Mr. Cox, also a former military sniper. ''Everyone has their own inner struggles, but he was very proactive about the things he was dealing with.''
In 2011, Mr. Kyle created the Fitco Cares Foundation to provide veterans with exercise equipment and counseling. He believed that exercise and the camaraderie of fellow veterans could help former soldiers ease into civilian life.
Mr. Kyle, who lived outside of Dallas with his wife and their two children, had his own difficulties adjusting after retiring from the Navy SEALs. He was deployed in Iraq during the worst years of the insurgency, perched in or on top of bombed-out apartment buildings with his .300 Winchester Magnum. His job was to provide ''overwatch,'' preventing enemy fighters from ambushing Marine units.
He did not think the job would be difficult, he wrote in his book, ''American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History.''
But two weeks into his time in Iraq, he found himself staring through his scope into the face of an unconventional enemy. A woman with a child standing close by had pulled a grenade from beneath her clothes as several Marines approached. He hesitated, he wrote, then shot.
''It was my duty to shoot, and I don't regret it,'' he wrote. ''My shots saved several Americans, whose lives were clearly worth more than that woman's twisted soul.''
Over time, his hesitation diminished and he became proficient at his job, credited with more than 150 kills. In his book, he describes shooting a fighter wielding a rocket launcher 2,100 yards away, a very long distance for a sniper and his farthest ever.
''Maybe the way I jerked the trigger to the right adjusted for the wind,'' he wrote. ''Maybe gravity shifted and put that bullet right where it had to be.''
''Whatever, I watched through my scope as the shot hit the Iraqi, who tumbled over the wall to the ground.''
Sheriff Tommy Bryant of Erath County said investigators were still sorting out how the three men had known one another and for how long, though he said Mr. Kyle and Mr. Littlefield had been friends. The authorities said the Saturday trip was the first time the three men had been out together at that shooting range. They said they did not know the motive for the killings.
''The suspect's mother was a schoolteacher for a long time,'' the sheriff said. ''She may have reached out to Mr. Kyle to try and help her son. We kind of have an idea that maybe that's why they were at the range, for some type of therapy that Mr. Kyle assists people with.''
In a news conference, the sheriff said: ''They all went out there together in the same vehicle. The suspect may have been suffering from some kind of mental illness from being in the military.''
Pentagon records show that Mr. Routh is currently a member of the Marine Reserves. He was an expert marksman and Marine corporal who had earned several medals, including a Marine good-conduct medal. He served in Iraq from September 2007 to March 2008, Pentagon officials said, and was currently listed as ''individual ready reserve,'' meaning he could be called back to active duty.
Sheriff's investigators said Mr. Routh was unemployed and since leaving active military duty had at least one arrest on a charge of driving while intoxicated.
Mr. Kyle's autobiography was published in January 2012 and became a nonfiction best seller. It turned Mr. Kyle into a celebrity, appearing on talk shows like ''Late Night With Conan O'Brien.''
The sudden success of the book surprised no one more than Mr. Kyle, the son of a church deacon who was initially rejected by the Navy when he tried to join in the mid-1990s, because of pins in his arm from a rodeo injury. His first book signing drew 1,200 people. About 850,000 print and e-book editions were sold.
In an interview with The New York Times in March, Mr. Kyle -- who received two Silver Stars and five Bronze medals for valor -- said he had hesitated to write about his experiences. But he was persuaded to move forward after hearing that other books about members of the SEALs were in the works.
''I wanted to tell my story as a SEAL,'' he said. ''This is about all the hardships that everybody has to go through to get the respect and the honor.''
But he also wanted his sense of humor to come out, he said, noting that he tried to ''write in a Texas drawl.''
At a book signing in Kerrville, Tex., last year, Bairbre Bible, a local resident, said Mr. Kyle took a break from signing autographs to share a hug and comforting words with her husband, Jerry, a Vietnam veteran still suffering from post-traumatic stress.
''Chris, just in that short meeting, was a very strong and compassionate person,'' Ms. Bible said. ''You felt a warmth and a special energy.''
Mr. Bible, 76, who has difficulty speaking, added, ''We shared personal pain.''
In gatherings with other veterans, friends said Mr. Kyle would deflect the praise of the inevitable well-wishers and play up the achievements of his comrades.
''He wasn't the American Sniper to all of his friends,'' Mr. Cox said. ''He was Chris Kyle and he was right alongside you. He was proud to be a veteran and he would do anything he could to serve veterans.''

HEADLINE: Patent Filers Flock Together

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Patents, for all their flaws, are a widely used proxy for innovation. And a new study from the Brookings Institution shows just how clustered patent-related innovation is in America. 
That cities are hot beds of creativity of all kinds well known. But the Brookings research details just how concentrated an activity associated with scientific and technological innovation -- patent filings -- really is. There are more than 370 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States. But the people living in just 20 metro areas -- home to 34 percent of the population -- generate 63 percent of the nation's patents. In the five most patent-intensive metro areas, the study found, the average resident is 2.4 times more likely to produce a patented innovation than the average American.
Those five metro areas with the most patent filings per million people, from 2007 to 2011, were: San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, Calif; Burlington-South Burlington, Vt.; Rochester, Minn.; Corvallis, Ore.; and Boulder, Colo.
(It's easy to see why Silicon Valley is on the list, but the others? The common thread among three of the cities, Burlington, Rochester and Boulder, is universities and I.B.M. Corvallis is also a university town, with a Hewlett-Packard facility.)
The 49-page report, according to its lead author, Jonathan Rothwell, a senior research associate at Brookings, was an attempt to put a yardstick to the output of innovation, make comparisons and suggest useful policy steps.
One school of thought in regional economic development, Mr. Rothwell observed, has emphasized stimulating consumption by investing in downtown sports stadiums, convention centers and shopping malls -- attractive urban settings to attract people and dollars. That was the path, he said, taken by some central California cities, like Stockton.
"Those investments proved to be made on a house of sand," Mr. Rothwell said, noting that Stockton declared bankruptcy last year, a financial casualty of the real estate recession.
The prime economic engines, Mr. Rothwell said, are research universities. These university communities are patent-generating powerhouses and large recipients of research funding from the federal government, a resource at risk, Mr, Rothwell observed, with budget cuts in the offing. And companies that receive federal Small Business Innovation Research grants tend to be prolific patenters.
Patent-intensive metro areas, Mr. Rothwell said, enjoy higher incomes, even compared with cities of comparable size and education levels. "San Diego does much better than, say, Atlanta or Houston," he said. One factor, he added, was that the college educated in San Diego were far more likely to have degrees in science, technology, engineering or math than in Atlanta or Houston.
The Brookings report says some critical things to say about sectors of the patent system, notably broad and vague software patents. "The growing popularity of open-source software is something of a rebuke to the patent system," write the authors Mr. Rothwell, Jose Lobo, Deborah Shrumsky and Mark Muro.
But the study points to the trends of increasing research spending per patent, and the rising number of citations and claims in each patent as evidence that the pace of patent activity overall is a good stand-in measure of innovation -- and it is growing.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Searching for Origins Of the Term 'Big Data'

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Words and phrases are fundamental building blocks of language and culture, much as genes and cells are to the biology of life. And words are how we express ideas, so tracing their origin, development and spread is not merely an academic pursuit but a window into a society's intellectual evolution.
Digital technology is changing both how words and ideas are created and proliferate, and how they are studied. Just last month, for example, the Library of Congress said its archive of public Twitter messages has reached 170 billion tweets and rising, by about 500 million tweets a day.
The Library of Congress archive, resulting from a deal struck with Twitter in 2010, is not yet open to researchers. But the plan is that it soon will be. In a white paper, the Library said that social media promises to be a rich resource that provides "a fuller picture of today's cultural norms, dialogue, trends and events to inform scholarship, the legislative process, new works of authorship, education and other purposes." 
The new digital forms of communication -- Web sites, blog posts, tweets -- are often very different from the traditional sources for the study of words, like books, news articles and academic journals.
"It's almost like oral language instead of edited text," said Fred R. Shapiro, editor of the "Yale Book of Quotations" and an associate librarian at the Yale Law School. "It's the way of the future."
The unruly digital data of the Web is a big ingredient in what is now being called "Big Data." And as it turns out, the term Big Data seems to be most accurately traced not to references in news or journal archives, but to digital artifacts now posted on technical Web sites, appropriately enough.
To our modest tale of word sleuthing: Last August, I wrote a Sunday column about 2012 being the breakout year for Big Data as an idea, in the marketplace, and as a term.
At the time, I did some reporting on the roots of the term, and I asked Mr. Shapiro of Yale to dig into it. He scoured data bases and came up with several references, including in press releases for product announcements and one intriguing use of the term by a now-famous author (more on that later).
But Mr. Shapiro couldn't find anything as crisp and definitive as he had done for me years earlier when I asked him to try to find the first reference to the word "software" as a computing term. It was in 1958, in an article in "The American Mathematical Monthly," written by John Tukey, a Princeton mathematician.
So, without a conclusive answer, I didn't write about the origins of the term Big Data in that Sunday column. But afterward, I heard from people who had ideas on the subject.
Francis X. Diebold, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania, got in touch and even wrote a paper, with the mildly tongue-in-cheek title, "I Coined the Term 'Big Data' " I had not thought of economics as the breeding ground for the term, but it is not unreasonable. Some of the statistical and algorithmic methods now in the Big Data tool kit trace their heritage to economic modeling and Wall Street.
Mr. Diebold staked a claim based on his paper, "Big Data Dynamic Factor Models for Macroeconomic Measurement and Forecasting," presented in 2000 and published in 2003. The economic-modeling paper was first academic reference found to Big Data, according to research by Marco Pospiech, a Ph. D. candidate at the Technical University of Freiberg in Germany.
By then, I had heard from Douglas Laney, an veteran data analyst at Gartner. His said the father of the term Big Data might well be John Mashey, who was the chief scientist at Silicon Graphics in the 1990s.
I replied to Mr. Diebold that I thought from what I had seen he probably had plenty of competition. And I passed along the e-mail correspondence I had received. Mr. Diebold said thanks much, and added that he had a University of Pennsylvania research librarian looking into it as well.
The term Big Data is so generic that the hunt for its origin was not just an effort to find an early reference to those two words being used together. Instead, the goal was the early use of the term that suggests its present connotation -- that is, not just a lot of data, but different types of data handled in new ways.
The credit, it seemed to me, should go to someone who was aware of the computing context. That is why, in my view, a very intriguing reference, discovered by the Yale researcher Mr. Shapiro, does not qualify.
In 1989, Erik Larson, later the author of bestsellers including "The Devil in the White City" and "In The Garden of Beasts," wrote a piece for Harper's Magazine, which was reprinted in The Washington Post. The article begins with the author wondering how all that junk mail arrives in his mailbox and moves on to the direct-marketing industry. The article includes these two sentences: "The keepers of big data say they do it for the consumer's benefit. But data have a way of being used for purposes other than originally intended."
Prescient indeed. But not, I don't think, a use of the term that suggests an inkling of the technology we call Big Data today.
Since I first looked at how he used the term, I liked Mr. Mashey as the originator of Big Data. In the 1990s, Silicon Graphics was the giant of computer graphics, used for special-effects in Hollywood and for video surveillance by spy agencies. It was a hot company in the Valley that dealt with new kinds of data, and lots of it.
There are no academic papers to support the attribution to Mr. Mashey. Instead, he gave hundreds of talks to small groups in the middle and late 1990s to explain the concept and, of course, pitch Silicon Graphics products. The case for Mr. Mashey is on the Web sites of technical and professional organizations, like Usenix. There, some of his presentation slides from those talks are posted, including "Big Data and the Next Wave of Infrastress" in 1998.
For me, looking for the origins of Big Data has been a matter of personal curiosity, something to get back to someday and write up on a weekend.
When I called Mr. Mashey recently, he said that Big Data is such a simple term, it's not much a claim to fame. His role, if any, he said, was to popularize the term within a portion of the high-tech community in the 1990s. "I was using one label for a range of issues, and I wanted the simplest, shortest phrase to convey that the boundaries of computing keep advancing," said Mr. Mashey, a consultant to tech companies and a trustee of the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif.
At the University of Pennsylvania, Mr. Diebold kept looking into the subject as well. His follow-up inquiries, he said, proved to be "a journey of increasing humility." He has written to two papers since the first one.
His most recent paper concludes: "The term Big Data, which spans computer science and statistics/econometrics, probably originated in the lunch-table conversations at Silicon Graphics in the mid-1990s, in which John Mashey figured prominently."
Tracing the origins of Big Data points to the evolution in the field of etymology, according to Mr. Shapiro. The Yale researcher began his word-hunting nearly 35 years ago, as a student at the Harvard Law School, poring through the library stacks. He was an early user of databases of legal documents, news articles and other documents, in computerized archives.
The Web, Mr. Shapiro said, opens up new linguistic terrain. "What you're seeing is a marriage of structured databases and novel, less structured materials," he said. "It can be a powerful tool to see far more."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: As Luck Would Have It

BYLINE: By JEANNETTE CATSOULIS

 BODY:
Opened on Friday in Manhattan.
Directed by Álex de la Iglesia
In Spanish, with English subtitles
1 hour 35 minutes; not rated 
A toothless examination of marketing and morality, Álex de la Iglesia's ''As Luck Would Have It'' combines lecture, farce and soapy sentiment in a single misshapen package.
Centering on Roberto (the Spanish comedian José Mota), a dejectedly unemployed adman, Randy Feldman's screenplay aims for satire but lands squarely on schlock. Immobilized when a ridiculously contrived accident leaves him supine on a museum floor with an iron rod piercing his skull, Roberto resolves to monetize the bejesus out of his predicament. Around him is a newly unearthed Roman amphitheater -- perfect for the gathering storm of paparazzi -- and ahead lie myriad opportunities to rescue his family from destitution. His body may be trapped, but his brain is working overtime.
A similarly restrictive setup was exploited to perfection in ''The Subway,'' a riveting 1997 episode of ''Homicide: Life on the Street.'' That show made us care about the victim's fate (and not just because he was played by Vincent D'Onofrio); here, there is nothing but chaos. As Roberto summons an agent and orchestrates a media frenzy, paramedics flutter uselessly, and his wife, Luisa (Salma Hayek, oozing affronted dignity), nags him for prioritizing money over family. But though the film's lather of deal-making and product placement firmly indicts tabloid television culture, Mr. de la Iglesia can't decide whether to play it straight or twisted. In the end he chooses both, resulting in a movie too forgettable even for the medium it chastises.

HEADLINE: A Million Jobs at Stake

 BODY:
With enormous struggle, the sluggish economy managed to create 2.2 million jobs last year. But beginning at the end of this month, at least half that amount -- more than a million jobs -- will start to disappear because of a mindless government austerity program that no one in Washington seems able to stop.
From the armed forces to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, every program except for most safety-net benefits is about to be cut by an arbitrary process known as the sequester, instigated by the 2011 Republican rampage against government. Over the next seven months alone, the cuts will reduce defense spending by $55 billion and nondefense discretionary spending by $27 billion. 
The Bipartisan Policy Center, a respected independent group, said at least a million jobs will be lost this year and next because of the slowdown caused by withdrawing so much money from the economy. The Congressional Budget Office says up to 1.4 million jobs are at stake.
This isn't fortune telling; the effect of the coming sequester was already evident in last week's announcement that the economy actually contracted during the final quarter of 2012. Much of the decline was directly due to the 22 percent reduction in spending by the Pentagon and military contractors in anticipation of the sequester's effects.
With the economy teetering on a knife edge, it is clear that this is the worst moment to initiate an indiscriminate budget cut. Government spending at this time can spell the difference between growth and shrinkage. But Republicans are willfully blind to this reality. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Republican, called it a ''Keynesian pipe dream'' last week, saying that only spending cuts will help the economy.
Congressional Republicans seem perfectly serene about allowing the sequester to take effect in a few weeks, so eager to prove they are budget cutters that they are willing to ignore the coming economic storm. ''I think sequester's going to happen,'' said Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma. ''I think people want it to happen.''
But it was never supposed to happen. The sequester was designed to be so dire that both parties would want to find a better way to reach a budget deal. The incentive for Republicans was the huge cut to defense spending, but an ideologically rigid generation of deficit hawks has shouted down the defense hawks, leaving Democrats with no negotiating partner. Republicans have repeatedly voted to replace the defense cuts with more domestic cuts, but the overall impact on the economy would be the same.
Congress should be thinking about ways to accelerate the economy, instead of remaining preoccupied with a short-term deficit. Nonetheless, the coming job losses could be sharply reduced if half or more of the spending cuts were replaced by revenue increases, as President Obama and Congressional Democrats have demanded. That would lower the amount of spending pulled out of the economy to bring down the deficit, replacing the cuts with taxes from the rich or companies with high cash reserves that are less likely to spend it.
The money could be raised by eliminating tax loopholes for energy companies, hedge fund managers and other high-end recipients of federal largess, but Republicans won't even consider the idea. ''The tax issue is finished, over, completed,'' Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, said recently.
In other words, bring on the unemployment. The first jobs to go will be in the defense sector, but the losses will soon spread as contracts to states and cities are cut, education and police grants are cut, and payments to Medicare providers are cut. Even the aid just approved for victims of Hurricane Sandy will fall under the sequester's ax. Americans are about to find out what happens when an entire political party demands deficit reduction at all costs, because those costs will be enormous.

HEADLINE: Airlines, Getting Greener

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Contrary to the assertion in ''Your Biggest Carbon Sin May Be Air Travel'' (news analysis, Sunday Review, Jan. 27), airlines are among the greenest forms of transportation, and we're getting greener. 
The Environmental Protection Agency confirms that United States airlines contribute less than 2 percent of domestic greenhouse gas emissions -- much less than the 25 percent produced by the rest of the transportation industry -- while driving more than 5 percent of gross domestic product and 10 million jobs.
We've achieved an outstanding record by investing billions in fuel-saving technologies. In fact, United States airlines improved fuel efficiency 120 percent since 1978, reducing carbon emissions by 3.3 billion metric tons, savings equivalent to taking 22 million cars off the road every year.
Airlines for America member airlines are part of a worldwide aviation coalition supporting global emissions standards at the International Civil Aviation Organization, intended to bring greater environmental benefit and do so in a way that supports United States businesses and travelers alike.

HEADLINE: Fresh Questions Over a Bank of America Settlement

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
Bank of America has long rued its decision in 2008 to acquire Countrywide Financial, the subprime mortgage giant. To date, the bank has set aside some $40 billion to settle claims of mortgage misconduct that occurred before it acquired the freewheeling lender.
It has been a regular refrain at Bank of America. Last month, Brian T. Moynihan, the bank's chief executive, told Bloomberg television at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that carrying Countrywide was like climbing a mountain with ''a 250-pound backpack.''
But according to new documents filed in state Supreme Court in Manhattan late on Friday, questionable practices by the bank's loan servicing unit have continued well after the Countrywide acquisition; they paint a picture of a bank that continued to put its own interests ahead of investors as it modified troubled mortgages.
The documents were submitted by three Federal Home Loan Banks, in Boston, Chicago and Indianapolis, and Triaxx, an investment vehicle that bought mortgage securities. They contend that a proposed $8.5 billion settlement that Bank of America struck in 2011 to resolve claims over Countrywide's mortgage abuses is far too low and shortchanges thousands of ordinary investors. 
The filing raises new questions about whether a judge will approve the settlement. If it is denied, the bank would face steeper legal obligations.
Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for Bank of America, denied the bank was putting its own interests ahead of investors.
''Modifying mortgages for homeowners in severe distress is critical to the ongoing economic recovery and is encouraged by the government at all levels,'' he said. ''It is difficult to see how federally regulated entities like the Federal Home Loan Banks would seek to attack that practice which helps families to stay in their homes and in no way violated the contracts at issue.''
Among the new details in the filing are those showing that Bank of America failed to buy back troubled mortgages in full once it had lowered the payments and principal on the loans -- an apparent violation of its agreements with investors who bought the securities that held the mortgages.
An analysis of real estate records across the country, the filing said, showed that Bank of America had modified more than 134,000 loans in such securities with a total principal balance of $32 billion.
Even as the bank's loan modifications imposed heavy losses on investors in these securities, the documents show, Bank of America did not reduce the principal on second mortgages it owned on the same properties. The owner of a home equity line of credit is typically required to take a loss before the holder of a first mortgage.
By slashing the amount the borrower owes on the first mortgage, Bank of America increases the potential for full repayment of its home equity line. Bank of America carried $116 billion in home equity loans on its books at the end of the third quarter of 2012.
The filing contains three examples of such modifications, all from 2010, well after the Countrywide purchase.
One example shows investors suffering a loss of more than $300,000 on a $575,000 loan made in 2006. In May 2010, Bank of America reduced the principal owed on a first mortgage to $282,000, but at the same time, real estate records showed, Bank of America's $110,000 home equity line of credit on the property remained intact and unmodified.
Another example indicates that Bank of America kept its $170,000 home equity line intact on a property while modifying the first mortgage held by investors. In that case, the investors took a $395,000 loss.
Bank of America, the filing noted, ''may have engaged in self-dealing and other misconduct, including in connection with modifications to first lien loans held by the Trusts where BofA or Countrywide held second lien loans on the same subject properties.''
Triaxx conducted the analysis by combing through the thousands of loans administered by Bank of America in 530 securities issued by Countrywide from 2005 through 2007. Triaxx then ran the loans through an extensive database it has created of every real estate transaction conducted across the United States during the last decade.
''We're confident that our approach will be successful for investors and that the facts speak for themselves,'' said Thomas Priore, founder of ICP Capital, who is overseeing the Triaxx analysis. ''These are just a few examples of the negligence we found.''
Triaxx's loan analysis has been accepted in another mortgage suit involving claims against Residential Capital, the bankrupt mortgage company that is a unit of Ally Financial. Investor recoveries in that case, being heard in bankruptcy court in Manhattan, will be based in part on Triaxx's work.
In the aftermath of the financial crisis, investors in mortgage securities have had difficulty identifying improper loan modifications and other servicer abuses like those described in this filing. Servicers have kept under wraps the detailed loan data that could point to these kinds of practices and have forced investors to sue to get access to these files.
Included in their court filing was a letter Triaxx and the other investors wrote to Bank of New York Mellon, the trustee that was hired to oversee the Countrywide securities to ensure that investors in them were treated fairly. The investors asked Bank of New York Mellon to explain why it had not pursued claims against Bank of America relating to the modifications on behalf of investors in the Countrywide securities.
Kevin Heine, a spokesman for Bank of New York Mellon said in a statement: ''As trustee, we have complied with our duties under the agreements and will follow any direction the court issues in connection with the letter.''
The letter and the underlying analysis were filed in New York State Supreme Court where Justice Barbara R. Kapnick is overseeing the $8.5 billion settlement reached in June 2011 by Bank of America and a handful of Countrywide mortgage securities holders. That settlement, which covers the same 530 Countrywide securities examined by Triaxx, would generate roughly 2 cents on the dollar to the investors who agreed to it. When the securities were sold, they contained loans totaling some $425 billion.
The investors include the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and Pimco and BlackRock, two large asset management companies. Bank of New York Mellon has also agreed to the settlement, releasing Bank of America from any future claims by investors trying to recoup their losses.
''Despite its knowledge of the Trusts' Loan Modification Claims,'' the letter said, ''the Trustee agreed to release such claims in the Settlement, apparently without any investigation of the extent or merit of such claims, and without any compensation for the Trusts with respect to such claims.''
Mr. Priore said: ''We're mystified how other managers would allow these institutions to ignore their responsibility when it has such a significant impact on investors.''
Trustees have been reluctant to take action against servicers on behalf of the investors in mortgage securities. Such actions would be costly, according to those in the industry, and would reduce profits in what is already a low-margin business. But this has left investors to fend for themselves with little information.

HEADLINE: A Rocky Road to Reforming Immigration

BYLINE: By ALBERT R. HUNT | BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Immigration reform is having a ''Kumbaya'' moment, with support from the White House, a bipartisan contingent in Congress, business and labor.
The Republicans are petrified after their dismal showing among the fastest-growing slices of the electorate, Hispanics and Asians; President Barack Obama wants to reward the loyalty of those voters. Business and labor, as well as many politicians, want to fix a totally dysfunctional system. There are more than 11 million undocumented immigrants, 5 percent of the work force. Many of these people live in fear of discovery, while jobs go unfilled in some areas.
Hold the Champagne. When it comes to immigration laws, the concept is always easier than the reality. Change failed to happen six years ago, despite the push from the high-powered coalition led by President George W. Bush and Senators John McCain and Edward M. Kennedy. The dynamics are more favorable today. Still, the same obstacles persist; the powerful countervailing considerations include these issues: 
A predicament on citizenship There's a fairly broad consensus for ending the illegal status of the undocumented. The White House, Hispanic groups and most Senate supporters insist that any overhaul must lead to a pathway to citizenship.
That approach, however, faces great resistance. Some lawmakers demand that any move toward citizenship must come second to solving the border-security problem, at a minimum. For some, this is a political cover; under the Obama administration, resources for border security have been increased sharply, including the use of drones. And deportations of undocumented immigrants are at a record high.
A border-security trigger is realistic if it includes quantifiable goals, like the number of new Border Patrol agents, the amount of resources allocated and the new technologies utilized. It isn't reasonable if it requires meeting an amorphous standard like ''operational control'' of a border that is always changing.
Hispanic groups assert that the real motive for such demands is to unreasonably stretch out any possibility of granting citizenship.
''There would be a backlash if citizenship is delayed for 15 or 20 years,'' warns Gary M. Segura, a Stanford University professor and co-founder of Latino Decisions, the leading research organization on Hispanic public opinion.
The future of immigration policy Equally contentious is the question of future flows of immigrants. One proposal would link the number of legal immigrants to economic conditions: More would be let in when times are good, fewer in tougher times. That sounds easier than it is. There will be clashes over how great a priority should be given to those with high-tech skills or to agriculture workers or to family reunification. Small businesses will rebel against any costly verification plan.
Most independent studies show that immigration is a decided economic plus, bringing in revenue and increasing productivity and innovation.
Yet the arguments of the populist right may resonate more as the debate heats up. NumbersUSA, a leading anti-immigration group, is reviving charges that an immigration overhaul would drive down wages for middle- and low- income workers. Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state who authored anti-immigration measures in several states and the Republican Party's platform position on the issue last summer, charges that taxpayers would be hit with $2.6 trillion in added food stamps, Medicare and Medicaid, which are government health care programs, and in welfare costs. That estimate is refuted by reliable studies; it still cuts.
The House Republican leadership J. Dennis Hastert, a former Republican speaker of the House, decreed that any bill must command majority support among majority party members. Last month, the House speaker, John A. Boehner, waived the rule twice to pass measures, one avoiding the so-called fiscal cliff and another providing aid to victims of Hurricane Sandy.
The speaker, along with most party leaders, understands his party's serious difficulties with Hispanic voters and fears making matters worse by blocking an overhaul. Two of the most virulent anti-immigration Republicans in the House, Lamar Smith of Texas and Steve King of Iowa, no longer hold important committee chairmanships.
Yet with anti-immigration sentiment still running high among many Republican rank-and-file voters, it's tough to imagine a majority of the party's House members backing a comprehensive bill, even if, as is certain, the Senate goes first. Mr. Boehner's only option might be to let a bill pass primarily with Democratic votes.
To do that, he would need the support of the House majority leader, Eric Cantor, and the whip, Kevin McCarthy; there's no shrewder politician than Mr. McCarthy, who is always attuned to the party's base. He's also from California, where, since Governor Pete Wilson played the anti-immigration card in 1994, the Democrats completely dominate politics.
The lack of a skilled deal maker The successful, if flawed, passage of Mr. Obama's health care measure probably wouldn't have been possible without the savvy hand of Rahm Emanuel, who was the White House chief of staff. Congressional Democrats and some outside advocates see no Emanuel counterpart in the current White House; privately, some say they would like the White House to enlist a special envoy -- perhaps Henry G. Cisneros, former housing secretary and former mayor of San Antonio, Texas, or Tom Daschle, the former Senate majority leader -- to shepherd legislation.
Egos and tensions already are surfacing among supporters of an overhaul; Republicans don't trust the White House, and some Democrats worry that Marco Rubio, the ambitious young Republican senator from Florida, will look for a reason to peel off as he comes under pressure from his party's right wing. There is no senator today who possesses Mr. Kennedy's skill for navigating these shoals.
It's still a slightly better bet that a big immigration bill will be enacted in this Congress. Getting there will be ugly, and the measure will seem to die more than once as it battles these cross-pressures.

HEADLINE: Once BlackBerry Focused, a Campus Widens Its View

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

 BODY:
WATERLOO, Ontario -- The University of Waterloo, in a city that people outside Canada would struggle to find on a map, is one of the world's best technology schools.
BlackBerry, the company formerly called Research in Motion, grew out of a student project there, and for years the school served as a reliable pipeline of stellar engineering talent straight into the nearby offices of the smartphone maker. In 2007, when BlackBerrys still defined smartphones, about 400 students were on paid internships with the company, positions that more often than not led to full-time jobs.
But after years of being a first-choice destination for University of Waterloo graduates and interns, BlackBerry is now a last resort. In its place, American technology giants including Google, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft have more than filled the hiring void. 
Increasingly, graduates are following the lead of Mike Lazaridis, who nearly 30 years ago helped found BlackBerry, and creating start-ups of their own like Pebble, the smartwatch company founded by a University of Waterloo grad, and BufferBox, a parcel delivery system recently acquired by Google.
Because of that, the consequences of the recent layoffs of 5,000 employees at BlackBerry are nearly invisible here in the company's home city or its immediate neighbor, Kitchener.
The local unemployment rate of 6.2 percent in December was stable from a year earlier and well below the national rate of 7.1 percent. Out on the main street in a cafe and whiskey bar called Death Valley's Little Brother that appears to have been dropped in from a fashionable part of Brooklyn, seats are scarce despite prices that could make a New Yorker wince.
Google's logo on a former leather tannery in Kitchener, a relic from the region's past as Canada's shoemaking capital, provides a vivid illustration of the way that, when a company starts to slip, the best talent goes elsewhere. BlackBerry aims to reverse its fortunes with radically new smartphones and equally innovative software that runs them. It introduced the phones to the public last week to strong reviews.
Steven Woods, the director of engineering for Google in Kitchener, said that the search engine company established an operation here about eight years ago and expanded into the tannery building in 2011 as part of a broad plan to absorb foreign talent and sensibilities.
Most of the company's other new operations were put in major metropolitan centers, including New York, London and Tokyo.
''Waterloo is different,'' Mr. Woods said, sitting in a scaled-down version of Google's Silicon Valley office, down to a gourmet, no-charge cafeteria. ''It's got this amazing university which has long been one of our top three recruiting universities for Google as a whole, worldwide,'' said Mr. Woods, who earned a doctorate at Waterloo.
''Waterloo grads do well at Google, they do very well.''
The University of Waterloo did not achieve its exalted status by being venerable. It received its first students, who were initially taught in temporary buildings plopped into a corn field north of town, only in 1957.
Nor did it buy its way to the top. Its alumni, particularly Mr. Lazaridis, the former co-chief executive and current vice chairman of BlackBerry, have been generous, with $121 million in personal donations to date. Mr. Lazaridis, who also donated $150 million to establish an independent school of theoretical physics in Waterloo, developed what became Research in Motion's first product while still an undergraduate student, and dropped out weeks before finishing his studies to found the company in 1984.
But like most universities in Canada, Waterloo is a public institution with relatively low tuition subsidized by Canadian taxpayers. In 2011, the federal and provincial governments provided $243 million, or 42 percent, of its operating budget. Its endowment is only $261 million, a fraction of the $16.5 billion Stanford holds or the $10.3 billion of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, two of America's top engineering universities.
Different approaches, rather than money, have instead enabled it to attract prominent faculty members from around the world as well as Canada's top engineering and computer science students.
Unusually for a college or university in North America, Waterloo does not require its faculty or students to give it any ownership stake in products or inventions they create there. For faculty members, control of that intellectual property can potentially be far more valuable than any university salary.
Engineering and computer science students are required to mix their studies with six work terms for which they are actively sought by employers, including many in Silicon Valley. By the time they graduate after five years, students will have earned $25,000 to $75,000 from their ''co-op program'' work. (Citing confidentiality rules, the university declined to say how many students are currently on work terms at BlackBerry.)
To the north of its campus, the university also runs an office park, leasing space to, among others, BlackBerry, Cisco, AGFA, Sybase and Open Text, another company that emerged from its classrooms and labs.
While Google uses co-op positions as a kind of tryout for students, co-op positions can also persuade students that various companies are not for them. ''The five different jobs of my co-op term, each of them convinced me that I didn't want to do them as a career,'' said Eric Migicovsky.
For his final co-op term, Mr. Migicovsky ran his own business, partly as a school project, which has since become Pebble Technology, a start-up in California that created a programmable wristwatch that displays data from iPhones and phones using the Android operating system.
None of those five jobs involved BlackBerry.
''It never really came up, I guess,'' said Mr. Migicovsky, who graduated in 2009.
Like Mr. Migicovsky, Ivan Lukianchuk decided he would rather try to start a company than be an employee. Unlike Mr. Migicovsky he did spent a term at Research in Motion in 2008 when the company was still riding high. ''I always thought early on I wanted to work at some big cool company, like RIM was at the time,'' Mr. Lukianchuk said. ''RIM was my first taste of a big corporate experience. It was horrible, it was probably the worst co-op job I had.''
Mr. Lukianchuk started an online gaming site offering cash prizes called Will Pwn 4 Food through Communitech, a start-up group whose founders included Jim Balsillie, the other former co-chief of RIM. Mr. Lukianchuk said he was hoping for BlackBerry's comeback despite his experience: ''I had to chase my boss to get work. Otherwise, they said, 'Look busy.' But you can only surf the Internet for so long.''

HIGHLIGHT: A legal review of the United States' arsenal of cyberweapons; Germany weighs bailing out Cyprus; starting a business in France; and the first weekend of the Six Nations rugby tournament has wrapped up. 

 BODY:
 NEWS A secret legal review on the use of the United States' growing arsenal of cyberweapons has concluded that President Barack Obama has the broad power to order a pre-emptive strike if the United States detects credible evidence of a major digital attack looming from abroad, according to officials involved in the review. David E. Sanger and Thom Shanker report from Washington. 
As a Russian loan runs out and Cyprus seeks aid, Germany finds itself in a fierce debate over whether to help bail out the island nation. Liz Alderman reports from Paris.
Accounts from captives held in the siege of a Saharan gas plant in Algeria last month reveal that militants sought to orchestrate a spectacular, deadly explosion. Adam Nossiter reports from Tiguentourine, Algeria, and Nicholas Kulish from Berlin.
A sometimes frustrated figure who prized her role as a team player, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's instincts were often more activist than those of a White House that has kept a tight grip on foreign policy. Michael R. Gordon and Mark Landler report from Washington.
Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of Spain is pledging to make public this week his tax returns and financial assets to refute what he described over the weekend as ''apocryphal'' documents showing that he and other senior conservative politicians had received payouts from a secret account maintained by their party. Raphael Minder reports from Madrid.
In the aftermath of the financial crash, Britain's politicians acknowledged that they had put too much faith in a bloated financial sector that plunged the country into crisis. But rebalancing the skills of the British labor force may require a shift that is as much social and cultural as it is economic. Stephen Castle reports from North Shields, England.
In France, companies have their wings clipped by onerous social charges paid to the government and severance packages that make companies think twice before hiring and firing-- but some entrepreneurs are still figuring out ways to succeed. Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura reports from Paris.
 ARTS With wit and ingenuity, the British graphic designer David Pearson is rekindling interest in paperbacks. Alice Rawsthorn reviews from London.

HEADLINE: Carlyle's Investment Ideas, by Podcast

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: In its latest foray into new media, the private equity firm Carlyle Group releases a podcast in which William E. Conway Jr., the co-founder and co-chief executive, discusses the investment outlook for the coming year. 

 BODY:
The Carlyle Group is making its debut on iTunes.
No, it's not a new album from Christopher W. Ullman, the firm's global head of communications and in-house whistler. 
Rather, the private equity firm has released a podcast in which William E. Conway Jr., Carlyle's co-founder and co-chief executive, discusses the investment outlook for the coming year.
The podcast, the first of what promises to be a monthly series of commentary from Carlyle executives, is the latest foray into new media for Carlyle, which began posting on Twitter last year. A big rival, the Blackstone Group, also uses Twitter. Another buyout firm, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, has an iPad app.
In the Carlyle podcast, Mr. Conway gives his thoughts on Europe, China and interest rates in the United States, prompted by questions from Mr. Ullman. He discusses how Carlyle's ideas differ from those of other investors.
"I would say that the herd is usually not a good place to invest," Mr. Conway says. "But I would not classify Carlyle as a contrarian investor."
In China, Carlyle is trying to take advantage of the rise of a consumer class, he says, while in Europe, the focus is on an improving economic situation.
"Our data right now is telling us the European economy in general has begun to bottom," Mr. Conway says.
He also discusses why Carlyle likes to invest in the United States, and he warns of a coming rise in interest rates. "What historically was considered to be the least risky investments - that is, 10-year government debt of the United States or Germany or England - I think has become some of the riskiest investments," he says.
Mr. Conway also alludes to what is known as a dividend recapitalization, the practice in the private equity industry of having a portfolio company borrow in order to pay its owners.
Portfolio companies can take advantage of low interest rates "by paying dividends to their stockholders," Mr. Conway says. "We have done that in the case of a number of our United States portfolio companies. Now, I would say also that I do not expect that this will continue forever."

HEADLINE: Osborne Promises More Regulatory Power to Split Up British Banks

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: British regulators will have the power to split up banks that fail to "ring fence," or separate, risky trading activity from retail banking, George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, said in a speech on Monday. 

 BODY:
LONDON - British regulators will have the power to split up banks that fail to separate risky trading activity from retail banking, George Osborne, the country's chancellor of the Exchequer, said on Monday.
As part of an overhaul of bank operations, Mr. Osborne said regulators would be able to forcibly separate firms that failed to maintain a division between their retail banking and investment banking units.
The so-called ring-fencing of consumer deposits from risky trading activity is an effort to reduce the exposure to the wider British economy if one of the country's largest banks collapses. 
 Many of Britain's largest banks have been engulfed in a series of scandals, and Mr. Osborne said the public was right to be angry over abuses in the country's financial industry.
The spotlight is on the Royal Bank of Scotland, which is expected to announce as early as this week a settlement over its involvement in the manipulation of a benchmark rate.
The bank, in which the government holds an 82 percent stake after providing a bailout, is said to be facing a fine of more than $650 million and a guilty plea by an Asian subsidiary related to the manipulation of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor.
Mr. Osborne said troubling behavior by those in Britain's financial industry was unacceptable.
"Irresponsible behavior was rewarded, failure was bailed out, and the innocent - people who have nothing whatsoever to do with the banks - suffered," Mr. Osborne said in a speech in Bournemouth, on the south coast of England.
During the recent financial crisis, a number of British banks, including the Lloyds Banking Group and Northern Rock, received multibillion-dollar bailouts after they ran into trouble because of exposure to risky assets.
To reaffirm the separation between retail and investment banking divisions, Mr. Osborne said on Monday that banks would have to appoint different senior managers to oversee each division. The new powers to forcibly split up banks are in response to fears that firms will try to find ways around dividing their retail and investment banking operations.
"No more rewards for failure. No more 'too big to fail.' No more taxpayers forking out for the mistakes of others," Mr. Osborne said.
Critics of the planned changes, however, say the separation of banks' operations will make it harder for them to raise capital and provide financial support to British companies.
"This will create uncertainty for investors, making it more difficult for banks to raise capital, which will ultimately mean that banks will have less money to lend to businesses," Anthony Browne, chief executive of the British Bankers' Association, a trade body criticized for its role in the Libor scandal, said in a statement.
The changes, which form part of new banking legislation that was being submitted to Parliament on Monday, mirror similar efforts in the United States and Europe to reduce the effect of banks' risky trading operations on the broader economy. The so-called Volcker Rule, the part of the Dodd-Frank Act that prohibits banks from making risky bets with their money, is also nearing regulatory approval in the United States.
In Britain, authorities are going a step further by dividing the Financial Services Authority, the country's financial regulator, into two units, as part of the widespread reforms.
In April, oversight of the country's banks will be returned to the Bank of England, the central bank, while a new consumer protection agency will monitor market abuse.
The changes come after a series of recent settlements by British banks over illegal activity.
HSBC and Standard Chartered agreed to pay a combined fine of more than $2 billion to American authorities related to money laundering allegations. Barclays reached a $450 million settlement with United States and British regulators in June related to the manipulation of Libor. And many of Britain's largest banks have been required to pay in total billions of dollars of penalties after inappropriately selling loan insurance to customers.
"Our country has paid a higher price than any other major economy for what went so badly wrong in our banking system," Mr. Osborne said on Monday.

HEADLINE: Despite Reorganizations, Scant Signs of Change in Airline Industry

BYLINE: STEPHEN J. LUBBEN


HIGHLIGHT: Major airlines have followed one of two main paths in their reorganization cases. But they never seem to use Chapter 11 to consider a new business model. 

 BODY:
Given the many airline Chapter 11 cases in this country, you might expect that there would be some room for innovation. You would be wrong.
Not long after the bankruptcy code was enacted in 1978, major airlines have filed for bankruptcy, beginning with classic cases like Eastern Airlines and Pan Am. Those two did not survive, giving Chapter 11 something of a bad name in its first decade or so. 
But more recently, major airlines have followed one of two main paths in their reorganization cases. First, some sell themselves to another airline. TWA's last Chapter 11 case, when it sold its assets under section 363 of the bankruptcy code to American, is a good example. Other arguable examples include Northwest and the second USAir case.
The other path is to reorganize as a stand-alone entity. Under this approach, the airline imposes some pain on shareholders, employees and creditors, but otherwise comes out the other side as essentially the same company as it was before bankruptcy.
Airlines never seem to use Chapter 11 to consider a new business model. Among the large domestic, full-service airlines, we have Delta, United, US Airways and American. I have flown most of them in the last few years, and what seems to distinguish American from the rest is the age of the planes.
Presumably that specific point will change as a result of the current American Airlines bankruptcy case.
Otherwise, they all offer cramped seating (especially in the back), marginal food for movie theater prices and service that all too often resembles that of the Post Office. 
In short, all the major airlines compete on price. None really seems to compete on service, quality or design of the product. Airline travel is basically a commodity.
This is true to some degree with many industries, of course.
The key difference with domestic airlines is that they find themselves in bankruptcy so often - much like the railroads of an earlier age, they have high fixed costs and are highly sensitive to economic conditions. Yet despite this, they rarely seem to use Chapter 11 as an opportunity to try something new, even though a reorganization presents an ideal time to, well reorganize.
The question remains whether Chapter 11 is unable to reinvent a business, or whether the parties to the case simply lack the will to take such a step.

HEADLINE: U.S. Accuses S. & P. of Fraud in Suit on Loan Bundles

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and MARY WILLIAMS WALSH


HIGHLIGHT: The Justice Department has filed civil fraud charges in federal court in Los Angeles against Standard &#038; Poor's over its ratings of mortgage-related securities. 

 BODY:
The Justice Department filed civil fraud charges late on Monday against the nation's largest credit-ratings agency, Standard & Poor's, accusing the firm of inflating the ratings of mortgage investments and setting them up for a crash when the financial crisis struck.
The suit, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, is the first significant federal action against the ratings industry, which during the boom years reaped record profits as it bestowed gilt-edged ratings on complex bundles of home loans that quickly went sour. The high ratings made many investments appear safer than they actually were, and are now seen as having contributed to a crisis that brought the financial system and the broader economy to its knees.
More than a dozen state prosecutors are expected to join the federal suit, and the New York attorney general is preparing a separate action. The Securities and Exchange Commission has also been investigating possible wrongdoing at S.& P.
 From September 2004 through October 2007, S.&P. "knowingly and with the intent to defraud, devised, participated in, and executed a scheme to defraud investors" in certain mortgage-related securities, according to the suit filed against the agency and its parent company, McGraw-Hill Companies. S.&P. also falsely represented that its ratings "were objective, independent, uninfluenced by any conflicts of interest," the suit said. 
S.& P., first contacted by federal enforcement officials three years ago, said in a statement Monday in anticipation of the suit that it had acted in good faith in issuing the ratings.
"A D.O.J. lawsuit would be entirely without factual or legal merit," it said, adding that its competitors had given exactly the same ratings to all the securities it believed to be in question.
Settlement talks between S.& P. and the Justice Department broke down in the last two weeks after prosecutors sought a penalty in excess of $1 billion and insisted that the company admit wrongdoing, several people with knowledge of the talks said. That amount would wipe out the profits of McGraw-Hill for an entire year. S.& P. had proposed a settlement of around $100 million, the people said.
S.& P. also sought a deal that would allow it to neither admit nor deny guilt; the government pressed for an admission of guilt to at least one count of fraud, said the people. S.& P. told prosecutors it could not admit guilt without exposing itself to liability in a multitude of civil cases.
It was unclear whether state and federal authorities were looking at the other two major ratings agencies, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch.
A spokesman for Moody's declined to comment. A spokesman for Fitch, Daniel J. Noonan, said the agency could not comment on an action that appeared to focus on Standard & Poor's, but added, "we have no reason to believe Fitch is a target of any such action."
The case against S.& P. focuses on about 40 collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.'s, an exotic type of security made up of bundles of mortgage bonds, which in turn were composed of individual home loans. The securities were created at the height of the housing boom. S.& P. was paid fees of about $13 million for rating them.
Prosecutors have uncovered troves of e-mails written by S.& P. employees, some of them expressing strong concern about the way such securities were being rated. The firm gave the government more than 20 million pages of e-mails as part of its investigation, the people with knowledge of the process said.
Since the financial crisis in 2008, the ratings agencies' business practices have been widely criticized and questions have been raised as to whether independent analysis was corrupted by Wall Street's push for profits.
A Senate investigation made public in 2010 found that S.& P. and Moody's used inaccurate rating models from 2004 to 2007 that failed to predict how high-risk mortgages would perform; allowed competitive pressures to affect their ratings; and failed to reassess past ratings after improving their models in 2006.
The companies failed to assign adequate staff to examine exotic investments, and failed to take mortgage fraud, lax underwriting and "unsustainable home price appreciation" into account in their models, the inquiry found.
"Rating agencies continue to create an even bigger monster - the C.D.O. market," one S.& P. employee wrote in an internal e-mail in December 2006. "Let's hope we are all wealthy and retired by the time this house of card falters."
Another S.& P. employee wrote in an instant message the next April, reproduced in the complaint: "We rate every deal. It could be structured by cows and we would rate it."
The three major ratings agencies are typically paid by the issuers of the securities they rate - in this case, the banks that had packaged the mortgage-backed securities and wanted to market them. The investors were not involved in the process but depended on the rating agencies' assessments.
Although the three agencies tend to track one another, each has its own statistical methods for assessing the likelihood that C.D.O.s and residential mortgage-backed securities, or R.M.B.S., will default. That has led to speculation that S.& P. analysts knew their method yielded unrealistic ratings, but issued the ratings anyway.
"As S.&P. knew, contrary to its representations to the public, S.&P.'s desire for increased revenue and market share in the RMBS and CDO ratings markets, and its resulting desire to maintain and enhance its relationships with issuers that drove its ratings business, improperly influenced S.&P. to downplay and disregard the true extent of the credit risks," the suit says.
In its statement on Monday, S.& P. said it had begun stress-testing the mortgage-backed securities it rated as early as 2005, trying to see how they would perform in a severe market downturn. S.& P. said it had also sent out early warning signals, downgrading hundreds of mortgage-backed securities, starting in 2006. Nor was it the only one to have underestimated the coming crisis, it said - even the Federal Reserve's open market committee believed that any problems within the housing sector could be contained.
The Justice Department, the company said, "would be wrong in contending that S.& P. ratings were motivated by commercial considerations and not issued in good faith."
For many years, the ratings agencies have defended themselves successfully in civil litigation by saying their ratings were independent opinions, protected by the First Amendment, which guarantees the right to free speech. Developments in the wake of the financial crisis have raised questions about the agencies' independence however. For example, one federal judge, Shira A. Scheindlin, ruled in 2009 that the First Amendment did not apply in a lawsuit over ratings issued by S.& P. and Moody's, because the mortgage-backed securities at issue had not been offered to the public at large. Judge Scheindlin also agreed with the plaintiffs, who argued the ratings were not opinions, but misrepresentations, possibly the result of fraud or negligence.
The federal action will be the first time a credit-rating agency has been charged under a 1989 law intended to protect taxpayers from frauds involving federally insured financial institutions, which since the financial crisis has been used against a number of federally insured banks, including Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Citigroup.
The government is taking a novel approach by accusing S.& P. of defrauding a federally insured institution and therefore injuring the taxpayer.
Among others, the compliant includes the demise of Wescorp, a federally insured credit union in Los Angeles that went bankrupt after investing in mortgage securities rated by S.& P. Wescorp is included as one example of the contended fraud, and as a way to bring the case in California. The suit was filed in Federal District Court for the Central District of California.

HEADLINE: Venture Capital's Sluggish Performance

BYLINE: ROBERT CYRAN


HIGHLIGHT: Investors need to strip the venture capital industry of its mystique and demand greater transparency and a better deal, the author contends. 

 BODY:
American venture capital needs a reboot. A decade of insufficient shrinkage hasn't fixed wimpy performance. At 6.1 percent annually over 10 years to September, according to Cambridge Associates and the National Venture Capital Association, V.C. fund returns undershoot boring stock indexes like the Nasdaq and the Russell 2000. 
Last year, V.C. outfits raised $20.6 billion of new committed funds, according to the National Venture Capital Association and Thomson Reuters. That's about 10 percent more than in 2011. Unfortunately, distributions from funds have lagged the cash put in since 1999. Last year's tally is also more than five times the average amount raised annually by V.C. firms in the decade leading up to the dot-com bubble. The bust happened, but the venture capitalists' appetites never took the same dive.
In addition, it has become much cheaper for start-ups to become established in areas like Internet services and software. Add the ability to look beyond V.C. firms for funds, and there's a mismatch between the supply of capital and upstart companies' need for it.
That said, performance is highly dispersed, and a few well-connected, marquee V.C. firms like Andreessen Horowitz still do very well. Founded in 2009, the firm has had several lucrative exits thanks to hits like Nicira, Groupon and Zynga. Its first fund is on track to return well over twice its initial capital. Most rivals, however, fall far short of that benchmark. The Kauffman Foundation said in a paper last year that half the V.C. funds in its portfolio failed even to return the capital investors put in.
V.C. firms face the same temptations that afflict hedge funds and private equity. If investors are willing, management fees can be attractive even if that means backing less-than-stellar performers. Rather than closing shop, they can persist for years. The giant California Public Employees' Retirement System lists 24 funds that started before the turn of the millennium and have not yet wound down, despite the majority providing negative returns to investors.
Calpers has now reduced its holding in V.C. firms to 1 percent of its $234 billion of assets as of last June. And the Kaufman Foundation's paper is something of a call to arms. Yet V.C. firms still seem to have little trouble raising new money. A few big names aside, the least investors need to do is strip the industry of its mystique and demand greater transparency and a better deal.

HEADLINE: Pneumonia Strain Has Spread

BYLINE: NICHOLAS BAKALAR


HIGHLIGHT: Strains of a pneumonia that is dangerous to hospitalized older patients and resistant to a class of antibiotics are appearing across the nation. 

 BODY:
Infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae is a serious danger to older hospitalized patients, with an estimated mortality rate as high as 40 percent. It has generally been treated with broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotics. Another class of antibiotics, carbapenems, is used as an antibiotic of last resort for the most persistent infections. 
But now carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella strains, or CRKP, are appearing across the nation, even outside of health care facilities.
A study in the March issue of Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology reports that the proportion of Klebsiella cases resistant to cephalosporins increased to 11.6 percent in 2010 from 5.3 percent in 1999. The proportion resistant to carbapenems increased to 4.5 percent in 2010 from less than 0.1 percent in 2002.
The senior author, Ramanan Laxminarayan, a researcher at the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy in Washington, D.C., compared the problem to that of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
"There's a similarity to MRSA, which prior to the early 2000s was not seen in the community, and it was very surprising when it showed up," he said. "But there had already been new drug developments for MRSA. The problem with CRKP is that we don't have any new drugs. This could wind up being worse than MRSA."

HEADLINE: Home With the Flu? 20 Years of the Family Medical Leave Act

BYLINE: KJ DELL'ANTONIA


HIGHLIGHT: Parents following those public service announcements to keep themselves and kids at home if they have the flu can find themselves without a job when they return. 

 BODY:
Tuesday is the 20th anniversary of the Family and Medical Leave Act. During those 20 years, it has been used more than 100 million times by employees caring for new babies, tending sick parents and spouses, and coping with illness.
Nearly every reader of this blog has experienced, or can imagine, a moment when going to work is impossible. Anything from a bout of norovirus to cancer treatment and car accidents can leave us scrambling, and any one of us, at any moment, could get a phone call that changes our relationship to work and family momentarily or for months to come. Readers in many professions can feel confident that if the school nurse calls this afternoon, they can find a way to collect a sick child without also finding themselves out of work. Many people don't have that confidence. 
Half the work force isn't covered by the F.M.L.A., because the employees work part time or their employer has fewer than 50 workers. Every organization that lobbies on behalf of those workers has collected many stories of employees told to come to work now, or don't ever come back, when calling to explain an absence due to surgery or a vomiting child, or to ask permission to go to the doctor. In 2008, researchers at the University of Chicago found that 17 percent of respondents to a national survey regarding sick-leave policiessaid that they had lost a job, or been told that they would lose a job, if they took time off for personal or family illness. And leaves taken under the F.M.L.A. are unpaid (unless an employer has a different policy). Employees who are eligible for leave may not be able to afford to take it.
Organizations like the National Partnership for Women and Families and Family Values @ Work continue to push for expansion of the laws protecting working parents and their families. An election eve survey commissioned by the N.P.W.F. found bipartisan support for laws ensuring workers the right to earn paid sick days and "creating a system of family and medical leave insurance": 86 percent of respondents who supported both candidates considered it important, and 63 percent called it "very important."

"We have huge changes in the the work force," Ellen Bravo, president of Family Values @ Work, said. "We don't have many families with wives at home full time to take care of all the people who need care. Just as workplaces adjusted to the fact that people have heart attacks and gall bladder surgeries, we need to to adjust to the fact that people have babies and folks who are dying and need care."
Right now, she told me, the momentum lies with the states and local communities pushing for something as simple as mandated paid sick leaves. Only Connecticut and cities like San Francisco, Washington, D.C., Milwaukee, Seattleand Long Beach, Calif., have passed laws requiring paid sick leave for some employees. Philadelphia, New York, Portland, Ore.,Marylandand Massachusettsare considering similar legislation. But paid sick days alone don't expand the F.M.L.A.'s impact to everyone who needs it. Finding politically viable and economically feasible ways to help working parents ensure that every family crisis isn't also a financial crisis is not simple.
"No one should have to choose between the job they need and the family they love," Ms. Bravo said. "The importance of the F.M.L.A. was that it established that principle. People should be able to be what they want to be: responsible employees and responsible family members." The F.M.L.A. and its offshoots are intended to give everyone the best chance they can have at doing both.

HEADLINE: Voting In and Out Monopoly Game's Faux Riche

BYLINE: VIJAI SINGH


HIGHLIGHT: Tuesday is the deadline to take part in online voting to determine which existing piece used in the board game will disappear forever, and which of five candidates will replace it. 

 BODY:
Despite the onslaught of high-tech games played on smartphones, tablets and giant flat-screen televisions, some old-fashioned board games played at a more methodical pace endure. Of those, perhaps the most popular is Monopoly, which was born 78 years ago.
And even though there are any number of variations -- a NASA edition, a New York Yankees edition, a Star Wars edition -- the Monopoly of Park Place, Boardwalk and the Community Chest has remained largely unchanged. 
 Until now. 
Hasbro, the company that manufactures Monopoly, has decided that the journey around the board for one of the eight classic tokens will end soon. And, in a modern twist, it has taken to social media to seek inputfrom the public. So after Tuesday, when voting closes, the thimble, car, boot, Scottie dog, battleship, hat, iron or wheelbarrow will go to jail, forever, and a new token will take its place.
Of course, the company is not leaving it entirely up to the public to decide such an important part of a classic game. Hasbro came up with a list of potential replacements, conducted an internal vote and narrowed the field to five finalists: a robot, diamond ring, cat, helicopter and guitar. The classic token with the fewest number of votes will be replaced by the new token with the highest number. The winner is to be announced on Wednesday.
As of Monday afternoon, the boot and the iron had the fewest votes and were most in danger of being replaced. Hasbro would not say which of the new pieces had the most votes. 
 "The token is key to the game and key for all of our fans,'' said Jonathan Berkowitz, the vice president for marketing at Hasbro Gaming, in a telephone interview from the company's headquarters in Pawtucket, R.I. "You ask anyone what their favorite Monopoly token is and most people have an answer. There's always a reason." 
The creation of Monopoly is widely attributed to Charles Darrow, an unemployed heating contractor from Philadelphia, though there were earlier versions of a similar game. Darrow's 1933 version named the properties after places in Atlantic City, which experienced a boom in the 1920s, before the Depression. 
 "Because it was a game and because games are entertaining and they're fun, Atlantic City seemed to be the perfect partner to use for the property names," said Philip E. Orbanes, the president of Winning Moves Games Inc., a game manufacturer. Mr. Orbanes has also written four books about Monopoly and has been a chief judge at the United States and world Monopoly championships. 
In 1935, Parker Brothers negotiated and signed a contract in the Flatiron Building in Manhattan to acquire Monopoly from Darrow, Mr. Orbanes said. (Parker Brothers is now owned by Hasbro.)
"J.P. Morgan, the legendary financier, was the inspiration in 1936 for the styling of the little Monopoly man who today we call Mr. Monopoly," he added.
Monopoly rose in popularity during the Depression. "Twenty-five percent of the work force was unemployed," Mr. Orbanes said, "so playing Monopoly was an opportunity to vicariously feel rich." 
The game has remained essentially unchanged, which some say is part of its continued success. "When I played Monopoly as a kid," Mr. Berkowitz, the Habro executive, said, "it's exactly the same as when I play it now with my kids, and the same is true of my parents and that's very, very rare, and I think that's one of the great things about the brand." 
Mr. Orbanes said, "The main appeal of the game is not necessarily the charming equipment, but rather it's the dynamic that takes place when you and I and our friends sit around the table and we start negotiating, deal-making, bantering, making decisions, seeing the results of the decisions we make.''

HEADLINE: Avenue Capital Prepares New Fund for Europe

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: The hedge fund run by Marc Lasry is in the process of raising a $500 million fund to invest in distressed European assets, signaling the firm's continued belief in a long-term recovery for the region. 

 BODY:
The Avenue Capital Group, the hedge fund run by Marc Lasry, is increasing its bet on Europe.
The firm is in the process of raising a $500 million fund to invest in distressed European assets, according to a person familiar with the matter. The new pool of capital, along with the $2.78 billion raised last year for another European-focused fund, signals Avenue's continued belief in a long-term recovery for the region. 
Europe has started to look more attractive in recent months, following bold moves by the European Central Bank last year that have helped lower borrowing costs for governments. At the same time, banks are under pressure from regulators to offload assets, creating possible opportunities for investors.
Avenue Capital, which is based in New York with offices in London and Munich, had about $3.9 billion allocated to European investments at the end of last year, according to the firm's Web site. The European strategy, overseen by Richard P. Furst, a senior portfolio manager, includes investments in distressed debt and other securities considered undervalued. The new fund in particular will focus on private equity and direct lending in Europe, the person familiar with the matter said.
Avenue is making a "three- to five-year bet" on Europe, Mr. Lasry said in an interview with The New York Times in July. Overall, Avenue had about $12 billion under management at the end of last year.
While European economies still face significant challenges, market experts are seeing signs of improvement. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, said he expected "positive contagion" to lift financial markets.
In a podcast released on Monday, William E. Conway Jr., co-chief executive of the Carlyle Group, also expressed optimism. "Our data right now is telling us the European economy in general has begun to bottom," he said.
A spokesman for Avenue, Todd Fogarty, declined to comment.

HEADLINE: Republicans Versus Consumers

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Once again, the G.O.P. is trying to weaken the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 

 BODY:
On Friday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell sent a letter to President Obama, cosigned by 42 other Senators, insisting on "structural changes" to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau - a government agency created after the Great Recession to stop private mortgage lenders, money transfer agencies, credit card companies and the like from ruining ordinary Americans in pursuit of ever-higher profits. Unless those changes are made, Mr. McConnell said, the Senate by golly is not going to approve the appointment of a director. 
Mr. McConnell wants the bureau to have a board rather than a director like some other (mostly toothless) agencies; he wants its budget to come under Congressional approval; and to devise some form of check to make sure that the bureau's decisions do not threaten the health of the American banking system. He claims these changes are necessary "to ensure accountability and transparency."

The "no confirmation" gambit is nothing new. In 2010, Republicans made clear that they would block the president's first pick to lead the bureau, Elizabeth Warren. The following year they blocked his second pick, Richard Cordray. Tired of playing that game, Mr. Obama finally "recess appointed" Mr. Cordray in January of 2012, but the legal legitimacy of that move is now in doubt. (Congress had not formally adjourned and was thus technically not in recess. It was holding pro-forma sessions lasting a few minutes each day, a non-recess recess organized specifically to prevent Mr. Obama from making appointments).
All along, it's been quite obvious that Republicans aren't interested in improving the bureau; they're interested in weakening it. They want to shrink it down to the size where they can drown it in the bathtub.
The point of a big, robust bureau is to inculcate the idea that consumer protection is central to bank safety and soundness. It is this overarching idea that Republicans (and bankers) hate. They want safety and soundness to be defined as whatever brings the most profit to a financial institution - even though precisely that approach fomented the excesses that led to the crisis of 2008.
Here are just a few of the consumer bureau's accomplishments:

        
It refunded $425 Million to consumers subjected to deceptive practices.

        
It issued several new mortgage rules, including one requiring lenders to make sure that prospective buyers can actually repay their mortgages, and another requiring lenders to provide applicants with free copies of all appraisals.

        
It created a new category of loans called "qualified mortgages" that cannot include dangerous features like interest-only payments or negative amortization.
Generally speaking, the Times editorial board has felt that the bureau's rules don't go far enough, but at least it's moving in the right direction.

HEADLINE: Arlene C. Ackerman, 66, Superintendent

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Arlene C. Ackerman, who won national accolades for improving student performance as a schools superintendent in all three cities that hired her -- Washington, San Francisco and Philadelphia -- even as her bulldozer management style rankled union leaders and politicians, died on Saturday in Albuquerque. She was 66. The cause was pancreatic cancer, said the Rev. Kevin Johnson, a friend. She lived in Albuquerque.
Dr. Ackerman called herself ''a warrior for children.'' She fought to improve the performance of disadvantaged students by allocating more resources and attention to lower-performing schools, and by replacing the worst with new ones, often charter schools. In 2010 she won the Richard R. Green Award, given by the Council of Great City Schools to the nation's top urban school leader. 
Arne Duncan, the federal education secretary, said in a statement after her death that he had learned from Dr. Ackerman during his years as superintendent of the Chicago schools.
Dr. Ackerman improved students' test scores, including those in the most severely underperforming schools, in each of the three cities in which she presided. But in each city disagreements with elected school overseers prompted her to leave before her contract expired. Many attributed this to arrogance and an autocratic style; some called her Queen Arlene.
In San Francisco, ''she was unwilling to listen to different points of view and not able to work with the entire Board of Education,'' Mark Sanchez, its president, said in an interview with The Philadelphia Inquirer in 2008.
Dr. Ackerman countered that she was unwilling to play politics. ''Is it a crime to stand up for children instead of stooping down into the political sandbox and selling our children for a politician's campaign victory?'' she said to The Inquirer.
When she became superintendent in Washington in 1998, Dr. Ackerman dismissed 30 principals and 600 administrative staff members in her first three months. When she took over in San Francisco in 2000, she said, she was appalled by financial shenanigans in the district's facilities division and called in the police and the F.B.I. She recovered $50 million in settlements from companies defrauding the schools.
Her first step in Philadelphia was to create a five-year blueprint that called for allocating more resources to needier schools and expansion of school choice. Three years of gains in test scores ensued.
Arlene Cassandra Randle was born in St. Louis on Jan. 10, 1947, the first of five children of a Protestant minister and a teacher. For Arlene, who was black, race was a constant consideration: after attending an all-black elementary school, she was one of only 50 black students in a 3,000-student high school. Dr. Ackerman recalled an episode in which a white girl lied in accusing her of threatening her with a knife. An assistant principal threatened to expel her, but her father, outraged, straightened things out.
When she was chosen for the National Honor Society, the white student who was to escort her into the induction ceremony refused. She entered alone.
Dr. Ackerman earned an undergraduate degree in elementary education from what is now Harris-Stowe State University, a historically black college in St. Louis. She earned master's degrees from Washington University and Harvard and a doctorate from Harvard, all in education. She taught elementary and middle school in a St. Louis suburb, rising to middle school principal and school district administrator.
In 1992, she was recruited to be an administrator in the Seattle school system. She went to Washington in 1997 as an assistant to the chief schools executive for the District of Columbia and became superintendent the next year. She was praised for working with parents and criticized for clashing with politicians.
In 2000, Dr. Ackerman was the first woman to be appointed superintendent of the San Francisco schools. In 2004 and 2005 San Francisco had the highest achievement of any urban school system in California. In 2005 the city was a finalist for the Broad Prize for Urban Education, given annually to the best urban school district in the country.
From 2006 to 2008, Dr. Ackerman taught at Teachers College, Columbia University. She was superintendent in Philadelphia from 2008 to 2011. When she left, some criticized her severance package of $905,000 at a time when the schools were struggling. The criticism grew after she applied for unemployment.
Dr. Ackerman's two marriages ended in divorce. She is survived by her sons, Anthony and Matthew Antognoli; four granddaughters; and several brothers and sisters.
For all her political battles, Dr. Ackerman remained at heart a teacher. Once a week, she escaped her superintendent duties to read to kindergartners.

HEADLINE: Europeans Await Report On Bus Blast In Bulgaria

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH and MATTHEW BRUNWASSER

 BODY:
SOFIA, Bulgaria -- A meeting of top government officials and security personnel of this small Balkan country on Tuesday could have wide-reaching repercussions for Europe's uneasy détente with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. Expectations are rising that Bulgarian officials will confirm a link between Hezbollah and the suicide bombing in July 2012 that killed five Israeli tourists and a Bulgarian bus driver and wounded dozens of others in Burgas on the Black Sea coast.
Experts say a determination that Hezbollah was involved would force the European Union to reconsider whether to designate the group a terrorist organization, as the United States and Israel have urged.
The European calculation all along has been that whatever its activities in the Middle East, Hezbollah does not pose a threat on the Continent. Thousands of Hezbollah members and supporters operate in Europe essentially unrestricted, raising money that is funneled back to the group in Lebanon. 
Changing the designation to a terrorist entity raises the prospect of unsettling questions for Europe -- how to deal with those supporters, for example -- and the sort of confrontation governments have sought to avoid.
''There's the overall fear if we're too noisy about this, Hezbollah might strike again, and it might not be Israeli tourists this time,'' said Sylke Tempel, editor in chief of the German foreign affairs magazine Internationale Politik.
The significance of their determination has put pressure on Bulgarian officials, who would like to maintain strong ties with both Israel and the United States, which call Hezbollah a terrorist organization, and European allies like France and Germany, which do not. Bulgarian officials have maintained a studied silence for more than six months since the attack.
''They have to name a name and say who is behind the attack,'' said Dimitar Bechev, head of the Sofia office of the European Council on Foreign Relations. ''At the same time, they don't want to go solo. Whatever they say has implications not just for Bulgaria but for the E.U. as a whole.''
A spokesman for the president's office, Veselin Ninov, said that the interior minister, Tsvetan Tsvetanov, was expected to ''announce the results of the interim progress report in the investigation of the Burgas attack'' on Tuesday, after the meeting of the president's council for national security, which includes the prime minister, top cabinet members and military and security personnel. Mr. Ninov would not say whether responsibility for those behind the bombing or their identities would be revealed.
Bulgarian officials are acutely aware of the stakes without anything like significant lobbying by larger European Union members that would prefer not to have to deal with the Hezbollah question. ''It was not a campaign,'' said Philipp Missfelder, a leading member of Germany's Christian Democrats and the party's foreign-policy spokesman in Parliament. ''Some German officials dropped a few words.''
But Mr. Missfelder said that attitudes toward Hezbollah were gradually shifting. ''It's clear that they are steered from Iran and they are destabilizing the region,'' Mr. Missfelder said. ''The group that thinks Hezbollah is a stabilizing factor is getting smaller.''
Hezbollah's dual nature as what Western intelligence agencies call a terrorist organization and a political party with significant social projects, including schools and health clinics, make it more difficult to dismiss. Hezbollah is a significant political actor in Lebanon, and many European officials are particularly wary of upsetting the status quo as the civil war drags on in Syria.
A sort of modus vivendi exists where Hezbollah keeps a low profile for its fund-raising and other activities and Europeans do not crack down. In Germany alone, some 950 people have been identified as being associated with the organization as of 2011. The group has always been treated as a benign force, even if assessments of the danger it presented varied greatly.
Omid Nouripour, a Bundestag member and a Green Party spokesman on security issues, said that for years he had opposed listing Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. ''In the situation now, with Syria, I think it's now time to isolate Hezbollah,'' Mr. Nouripour said.
But France remains the European Union country with the strongest engagement in Lebanon as well as in Syria, and with the most say in European policy toward Hezbollah, said François Heisbourg, special adviser to the Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris.
''The French, to the extent that it's possible, try to avoid political destabilization and radicalization in Lebanon,'' Mr. Heisbourg said. ''The driver in France is the situation in Lebanon and the politics in Lebanon. It's not as if France didn't know that Hezbollah is a terrorist organization.''
The Netherlands has already declared Hezbollah a terrorist organization. Britain lists only the group's militant wing as a terrorist organization, distinguishing it from the political side. The United States and Israel have been the most vocal about the group's connection to violence and ties with Iran.
''I would describe Hezbollah as the most potent terrorist organization in the world, and very disciplined,'' said Michael Chertoff, the former secretary of homeland security under President George W. Bush.
A tour bus carrying Israeli vacationers exploded in a fireball outside the airport in Burgas, killing seven people including the bomber. Almost immediately the attack took on political overtones, with international echoes in Jerusalem, Beirut and Tehran.
Immediately after the bombing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel blamed Iran and what officials there call its surrogate, Hezbollah, for the attack. Shortly afterward an American official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that Tehran had given ''broad guidance'' to Hezbollah to attack Israeli targets when the opportunity presented itself. A senior government official in Israel said intelligence had identified telephone calls between Lebanon and Burgas in the two months leading up to the bombing, with a spike in the three days before the attack.
The bombing, which came in the wake of several near-misses and foiled plots against Israeli interests around the world, was widely seen as retribution for the killings of Iranian nuclear scientists, part of what analysts have called a shadow war pitting Iran and Hezbollah against Israel. Iran blames Israel for the assassinations of several nuclear scientists. Israel says Hezbollah and Iran are behind a series of attacks on Israeli targets in India, Georgia, Thailand and elsewhere, in addition to the Burgas bombing.
Shortly after the attack Prime Minister Boiko Borisov of Bulgaria called the group behind it ''an exceptionally experienced'' team, and described the attack as a conspiracy with multiple members, not the act of an individual. A member of the country's security establishment said that there was a ''clear direction that points to Hezbollah'' in both the pattern of the attack and the evidence.
But the Bulgarians stopped short of formally blaming Hezbollah at the time. Six months have passed without a determination by Bulgarian officials.
''If you factor in the suspicion that there are political implications beyond Bulgaria's borders,'' said the European council's Mr. Bechev, ''it's completely understandable that they've been playing for time.''

HEADLINE: Clues to a Troubling Gap

BYLINE: By HANNAH FAIRFIELD

 BODY:
For years -- and especially since 2005, when Lawrence H. Summers, then president of Harvard, made his notorious comments about women's aptitude -- researchers have been searching for ways to explain why there are so many more men than women in the top ranks of science. 
Now comes an intriguing clue, in the form of a test given in 65 developed countries by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. It finds that among a representative sample of 15-year-olds around the world, girls generally outperform boys in science -- but not in the United States.
What explains the gap? Andreas Schleicher, who oversees the tests for the O.E.C.D., says different countries offer different incentives for learning science and math.
In the United States, he said, boys are more likely than girls to ''see science as something that affects their life.''
Then there is the ''stereotype threat.''
''We see that very early in childhood -- around age 4 -- gender roles in occupations appear to be formed,'' said Christianne Corbett, co-author of the 2010 report ''Why So Few? Women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math,'' by the American Association of University Women. ''Women are less likely to go into science careers, although they are clearly capable of succeeding.''
Researchers say these cultural forces are strong in the United States, Britain and Canada but far less pervasive in Russia, Asia and the Middle East, which have a much higher proportion of women in science and engineering. In Jordan, for example, girls score more than 8 percent better in science than boys do. The disparities in Albania and Qatar are almost as large.
''For girls in some Arab countries, education is the only way to move up the social structure,'' Mr. Schleicher said. ''It is one way to earn social mobility.''

Girls vs. Boys: On a science test given to 470,000 students around the developed world, girls outperformed boys in most nations -- but not in the United States. The two-hour exam, which also tested reading and mathematical literacy, focused on how students applied their knowledge. The students were all 15, an age when most are nearing the end of their required education. They were chosen at random from a representative sample of schools in 65 developed nations. These results are from 2009
 the test is given every three years, and the next round of results will be available in December. (Source: Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) (CHART BY HANNAH FAIRFIELD/THE NEW YORK TIMES) (D3)

HEADLINE: Hazards: Pneumonia Strain Has Spread

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS BAKALAR

 BODY:
Infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae is a serious danger to older hospitalized patients, with an estimated mortality rate as high as 40 percent. It has generally been treated with broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotics. Another class of antibiotics, carbapenems, is used as an antibiotic of last resort for the most persistent infections. 
But now carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella strains, or CRKP, are appearing across the nation, even outside of health care facilities.
A study in the March issue of Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology reports that the proportion of Klebsiella cases resistant to cephalosporins increased to 11.6 percent in 2010 from 5.3 percent in 1999. The proportion resistant to carbapenems increased to 4.5 percent in 2010 from less than 0.1 percent in 2002.
The senior author, Ramanan Laxminarayan, a researcher at the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy in Washington, D.C., compared the problem to that of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
"There's a similarity to MRSA, which prior to the early 2000s was not seen in the community, and it was very surprising when it showed up," he said. "But there had already been new drug developments for MRSA. The problem with CRKP is that we don't have any new drugs. This could wind up being worse than MRSA."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Bet on U.S. Pays Off for Germany's Carmakers

BYLINE: By JACK EWING; Bill Vlasic contributed reporting from Detroit.

 BODY:
It was only a few years ago that some economists were arguing that Europe was ''decoupling'' from its long dependence on trade with the United States and predicting that the Continent's future lay with the so-called tiger economies of Asia.
German carmakers, at least, had a different vision of the future.
The recovery in the United States auto market, which produced big earnings growth at Chrysler and Ford in their fourth quarters, has also been a boon for Germany's big three -- Daimler, BMW and Volkswagen.
The double-digit increases in their American sales last year reflected an overall surge in demand by American buyers for European and, above all, German products. Well-designed vehicles and machinery, so coveted a Germany specialty that they can often fetch premium prices, were by far the biggest categories of European exports to the United States. 
As a result, overall German exports to America rose 24 percent in October from a year earlier, outpacing the 18 percent growth for euro zone exports to the United States.
In many ways, the success of the German carmakers has let them invest to produce further success in the American market. The German companies are cashing in on years of commitment to the United States, which remained an important market for them even as the global auto industry trained its sights on China.
Volkswagen, for example, has invested $4 billion in the United States since 2008, building a factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., that began churning out Passat sedans in 2011.
''Five years ago, we reset the clock here in America,'' Martin Winterkorn, the chief executive of Volkswagen, said in Detroit last month. ''The Passat was made in America for America.''
BMW and Daimler's Mercedes-Benz unit have been making sport-utility vehicles and other autos in America since the 1990s: BMW in Spartanburg, S.C., and Mercedes in Tuscaloosa, Ala.
That presence put them in position to take advantage of the revival of the American market.
Nearly a third of the vehicles that BMW sells in America are built in that country, according to LMC Automotive, a research firm in Troy, Mich. Mercedes and VW both produce about a quarter of what they sell in the United States in local factories.
BMW and Mercedes have also expanded their appeal in the United States by moving carefully into more affordable parts of the market. Mercedes, for example, sells an entry-level Mercedes sedan for less than $30,000.
All of that has contributed to a sales surge. BMW vehicle sales in the United States rose 14 percent last year, including the Mini brand; sales of Daimler's Mercedes and Smart brands increased more than 15 percent; and Volkswagen's sales soared 34 percent, including Audi brand cars.
For Mercedes and VW, those were better growth rates than in China, and they helped to offset slower sales there.
The German automakers' strong financial results contrast with those of European rivals like Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroën, which abandoned the United States market decades ago. Now the French carmakers are short of ways to counterbalance the stricken European market. It is probably too late for them to re-enter the United States, even if they could afford the cost of re-establishing a dealership network.
Mercedes and VW are so well placed in the United States that they even did a little strutting during the televised Super Bowl football championship on Sunday, showing splashy commercials.
In the Mercedes spot, the actor Willem Dafoe, playing the devil, offers a young man a new CLA sedan in exchange for his soul. After a fantasy sequence in which the young man cuddles with the model Kate Upton, dances alongside Usher and overtakes Formula One cars on a racetrack, he sees a billboard advertising the CLA for $29,900. He realizes he can afford one without the devil's help.
The euro zone recession would clearly be much worse than it is without the income that European companies are bringing in from the United States. While Germany has been the main beneficiary, accounting for 40 percent of euro zone exports to the United States, countries including France, Italy and Spain also recorded big gains in sales in America of products that span categories from chemicals to wine.
Britain, which is in the European Union but not the euro zone, expanded exports to America by 11 percent in October from a month earlier. That made Britain second to Germany in total sales of goods to the United States that month, with about 4 billion euros, or $5.4 billion, in October versus 8 billion euros for Germany, according to official figures.
The renaissance of United States demand is a big shift from a few years ago, when all the action seemed to be in Asia. The realignment has prompted some companies and governments to re-examine their priorities, and it helps explain why European Union leaders like Angela Merkel of Germany and David Cameron of Britain have been pushing hard for a new trade agreement between Europe and the United States. A deal would eliminate tariffs and harmonize regulatory requirements for cars and other products.
America has always been important to German manufacturers.
But the recent pickup in United States demand for factory equipment, which is closely linked to the auto industry as well as natural gas exploration and chemical production, came as a surprise.
After past economic downturns, United States demand for machinery never fully recovered to precrisis levels, said Peter Leibinger, vice chairman of Trumpf, a company based in Ditzingen, Germany, that makes machines used to cut and form sheet metal.
''It was always a step down,'' Mr. Leibinger said by telephone from Farmington, Conn., where a Trumpf factory employs about 700 people.
But this time it was different. After an initial plunge following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, Trumpf's American sales have soared, rising about 90 percent to 274 million euros from June 2010 to June 2012.
The German carmakers are benefiting from a general recovery in the premium end of the American market, as well as from more aggressive financing incentives. But they are also in position to meet demand for less expensive models, as with the BMW X3 SUV, which starts at about $39,000.
Volkswagen, which only a few years ago flirted with irrelevance in the United States, has come back after a campaign that began in 2008 and included a high-tech makeover of the buildings that house Audi dealerships as well as efforts to improve service.
The Passat made in Tennessee is less costly and simpler than the European version. It has helped VW compete better in the United States with the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord.
''The VW brand has historically had more of a cult following,'' said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president at LMC Automotive. ''The new Passat is larger and more in line with midsize cars in the U.S. It has more mass appeal than cult appeal.''
VW has also invested heavily in marketing in the United States. The company's Super Bowl spot portrayed an office worker from Minnesota speaking in a Jamaican patois and exhorting his dour co-drones to ''turn the frown the other way around.'' Then he took them for a ride in a red Beetle. The slogan is: ''Get In. Get Happy.'' (Some commentators said the commercial was culturally insensitive, but Jamaica's tourism minister liked it, The Associated Press reported.)
Mr. Schuster said he thought VW sales would continue to grow this year, though perhaps not as fast. In January, sales of the German brands rose less than the American car market over all, although it was not clear if the relatively poor performance was a trend or an anomaly. Over all, vehicle sales in the United States were up 14 percent in January from a year earlier. Mercedes sales rose 11 percent over that period, VW and Audi unit sales rose 7 percent, and BMW and Mini sales were up only 2 percent.
BMW sales were held back by a shortage of products because of heavy demand last year, a spokesman said, adding that the company expected 2013 to be a good year in the United States.
Despite all the talk about Asia in recent years, there is palpable relief among German exporters that the United States is once again a growth market. America remains an easier place for European companies to do business than most emerging markets.
''To us, it's a market like Germany,'' said Mr. Leibinger of Trumpf. ''We consider China a huge opportunity, but we do see the risks there.''

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Decline in Euro Zone, Leaving Room for E.C.B. to Cut Rates

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- Euro zone factory prices fell for the second month in a row in December, mirroring the trend in consumer inflation and leaving room for a possible European Central Bank interest rate cut to revive the weak economy. 
Prices at factory gates in the 17 countries using the euro fell 0.2 percent in December from November, the E.U.'s statistics office, Eurostat, said on Monday.
Prices fell by the same margin in November. Compared to the same month a year ago, the producer price index was up 2.1 percent in December. Annual consumer inflation was 2.0 percent in January, close to the E.C.B.'s target of below 2 percent.
The E.C.B.'s governing council kept rates at 0.75 percent at its January meeting and will discuss rate policy again on Thursday. The decision to keep policy on hold last month was unanimous, but economists are divided over the E.C.B.'s future moves.
''The E.C.B. is unlikely to change policy stance'' in February, analysts at Citigroup wrote in a note. ''But we expect the tone of the press statement to turn more cautious on the economic outlook and more relaxed on the outlook for inflation,'' the bank said, referring to the E.C.B.'s explanation for its decision on rates delivered to the media.
Both consumer and factory inflation were driven up last year by high world oil prices and tensions between Iran and the West over Tehran's nuclear ambitions, which further pushed up the cost of energy.
Lower world oil prices have since helped cut the cost of energy for industry and households in the euro zone. Brent crude came down from $120 a barrel in August to trade around $110 a barrel towards the end of 2012.
Brent crude was around $116 a barrel on Monday, on signs of improving economic growth in the United States and China.
Last year's cooler prices were reflected in the euro zone's producer prices in December. Energy prices dropped 0.8 percent, the third straight month of decline, and by the same margin as in November.

HEADLINE: Renewed Concern About Europe Lowers Shares

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks fell on Monday as renewed worries about the euro zone crisis caused the market to pull back from recent gains.
Shares of McGraw-Hill fell 13.8 percent, to $50.30, their worst daily percentage decline since the October 1987 market crash, after news emerged that the Justice Department plans to sue Standard & Poor's, a unit of McGraw-Hill, over its mortgage bond ratings. It would be the first such federal action against a credit-rating agency related to the recent financial crisis.
Chevron and Wal-Mart were among the biggest drags on the Dow Jones industrial average after analysts downgraded the companies, and all 10 S.& P. 500 sectors were lower. The losses came after Friday's market climb that left the S.& P. 500 at a five-year high and the Dow above 14,000. 
''The market is extended and due for a pullback. I think people are looking for an excuse to make sales,'' said Michael James, a senior trader at Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles.
Spanish and Italian bond yields rose, renewing worries about the euro zone's sovereign debt crisis. Spain's prime minister faced calls to resign over a corruption scandal, while an inquiry of contended misconduct involving an Italian bank was expected to widen three weeks before a national election.
Adding to market pressure, data from the Commerce Department showed factory orders for December were below economists' expectations.
The Dow Jones industrial average was down 129.71 points, or 0.93 percent, at 13,880.08. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 17.46 points, or 1.15 percent, to 1,495.71.
The Nasdaq composite index lost 47.93 points, or 1.51 percent, to 3,131.17.
With 18.7 billion shares traded, it was the busiest day on record for McGraw-Hill shares. Shares of another ratings agency, Moody's, fell 10.66 percent, to $49.45.
The benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose on Friday, leaving it about 60 points away from its record intraday high of 1,576.09, while the Dow's march above 14,000 was the highest for the index since October 2007.
The S.& P. index remains 4.87 percent higher for the year.
The CBOE Volatility index, VIX, Wall Street's so-called fear gauge, rose 13.72 percent.
Chevron dipped 1.12 percent, to $115.20, after UBS cut its rating to neutral.
Wal-Mart Stores fell 1.22 percent, to $69.63, after JPMorgan lowered its rating on the retailer and reduced its price target.
Shares of the household products company Clorox rose 0.71 percent, to $79.72, after quarterly profit beat analysts' estimates as a severe flu season increased sales of disinfectant wipes.
According to Thomson Reuters data, of the 256 companies in the S.& P. 500 that reported earnings through Monday morning, 68.4 percent have reported earnings above analysts' expectations, compared with the 62 percent average since 1994 and the 65 percent average over the last four quarters.
S.& P. 500 fourth-quarter earnings are expected to rise 4.4 percent, according to the data. That estimate is above the 1.9 percent forecast at the start of earnings season, but well below the 9.9 percent forecast on Oct. 1.
In deal news, the software maker Oracle agreed to buy a network equipment company, Acme Packet, for $2.1 billion. Shares of Oracle were down 3 percent at $35.13, while Acme Packet shot up 23.65 percent, to $29.59.
Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 19/32, to 97 2/32 and the yield fell to 1.96 percent from 2.03 percent late Friday.

HEADLINE: U.S. Accuses S.&P. Of Fraud in Suit On Loan Bundles

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
The Justice Department late Monday filed civil fraud charges against the nation's largest credit-ratings agency, Standard & Poor's, accusing the firm of inflating the ratings of mortgage investments and setting them up for a crash when the financial crisis struck.
The suit, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, is the first significant federal action against the ratings industry, which during the boom years reaped record profits as it bestowed gilt-edged ratings on complex bundles of home loans that quickly went sour. The high ratings made many investments appear safer than they actually were, and are now seen as having contributed to a crisis that brought the financial system and the broader economy to its knees.
More than a dozen state prosecutors are expected to join the federal suit, and the New York attorney general is preparing a separate action. The Securities and Exchange Commission has also been investigating possible wrongdoing at S.& P.
From September 2004 through October 2007, S.&P. "knowingly and with the intent to defraud, devised, participated in, and executed a scheme to defraud investors" in certain mortgage-related securities, according to the suit filed against the agency and its parent company, McGraw-Hill Companies. S.&P. also falsely represented that its ratings "were objective, independent, uninfluenced by any conflicts of interest," the suit said. 
S.& P., first contacted by federal enforcement officials three years ago, said in a statement Monday in anticipation of the suit that it had acted in good faith in issuing the ratings.
"A D.O.J. lawsuit would be entirely without factual or legal merit," it said, adding that its competitors had given exactly the same ratings to all the securities it believed to be in question.
Settlement talks between S.& P. and the Justice Department broke down in the last two weeks after prosecutors sought a penalty in excess of $1 billion and insisted that the company admit wrongdoing, several people with knowledge of the talks said. That amount would wipe out the profits of McGraw-Hill for an entire year. S.& P. had proposed a settlement of around $100 million, the people said.
S.& P. also sought a deal that would allow it to neither admit nor deny guilt; the government pressed for an admission of guilt to at least one count of fraud, said the people. S.& P. told prosecutors it could not admit guilt without exposing itself to liability in a multitude of civil cases.
It was unclear whether state and federal authorities were looking at the other two major ratings agencies, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch.
A spokesman for Moody's declined to comment. A spokesman for Fitch, Daniel J. Noonan, said the agency could not comment on an action that appeared to focus on Standard & Poor's, but added, "we have no reason to believe Fitch is a target of any such action."
The case against S.& P. focuses on about 40 collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.'s, an exotic type of security made up of bundles of mortgage bonds, which in turn were composed of individual home loans. The securities were created at the height of the housing boom. S.& P. was paid fees of about $13 million for rating them.
Prosecutors have uncovered troves of e-mails written by S.& P. employees, some of them expressing strong concern about the way such securities were being rated. The firm gave the government more than 20 million pages of e-mails as part of its investigation, the people with knowledge of the process said.
Since the financial crisis in 2008, the ratings agencies' business practices have been widely criticized and questions have been raised as to whether independent analysis was corrupted by Wall Street's push for profits.
A Senate investigation made public in 2010 found that S.& P. and Moody's used inaccurate rating models from 2004 to 2007 that failed to predict how high-risk mortgages would perform; allowed competitive pressures to affect their ratings; and failed to reassess past ratings after improving their models in 2006.
The companies failed to assign adequate staff to examine exotic investments, and failed to take mortgage fraud, lax underwriting and "unsustainable home price appreciation" into account in their models, the inquiry found.
"Rating agencies continue to create an even bigger monster - the C.D.O. market," one S.& P. employee wrote in an internal e-mail in December 2006. "Let's hope we are all wealthy and retired by the time this house of card falters."
Another S.& P. employee wrote in an instant message the next April, reproduced in the complaint: "We rate every deal. It could be structured by cows and we would rate it."
The three major ratings agencies are typically paid by the issuers of the securities they rate - in this case, the banks that had packaged the mortgage-backed securities and wanted to market them. The investors were not involved in the process but depended on the rating agencies' assessments.
Although the three agencies tend to track one another, each has its own statistical methods for assessing the likelihood that C.D.O.s and residential mortgage-backed securities, or R.M.B.S., will default. That has led to speculation that S.& P. analysts knew their method yielded unrealistic ratings, but issued the ratings anyway.
"As S.&P. knew, contrary to its representations to the public, S.&P.'s desire for increased revenue and market share in the RMBS and CDO ratings markets, and its resulting desire to maintain and enhance its relationships with issuers that drove its ratings business, improperly influenced S.&P. to downplay and disregard the true extent of the credit risks," the suit says.
In its statement on Monday, S.& P. said it had begun stress-testing the mortgage-backed securities it rated as early as 2005, trying to see how they would perform in a severe market downturn. S.& P. said it had also sent out early warning signals, downgrading hundreds of mortgage-backed securities, starting in 2006. Nor was it the only one to have underestimated the coming crisis, it said - even the Federal Reserve's open market committee believed that any problems within the housing sector could be contained.
The Justice Department, the company said, "would be wrong in contending that S.& P. ratings were motivated by commercial considerations and not issued in good faith."
For many years, the ratings agencies have defended themselves successfully in civil litigation by saying their ratings were independent opinions, protected by the First Amendment, which guarantees the right to free speech. Developments in the wake of the financial crisis have raised questions about the agencies' independence however. For example, one federal judge, Shira A. Scheindlin, ruled in 2009 that the First Amendment did not apply in a lawsuit over ratings issued by S.& P. and Moody's, because the mortgage-backed securities at issue had not been offered to the public at large. Judge Scheindlin also agreed with the plaintiffs, who argued the ratings were not opinions, but misrepresentations, possibly the result of fraud or negligence.
The federal action will be the first time a credit-rating agency has been charged under a 1989 law intended to protect taxpayers from frauds involving federally insured financial institutions, which since the financial crisis has been used against a number of federally insured banks, including Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Citigroup.
The government is taking a novel approach by accusing S.& P. of defrauding a federally insured institution and therefore injuring the taxpayer.
Among others, the compliant includes the demise of Wescorp, a federally insured credit union in Los Angeles that went bankrupt after investing in mortgage securities rated by S.& P. Wescorp is included as one example of the contended fraud, and as a way to bring the case in California. The suit was filed in Federal District Court for the Central District of California.
Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: New Idea for Penn Station Entails Relocating a College

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
In the early 1990s, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan proposed transforming the sprawling post office on Eighth Avenue, with its Corinthian columns, into a grand entryway to the busiest transit hub in North America, Pennsylvania Station. Since then, a succession of plans for what is to be known as Moynihan Station have surfaced with fanfare, only to sink later.
Now, a major developer is promoting a proposal to improve the viability of the project by moving the Borough of Manhattan Community College to the back of the post office, which is across Eighth Avenue from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. 
Under the proposal by the developer, the Related Companies, the community college would move 3.8 miles north of its current location downtown to 1.1 million square feet of space in the post office building. The college would be the anchor tenant in the complex.
Related Companies would simultaneously build a new train hall, train platforms and underground connections to the cramped and labyrinthine Penn Station at the front end of the post office. In return, Related would receive the college's potentially valuable campus, which spans four city blocks near the Hudson River, for residential development.
Related's chairman, Stephen M. Ross, has spent more than a year wooing college officials, and he met last month with senior officials in the administration of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, hoping to persuade them that this is the best way to move the project forward, real estate executives said.
But Mr. Cuomo and the City University of New York, which runs the college, have not embraced the proposal, which has been perceived by some in the real estate industry as more advantageous for Related than for the college.
Michael Arena, a CUNY spokesman, would say only that officials have had ''preliminary discussions with'' Related.
Matthew L. Wing, a spokesman for the governor, said, ''We're reviewing the proposal.''
Related would not comment on the proposal, which was described by real estate executives who have been briefed on it.
Some longtime supporters of the Moynihan project said the proposal was worth exploring, especially if it would lead to construction of the train annex.
''We do need to get going on this station,'' said Robert Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association, a civic advocacy group. ''I'd like to see something exceptional done there.''
The long delay on the Moynihan project is typical of large, complicated redevelopment efforts involving partnerships between private developers and government, like Battery Park City, Hudson Yards or the rejuvenation of Times Square. The projects can languish through the ebb and flow of the economy, legal challenges and changes in Albany or at City Hall.
Nearly eight years after Related, and its development partner, Vornado Realty Trust, were selected by the state to build Moynihan Station, the developer is loath to relinquish its development rights. And today, the state has no desire to end the partnership, if only because it would have to reimburse Related for about $25 million in expenses related to the project.
Senator Moynihan wanted to transform the post office building to improve the cramped train station, which is used by more than 500,000 commuters a day. It was also meant to be an act of civic redemption for the 1963 demolition of the much-admired glass and steel train shed that soared over the underground portion of the station. Both the old Penn Station and the post office building were designed by the same firm -- McKim, Mead & White.
But the development partners had a far more ambitious, $14 billion plan in mind. They sought to demolish Madison Square Garden, which sits over Penn Station, and build a new arena for the Knicks and Rangers inside the post office. With the Garden gone, they planned to overhaul Penn Station, erecting a glass-enclosed train hall, along with department stores and, nearby, office and residential buildings.
The complicated plan collapsed in 2008 because of the recession.
Currently, the state's development corporation is overseeing about $300 million in work beneath the post office building to create two entrances for Amtrak commuters at 31st and 33rd Streets and to expand the train platforms and the passageway to Penn Station.
Related executives first approached the Borough of Manhattan Community College about a land swap in summer 2011. The college's enrollment has climbed to nearly 25,000 students, up 30 percent from 18,763 in 2004, forcing the school to lease space nearby.
The initial response from the college was lukewarm. Officials expressed little interest in relocating, especially since the college was about to complete a new $325 million building, Fiterman Hall, downtown. It was also unclear how the school could legally swap the land without going through an auction.
But real estate executives said Mr. Ross had tried to address the school's concerns, promising to build a larger facility in and around the post office building. Related suggested that the school could operate uptown and downtown campuses.
Related is now trying to persuade Mr. Cuomo that its proposal is the only way to restart the project, generating additional classroom space and thousands of jobs at a location that is unlikely to attract major retailers.
But some government officials contend that the college is not the ideal tenant for the post office building. Instead, they say, Related should be focusing on potential retail and office tenants like Google, which has been scouring the neighborhood for additional space.

HEADLINE: More Jobs, Higher Pay

 BODY:
In President Obama's first term, the fiscal stimulus and the auto-industry rescue of 2009 created and preserved millions of jobs. But the stimulus ended years ago, replaced with temporary measures that have been insufficient to propel the economy forward. Health care reform in 2010 was a major step in the effort to support the middle class, but its broad effects will be felt only in the years and decades to come.
In recent years, the administration and Congress have been consumed with deficit reduction, which is antithetical to job creation because it curbs government spending when the economy is weak. Unless Mr. Obama can shift policy away from premature austerity and toward ways to bolster demand and foster investment, job growth will remain sluggish and unemployment high. 
What has been missing for years is a forceful labor agenda -- one that calls for more jobs, but also has as its goal rising wages coupled with robust hiring.
Mr. Obama can take an important step in that direction by placing his next labor secretary at the center of his economic team. The first-term labor secretary, Hilda Solis, was largely sidelined, a reflection of the administration's focus on the recovery of Wall Street, not Main Street. Some of the names that have been floated for the job -- including Jennifer Granholm, the former governor of Michigan -- show that Mr. Obama is seeking someone of high stature, but any secretary's ability to be a transformative force will depend on the president's support.
Part of an effective agenda would surely include a higher minimum wage, which is overdue. It is one of the most effective ways to lift wages because raising the floor also raises wages higher up the income scale. Union membership can also push up wages through collective bargaining. In 2012, even as the share of American workers in a union fell to its lowest level in nearly a century, the median weekly earnings of full-time unionized workers was $943 versus $742 for comparable nonunion workers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Yet the administration's support for unions has been more rhetorical than real. Mr. Obama failed to keep a campaign promise from 2008 to advance legislation to make it easier for workers to unionize and made scant use of the bully pulpit as unions have come under prominent attack in Wisconsin, Indiana and Michigan.
A recent federal court ruling invalidating his recess appointees to the National Labor Relations Board, which enforces federal labor law, will be a further setback to workers' ability to bargain for higher wages. The misguided decision, if upheld, would deny the board a quorum to rule on legal questions. In seeking to overturn the ruling, all the way to the Supreme Court, if necessary, the administration should take aim at the court's unjustified incursion on presidential power and its antiunion bias.
The White House must also commit to new rules on workplace safety, wage and overtime enforcement and proper classification of workers as employees versus independent contractors, a label that employers often misuse to deny benefits. Labor reforms are also central to immigration reform. Legalizing undocumented workers and revamping federal visas for noncollege-educated workers could raise wages by limiting exploitation, while ensuring that American workers have a fair shot at lower-skilled jobs for which there is significant foreign competition.
In his first term -- a time of persistent high unemployment, weak job growth, stagnating wages and rising income inequality -- Mr. Obama neglected a basic labor agenda. He now has a chance to take corrective action.
This is part of a continuing series on what President Obama and Congress should tackle in the next four years. Other editorials are at nytimes.com/secondterm.

HEADLINE: Plan Could Allow Forced Splits of British Banks

BYLINE: By MARK SCOTT

 BODY:
LONDON - British regulators will have the power to split up banks that fail to separate risky trading activity from retail banking, George Osborne, the country's chancellor of the Exchequer, said on Monday.
As part of an overhaul of bank operations, Mr. Osborne said regulators would be able to forcibly separate firms that failed to maintain a division between their retail banking and investment banking units.
The so-called ring-fencing of consumer deposits from risky trading activity is an effort to reduce the exposure to the wider British economy if one of the country's largest banks collapses. 
Many of Britain's largest banks have been engulfed in a series of scandals, and Mr. Osborne said the public was right to be angry over abuses in the country's financial industry.
The spotlight is on the Royal Bank of Scotland, which is expected to announce as early as this week a settlement over its involvement in the manipulation of a benchmark rate.
The bank, in which the government holds an 82 percent stake after providing a bailout, is said to be facing a fine of more than $650 million and a guilty plea by an Asian subsidiary related to the manipulation of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor.
Mr. Osborne said troubling behavior by those in Britain's financial industry was unacceptable.
"Irresponsible behavior was rewarded, failure was bailed out, and the innocent - people who have nothing whatsoever to do with the banks - suffered," Mr. Osborne said in a speech in Bournemouth, on the south coast of England.
During the recent financial crisis, a number of British banks, including the Lloyds Banking Group and Northern Rock, received multibillion-dollar bailouts after they ran into trouble because of exposure to risky assets.
To reaffirm the separation between retail and investment banking divisions, Mr. Osborne said on Monday that banks would have to appoint different senior managers to oversee each division. The new powers to forcibly split up banks are in response to fears that firms will try to find ways around dividing their retail and investment banking operations.
"No more rewards for failure. No more 'too big to fail.' No more taxpayers forking out for the mistakes of others," Mr. Osborne said.
Critics of the planned changes, however, say the separation of banks' operations will make it harder for them to raise capital and provide financial support to British companies.
"This will create uncertainty for investors, making it more difficult for banks to raise capital, which will ultimately mean that banks will have less money to lend to businesses," Anthony Browne, chief executive of the British Bankers' Association, a trade body criticized for its role in the Libor scandal, said in a statement.
The changes, which form part of new banking legislation that was being submitted to Parliament on Monday, mirror similar efforts in the United States and Europe to reduce the effect of banks' risky trading operations on the broader economy. The so-called Volcker Rule, the part of the Dodd-Frank Act that prohibits banks from making risky bets with their money, is also nearing regulatory approval in the United States.
In Britain, authorities are going a step further by dividing the Financial Services Authority, the country's financial regulator, into two units, as part of the widespread reforms.
In April, oversight of the country's banks will be returned to the Bank of England, the central bank, while a new consumer protection agency will monitor market abuse.
The changes come after a series of recent settlements by British banks over illegal activity.
HSBC and Standard Chartered agreed to pay a combined fine of more than $2 billion to American authorities related to money laundering allegations. Barclays reached a $450 million settlement with United States and British regulators in June related to the manipulation of Libor. And many of Britain's largest banks have been required to pay in total billions of dollars of penalties after inappropriately selling loan insurance to customers.
"Our country has paid a higher price than any other major economy for what went so badly wrong in our banking system," Mr. Osborne said on Monday.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Museums Grapple With the Strings Attached to Gifts

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN

 BODY:
For museums and other institutions confronted with the sometimes onerous restrictions that donors place on major gifts, forever can be a very long time.
In Tennessee, Fisk University, facing possible closing, needed court permission to sell a stake in an art collection that the artist Georgia O'Keeffe had donated with the proviso that it never be sold.
And now the Brooklyn Museum is asking a judge to bypass the wishes of Col. Michael Friedsam, who ordered before he died in 1931 that his collection be kept together. Conservators there discovered that a quarter of his 926 works were not of museum quality, were misattributed or, in a few cases, were fakes. So now the museum is trying to unload those unwanted gifts as if they were a Christmas fruitcake.
Handling what is known in the philanthropic world as donor intent is vexing for many institutions. How do you adhere to a donor's wishes when they seem to interfere with the best interests of the institution? 
''A respect for donor intent is essential for philanthropic integrity,'' said Adam Meyerson, president of the Philanthropy Roundtable, an association dedicated to protecting benefactors' interests. However, he added, ''You're not serving donor intent if you go bankrupt.''
The tension between contributors and institutions is hardly new, but it has gained a higher profile in recent years. The weak economy has shrunk museum budgets, while technology or evolving tastes have led curators to reassess once venerable works. Institutions, which need money or space as artworks fill their basements, often look to sell items donated with the stipulation that they never be relinquished.
When it came to the Clyfford Still Museum, the City of Denver in effect argued that it had to violate the Stills' wishes in order to fulfill them. Still's wife, Patricia, gave Denver 2,400 of her husband's works after his death with the understanding that the city would build a museum dedicated solely to his work and never sell or lend any of the art. But in 2011, six years after Ms. Still died, when fund-raising for the museum slowed, Denver received court permission to auction four of the paintings.
Amid cases like these, consultants and nonprofit organizations have stepped up efforts to help benefactors generate donations and wills that better ensure that their wishes are honored long after their deaths.
''I'm certainly getting more phone calls'' about donor intent, said Jeffrey J. Cain, in 2008 a founder of the consulting firm American Philanthropic. Mr. Cain, who wrote a free guidebook titled ''Protecting Donor Intent: How to Define and Safeguard Your Philanthropic Principles,'' said the issue had ''really captured the attention of conservative-minded donors, especially those giving gifts to the academy who worry about how those gifts would be managed over time.''
Philanthropy experts say that donors across the political spectrum are concerned about preserving their vision. But examples of foundations that have leaned left after being created by die-hard capitalists, like the carmaker Henry Ford and the oil magnate J. Howard Pew, have prompted several conservatives to speak out more loudly about the importance of donor intent.
''The Pews would spin in their graves,'' states one of several case studies featured in the Philanthropy Roundtable's library, which details the liberal organizations and causes, from radical environmentalists to campaign finance reform, that are financed by the bequests of conservative capitalists. ''It hurts the growth of philanthropy if the foundations that donors set up proceed to ignore or violate the most cherished principles of their founders,'' Mr. Meyerson of the Roundtable said.
Some philanthropy veterans said the interest in creating foundations with a limited life span could stem from growing concerns about donor intent. ''Any perpetual foundation is going to be liable to drift,'' said James Piereson, president of the William E. Simon Foundation.
Mr. Piereson was once executive director of the conservative John M. Olin Foundation, which was devised to spend all of its assets within a generation of Mr. Olin's death in order to prevent mission drift.
''Donor intent cannot realistically be guaranteed beyond a generation,'' Mr. Piereson said.
Museum administrators say they do their best, but that violating a donor's wishes is sometimes unavoidable.
In perhaps the most famous of these cases, the Barnes Foundation in Pennsylvania convinced a judge a few years ago that its very survival depended on breaking the terms of its founder's trust so it could move his magnificent art collection from suburban Merion to downtown Philadelphia.
Mr. Meyerson said the Barnes case illustrated how some restrictions could sabotage a donor's desires. He pointed to a requirement that the Barnes invest in only Treasury bonds, which hamstrung the foundation's finances. Even now, several months after the new Barnes opened its doors, the case remains a rallying point among an assortment of advocates in the philanthropy, legal and arts worlds who have campaigned for tighter compliance with donors' wishes.
For the Brooklyn Museum, the issue is also financial. Colonel Friedsam's will stipulated that his collection of paintings, porcelains, historical weapons and costumes never be split up. But although the inferior objects will not be displayed, museum administrators say they will, nonetheless, cost tens of thousands of dollars to store because the museum is running out of space.
In most states the attorney general is responsible for monitoring donations to charitable organizations, and in New York the attorney general has entered the case in support of the museum. The court has said that if the museum wants to split the collection, it must first try to find out whether any of Colonel Friedsam's alternate heirs are still alive.
Since donations are often a museum's lifeblood, most go to great lengths to fulfill a donor's desires faithfully. The Museum of Modern Art transferred two van Gogh drawings to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1998 because a donor had directed they be given away after 50 years.
And visitors to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, where few things in the darkly lighted galleries ever change position, can see the frames and the ragged edges of four paintings that were cut out and taken during a brazen 1990 theft. In part because Mrs. Gardner's will ordered that ''the general disposition or arrangement'' of her collection be maintained, curators have chosen to leave the frames on exhibit. Many museum administrators agree that Mrs. Gardner's instructions have created an unusual gem of a museum.
Nonetheless, most would no doubt prefer that donors leave the decision-making to them, emulating the stance of John D. MacArthur, who once told a trustee of his foundation: ''I figured out how to make the money. You fellows will have to figure out how to spend it.''

HEADLINE: A Billion-Dollar Club, and Not So Exclusive

BYLINE: By QUENTIN HARDY

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- The number of privately held Silicon Valley start-ups that are worth more than $1 billion shocks even the executives running those companies.
''I thought we were special,'' said Phil Libin, chief executive of Evernote, an online consumer service for storing clippings, photos and bits of information as he counted his $1 billion-plus peers.
He started Evernote in 2008 on the eve of the recession and built it methodically. ''A lot of us didn't set out to have a big valuation, we're just trying to build something that lasts,'' Mr. Libin said. ''There is no safe industry anymore, even here.''
But an unprecedented number of high technology start-ups, easily 25 and possibly exceeding 40, are valued at $1 billion or more. Many employees are quietly getting rich, or at least building a big cushion against a crash, as they sell shares to outside investors. Airbnb, Pinterest, SurveyMonkey and Spotify are among the better-known privately held companies that have reached $1 billion. But many more with less familiar names, including Box, Violin Memory and Zscaler, are selling services to other companies. 
''A year from now that might be 100,'' said Jim Goetz, a partner at Sequoia Capital, a venture capital business. Sequoia counts a dozen such companies in its portfolio. It is part of what he calls ''a permanent change'' in the way people are building their companies and financers are pushing up values.
The owners of these companies say the valuations make them giddy, but also create unease. Once $1 billion was a milestone, now it is also a millstone. Bigger expectations must be managed and greater uncertainty looms.
Investors and executives point to a number of reasons for the high valuations. Interest rates are low, which makes it easy for private equity companies to take large stakes in companies. Young tech millionaires and wealthy foreigners like Yuri Milner, the Russian billionaire, have been private investors, too. As each one puts more money into a start-up, it escalates the bidding for the others.
Last month the value of Twitter, which began in 2006, hit $9 billion, based on an offer for employee shares by BlackRock, a global investment manager. On the first day Microsoft sold shares to the public in 1986 it was 11 years old and worth just $778 million. That would be only $1.6 billion adjusted for inflation.
Pinterest, an online scrapbooking and social networking site with no revenue, became worth $1.5 billion in less than three years. Amazon.com went public in 1997 after only three years, but had a valuation of just $438 million. And it had almost $16 million in revenue for the 1997 fiscal year.
Silicon Valley entrepreneurs contend that the price spiral is not a sign of another tech bubble. The high prices are reasonable, they say, because innovations like smartphones and cloud computing will remake a technology industry that is already worth hundreds of billions of dollars.
In addition, many of the billion-dollar companies, including MobileIron, Pure Storage, Marketo, DDN and SurveyMonkey (which two weeks ago raised $794 million, to reach a value of $1.35 billion), sell products and services primarily to other businesses.
For every Dropbox, which offers online data storage primarily to consumers and is valued at $4 billion, there are two unheralded companies like Zscaler, a provider of online corporate data security, and Palantir, which does predictive data analysis, valued at more than $1 billion. Selling to big business is considered less risky than selling to consumers.
''There are disruptions everywhere,'' said Robert Tinker, the chief executive of MobileIron, which makes software for companies to manage smartphones and tablets. ''Mobile disrupts personal computers, a market worth billions. Cloud disrupts computer servers and data storage, billions of dollars more. Social may be one of those rare things that is totally new.''
Relative to the size of the markets that mobile devices, cloud computing and social media are toppling, he says, the valuations are reasonable.
But most of these chief executives are also veterans of the Internet bubble of the late '90s, and confess to worries that maybe things are not so different this time. Mr. Tinker, 43, drives a 1995 Ford Explorer that has logged 265,000 miles.
''If somebody comes to a job interview here in a $100,000 car, I know he's not hungry,'' he said. ''The reality is, I've taken $94 million in investors' money, and we haven't gone public yet. I feel that responsibility every day.''
Concern is growing that the billion-plus club is filling up with companies that look alike. ''Everyone is saying, 'I have a cloud technology, I should be valued at 20 times my sales,' '' said Jay Chaudhry, the chief executive of Zscaler. ''Some are real, but a lot of others are stretched too thin. They'll languish out there.''
The nagging fear is that valuations, which are turned into profits only if the company goes public successfully or is bought for a high price, could still plunge.
Groupon, the daily deals site, rejected a $6 billion acquisition offer from Google in 2010. After going public, it is valued at $3 billion. Zipcar, a car-sharing service, was worth $1.2 billion at its April 2011 initial public offering. In January, Avis Budget Group bought it for just $500 million.
Facebook's stock debut, of course, is the greatest valuation warning of all. It was modestly higher on its first day of public trading and down by about half four months later. Facebook has since recovered somewhat, but other executives now call its initial public offering ''Faceplant.''
The founders of the highly valued companies are old enough to remember past busts, and many shun the bubble lifestyle of fast cars and fancy parties.
Mr. Libin, who said he grew up on food stamps as the son of Russian immigrants in the Bronx, became a millionaire when he sold his first company, Engine5, to Vignette in 2000.
''The company I sold to, there were purple Lamborghinis in the garage. I got into watches,'' he said. ''Maybe a half-dozen, nothing over $10,000, but I needed this glass and leather watch winder.''
Evernote started as the financial crisis hit. ''One night I was almost busted again,'' he said, ''and there was that watch winder on the shelf, mocking me.''
''Every job out there is insecure now,'' he said. ''People sell 10 percent of their stock, and they have an incentive to make the other 90 percent worth more. They are still working, but not worrying about what will happen to their home or their kids.''

HEADLINE: Dealing With the Real Putin

BYLINE: By FIONA HILL and CLIFFORD GADDY

 BODY:
THE Obama administration has decided it's time to ''reset the reset'' with Russia. The reset was one of the administration's first foreign policy initiatives in 2009 and certainly reduced bilateral tensions for a period. But President Obama now faces Vladimir Putin as Russia's president instead of Dmitri Medvedev, and the entire premise of U.S.-Russia relations will have to be reviewed.
After 12 years at the top of Russian politics, Putin should be a known quantity. But policy makers and pundits are constantly diverted by the images that proliferate inside and outside Russia -- from the action man tranquilizing tigers and flying with cranes, to the cruel anti-American autocrat who exploits orphans to undermine U.S. human rights legislation. 
For the Obama administration to chart a new course in relations with Russia, it needs to be clear about who Vladimir Putin is and what he wants.
Putin is a man fixated on the survival of the Russian state, not just his own survival. In his first two presidential terms he worked to restore and consolidate the strength and independence of the Russian state. He did so primarily by channeling windfall revenues from the oil boom to pay off the colossal debts accumulated by his predecessors, Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin. He then proceeded to build up Russia's financial and material reserves.
Putin now believes it is time to concentrate on strengthening Russia internally. In his annual ''Message to the Federal Assembly'' (the Russian equivalent of a State of the Union Message) in December 2012, Putin barely mentioned the outside world. The international system, he suggested, is fraught with risk for Russia, not opportunity. Russians, Putin commanded, need to turn inward. They should look to patriotism, not Westernism; to solidarity, not individualism; to spirituality, not consumerism and moral decay. He touted Russia's historic roots and traditional values as the basis for its future trajectory.
Putin's priority for 2013 is to reduce Russia's exposure and vulnerability to external shocks. He is not interested in foreign policy adventures, especially not a confrontation with the United States. Putin firmly opposes U.S. policy toward Syria and the threat of force against Iran. But his opposition stems neither from anti-Americanism nor a desire to back the Iranian mullahs or Syria's Bashar al-Assad in their struggles with the West. It is rooted in his obsession with stability. Helping Tehran secure a nuclear weapon and keeping Assad in Damascus are not Putin's goals. But an Israeli or U.S. attack on Iran's nuclear sites, and NATO or the United Nations intervening in Syria to forcibly remove Assad, would increase global volatility.
Putin wants Russia to be left alone, unencumbered by liabilities and obligations. He wants Russia to hunker down in its Eurasian neighborhood and not embark on further integration with an embattled West. Putin has never seen the West as a model for Russia. Now, he is not even interested in joining it as a partner. The euro zone crisis has convinced him there is no need for Russia to pursue a ''common European home'' (an idea he picked up from Gorbachev and Yeltsin early in his presidency).
Although he championed Russia's entry into the World Trade Organization, Putin saw this as a long-denied right, as well as a rite of passage into the ''big boys club.'' In his annual address, Putin promised he would ensure there is a ''demand'' for Russia in the world, both for the Russian economy and for a Russian role in geopolitics. Putin's goal is to make sure the ailing West knows it needs Russia and its vast territory and resources more than Russia needs the West, even if that is an overreach.
Where does this leave the reset? The reality is this: There are no big deals to be had with Putin. Outside the traditional U.S.-Russian bilateral realm of arms control, there is no great opportunity for the Obama administration in Russia. The only quid pro quo Putin would likely strike with the United States is one no administration could (or would) contemplate -- where Moscow agrees not to make life too difficult for Washington, as long as the U.S. ignores Russian domestic developments and human rights abuses.
On Iran and Syria, Putin will calibrate his moves to reduce Moscow's exposure and increase its leverage. Meanwhile, Putin's perceptions of U.S. meddling in Russian politics will remain the sore point in the relationship. When he considers the Russian state insulted or challenged in any way on this issue, Putin will be quick to respond.
For Putin very little is off-limits in getting his message across, as the recent ban on U.S. adoptions makes clear. Even when the myths are dispelled, the real Vladimir Putin is difficult to deal with. Putin is a man who knows what he wants. Only once the administration is clear about what that is can it begin to figure out its own message and limits in dealing with Putin's Russia.

HEADLINE: Hand of U.S. Is Seen in Halting General's Rise

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON, RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD and ERIC SCHMITT; Ginger Thompson reported from New York, Randal C. Archibold from Mexico City, and Eric Schmitt from Washington. Lisa Schwartz and Kitty Bennett contributed research.

 BODY:
As Mexico's military staged its annual Independence Day parade in September, spectators filled the main square of Mexico City to cheer on the armed forces. Nearly 2,000 miles away in Washington, American officials were also paying attention.
But it was not the helicopters hovering overhead or the antiaircraft weapons or the soldiers in camouflage that caught their attention. It was the man chosen to march at the head of the parade, Gen. Moisés García Ochoa, who by tradition typically becomes the country's next minister of defense.
The Obama administration had many concerns about the general, including the Drug Enforcement Administration's suspicion that he had links to drug traffickers and the Pentagon's anxiety that he had misused military supplies and skimmed money from multimillion-dollar defense contracts.
In the days leading up to Mexico's presidential inauguration on Dec. 1, the United States ambassador to Mexico, Anthony Wayne, met with senior aides to President Enrique Peña Nieto to express alarm at the general's possible promotion. 
That back-channel communication provides a rare glimpse into the United States government's deep involvement in Mexican security affairs -- especially as Washington sizes up Mr. Peña Nieto, who is just two months into a six-year term. The American role in a Mexican cabinet pick also highlights the tensions and mistrust between the governments despite proclamations of cooperation and friendship.
''When it comes to Mexico, you have to accept that you're going to dance with the devil,'' said a former senior D.E.A. official, who requested anonymity because he works in the private sector in Mexico. ''You can't just fold your cards and go home because you can't find people you completely trust. You play with the cards you're dealt.''
A former senior Mexican intelligence official expressed similar misgivings about American officials. ''The running complaint on the Mexican side is that the relationship with the United States is unequal and unbalanced,'' said the former official, who, like others interviewed for this article, spoke anonymously to discuss diplomatic and security exchanges. ''Mexico is open with its secrets. The United States is not. So there's a lot of resentment. And there's always an incentive to try to stick it to the Americans.''
Wave of Violence
Washington's concerns about General García Ochoa -- which several officials cautioned were not confirmed -- come as both governments grasp for new ways to stem the illegal flows of drugs, guns and money across their borders.
Under Mr. Peña Nieto's predecessor, Felipe Calderón, cooperation between the two governments had expanded in ways once considered unthinkable, with American and Mexican agents conducting coordinated operations that resulted in the capture or killing of several dozen important cartel leaders. But while Washington highlighted the record numbers of arrests, the stepped-up campaign created a wave of violence in Mexico that left some 60,000 people dead.
The devastating death toll has Mr. Peña Nieto, 46, a former governor, promising to move his country's fight against organized crime in a different direction, focusing more on reducing violence than on detaining drug kingpins. But he has so far offered only vague details of his security plans, focusing instead on social and economic programs.
While Mr. Peña Nieto portrays himself as the leader of a new generation of reformers, he is also a scion of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which ruled Mexico for more than 70 years through a combination of corruption and coercion until it lost power in 2000. During its time in power, the party was known more for keeping the United States at arm's length while attempting to strike deals with drug traffickers, rather than combating them head on.
Mr. Peña Nieto's election has brought the PRI back to power, and since so many of those serving in his cabinet have one foot in the past, foreign policy experts who specialize in Mexico say it is not clear where the new government is headed.
''It could go either way,'' said Eric L. Olson of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, speaking of future cooperation between Mexico and the United States. ''Part of me says, 'Let's not assume it's all going to go south.' And there are things that are happening that give me hope. But the longer it goes without some clarity, the more doubts creep in.''
Those doubts have also crept to Capitol Hill. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont who sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said he was withholding nearly $230 million in security assistance to Mexico through the so-called Merida Initiative amid concerns about whether the fight against organized crime is doing more harm than good.
''Congress has been asked for a significant new investment, but it's not clear what the Mexican government's plans are,'' Mr. Leahy said. ''It's premature to sign off on more of the same.''
General García Ochoa, 61, whose background is at once exemplary and enigmatic, personifies that quandary. On paper, he is a model officer. He earned two advanced degrees from Mexico's most prestigious military academies, and founded the elite National Center for Counter-Narcotics Intelligence. He has been a student and an instructor in American military training programs. He has written three books, including one on the military's role in the drug fight.
People who know the general said they were struck by his candid assessments of the fight against organized crime. He spoke openly about governmental corruption, a topic that has been considered taboo. And on at least two occasions over the past year and a half, the general's friends said, he traveled secretly to San Antonio to meet with American intelligence officials -- he didn't feel safe meeting with agents in Mexico, they said -- and gave names of military and civilian officials he suspected of providing protection to drug traffickers.
''He was genuinely worried that corruption was giving the military a bad name, and that if nothing was done about it, it could hurt relations with the United States,'' said a person knowledgeable about the meetings. ''The way he saw it, this next government has the chance to really change the way Mexico works with the United States. He didn't want that chance to be missed.''
By then, General García Ochoa was already on the short list to become defense minister. And people who know him said he hoped American support would give him an advantage over other candidates.
What he did not know was that the United States was quietly advocating against him. Current and former American officials said they had put together a troubling portfolio of allegations against the general. In his role as director of military administration and acquisitions, he had been accused of skimming money and supplies from large defense contracts.
Reports in the Mexican news media last summer accused the general of approving payments totaling more than $355 million for sophisticated surveillance equipment, without reporting those payments to civilian authorities or providing an explanation of how that equipment would be used.
'Mr. Ten Percent'
Behind the scenes, American officials had nicknamed the general ''Mr. Ten Percent,'' shorthand for their suspicions about the way he handled contracts. And two American officials recalled the general making a formal request for American assistance for the military's helicopter unit, and then backing out of the arrangement when the United States asked to look at the books -- including the unit's financial, flight and fuel records.
''The United States is sending a lot of money down there,'' said one senior American official, describing the concerns about the general. ''We need to be sure that money is being used in the right way or we could lose a huge opportunity.''
The D.E.A. suspected the general had long ties to drug traffickers. Agents declined to discuss the specific nature of those links. Nor would they say whether their investigation against the general was continuing. General García Ochoa declined requests to be interviewed.
''There was a lot of information on him, and it was coming from multiple sources,'' said a recently retired senior federal law-enforcement officer, referring to what he called the ''serious concerns'' about the general. ''We never found any smoking guns, not enough to make a case.''
The New York Times obtained classified D.E.A. intelligence reports from the early years of the general's career, when he founded the counternarcotics intelligence center. The reports, dated Dec. 15, 1997, allege that then-Colonel García Ochoa was one of several senior Mexican military officials involved with attempts to negotiate a deal with the country's most powerful drug trafficking organizations.
''It is highly likely,'' said one report, ''that military officials wanted to continue to profit from an ongoing relationship with the drug traffickers.''
The reports also allege that the colonel led a raid against the Juárez Cartel in which he deliberately allowed the kingpin Amado Carrillo Fuentes to escape, saying that the colonel ''did not give orders to launch the operation until the car in which ACF was reportedly traveling had departed the area.''
Mexican officials declined requests to be interviewed for this article. American officials declined to comment publicly on their suspicions about the general. But they emphasized that whatever concerns they might have had about an individual general were hardly representative of the larger relationship between the two governments.
There have been significant strides in cooperation in recent years, including the first drones flying over Mexican airspace, the creation of the first joint intelligence center on a Mexican military base, operations staged by Mexican counternarcotics officers on the United States side of the border, and operations conducted by American federal law enforcement agents against money laundering in Mexico.
The United States has successfully shared delicate intelligence with the Mexican Navy, which led to the arrests of significant cartel leaders. And the number of exchanges between the Pentagon and the Mexican military has increased drastically, from 3 events in 2009 to nearly 100 last year, according to a report in Small Wars Journal, an independent online military publication.
''One of the most important bilateral relationships the United States has is with Mexico, and neither side is going to abandon it,'' said another former senior D.E.A. official. ''Yes, there are significant concerns, but when they come up you try to isolate them, limit their impact and move on.''
The American effort to prevent General García Ochoa's promotion was just such an exercise in containment, with the Americans quietly moving to weed out Mexican officials suspected of corruption because they feared Mexican institutions would not be willing or able to do so on their own.
Misgivings Aired
After September's Independence Day parade, senior American officials gathered in Mexico City for two days of meetings to assess their suspicions about the general, and to discuss whether or not to share those misgivings with their Mexican counterparts.
According to a Mexican official, the Americans eventually did share their concerns about the general, less than a week before Mr. Peña Nieto announced his cabinet appointments. The official said the American ambassador met in Mexico City with two senior aides to the incoming leader, including Miguel Ángel Osorio Chong, who later became interior minister, and Jorge Ramírez Marin, a former national security adviser.
The official said Mr. Wayne, the ambassador, had discussed Washington's concerns about the general, emphasizing that the allegations had not been corroborated.
''The timing was important,'' the Mexican official said, ''because Mexican presidents almost never replace the person they appoint as defense minister, so whoever was chosen would be involved with setting the terms of cooperation for the next six years.''
In the end, General García Ochoa did not get the job. Instead, it went to Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda, who Mexican officials said had become close with Mr. Peña Nieto when he served as governor of the state of Mexico and General Cienfuegos commanded the area's military base.
As for General García Ochoa, he was dispatched to a military base in the northern border state of Coahuila, a hotbed of cartel-related prison breaks, police corruption and political assassinations.
Whether Washington played a central role in how things turned out for the general remains unclear. Meanwhile, a column in the Mexican newspaper El Universal debated whether his dangerous new assignment was a demonstration of the government's confidence in him, or a demotion aimed at forcing him to consider an early retirement.
Whichever the case, the general made a hasty departure from the military's headquarters in Mexico City. One person who knows him said he had emptied his office with the help of a handful of aides and dispensed with the usual farewell festivities.
On a day in December when defense ministers from across the hemisphere gathered for a summit meeting in Mexico City, the general was seen wearing civilian clothes, climbing into his personal car and driving away.

HIGHLIGHT: An unprecedented number of high technology start-ups, including Evernote and Spotify, are valued at $1 billion or more and remain privately held. With the size comes bigger expectations. 

 BODY:
The number of privately held Silicon Valley start-ups that are worth more than $1 billion shocks even the executives running those companies, reports Quentin Hardy in Tuesday's New York Times. 
"I thought we were special," said Phil Libin, chief executive of Evernote, as he counted his $1 billion-plus peers. 
He started Evernote, an online consumer service for storing clippings, photos and bits of information, in 2008 on the eve of the recession and built it methodically. "A lot of us didn't set out to have a big valuation, we're just trying to build something that lasts," Mr. Libin said. "There is no safe industry anymore, even here."
But an unprecedented number of high technology start-ups, easily 25 and possibly exceeding 40, are valued at $1 billion or more. Many employees are quietly getting rich, or at least building a big cushion against a crash, as they sell shares to outside investors. Airbnb, Pinterest, SurveyMonkey and Spotify are among the better-known privately held companies that have reached $1 billion. But many more with less familiar names, including Box, Violin Memory and Zscaler, are selling services to other companies.
The owners of these companies say the valuations make them giddy, but also create unease. Once $1 billion was a milestone, now it is also a millstone. Bigger expectations must be managed and greater uncertainty looms.

HEADLINE: Silicon Valley's Favorite Stories

BYLINE: DAVID STREITFELD


HIGHLIGHT: American Experience, the PBS history series, has told the history of the Silicon Valley from the beginning. It is a lively but idealized portrait. 

 BODY:
Silicon Valley rose up en masse last year to trash the reality series "Start-Ups: Silicon Valley," mostly for the sin of making it look as if just about anyone who was good-looking and self-confident could start an Internet company. If you were striving here to succeed or were covering those trying to succeed, wouldn't you want to believe that skill if not genius was required too?
All those critics will find PBS's "Silicon Valley," airing Tuesday night as part of the long-running "American Experience" series, much more to its liking. It tells once again the stories that Silicon Valley loves to hear about itself: how the modern notion of innovation was created in a bunch of former cherry, apricot and almond orchards; that white-collar workers first realized here that they could tell management to stuff it and go get a better job down the street, and that building the future was not and never is about the money. 
"Silicon Valley" - can't anyone come up with a more distinctive title for shows about Silicon Valley? - goes all the way back to the beginning, which means 1955. That was when William Shockley, the co-inventor of the transistor, set up the Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory in Mountain View, 40 miles south and a world away from San Francisco. He was a genius but domineering and paranoid, and the bright young things he hired soon rebelled. In the key moment in Silicon Valley's history, eight of them decamped for a new firm, Fairchild Semiconductor. Their young leader, Robert Noyce, set up a new kind of company at Fairchild, one that was all about openness and risk. The rigid hierarchy of the East was eliminated. So was the conspicuous consumption. The money doesn't seem real, Noyce was quoted as saying. It's just a way of keeping score. Silicon Valley executives have repeated that line ever since.
Noyce and Fairchild developed the first workable integrated circuit, without which America might never have reached the moon. But the company was unstable in the Shockley tradition, and the bright young things went out to start new companies. Most are long forgotten but one, Intel, powered the microprocessor revolution that gave us our present-day nirvana of pornography on demand and same-day diaper shipping.
The story is fluidly told by the director Randall MacLowry, who expertly juggles between stock footage of highways and factories and snippets of interviews by historians and those who were there, including two of the eight defectors, Jay Last and Gordon Moore. But the brisk format and need for compelling video does not really lend itself to the thoughtful exploration these themes demand.
For instance, Silicon Valley might have pioneered the idea that workers do not have to be tied to the same company for their entire working life, but lack of loyalty now cuts two ways. I doubt many of the millions of employees abruptly cut loose during the Great Recession look fondly on this innovation. What Noyce and his colleagues created in Silicon Valley was less the model for American workers, as it is so often portrayed, than a vivid but unreachable dream.
At the end of "Silicon Valley," Noyce remains a blank. He may have been brilliant but he did not have the outrageousness of Steve Jobs, which is why this is a PBS documentary and Jobs is a feature film starring Ashton Kutcher. Noyce also died way too young, in 1990 at the age of 62. His obituaries were brief.
The documentary misses an opportunity when Michael S. Malone, one of its historians, talks about how for the Fairchild elite there was "a constant tension between being masters of the universe and living a small-town life. That tension drove these guys on." It's an intriguing point, but then the show drops it. To see this proposition developed at length, it's necessary to go back to the medium of print - specifically, Tom Wolfe's 1983 Esquire classic, "The Tinkerings of Robert Noyce," reprinted in his collection "Hooking Up" but posted on the Web for some reason at a Stanford University URL. A half-second's Googling finds it.
Wolfe's theory is that Silicon Valley's spiritual home is the Midwest, where Noyce and other technology creators grew up. "In a small town, when something breaks down, you don't wait around for a new part, because it's not coming," Noyce says. "You make it yourself." Wolfe also says Noyce wasn't adverse to spending money; he just didn't like to be obvious about it. And finally, he lays bare the rarely seen underbelly of the valley by quoting Andrew Grove, one of the first Intel employees and its chief executive during the glory years in the 1980s. At employee meetings, Wolfe writes, Grove would ask, "How would you sum up the Intel approach?"
"Many hands would go up, and Grove would choose one, and the eager communicant would say: 'At Intel you don't wait for someone else to do it. You take the ball yourself and you run with it.' And Grove would say: 'Wrong. At Intel you take the ball yourself and you let the air out and you fold the ball up and put it in your pocket. Then you take another ball and run with it and when you've crossed the goal you take the second ball out of your pocket and reinflate it and score twelve points instead of six.' "
Now that is the real Silicon Valley. Some day someone will capture it in a documentary.

HEADLINE: Justice Department Faces Uphill Battle in Proving S.& P. Fraud

BYLINE: PETER J. HENNING and STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: The Justice Department in a civil complaint accused Standard &#038; Poor's of issuing faulty credit ratings on securities tied to mortgages. While the document is chock full of dubious actions, it may be hard to prove the behavior amounts to fraud. 

 BODY:
The Justice Department accused Standard & Poor's of issuing faulty credit ratings on securities tied to mortgages. The 119-page civil complaint is chock-full of e-mails that paint a picture of shoddy practices and greed as S.& P. purportedly watered down its standards to generate more business. 
But whether the company's practices equate to fraud will be difficult to prove. 
The government is bringing charges under a provision of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, a statute adopted in 1989 during the savings and loan crisis to make it easier to pursue fraud cases in the banking business. The law allows for a penalty of up to $1 million for each violation of the mail, wire and bank fraud statutes for conduct "affecting" a federally insured financial institution. 
 The statute is designed to help the government recoup money it expended bailing out any failed bank. In this case, the government is suing over the failure of Western Federal Corporate Credit Union and other unnamed financial institutions. 
The statute was rarely used until recently, when the Justice Department apparently found it useful for cases arising out of the financial crisis. The United States attorney's office in Manhattan sued Wells Fargo and Bank of America in October for penalties related to their mortgage operations.
The benefit of using the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act is that one only needs to meet the lower burden of proof in civil cases of a "preponderance of the evidence" while still being able to use the broad mail and wire fraud statutes. This is in contrast to criminal charges, which require that prosecutors prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. 
The government probably thinks it has some smoking guns. The complaint claims that S.& P. continued to rate subprime mortgage securities highly as the financial crisis began to hit and the securities looked increasingly shaky. 
The Justice Department also contends that S.& P. helped fuel the financial crisis. In the first half of 2007, the company rated a number of large mortgage-backed securities, bestowing top grades on the investments. It then quickly downgraded the securities, which defaulted in months.
Then there is the usual array of inappropriate e-mails and text messages. One riffs on the Talking Heads song "Burning Down the House," creating new lyrics: "Subprime is boi-ling o-ver. Bringing down the house." Another e-mail from an analyst in response to a question about how his new job was going reads: "Job's going great. Aside from the fact that the M.B.S. world is crashing, investors and the media hate us and we're all running around to save face ... no complaints."
Despite the colorful e-mails, the Justice Department will face an uphill battle, even with the lower burden of proof. 
The first problem is that Justice Department will have to demonstrate that S.& P. acted inappropriately. The government will have to prove that ratings were in fact faulty, and published intentionally so as to deceive investors in the securities. In response, S.& P. could simply argue that the company was just as blinded by the financial crisis as anyone else, and that questionable e-mails are simply the work of lower-level employees who were not involved in the decision-making. 
In other words, S.& P. lacked the intent necessary to prove fraud. 
Even if the Justice Department can prove the agency acted to deceive investors, it still has to deal with something lawyers call reliance. In other words, did investors rely on these ratings to make their decisions? 
S.& P. did not deal directly with any investors, working only with the issuers and receiving payment for its ratings. In fact, most offering documents for these securities specifically told investors not to rely on the ratings. While that does not preclude finding that the company engaged in a fraudulent scheme, it does make it more difficult to show the link between purportedly shoddy ratings and any direct effect on the investors. 
Perhaps more important is that S.& P. was not the only company that rated the securities. Typically, a security was also rated by at least one of the other two major rating agencies, Fitch Ratings and Moody's Investors Service. They have not been accused of any misconduct by the Justice Department, and S.& P. can point to its competitors' ratings as proof that it did not intend to mislead investors. 
In its complaint, the government asserts that S.& P.'s fraudulent scheme "caused" investors to buy the securities, but the ratings by other firms may well have contributed to that decision. By only suing S.& P., the Justice Department will have to show that the company's ratings played a major role in the investment decision.
Even if a fraud claim is established, S.& P. is sure to raise an old defense: the First Amendment's protection for freedom of the press. The credit rating agencies have fought lawsuits accusing them of negligence and fraudulent misrepresentation by arguing that they are financial journalists whose ratings are only opinions on the future prospects of the securities. Under the Supreme Court's decision in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, a plaintiff suing a member of the press would have to prove "actual malice." It is a difficult standard to meet.
Although S.& P. and the other firms have successfully offered this defense to get cases dismissed, federal courts have been less receptive of late. For example, a Federal District Court judge in New Mexico rejected the argument of the three major credit rating agencies that the First Amendment protected their ratings on a mortgage-backed security, finding that the limited distribution of the information meant that their statements did not receive the full protection afforded by the Constitution. 
In another case in August, Judge Shira A. Scheindlin of Federal District Court in Manhattan also refused to dismiss a case against Moody's and S.& P. on the basis of the First Amendment's protections. She wrote that "ratings are actionable if (they) both misstated the opinions or beliefs held by the rating agencies and were false or misleading with respect to the underlying subject matter they address."
By accusing S.& P. of fraud, the Justice Department may be able to undermine any First Amendment claim by the company. The protections afforded by the Constitution do not extend to statements made as part of a fraudulent scheme. By charging that the ratings were designed to help the company generate new business, the government may block S.& P. from having the complaint dismissed before trial.
But even if the Justice Department can fight off the First Amendment issue, it must prove that S.& P. ratings were the product of intentional fraud and not just stupidity. It also must show that investors actually cared about the ratings. This could be tough, since the ratings agencies were notorious for getting it wrong. After all, Enron carried a triple-A rating just weeks before its collapse. 
While one might think disgust with financial institutions and distaste for ratings agencies will carry the day, the government has had a hard time winning fraud cases in court when juries actually look at the facts. It all means that the Justice Department will have its work cut out for it this time.

HEADLINE: S.& P. E-Mails on Mortgage Crisis Show Alarm and Gallows Humor

BYLINE: MARY WILLIAMS WALSH and RON NIXON


HIGHLIGHT: In 2006, some executives at Standard &#038; Poor's pushed to revise the firm's rating models in hopes of preserving market share, while others expressed deep concerns about the poor performance of the securities, according to court documents. The credit rating agency has called the suit "meritless." 

 BODY:
 10:17 p.m. | Updated 
The executive at Standard & Poor's was clear: "This market is a wildly spinning top which is going to end badly."
That sober assessment of certain mortgage-related investments, delivered to colleagues in a confidential memo in December 2006, is now part of a trove of internal e-mails and documents that have come to light in a federal suit against S.& P., the nation's largest credit ratings agency.
The correspondence, made public in court documents late Monday, provide a glimpse at the inner workings of an institution that the Justice Department says fraudulently inflated credit ratings, with dire consequences for the entire economy. In a series of e-mails, tensions appeared to be escalating inside the firm's headquarters in Lower Manhattan as it publicly professed that its ratings were valid, even as the home loans bundled into mortgage-backed securities, or M.B.S., were failing at accelerating rates.
One comes from an S.& P. analyst in March 2007 borrowing from the Talking Heads song "Burning Down the House," creating new lyrics: "Subprime is boi-ling o-ver. Bringing down the house." S.& P. said prosecutors cherry-picked e-mails and that it would vigorously defend itself from "these unwarranted claims." 
In another 2007 e-mail, an analyst responds to a question about his new job: "Job's going great. Aside from the fact that the M.B.S. world is crashing, investors and the media hate us and we're all running around to save face ... no complaints."
Together, the documents show a portrait of some executives pushing to water down the firm's rating models in the hope of preserving market share and profits, while others expressed deep concerns about the poor performance of the securities and what they saw as a lowering of standards.
The United States attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., joined by attorneys general from 16 states, unveiled the case on Tuesday in Washington, accusing S.& P. and its parent, the McGraw-Hill Companies, of intentionally propping up ratings of shaky mortgage investments and setting them up for a crash when the financial crisis struck.
The government is seeking $5 billion in penalties to cover losses to investors like state pension funds and federally insured banks and credit unions. The amount would be more than five times what S.& P. made in 2011.
"The action we announce today marks an important step forward in the administration's ongoing effort to investigate - and punish - the conduct that is believed to have continued to the worst economic crisis in recent history," Mr. Holder said.
The government, by bringing the civil fraud charges under a 1989 law created after the savings and loan crisis, faces a lower burden of proof when the victims are federally insured banks. But prosecutors could still face a high bar in convincing a jury by a preponderance of evidence that S.& P. knew that its ratings were faulty and that it intended to deceive investors.
"If the facts prove out, it certainly seems like Standard & Poor's intentionally cooked its models in order to make the ratings higher than they otherwise thought they should be, in violation of the firm's own policies and standards," said Neil Barofsky, a former federal prosecutor who served as the special inspector general for the United States Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program from 2008 to 2011.
"What we don't know yet is, what's the other stuff that could be out there?" he added, noting that the vast body of internal documents might also contain exculpatory material for S.& P.
The ratings agency said in a statement: "Claims that we deliberately kept ratings high when we knew they should be lower are simply not true."
The company said that it had always been committed to "providing independent opinions on creditworthiness based on available information," and that its actions reflected its best judgments about the investments at the heart of the suit - about 40 collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.'s, an exotic type of security made up of bundles of residential mortgage-backed securities, which in turn were composed of individual home loans. Those securities were packaged by banks, rated by S.& P. and sold to investors in 2007.
"Unfortunately," the company's statement said, "S.& P., like everyone else, did not predict the speed and severity of the coming crisis and how credit quality would ultimately be affected."
Remarks that S.& P. employees made in internal memos and electronic communications show that as early as spring 2004, certain executives wanted to change the firm's rating methodology, but only after polling "an appropriate number of issuers and investment bankers" as to the "rating implications."
The idea of asking bankers what they thought about a change in the firm's methods shocked some S.& P. analysts and executives, including one who fired back, "What does 'rating implication' have to do with the search for truth? Are you implying that we might actually reject or stifle 'superior analytics' for market considerations?"
In May 2004, an analyst warned that S.&. P. had just lost to its competitor Moody's Investors Service the chance to rate a very large deal by being too hard-nosed about the amount of collateral that would be required to get a good rating. More collateral would mean less profit for Mizuho, the bank putting that deal together.
"We must address this now," she said - otherwise the firm would lose more deals.
The complaint describes a debate in 2004 and 2005 about whether S.& P. should change its model for rating C.D.O.'s and what effect the proposed changes might have on its business. The change was scheduled for July 2005, but before it could happen, an analyst sent an e-mail saying that according to the investment bank Bear Stearns, the older model "had been the 'best' " at rating weaker pools of mortgages, compared with Moody's and Fitch.
As the housing market deteriorated in early 2007, the gallows humor in the e-mails intensified. Banks that had created mortgage-backed securities were unloading them quickly, to avoid being stuck with any duds.
"That means the market will crash," one analyst told another in an instant message. "Deals will rush in before they take further loss."
"Yes," said the analyst's colleague. "We should not push criteria," continued the first, "but we give in anyway. Ahahhahaha."
About a month later, another S.& P. employee wrote in another instant message, reproduced in the complaint: "We rate every deal. It could be structured by cows and we would rate it."
In its statement Tuesday, S.& P. said that the cow e-mail "had nothing to do with R.M.B.S. or C.D.O. ratings or any S.& P. model, and the analyst had her concerns addressed with the issuer before S.& P. issued any rating."
S.& P. said that there was a robust internal debate about how a rapidly deteriorating housing market might affect the C.D.O.'s, "and we applied the collective judgment of our committee-based system in good faith," adding, "The e-mail excerpts cherry-picked by D.O.J. have been taken out of context, are contradicted by other evidence, and do not reflect our culture, integrity or how we do business."
It was unclear whether the Justice Department was looking at the other two major ratings agencies, Moody's and Fitch. Tony West, the acting associate attorney general, said he would not discuss actions against other ratings agencies.
Settlement talks between S.& P. and the Justice Department broke down in the last two weeks after prosecutors sought a penalty in excess of $1 billion and insisted that the company admit wrongdoing, several people with knowledge of the talks said. S.& P. had proposed a settlement of about $100 million, while the government pressed for an admission of guilt to at least one count of fraud, said the people.
McGraw-Hill shares fell nearly 11 percent on Tuesday. Moody's shares fell about 9 percent, to $45.09.
 Andrew Ross Sorkin, Michael J. de la Merced and Floyd Norris contributed reporting.

HEADLINE: An X-Ray of Russian Corruption

BYLINE: JESSE NEWMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Has corruption become so ingrained in Russian society that it is almost part of the nation's genetic code? Using a panoramic camera, Misha Friedman explored how people accept corruption and shortcuts in daily life. 

 BODY:
Before James Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins won the Nobel Prize for their discovery of DNA's double helix, "Photo 51" - an X-ray photograph - helped them identify the molecule's complex structure. And just as photography made visible what scientists suspected, Misha Friedman is training his camera on what seems like a common trait in his national genetic code.
Corruption. 
Mr. Friedman has journeyed through Russia and created a series called "Photo51 - Is Corruption in Russia's DNA?" But his images are not documentary evidence of corrupt acts. Rather, they are a visual tour of the ways in which public corruption manifests itself in people's private lives, radiating outward through Russian society, touching ordinary men and women, and becoming the norm.
"The helix has two lines," Mr. Friedman said. "In a lot of situations, it is really the government that is at fault. But the other helix has to do with the private sector. It has nothing to do with the state. It's all about the behavior of individuals - their complacency and their acceptance of the unacceptable."
Wandering the streets of St. Petersburg and Moscow last summer, and visiting small towns in Karelia and the Ural Mountains, Mr. Friedman found traces of political corruption everywhere, from a polluted nuclear complex (Slides 7 and 18) to a crooked festival (Slide 4) to a toxic slag heap at a copper smelting plant (Slide 12).
But what he was most interested in - and troubled by - was the social corrosion and decay that he saw on display, as when policemen and bystanders watched a man beat a woman in broad daylight (Slide 5). Or when a group of teenagers roped off their remote campsite with tape from a crime scene (Slide 2).
The biggest challenge, he said, was documenting how corruption plays out in people's everyday lives without condemning individual citizens.
"There's so much bureaucracy and inconvenience all around that all you want on a daily basis is to simplify," Mr. Friedman said. "Simplify your routine so you can get to work. So you can get anything done. To get most things done faster, or more efficiently, you have to navigate the system because the laws are so ambiguous."
Mr. Friedman, 35, is no stranger to the challenges of daily living in Russia. Born and raised in what is now Moldova but was then part of the Soviet Union, he remembers watching his father bribe traffic policemen. In 1991, when he was 14, Mr. Friedman immigrated to the United States with his family. He studied economics and international relations in school and went to work for nongovernmental organizations abroad, spending five years with Doctors Without Borders in Africa, Asia and the former Soviet Union.
In 2005, while working for Doctors Without Borders in Darfur, Sudan, Mr. Friedman picked up a camera and began taking pictures. Three years later, while working in Chechnya, he started to pursue photography in earnest. He spent almost five years shooting a documentary project on tuberculosis and eventually quit his day job to become a professional photographer.
Last year, the Institute of Modern Russia, a United States-based nonprofit group that works to support democratic values and institutions in Russia, commissioned Mr. Friedman to make a visual record of corruption in Russia.
"Corruption is something you have to deal with from the moment you're born to the moment you die," he said.
This realization - that lawlessness, deceit, bribery, cronyism and impunity are deeply encoded within all aspects of Russian life - gave Mr. Friedman the idea to use a camera he had never tried before: a panoramic.
"I think it's important for projects to have appropriate technical solutions," he said. "I look at corruption as something that you are encircled by, surrounded by, your entire life. So I thought it would be interesting to use the panoramic format, with the idea of creating a spiral, connecting all the images into one."
The resulting photographs are stark, black-and-white images that each hint at something gone awry - in the body or soul - in Mr. Friedman's early home.
"It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do as a photographer," he said. "Doing a project on tuberculosis is not answering any questions, it's documenting facts the best way you can. Here it is trying to tackle questions that I have not seen visual answers for."
Mr. Friedman hopes his project will be the beginning of a conversation about how to deal with corruption in Russia. That's why the title of his project is an open question, he said.
"Let's talk about this," he said. "Maybe the reason why we can't solve corruption is because our definition is too narrow."
 An exhibition of Mr. Friedman's work will open on Feb. 15 and be on view through March 2 at 287 Spring in SoHo.

HEADLINE: New York to Washington on About One Gallon of Gas

BYLINE: STEPHANIE STEINBERG


HIGHLIGHT: A teenager built a three-wheel car to test the limits of fuel economy. 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - Imagine driving from New York to Washington on one gallon of gas. It may sound far-fetched, but a 17-year-old took the challenge.
Rami Bedewi of Potomac, Md., enjoyed building model cars as a child. The hobby continued in high school, when as a student at Georgetown Preparatory School he decided to build a vehicle he could actually drive. But what?
"You know, everyone wants to have an exotic sports car, but then I became more realistic, thinking, 'Well, what would be more practical in the world today?'" he said Saturday, standing near his creation on display at the 2013 Washington Auto Show. 
Mr. Bedewi settled on a one-seat hybrid that could travel the 230 miles from New York to Washington using a battery-powered motor and one gallon of gas. He called the project the "One Gallon Challenge" and said he spent two years tinkering with shelf components after school and on weekends.
The Web site 1gchallenge.com describes the technology this way: "The electric motor of the car directly powers the wheels, and the gasoline engine serves as a generator to charge the batteries."
He said there were a few mishaps along the way - batteries from a Chinese supplier caused a fire the first time he hooked them up, and he had to recut the chassis and push back the pedals after unexpectedly growing three inches, but the biggest roadblock was obtaining vehicle registration.
The Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration said the car didn't meet safety regulations, Mr. Bedewi said. His father, Nabih Bedewi, turned to the office of the Maryland governor, Martin O'Malley, to no avail. "It was an uphill battle," said Nabih Bedewi, an electrical engineer. The Bedewis then tried the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles, which issued a three-wheeled motorcycle permit within a week.
On March 12, 2012, Rami Bedewi set off at 5:30 a.m. from Jersey City.
"It was really windy that day," Rami Bedewi said. "I remember the car was swerving, and I had to make sure I kept control."
He drove 30 to 45 m.p.h on back roads with his mother leading and father trailing in their vehicles. Nabih Bedewi talked in his son's earpiece during the 12-hour journey to keep him focused, especially when they hit traffic leaving Jersey City.
"I think he was sort of getting a little frustrated that the first 15 miles took an hour and a half to two hours, so he thought he was never going to make it," Mr. Bedewi said of his son.
Rami Bedewi made four stops (five if you count the police officer who pulled him over in Delaware to check for registration) before rolling into his high school's parking lot in North Bethesda, Md.
The trip consumed one and a quarter gallons of gas, but he could have made it with less than a gallon if he had fully depleted his battery the last 50 miles, he said. Instead, he finished the trip on a fully charged battery, using an extra quarter gallon of fuel.
But he said he was not disappointed that he failed to meet his target.
"It was a fantastic experience," he said, grinning as curious auto show attendees circled the car.
Now 18, Rami Bedewi is studying mechanical engineering at John Hopkins University. He said he was considering a new challenge, but declined to divulge details.
"I'm thinking of other projects to pursue," he said, adding that he is still "figuring out time and resources."

HIGHLIGHT: Joe Flacco, the Baltimore Ravens quarterback and the Super Bowl's most valuable player, was presented the keys to a 2014 Corvette Stingray. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 Before the Super Bowl on Sunday, there was speculation that General Motors, which did not advertise on the broadcast, would have a presence at the game as part of Beyonce's halftime show. But when the pyrotechnics lighted up the Super Dome and Destiny's Child reunited on the football field, there was no sign of G.M. "It did not work out," G.M. said Monday of the possibility of a Corvette appearing in the show. What did work out was that the Super Bowl's most valuable player, Joe Flacco, received the keys to a 2014 Corvette Stingray. The Ravens quarterback becomes one of the first owners of the 450-horsepower sports car. The Detroit Free Press points out that the keys come with a dose of reality: a $25,700 tax bill. (USA Today) 
 Even as car sales figures have been rebounding, there are signs that Americans are actually driving less, MSN.com reports. Citing a study by the Frontier Group and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, MSN.com said "that Americans have been driving less since the start of the new millennium, well before the recession, and that the average American was driving 6 percent less per year in 2011 compared with 2004." Among the factors contributing to this are technologies, like teleconferencing, which reduce the need for driving, and a declining interest in driving among young people. (MSN.com)
 If the charge on your electric vehicle's battery is getting weak and you're in Bar Harbor, Me., no worries. The College of the Atlantic, an environmentally focused university, is allowing people with plug-in hybrid or electric vehicles to power up for free at its two charging terminals, The Bangor Daily News reports. Each charger is connected to the electric grid and to solar panels. They were donated by a Nissan dealership in Bangor. The college owns three electric vehicles, said Alex Pine, a third-year student. The chargers are available from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (The Bangor Daily News)

HEADLINE: Are Immigrants Taking Your Job? A Primer

HIGHLIGHT: There are a lot of competing studies (and pundits), but the general takeaway from conservative and liberal economists is that immigration is good for native workers' living standards over the long run. 

 BODY:
Immigration reform is back on the table, reviving debates about whether immigration is good or bad for American-born workers.
There are a lot of competing studies (and pundits) out there, but the general takeaway from conservative and liberal economists is that immigration is good for Americans' living standards over the long run. That's because immigrants raise the wages of native-born workers (and also lower the cost of immigrant-dense services like child care and cleaning). 
As scholars at the Brookings Institution's Hamilton Project explained recently, immigrants and native-born workers are generally complements, rather than perfect substitutes: lower-skilled immigrants largely sort into farming and other manual, low-paid jobs that the native-born don't want to do, and higher-skilled immigrants provide labor that high-tech companies cannot find enough trained American-born workers.
As a result, immigration creates new job opportunities for the native-born, with some particularly high-profile examples found in Silicon Valley. According to a Kauffman Foundation study, of the engineering and technology companies founded in the United States from 2006 to 2012, 24.3 percent had at least one key founder who was foreign-born. In Silicon Valley alone, this number was 43.9 percent. Even outside of Silicon Valley, entrepreneurship rates are higher for the foreign-born than the native-born, and start-ups are the greatest source of American job growth.
Academic research suggests that, over all, immigrants create modest but positive average wage increases from 0.1 percent to 0.6 percent for American workers, according to Michael Greenstone and Adam Looney, both of the Hamilton Project.
There is some disagreement about whether the wage benefits of immigration are evenly distributed among all workers, though.
The chart below was created by the Hamilton Project and is based on this 2008 study. It shows the results of two different economic models designed to estimate the effect that immigration from 1990 to 2006 is likely to have had on wages for American workers (after adjusting for inflation).
The purple bars represent estimates based on research by George Borjas and Lawrence Katz, and show that immigration may have lowered the wages of American-born high school dropouts by 4.7 percent and those of college-educated workers by 1.7 percent. The blue bars show the results of a different model, created by Gianmarco I.P. Ottaviano and Giovanni Peri, that finds that all educational groups likely benefited to some small degree.
For more on the history of the debate over how immigration affects wages, I suggest this 2006 article from The New York Times Magazine by Roger Lowenstein.

HEADLINE: The Spending Brownout

BYLINE: DAVID FIRESTONE


HIGHLIGHT: Congress seems determined to throw more than a million people out of work. 

 BODY:
For misguided reasons of ideology and inertia, Congress seems determined to throw more than a million people out of work over the next two years. This is the price of the unnecessary spending brownout known as the sequester, and today the failure to stop it became even more inexcusable. 
The Congressional Budget Office announced that all of the austerity approved in the last two years has brought the deficit down below $1 trillion for the first time in five years, ending up at $845 billion by October. And the C.B.O. made clear that fiscal tightening has come at a high cost: slow growth, a brake on hiring of new workers, and unemployment hovering close to 8 percent.
Despite that loud warning, the sequester is scheduled to go into effect at the end of this month, the first installment of which will cut $77 billion over the next seven months. The full sequester will eliminate as many as 1.4 million jobs, the C.B.O. has estimated.

The obvious solution is simply to turn off the sequester and further deficit-slashing until the economy has righted itself, but even Democrats are too afraid of the big-spender label to make that case. So today, President Obama appeared before the White House cameras with a second-best idea: delay the sequester for a few months and replace it with a mix of smaller spending cuts and revenue increases. The cuts could be targeted to minimize job losses, which would also be reduced by raising revenues and thus withdrawing fewer government dollars from the economy.
"There is no reason," the president said, "that the jobs of thousands of Americans who work in national security or education or clean energy, not to mention the growth of the entire economy, should be put in jeopardy just because folks in Washington couldn't come together to eliminate a few special interest tax loopholes or government programs that we agree need some reform."
During the delay, he suggested, Congress would have additional time to work out a longer-term solution to our budgetary problems.
Mr. Obama didn't specify what kind of revenue package he was seeking, although the basic outlines have been clear for months: eliminating various corporate loopholes and deductions for some high-income taxpayers, such as the break on carried interest. Most of these revenue increases would have a minimal impact on hiring.
Republicans immediately responded that that they will not consider any new revenues as a way to reduce or delay the sequester. "The president's proposal is nothing more than another tax hike to pay for more Washington spending," said Dave Camp of Michigan, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
The spending cuts were designed to goad them into accepting a balanced approach in order to avert the big cuts to the defense budget, which used to be one of the highest priorities for an earlier generation of party members. But younger Republicans don't seem to care about fewer fighter jets or naval bases; they want their spending cuts however they can get them, untarnished by revenue increases. Barring a breakthrough, it looks like their wish will come true in less than a month.

HEADLINE: Hillary 2013 Gives Way to 'Hillary 2016'

BYLINE: LUISITA LOPEZ TORREGROSA


HIGHLIGHT: From her farewell tour to her "Global Townterview," the U.S. secretary of state's final week felt a lot like the first week of the next campaign. 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - Hillary Clinton woke up today with no place to go - at least in an official capacity. 
This must have been something of a shock to someone who has lived in the public arena round the clock for more than 30 years, who has traveled nearly one million miles to 112 countries in just four years, who last week logged more speeches, interviews and farewell gatherings than many presidents and most secretaries of state have done in their last days in office.
But it's unlikely that newly minted private citizen Hillary Rodham Clinton, the most popular political public figure in the United States (she enjoyed a stunning 67 percent approval rating in the most recent poll) and one of the most admired leaders in the world, will really leave the public stage. 
In my latest Female Factor column, I write about the very male, very white Obama administration Mrs. Clinton leaves behind. 
As the world knows, many people think Mrs. Clinton can virtually have the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 if she wants it. These are very, very early days, of course, but it's still a good bet - at least right now - that she will get the chance to crack the highest glass ceiling and run for the presidency of the United States.
For now, she might kick back for a minute or two, let her mind unwind and her head recover, but she's already planning to write a memoir and will surely hop on a plane to globetrot for her signature cause, the advancement of women and girls worldwide.
It's unlikely, as some opponents might wish, that she will fade into the background, as some former presidents and public figures do once their time in office is up.
But then few of them have had such a sendoff. Mrs. Clinton's last days in office were a triumphant march, a command performance. 
The media gorged on her every move and every word. While policy experts and columnists - including here on Rendezvous - pointed out that she had no single overarching achievement as secretary of state, most gave her credit for her support of pro-democracy movements in the Arab Spring, her pivotal opening to Asia and strong stands on China, and, of course, her indefatigable work to help women and girls around the world.
The adulation at times knew few bounds. The new issue of Newsweek magazine put her on the cover with a headline that some people found premature, "The Most Powerful Woman in American History." And Mika Brzezinski, the co-anchor of MSNBC's "Morning Joe," said, "Where would all of us be without her?"
Overall, media and expert assessments of her tenure at the State Department have been measured, fair and positive. Few questioned her legacy and high stature among secretaries of state.
In the past week, there was her high-wire act before the Senate and House hearings on the killing of the U.S. ambassador to Libya at Benghazi; her love-fest interview with President Obama on "60 Minutes"; her series of interviews with the five major American networks; and her "Global Townterview" (above and here) on some of the world's top television networks. She fielded dozens of questions from her seat at Washington's Newseum. The questions were mostly admiring.
But Mrs. Clinton has long been a global celebrity.
"She is a bold and inspiring woman who has been a messenger and an actor of the great geopolitical challenges of today," said Veronique Morali, the president of the Paris-based Women's Forum for the Economy and Society.
"During her tenure at the State Department, promoting equal opportunities for women around the world became a mainstream and even a priority agenda item, one that U.S. embassies and policy-makers could no longer ignore," Ms. Morali said in an email. 
Here in Washington, Mrs. Clinton is, second only to President Obama, the Democratic Party's top political commodity. In the past week, progressive advocacy groups like Emily's List, Planned Parenthood and Human Rights Campaign took advantage of the Hillary Farewell Tour to send out promotional emails asking liberal-leaning voters to sign online thank-you cards to Mrs. Clinton.
By week's end over 170,000 people had responded, according to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The thank-you signatures for Mrs. Clinton will serve to build the email lists and databases of liberal organizations and the Democratic Party. 
Her last hour as secretary of state came on Friday afternoon at her home ground at the State Department. In thick eyeglasses (which she has been wearing since she suffered a concussion and blood clot) and bundled up in a trademark jacket, she spoke standing at the top of a stairway, leaning on a banister, appearing casual and at ease, by turns cheerful and forceful, upbeat and sentimental.
Then she stepped down and plunged into the thick, clamoring crowd. The shout went up, "Hillary in 2016!" 
Right then and there, surrounded by fans and eagerly pressing the flesh and mouthing thanks, she found herself at the center of a scene out of a political convention. It didn't seem so much a final goodbye as the beginning of a new campaign.

HEADLINE: Profit Slides 6% at Disney as Movie and TV Divisions Lag

BYLINE: BROOKS BARNES


HIGHLIGHT: Increases in costs for programming like basketball and football at ESPN provided a drag on the results from Disney's media networks unit. Walt Disney Studios struggled compared with the same period a year earlier. 

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES - Higher costs at ESPN and lower DVD sales resulted in a 6 percent declinein quarterly profit at Disney, the company said late Tuesday. But Disney's video game and Web unit finally swung to a profit and the conglomerate steered attention toward potential "Star Wars" growth.
Wall Street reacted positively; Disney shares climbed 3 percent in after-hours trading, to about $56. 
Robert A. Iger, chairman and chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, told analysts in a conference call that Disney's newly acquired Lucasfilm division is moving forward with "a few" additional movies that feature characters from the "Star Wars" universe.
Lawrence Kasdan, known for his work on "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi," and Simon Kinberg, a screenwriter whose credits include "Sherlock Holmes," are both working on the "stand-alone" films, Mr. Iger said. Disney has previously announced plans to make the seventh, eighth and ninth installments in the "Star Wars" saga; they will roll out over a six-year period starting in 2015 with one directed by J.J. Abrams.
Investors and analysts had been expecting a bumpy quarter. Disney made the unusual decision in November to note publicly some of its coming difficulties, like higher ESPN programming costs and a calendar quirk that would hurt theme parks by moving part of the New Year's holiday into a different quarter.
Even so, Disney beat Wall Street estimates of 76 cents a share. For the quarter, which ended on Dec. 29, Disney reported net income of $1.38 billion, or 77 cents a share, down from $1.46 billion, or 80 cents a share, in the same quarter a year earlier. Excluding one-time charges and gains, Disney reported 79 cents a share for the most recent quarter, the first in the company's fiscal year.
Revenue climbed 5 percent, to $11.34 billion.
ESPN had a significant impact on Disney's quarter, with programming expenses increasing for football and basketball. Those costs held back results for Disney's media networks unit, which houses the cable sports behemoth; operating income there increased a tepid 2 percent, to $1.21 billion. The growth came from the Disney Channel, ABC Family and higher ad sales at the ABC broadcast network.
Also dragging down quarterly results was Walt Disney Studios, which reported a 43 percent drop in operating income, to $234 million. The problem involved comparability: DVD sales for "Brave" and "Cinderella" were slight compared with disc releases in the same period a year earlier for "Cars 2" and "The Lion King."
Theme parks continued to be a bright spot. Operating income in Disney's parks and resorts division, watched as a barometer of the broader economy, increased 4 percent in the most recent quarter, to $577 million. Higher attendance at Disneyland Resort in California, where a "Cars"-themed area opened last summer, contributed to the growth, as did strong bookings on the company's Fantasy cruise ship.
Interactive media, a business unit that includes video games and Disney.com, turned to an operating profit of $9 million after 16 consecutive quarters of losses. The company cited growth from Disney-branded cellphones in Japan as part of the reason. But Mr. Iger told analysts that there would most likely be losses ahead. "We know we have more work to do," he said.

HEADLINE: Cantor Speech Expands His Visibility and Party Vision

BYLINE: JONATHAN WEISMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Eric Cantor laid out an expansive social agenda for the Republican Party on education, health care, job training and scientific research. 

 BODY:
Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, seeking to soften the image of a Republican Party that has been focused almost exclusively on budget cutting, laid out an expansive social agenda on Tuesday for education, health care, job training and scientific research - what he called "creating the conditions for health, happiness and prosperity."
Speaking at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research organization in Washington, Mr. Cantor, the House majority leader, joined a broader Republican effort to expand the party's appeal in the wake of last November's electoral beating and to move beyond an endless cycle of budget showdowns that began as soon as the Republicans took control of the House in 2011. He embraced offering illegal immigrants brought to the country as children a path to citizenship, a policy he once opposed. And though he has in the past endorsed proposals to turn Medicare into a system that offers seniors a fixed subsidy to buy private health insurance, Mr. Cantor on Tuesday embraced simpler approaches to cutting health care costs. 
"In Washington, over the past few weeks and months, our attention has been on cliffs, debt ceilings and budgets, on deadlines and negotiations," he said. "But today, I'd like to focus clearly on what lies beyond those fiscal debates."
That message was somewhat mixed, however. In the morning, leaders emerged from a meeting of the House Republican Conference to tout legislation demanding that President Obama produce a budget that balances in 10 years - or at least projects when it would come into balance. The afternoon was spent responding to the president's demand that Congress act now to head off automatic, across-the-board spending cuts to defense and domestic programs, set to begin in March. Those cuts, known as "sequestration," were set up in 2011 to help defuse the first - but not the last - showdown between Republicans and the White House over raising the government's borrowing limit.
But after a 2012 Republican campaign that revolved around such deficit debates, Mr. Cantor set out to show that House Republicans have a broader vision for governance - and to raise his own profile as a party leader.
He pointed to a San Francisco public schools policy that expands choice within the school system and allows financing to flow with students to schools that are most attractive. Under the policy, more money is awarded for low-income students, children with disabilities, and those that speak English as a second language.
"So there's an incentive for schools to seek the more vulnerable populations, and reasons for schools to differentiate themselves and to excel," Mr. Cantor said in a rare show of support for a city synonymous with political liberalism.
Federal school financing formulas should adopt the same approach, encouraging choice between public, private and charter schools, he said. Higher education assistance should encourage students to go into science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields by prompting universities to disclose unemployment rates and earning potentials for all areas of study. And the nation's visa and immigration system should be tilted toward offering foreign students studying science, engineering and technology a way to stay in the country.
"One of our priorities this year will be to move heaven and earth to fix our education system for the most vulnerable," he said. 
Financing for federal research should shift from social sciences to hard sciences as well.
Many of the policies Mr. Cantor embraced - school choice, streamlining federal worker training and changing labor laws to allow workers to eschew overtime for time off - have been Republican agenda items for more than a decade. But they have largely dropped off the radar screen for a singular focus on deficit reduction. His support for a comprehensive immigration overhaul might have been most noteworthy, although he kept his support to broad principles.
Moderate Republicans expressed relief that they would have new issues to raise with their constituents.
"It was just refreshing to hear someone talk about education," said Representative Richard Hanna, Republican of New York.
Representative Charlie Dent, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania, said, "As a party, we sometimes get too much into the green eyeshade discussion at the expense of everything else."

HEADLINE: Corporate Forces Endangered the Twinkie, but May Save It

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: While repeated changes in ownership and questionable management helped bring down Hostess Brands, bankruptcy may be the salvation of one of its most prominent brands, Twinkies. 

 BODY:
Snack cake aficionados rejoice, the Twinkie will live.
Its demise nearly came at the hands of corporate America's machinations. Its survival, however, depends on some of those same machinations. In the end, it was the extreme outcome of a liquidation in bankruptcy that made the 83-year-old brand salvageable.
The history of the cream-filled snack illustrates a number of the forces that have driven American capitalism over the last hundred years. Its first owner, Continental Baking Company, bought companies left and right in the 1920s, including the Taggart Baking Company, maker of Wonder bread, in 1925.
But the Twinkie was an in-house invention. It was created in 1930 by an executive working at Continental Baking who was looking for a product to sell after strawberry season ended, when the factory line for cream-filled strawberry shortcake sat empty. The yellowish, cream-filled Twinkie was a hit and the company quickly expanded. 
Continental Baking continued its acquisition spree and by 1968 it was a motley assortment of baking brands that fed on America's tastes for sweet and easy food. It was then acquired by Harold Geneen's ITT, a conglomerate that sold not only Twinkies but also munitions. There, the brand sat for 16 years until Continental Baking was sold in 1984 for $475 million to Ralston Purina.
By then the baking business had entered a slow growth phase as inflation in baked goods, which had allowed the company continually to raise prices, subsided. Ralston Purina was unable to produce growth in the brands and ended up selling the bakery for about $400 million in 1995 to Interstate Bakeries.
Interstate Bakeries became the largest bakery in the country, but the sentiment around the deal was aptly expressed by a food industry analyst, who said at the time that Ralston Purina's sale "basically allows them to get rid of a dog."
Interstate Bakeries was itself a mongrel of many brands put together by serial acquisitions. Unfortunately, Interstate turned out to be better at acquiring companies than managing them. The brands had been passed around often and in the traveling it appears management never could get a more coherent vision for the company other than acquiring yet more unhealthy brands and leaving them to languish.
Then, at the turn of the millennium, the company was hit by a double blow: a taste for health and less carbohydrates among consumers and a botched attempt to put an additive in its breads to give them longer shelf life. You can tell that something is wrong with a food company when its strategy to save itself is to make its food last weeks longer.
It was also not the time to lack vision. The company's historically high labor and food costs could no longer be covered up by rising prices. Consumers demanded ever cheaper snack food prices.
The company entered bankruptcy in 2004. More than four years later, it emerged, now owned by Ripplewood, which put up $130 million to acquire it. It was then that the company rebranded itself as Hostess Brands.
Despite the company's cost reductions, and its lowering the employee head count by about 10,000, that was still not enough. The company had more than $800 million in debt coming out of bankruptcy, which was actually over $150 million more than it started with. Not to mention that it had spent $170 million on advisers during bankruptcy.
Indeed, people close to Hostess also say that Ripplewood's plan was yet another merger: to sell the company to the Sara Lee Corporation. But when Sara Lee sold its bakery operations to Grupo Bimbo, there was no Plan B.
The company filed for bankruptcy again in 2012. It lost $341 million in the previous fiscal year, according to Standard & Poor's Capital IQ. And management, which had gone through six chief executives in a decade, had been unable to execute a turnaround plan.
When the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union drew a line in the sand in November and said it would rather risk liquidation, it was over.
It was a principled position that the brands would do better with a fresh start and new management. Hostess filed a plan to liquidate the company and fire almost all its 18,000 employees.
The news spread that the Twinkie had finally met its match, along with Wonder bread, the Devil Dog and all the other products. It was then that the mechanisms of corporate America were put in motion to revive Hostess.
Hostess's investment banks went to work and lined up potential bidders. In fact, they didn't have to do much, as the announcement of the company's liquidation and the publicity that followed brought in more than 80 bidders in a few days. It also led to a quick run on Twinkies and other Hostess brands.
The interest came as a surprise to Hostess. Its executives - fearing that liquidation would destroy everything - had worked hard with the Teamsters union for a plan to save the company, only to be frustrated by the bakers union at the last minute. But liquidation has proved to be the Twinkie's savior.
Instead of trying to work out a compromise by reorganizing in bankruptcy, the company used the bankruptcy process to escape all its past burdensome debts. Freed of 394 union contracts, more than $2 billion in pension liabilities and any need to retain factories, the value of the Twinkie was reduced solely to what people were willing to pay for the brand. News of the Twinkies demise was the best thing that ever could have happened to the company.
Two private equity firms, C. Dean Metropoulos & Company and Apollo Global Management, have agreed to pay $410 million to buy the Hostess business, including Twinkies. And Flowers Foods has agreed to buy Wonder and Hostess's other bread businesses for $360 million. Even Drake's will survive; McKee Foods has agreed to pay $27.5 million for the business.
These are so-called stalking horse bids. In bankruptcy there is an open auction of the liquidated business, which in this case is expected to occur in bankruptcy court in February and March, when others will bid.
All told, it appears that the sale of Hostess may reap over a billion dollars, almost twice what the creditors initially expected if it had not been liquidated. In other words, the liquidation of Hostess has made the company worth more.
There's a lesson here. While corporate machinations and passing along brands can damage them, the clean bill of liquidation allowed corporate America to re-evaluate the Twinkie.
Sure, there will be future battles as Hostess's old unions struggle to have their employees rehired and new management tries to restart the company. And nothing can heal the wounds of the employees who have lost savings and pensions as well as jobs.
But the brands will now come under better management and, we can hope, more capable owners who can turn to reviving these businesses. In other words, while extreme finance was the cause of Hostess's demise, it may very well now be the Twinkie's savior.

HEADLINE: Debevoise & Plimpton Drops Trusts and Estates Practice

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The law firm's move to get out of the estate-planning business comes as the legal industry continues to emphasize more profitable practices. 

 BODY:
Last month, the nation's leading trusts and estates lawyers convened at a Florida resort to discuss the latest in estate planning.
Between lectures and workshops, some of the lawyers exchanged whispers about an unsettling piece of gossip: Debevoise & Plimpton, the prominent white-shoe law firm, was eliminating its trusts and estates practice.
Debevoise's decision surprised members of the trusts and estates bar. If an institution as prestigious and financially sound as Debevoise was abandoning its practice, were they vulnerable too?
The news also raised eyebrows across the legal industry because it seemed to run counter to Debevoise's reputation for a strong partnership culture. At a time when many large law firms have discarded the traditional partnership model and embraced a more bottom-line approach, Debevoise has been seen as retaining an old-school ethos - a genteel law firm known for its camaraderie and decency. 
"It saddens me to see a great law firm terminate its estates department," said William D. Zabel, a partner at Schulte Roth & Zabel and one of the country's leading trusts and estates lawyers. "Although I don't know the reasons for this decision, it would seem to be a byproduct of the economics of our society, making the law into more of a business than a profession. That saddens me even more."
In a statement, Michael W. Blair, Debevoise's presiding partner, confirmed that it was jettisoning trusts and estates, and that the group's eight lawyers - including Jonathan J. Rikoon, the partner in charge of the practice - were trying to find another home.
"Debevoise supports the group in this process and will work to ensure that in this transition the needs of the firm's clients continue to be served," he said.
New York-based Debevoise is the latest big corporate law firm to discontinue the practice. In 2011, Weil, Gotshal & Manges, a 1,200-lawyer firm, got out of trusts and estates, deciding it did not fit the firm's business model. Another firm, Gibson Dunn & Crutcher, with 1,100 lawyers, ended its trusts and estates practice about a decade ago.
Corporate law firms once viewed trusts and estates as a small yet important practice that discreetly advised wealthy families. But drafting wills and trusts, and the legal matters that flow from that, is less lucrative than the primary revenue drivers at big law firms: multibillion-dollar corporate transactions and high-stakes litigation.
And there are problems with trusts and estates within a big law firm model. The practice, to use the law firm management parlance, is not as leverageable as other areas. Corporate and litigation partners generate big fees by assigning armies of junior lawyers to megamergers and complex lawsuits. By comparison, trusts and estates work requires far less manpower, which mean far less profit.
Another issue in sustaining these departments is that individual clients bristle at billable rates that now reach more than $1,000 an hour. While big corporations grudgingly pay those rates, wealthy families often resist them.
As a result of these dynamics, firms' trusts and estates practices have remained small and, in many cases, decreased. At the same time, firms have aggressively built up their corporate and litigation practices across the globe. They have also embraced hot, moneymaking practice areas like patent law and white-collar criminal defense.
There are some counterexamples to this trend, however. In 2011, seven trusts and estates lawyers from Weil, led by Carlyn S. McCaffrey, moved to McDermott Will & Emery, a firm with about 65 trusts and estates lawyers, one of the larger such practices. Another firm committed to trusts and estates is Katten, which has more than 50 lawyers in the group.
Joshua S. Rubenstein, the head of Katten's trusts and estates practice, said that his business went well beyond comforting bereaved spouses and children. A successful practice, he said, includes assignments like advising families in the sale of closely held companies, overseeing trust-related litigation or even assisting in the purchase of a yacht or private jet.
"If done right, a full-service, high-end trusts and estates practice can generate a lot of work for other areas of the firm," Mr. Rubenstein said.
As large firms have de-emphasized their trusts and estates practices, boutiques have sprouted up. Sanford J. Schlesinger, a former partner at the New York corporate firm Kaye Scholer, left in 2004 along with several colleagues to set up an 11-lawyer shop, Schlesinger Gannon & Lazetera.
Mr. Schlesinger lamented the demise of the practice at big firms, and said he thought they were missing a business opportunity.
"Families are going to pass more wealth in the next 10 years than in the history of humankind, and someone is going to have to shepherd that wealth transfer," he said. "These firms are making a shortsighted, profit-driven decision without a view of the long-term big picture."
Debevoise, started in 1931 by two young patrician lawyers, Eli Whitney Debevoise and William E. Stevenson, does not see it that way. Three decades ago, the firm's trusts and estates practice had six partners, including Barbara Paul Robinson, now retired and a former president of the New York City Bar Association, and Theodore A. Kurz, the former head of the department. Today, there is only one, Mr. Rikoon, 57, who declined to comment for this article.
The firm formed a committee to study its trusts and estates practice, which has advised families like the Lauders (cosmetics) and the Dolans (cable television), according to people with direct knowledge of the group. After concluding that the practice did not have enough business to expand, the committee recommended closing it down. The firm will continue to employ Mr. Rikoon and the seven other lawyers while they interview elsewhere, these people said.
One factor contributing to Debevoise's move to discontinue the group, people say, is its unusual lock-step compensation system, which pays partners in a narrow range strictly according to seniority. That means that Mr. Rikoon is paid on par with a star deal maker from the same law school year, while bringing in less business. This created some discord in the partnership ranks. Debevoise's profits per partner are $2.1 million, according to The American Lawyer magazine.
Debevoise, with 650 lawyers, recently made headlines away from trusts and estates. The firm advised a special committee of Dell's board on the $24 billion leveraged buyout of the computer company. And President Obama nominated the Debevoise partner Mary Jo White to run the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Stephen J. Friedman, a onetime Debevoise partner who is now president of Pace University, said that he was unaware of the facts involved in his former firm's decision to close the trusts and estates practice, but noted that organizations are often faced with business realities that require painful choices.
"It's sometimes necessary to make a decision that's in the best interest of the firm but can hurt individual partners and associates," he said. "That's not a happy experience, but it's sometimes the right thing to do."

HEADLINE: Many Relying on Home Equity for Retirement

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: A survey finds a big gap between what workers expect to need for retirement and what they've saved. 

 BODY:
Even though the housing market has not recovered, nearly half of older working Americans expect to use equity in their homes to help finance their retirement, a new survey finds. 
Roughly 47 percent of employed Americans ages 50 to 70 said they were relying on equity in their homes, the Retirement Check-In survey from Ameriprise Financial found. The finding is surprising, an accompanying report notes, because housing values in many parts of the country remain below the level they were before the recession. Also, 37 percent of homeowners say they're not on track to pay off their mortgage before they retire.
More people said they were relying on home equity now compared with before the recession, the report finds. When participants were asked whether, before the downturn, they had expected to rely on home equity to help pay for their retirement, just 39 percent said yes.
While the reason for that shift isn't entirely clear, the report says it is plausible that the loss in value of other investments during the recession may have been so steep that many older workers feel they have no other alternative, even if their homes are worth less than they used to be.
"My hypothesis is that people didn't think they were going to need to tap into equity because they thought they would have sufficient assets," said Suzanna de Baca, vice president of wealth strategies at Ameriprise Financial. "Now, despite the fact they have reduced home equity, the shortfall between what they've saved and what they need is greater."
The finding is typical of a "perplexing disparity" between Americans' emotional outlook for retirement and the reality they face, the report said.
For instance, nearly three-quarters indicated that their dream retirement included taking "really nice vacations." Yet, when asked if they would be able to afford the essentials in retirement, fewer than half said they felt "extremely" or "very" confident. And just 38 percent said they were confident they could afford the extras they had been anticipating in retirement, like traveling and hobbies.
The telephone survey included 1,000 employed Americans age 50 to 70, with investable assets of at least $100,000 (including employer-based retirement plans, but not real estate) and who are planning to retire at some point. Koski Research conducted the survey on behalf of Ameriprise Financial from Oct. 31 and Nov. 14, 2012. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.

HEADLINE: Babbitt Exhorts Obama to Protect Public Lands

BYLINE: JOHN M. BRODER


HIGHLIGHT: Bruce Babbitt faults the president for opening vast tracts of public land drilling and protecting less than some recent predecessors. 

 BODY:
Bruce Babbitt, the interior secretary in the Clinton administration and a former governor of Arizona, made one of his periodic forays out of the political wilderness on Tuesday to criticize the Obama administration for favoring oil and gas development over conservation on public lands.
Mr. Babbitt, 74, whose modest demeanor masked the sharpness of his critique of a fellow Democrat, said in a speech at the National Press Club that Mr. Obama was falling behind many of his predecessors in setting aside lands for wilderness while making vast tracts available for drilling. 
He noted that President George H.W. Bush and President Bill Clinton protected roughly one acre of public land for every acre made available for hydrocarbon development. Under President George W. Bush, Mr. Babbitt said, industry claimed 7.5 acres for every acre set aside for public use - although that figure does not include the 200 million acres of marine reserve near Hawaii that Mr. Bush decided to protect at the end of his presidency, which would have given him a better ratio than any of his predecessors.
"So far under President Obama, industry has been winning the race as it obtains more and more land for oil and gas," Mr. Babbitt said. "Over the past four years, the industry has leased more than six million acres, compared with only 2.6 million acres permanently protected."

"This lopsided public land administration in favor of the oil and gas industry cannot continue," he said.
Mr. Obama has pursued an on-again, off-again approach to onshore and offshore oil and gas leasing. Early in his presidency, he proposed a major expansion of drilling rights, then pulled back after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010. He approved oil exploration off the North Slope of Alaska, but industry has complained about the slow pace of leasing on Western lands.
Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, frequently chided Mr. Obama for his supposed hostility to oil and gas development on public lands.
Responding to Mr. Babbitt's speech, Jessica Kershaw, an Interior Department spokeswoman, said: "As Mr. Babbitt noted, the administration has charted an impressive course for conservation, including launching landmark conservation policies and making unprecedented investments to protect and restore vital lands and waters that support local economies, and we look forward to building on these historic achievements."
"Our guiding principle from the beginning has been a balanced approach to achieving an all-of-the-above energy strategy while also taking important steps to preserve our treasured landscapes, like the Grand Canyon and the Everglades and partnering with local stakeholders to support their conservation priorities," she said.
Mr. Babbitt, who has spent his years out of government practicing law, writing and speaking for conservation, proposed that Mr. Obama should right the imbalance by permanently setting aside four million acres of public lands and then maintaining a one-to-one ratio of preserved land to land leased for oil and gas development.
"If the president's annual goals for land conservation are not met, he should suspend quarterly lease sales until they are," Mr. Babbitt said. "The threat of lease suspension will provide a strong incentive for the Congress, and industry lobbyists, to act upon pending conservation legislation."
He acknowledged that it would not be easy with a hostile Congress and an aggressive and well-financed petroleum industry working against the president. He said Mr. Obama should make extensive use of his executive powers, including invocation of the Antiquities Act, to protect scenic and wilderness areas. He also said there was broad public support for conservation and 30 bills pending in Congress at the end of 2012 to protect five million acres at specific sites in 13 states from Oregon to Maine.
Representative Rob Bishop, Republican of Utah, chairman of the public lands subcommittee of the House Natural Resources Committee, said a significant majority of public lands was already off-limits to commercial development.
He sharply criticized Mr. Babbitt for the designation of the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument in Utah at the end of the Clinton administration.
"This locked up the nation's largest proven coal deposit," Mr. Bishop said in a statement. "Suggesting that the president hurry up and use the Antiquities Act to unilaterally establish new land designations clearly illustrates that Secretary Babbitt's agenda is purely political and has little to do with the vitality of states and communities."
He said the president should ignore Mr. Babbitt's advice, which he called "an arbitrary formula concocted by a former presidential cabinet member turned liberal activist."
This is not the first time Mr. Babbitt has jabbed a thorn in Mr. Obama's side. Two years ago, he blasted the president for failing to confront Congressional Republicans who advocated more mining, logging and drilling on public lands. He blamed political calculations by "munchkins" in the White House for what he deemed cowardice on conservation issues.
Many presidents, including Mr. Clinton and the second Mr. Bush, wait until late in their terms to use executive powers to set aside land for preservation.

HEADLINE: Ouster Sharpens Debate on the Sage Grouse

BYLINE: NATE SCHWEBER


HIGHLIGHT: The forced resignation of Nevada's wildlife director reflects resistance to his efforts to protect the bird's habitat. 

 BODY:
The ouster of a Nevada wildlife official has fanned a debate over whether the sage grouse can best be kept off the Endangered Species List by protecting its habitat or by killing more of its predators.
Kenneth Mayer, who had been the director of the Nevada Department of Wildlife and serves on regional and national committees that deal with sage grouse conservation, startled environmentalists and many Nevadans last week by announcing that Gov. Brian Sandoval had demanded his resignation. 
The federal Fish and Wildlife Service is assessing sage brush populations throughout the country and is expected to decide by the end of 2015 whether the bird should be listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act. Mr. Mayer maintained that it was his top priority to keep sage grouse populations healthy enough not to need federal protection. Many Nevadans fear that endangered status for the bird could mean restrictions on agriculture, development and energy production. 
Mr. Mayer's supporters had praised his ability to navigate the often-conflicting interests of ranchers, farmers, environmentalists, miners, energy developers and hunters in seeking to keep the sage grouse off the list. But critics said that his steps to protect its habitat went too far and risked hurting the economy. 
In one of his last acts, Mr. Mayer's department mapped nine million acres of remaining sagebrush ecosystems in Nevada and identified core areas of the birds' most vital habitat, as well as places with sparse numbers of sage grouse that it considered better candidates for development. 
"I just kept my nose down and tried to do the best thing for the State of Nevada and its wildlife because we need to keep the bird off the list and still provide many opportunities for energy developers," Mr. Mayer said in a telephone interview. "As the director of a state wildlife agency, if you try to do the right thing and base things in science, you're going to have your detractors."

In late 2011, the federal secretary of agriculture, Tom Vilsack, gave Mr. Mayer an award for his sage grouse conservation work, and Governor Sandoval publicly praised him. Mary-Sarah Kinner, a spokeswoman for the governor, said Tuesday that the governor remains dedicated to sage grouse conservation.
"The governor created the Sagebrush Ecosystem Council by executive order and believes that preventing the listing of the sage grouse is critical for the state of Nevada," she said. "The governor thanks Ken Mayer for his service to Nevada and wishes him well."
Tina Nappe, 72, a Reno resident who is a member of the state's Sagebrush Ecosystem Council, said that Mr. Mayer's ouster "sends a terrible statement about the state's commitment to science and habitat."
But Cecil Fredi, 74, president of a sportsmans' group called Hunters Alert who lives in Las Vegas and lobbied for Mr. Mayer's removal, said that the wildlife director should have focused more on killing the bird's predators than on protecting its ecosystem.
"What did Ken Mayer do? Nothing. Just habitat, habitat, habitat, which is a terrible thing for a person in his position to do," he said. "You get instant results when you poison a raven or shoot a coyote."
Biologists, however, say that destruction of sagebrush ecosystems, in which the sage grouse builds nests known as leks, is the direst threat to the bird. 
The largest member of the grouse family, the greater sage grouse, once numbered in the millions across the shortgrass prairie of the Great Plains. Human predation widened as the west was settled: Theodore Roosevelt hunted them as a young man working cattle in the Dakotas in the late 1800s, and in the early 1900s the bird saved countless homesteaders from starving. 
Biologists estimate that around 90,000 sage grouse are left in Nevada and northeastern California. 
Since 1999, ferocious wildfires have scorched three million acres, approximately 15 percent, of the sage grouse's remaining habitat in Nevada, biologists estimate. While sagebrush is returning to some of the burned areas, much of the land has been taken over by invasive weeds including cheatgrass and tansy mustard, neither of which provides refuge for the grouse. Meanwhile, agriculture, development and extractive industry continues to fragment sagebrush ecosystems.
David Bobzien, a state assemblyman, said that Mr. Mayer's ouster just before the start of the legislative session was jarring. "The suddenness of the director's removal potentially sends a message to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that Nevada is less than committed to science-based conservation measures necessary to prevent a listing," he said.
Mr. Mayer previously led the Nevada Department of Wildlife from 2007 until 2010, when Jim Gibbons, then governor, fired him under pressure from ranchers and hunters who said that the agency director had not killed enough coyotes and mountain lions to boost deer populations. 
Governor Sandoval rehired Mr. Mayer, only to demand his resignation two years later amid similar predator control complaints.
State budget records show that Mr. Mayer spent $400,000 to kill predators last year and invested more in that effort in several regions of the state than his predecessor did. He oversaw the killing of thousands of ravens in sage grouse habitat along with many hundreds of coyotes, dozens of raccoons, and a few bobcats and mountain lions. 
He said that out of fiduciary responsibility to taxpayers, he opted to invest less on predator control in regions where studies showed that coyote exterminations had no correlating effect on deer populations. 
Gerald Lent, 74, a former chairman of the Nevada Board of Wildlife Commissioners, dismissed Mr. Mayer's findings as "voodoo science."
"He was anti-predator control, and he says he's dedicated to wildlife in Nevada," said Mr. Lent, who had urged Governor Gibbons to dismiss Mr. Mayer. "That just burns me."
Jack Robb, 45, the new chairman of the Nevada Board of Wildlife Commissioners, said that lobbying did not influence Governor Sandoval's decision to ask Mr. Mayer to resign. There are some people taking credit for it and I can assure you they played no part in it," he said. "Science-based management is the highest priority of the governor, and I have no doubt that whoever Ken's replacement is will be science-based."
Cliff Gardner, 74, a rancher in Nevada's remote Ruby Valley who wrote editorials in The Elko Daily Free Press accusing the Department of Wildlife of suppressing studies showing the efficacy of predator control, said he was not optimistic about Mr. Mayer's replacement.
"I'm sure most of the people being considered for his job graduated from a college," he said. "These people are the cause of the destruction of wildlife."

In what would be the biggest buyout since the financial crisis, Dell was close to an agreement to sell itself to a consortium of its founder, Microsoft and the private equity firm Silver Lake for more than $23 billion, people briefed on the matter told DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced.
The final details were being worked out on Monday, and an agreement could be announced as soon as Tuesday, although the talks could still collapse, the people briefed on the matter said. The investors are expected to pay $13.50 to $13.75 a share, with Michael S. Dell, the founder, contributing his nearly 16 percent stake to the deal, worth about $3.8 billion under the current terms. Silver Lake would likely contribute about $1 billion, and Microsoft is expected to put in about $2 billion in the form of preferred shares or debt, the people added. Dell may also bring home some of its offshore cash to help finance the deal. 
"The question will now turn to whether taking the personal computer maker private will accomplish what years of previous turnaround efforts have not," Mr. de la Merced writes. "Mr. Dell has sought to move the company into the more lucrative and stable business of providing corporations with software services, spending billions of dollars on acquisitions to lead that transformation. The aim is to refashion Dell into something more like I.B.M. or Oracle. Even so, manufacturing PCs still makes up half of the company's business."
LIBERTY GLOBAL IN TALKS TO BUY VIRGIN MEDIA | Liberty Global, the cable company owned by the American billionaire John C. Malone, is in talks to buy Virgin Media, the British company said on Tuesday. Shares in Virgin Media rose almost 15 percent in early trading in London on Tuesday. The company's enterprise value is around $19.4 billion according to data from Thomson Reuters. "The British company, whose primary listing is on Nasdaq, is the second-largest pay-TV provider in Britain after BSkyB, which is partly owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. A potential deal for Virgin Media would put Mr. Malone head-to-head with Mr. Murdoch, his longtime rival," DealBook's Mark Scott writes.
U.S. ACCUSES S.&P. OF FRAUD | The Justice Department on Monday filed civil charges against Standard & Poor's, the nation's biggest credit-rating agency, accusing it of inflating the ratings of mortgage investments. "The suit, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, is the first significant federal action against the ratings industry, which during the boom years reaped record profits as it bestowed gilt-edged ratings on complex bundles of home loans that quickly went sour," Andrew Ross Sorkin and Mary Williams Walsh write in DealBook. More than a dozen state prosecutors are expected to join the federal suit, and New York's attorney general is readying a separate action.
 S.&P. "knowingly and with the intent to defraud, devised, participated in, and executed a scheme to defraud investors" in mortgage-related securities from September 2004 through October 2007, according to the suit filed against the company and its parent, McGraw-Hill Companies. The credit-rating agency also falsely represented that its ratings "were objective, independent, uninfluenced by any conflicts of interest," the suit claimed. S.&P., for its part, said it had acted in good faith. "A D.O.J. lawsuit would be entirely without factual or legal merit," the company said, adding that its competitors had given the same ratings to the securities believed to be in question.
"Settlement talks between S.&P. and the Justice Department broke down in the last two weeks after prosecutors sought a penalty in excess of $1 billion and insisted that the company admit wrongdoing, several people with knowledge of the talks said," Mr. Sorkin and Ms. Walsh write. "That amount would wipe out the profits of McGraw-Hill for an entire year. S.&P. had proposed a settlement of around $100 million, the people said. S.&P. also sought a deal that would allow it to neither admit nor deny guilt; the government pressed for an admission of guilt to at least one count of fraud, said the people. S.&P. told prosecutors it could not admit guilt without exposing itself to liability in a multitude of civil cases."
McGraw-Hill's stock tumbled almost 14 percent on Monday, to close at $50.30 a share.
HERBALIFE'S ELUSIVE SALES DATA | The hedge fund manager William A. Ackman has clashed with another big investor, Daniel S. Loeb, over whether the nutritional supplements company Herbalife is a pyramid scheme. Regulators scrutinizing the company will have an interesting problem, DealBook's Peter Eavis writes. "The public numbers do not provide a clear picture of who buys Herbalife products - and why. So-called direct-sales companies like Herbalife operate in an accounting gray area that allows them to book goods bought by its network of sales representatives as revenue. Most traditional retailers record sales when a customer buys something. The uncertainty has left shares of Herbalife vulnerable to wild swings in recent months."
Herbalife claims it is a strong company, but it is hard to discern the underlying demand. "The company doesn't specify how many of those products are eventually sold to customers outside the sales network. Nor does it detail how many products are consumed by members of its network."
One former saleswoman for Herbalife, Ana Arias, of Scottsdale, Ariz., is considering legal action against the company, estimating she lost $210,000 after three years in the company's network. "They want to make people believe there is this long line of consumers," she said. "I realized it was going to go nowhere."
ON THE AGENDA | The Commodity Futures Trading Commission holds a daylong public meeting starting at 9:30 a.m. on proposed rules to protect client funds held by futures commission merchants and derivatives clearing organizations. NYSE Euronext, BP and Sirius XM Radio report earnings on Tuesday morning. Zynga announces results in the evening. The ISM nonmanufacturing survey for January is out at 10 a.m. Apple releases its newest version of the iPad.
BRIDGEWATER SAID TO PLAN NEW FUND | Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund firm, has told investors it will start a new fund this year, to help make sure another fund does not get too big, The Wall Street Journal reports. The new fund, All Weather Major Markets, was described as a variation of its All Weather strategy, which returned 15.3 percent in 2012, gross of fees, according to the newspaper. The firm also said it had sold a minority equity stake to an outside investor whom it did not identify, the newspaper says. Last year, the Teacher Retirement System of Texas bought a $250 million stake in Bridgewater.

HEADLINE: Drinking Wine, From a Chore to a Choice

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV

 BODY:
Wine is old, ancient, neolithic. It has been consumed throughout recorded history. Yet wine as we know it today is relatively new. Where it originated, what it tasted like and represented, and how it was transformed over time are explored in Paul Lukacs's fascinating new book, ''Inventing Wine: A New History of One of the World's Most Ancient Pleasures,'' published in December by W. W. Norton & Company.
One thing is clear from Mr. Lukacs's work: most wine for much of history was vile, nasty stuff. If an ancient critic had etched a tasting note to describe the wine that most people drank, it might have read, ''Wretched, horrible, vinegary, foul.'' Yet people drank it anyway, because they had no choice. Other beverages like water and milk were disease ridden. Wine might have tasted awful, but alcohol was a built-in disinfectant. 
It was not until the Renaissance, writes Mr. Lukacs (who, when not researching wine, is an English professor at Loyola University Maryland in Baltimore), that familiar notions of discrimination came to be. Only then did wine connoisseurs, a minute group to be sure, begin to associate particular styles and qualities in wine with specific places, an early idea of terroir. And only then did astute wine drinkers begin to perceive that some wines could be appreciated intellectually and emotionally rather than just physically, and that the best wines conveyed a sense of balance, length and depth.
But it was really with the Enlightenment in the 18th century, when a series of revolutions began that would transform our understanding of grape-growing, wine production and wine storage, that wine began to resemble what we now take for granted.
''We're all children of the Enlightenment, not Plato and Aristotle, but Locke and Rousseau,'' Mr. Lukacs said over lunch recently in Manhattan. ''That's when modern wine emerged.''
Other changes occurred as well. As the water supply became safer, it was no longer necessary for people to consume wine. It became a choice. One could savor rather than drink, and so wine had to become more appealing. Nonetheless, through the early 20th century the vast pool of wine could be divided into two groups: a small amount of fine wine, or vin fin, which appealed to discriminating tastes, and most other wines, vin ordinaire, cheap and plentiful but not very good and often pretty bad.
''The gap between top wines and others was phenomenal,'' he said.
Wine enjoyed a brief golden age in the 19th century with the rapid rise of a middle class with economic resources and cultural aspirations. But it hit a roadblock in the late 19th century as disease assailed European vineyards, to be followed by world wars, economic depression, a fashion for spirits and cocktails, and Prohibition. Yet wine rose again in the second half of the 20th century.
Perhaps a bit smugly, as Mr. Lukacs and I shared a bottle of Il Frappato, a delightfully fresh red from the Sicilian producer Arianna Occhipinti, we agreed that we were lucky to be living in the present, perhaps the greatest time in history to be a wine lover. Sitting in a New York City restaurant, we had access to a greater diversity of wines, from more places and in more styles, than at any time in history.
Il Frappato was a perfect illustration of how much the world had changed not just over 2,000 years, but in the last 25. In the 1980s, few people had even heard of the frappato grape, and most wines from Sicily were regarded as heavy, oxidized or just plain bad. Sicily might have been one of the last bastions of vin ordinaire. Yet today, it is a fount of thoroughly exciting wines.
Mr. Lukacs, 56, who grew up outside Philadelphia, said he had always been inclined toward wine. His father, who is Hungarian, drank wine regularly. But Mr. Lukacs said he really became interested during his graduate years at Johns Hopkins, when he joined a book study group that quickly transformed into a wine group.
''What interested me about wine is that it's intellectually very, very rich,'' he said. ''You don't need to know, but you want to know.''
Along with his academic pursuits, he went on to write a wine column for The Washington Times for 19 years and to publish two other wine books, ''American Vintage: The Rise of American Wine'' in 2000 and ''The Great Wines of America: The Top Forty Vintners, Vineyards, and Vintages'' in 2005.
Among the most interesting points Mr. Lukacs makes in ''Inventing Wine'' is that the idea of ''tradition'' in wine has been thoroughly mutable. The notion of Bordeaux's illustrious past, for example, was very much a 19th-century creation by owners who built chateaus in older architectural styles in an effort to convey a sense of legacy. Current wine marketing, with its emphasis on heritage and continuity, draws from the same source.
Why did wine taste so bad for so long? As anyone who's ever tried to make wine knows, exposure to air, to dirt and to myriad other substances can cause wine to spoil. Not so it becomes unhealthy, just repellent. And so, for ancient and not-so-ancient winemakers, the challenge was, after fermenting grape juice into wine, to prevent the wine from spoiling.
Up until the 19th century, when glass bottles could be mass-produced, Mr. Lukacs writes, this was nearly impossible. Vessels of old, made of clay or wood, could hold large quantities of wine. But once you began to draw down the contents, air entered the picture with all its microbial companions. In an effort to compensate for sour, vinegary flavors, ancient vintners added all sorts of flavorings. Spices, yes, but also pitch and ash, and even lead and lye. Wealthier clients might afford a better brand of additives, like spices and herbs.
Eventually, ancient vintners discovered techniques for making longer-lasting wines, like drying grapes before fermenting them, which is somewhat reminiscent of modern wines like Amarone. These dried grape wines became highly sought after and came to be emblems of social privilege, foreshadowing, Mr. Lukacs writes, wine's future role as a status symbol.
''It was a way of distinguishing one's tastes from somebody else's,'' Mr. Lukacs said over lunch. ''Even in the ancient world, there were real distinctions between what the patrician drinks and what the plebeian drinks.''
Some things never change.

HEADLINE: Corporate Forces Endangered the Twinkie, but May Save It

BYLINE: By STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF. 
Steven M. Davidoff is a professor of law and finance at Ohio State University. His columns can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook. Follow @StevenDavidoff on Twitter.

 BODY:
Snack cake aficionados rejoice, the Twinkie will live.
Its demise nearly came at the hands of corporate America's machinations. Its survival, however, depends on some of those same machinations. In the end, it was the extreme outcome of a liquidation in bankruptcy that made the 83-year-old brand salvageable.
The history of the cream-filled snack illustrates a number of the forces that have driven American capitalism over the last hundred years. Its first owner, Continental Baking Company, bought companies left and right in the 1920s, including the Taggart Baking Company, maker of Wonder bread, in 1925.
But the Twinkie was an in-house invention. It was created in 1930 by an executive working at Continental Baking who was looking for a product to sell after strawberry season ended, when the factory line for cream-filled strawberry shortcake sat empty. The yellowish, cream-filled Twinkie was a hit and the company quickly expanded. 
Continental Baking continued its acquisition spree and by 1968 it was a motley assortment of baking brands that fed on America's tastes for sweet and easy food. It was then acquired by Harold Geneen's ITT, a conglomerate that sold not only Twinkies but also munitions. There, the brand sat for 16 years until Continental Baking was sold in 1984 for $475 million to Ralston Purina.
By then the baking business had entered a slow growth phase as inflation in baked goods, which had allowed the company continually to raise prices, subsided. Ralston Purina was unable to produce growth in the brands and ended up selling the bakery for about $400 million in 1995 to Interstate Bakeries.
Interstate Bakeries became the largest bakery in the country, but the sentiment around the deal was aptly expressed by a food industry analyst, who said at the time that Ralston Purina's sale "basically allows them to get rid of a dog."
Interstate Bakeries was itself a mongrel of many brands put together by serial acquisitions. Unfortunately, Interstate turned out to be better at acquiring companies than managing them. The brands had been passed around often and in the traveling it appears management never could get a more coherent vision for the company other than acquiring yet more unhealthy brands and leaving them to languish.
Then, at the turn of the millennium, the company was hit by a double blow: a taste for health and less carbohydrates among consumers and a botched attempt to put an additive in its breads to give them longer shelf life. You can tell that something is wrong with a food company when its strategy to save itself is to make its food last weeks longer.
It was also not the time to lack vision. The company's historically high labor and food costs could no longer be covered up by rising prices. Consumers demanded ever cheaper snack food prices.
The company entered bankruptcy in 2004. More than four years later, it emerged, now owned by Ripplewood, which put up $130 million to acquire it. It was then that the company rebranded itself as Hostess Brands.
Despite the company's cost reductions, and its lowering the employee head count by about 10,000, that was still not enough. The company had more than $800 million in debt coming out of bankruptcy, which was actually over $150 million more than it started with. Not to mention that it had spent $170 million on advisers during bankruptcy.
Indeed, people close to Hostess also say that Ripplewood's plan was yet another merger: to sell the company to the Sara Lee Corporation. But when Sara Lee sold its bakery operations to Grupo Bimbo, there was no Plan B.
The company filed for bankruptcy again in 2012. It lost $341 million in the previous fiscal year, according to Standard & Poor's Capital IQ. And management, which had gone through six chief executives in a decade, had been unable to execute a turnaround plan.
When the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union drew a line in the sand in November and said it would rather risk liquidation, it was over.
It was a principled position that the brands would do better with a fresh start and new management. Hostess filed a plan to liquidate the company and fire almost all its 18,000 employees.
The news spread that the Twinkie had finally met its match, along with Wonder bread, the Devil Dog and all the other products. It was then that the mechanisms of corporate America were put in motion to revive Hostess.
Hostess's investment banks went to work and lined up potential bidders. In fact, they didn't have to do much, as the announcement of the company's liquidation and the publicity that followed brought in more than 80 bidders in a few days. It also led to a quick run on Twinkies and other Hostess brands.
The interest came as a surprise to Hostess. Its executives - fearing that liquidation would destroy everything - had worked hard with the Teamsters union for a plan to save the company, only to be frustrated by the bakers union at the last minute. But liquidation has proved to be the Twinkie's savior.
Instead of trying to work out a compromise by reorganizing in bankruptcy, the company used the bankruptcy process to escape all its past burdensome debts. Freed of 394 union contracts, more than $2 billion in pension liabilities and any need to retain factories, the value of the Twinkie was reduced solely to what people were willing to pay for the brand. News of the Twinkies demise was the best thing that ever could have happened to the company.
Two private equity firms, C. Dean Metropoulos & Company and Apollo Global Management, have agreed to pay $410 million to buy the Hostess business, including Twinkies. And Flowers Foods has agreed to buy Wonder and Hostess's other bread businesses for $360 million. Even Drake's will survive; McKee Foods has agreed to pay $27.5 million for the business.
These are so-called stalking horse bids. In bankruptcy there is an open auction of the liquidated business, which in this case is expected to occur in bankruptcy court in February and March, when others will bid.
All told, it appears that the sale of Hostess may reap over a billion dollars, almost twice what the creditors initially expected if it had not been liquidated. In other words, the liquidation of Hostess has made the company worth more.
There's a lesson here. While corporate machinations and passing along brands can damage them, the clean bill of liquidation allowed corporate America to re-evaluate the Twinkie.
Sure, there will be future battles as Hostess's old unions struggle to have their employees rehired and new management tries to restart the company. And nothing can heal the wounds of the employees who have lost savings and pensions as well as jobs.
But the brands will now come under better management and, we can hope, more capable owners who can turn to reviving these businesses. In other words, while extreme finance was the cause of Hostess's demise, it may very well now be the Twinkie's savior.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Service Companies' Growth Slowed Slightly in January

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Growth at service companies slowed slightly in January as a result of weaker new orders and slower business activity. But hiring improved, providing a bright sign for the economy. 
The Institute for Supply Management said Tuesday that its index of nonmanufacturing activity dipped to 55.2 in January. That was down from 55.7 in December, which was the highest level in nearly a year. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion.
The modest decline from December's strong reading suggests the industry was not greatly hampered by an increase in Social Security taxes that reduced take-home pay for most Americans.
Companies did not single out the rise in payroll taxes in the survey, Anthony S. Nieves, chairman of the I.S.M.'s survey committee, said in a conference call with reporters.
The report measures growth in industries that cover 90 percent of the work force, including retailing, construction, health care and financial services.
Over all, economists were encouraged by the steady reading in the services index, as well as a sharp jump in the institute's January manufacturing index released last week. The reports suggest economic growth is rebounding in the quarter from January to March, after shrinking from October to December.
A gauge of hiring in the services report rose to its highest level in nearly seven years. That was consistent with the solid job gains reported by retailers, construction companies and other service firms in the government's January employment report, released last week.
Service and construction companies have added an average of nearly 195,000 jobs a month in the last three months. The increase in the employment gauge suggests the solid hiring will continue.
Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics, attributed the dip in the overall I.S.M. index to the Social Security tax increase. ''But this blow has been small and cushioned by stronger demand in other sectors, namely construction,'' he said.

HEADLINE: An Evolving West Harlem, Portrayed in a First Wave of Grant Requests

BYLINE: By KIA GREGORY

 BODY:
Some of the requests conjure images of a worn-down West Harlem: efforts to revive the arts in faltering schools; raise reading and writing skills for kindergarten and first-grade students; and help people with criminal records find jobs.
Others suggest a neighborhood that now feels different; there are requests to finance culinary classes, a youth soccer program and a tourism group to showcase the area's history and culture. 
The West Harlem Local Development Corporation was formed about eight years ago, through a community board vote, to negotiate on the community's behalf with Columbia University, set to redevelop a large swath of the neighborhood. The result was a benefits agreement that, among other things, requires Columbia to give the corporation $76 million to address neighborhood needs. Now, requests are in for the first of many grant cycles, and though only a fraction will be approved, the proposals themselves paint a nuanced portrait of West Harlem.
They suggest a neighborhood at a crossroads -- as it has been for many years now -- but in ways that have never been quite so clearly demonstrated.
''It's about the whole quality of life,'' Kofi Boateng, the executive director of the corporation, said of the breadth of the proposed projects, ''and preparing for the future.''
More than 100 pre-grant applications were received by the January deadline, and now a sifting process begins.
When the City Council approved the rezoning plan that cleared the way for Columbia to expand by 17 acres into Manhattanville, which is in West Harlem, the estimated $6.3 billion project was seen by some as a victory for the neighborhood. Others saw in it a hostile takeover. Local officials and community leaders brokered the benefits agreement -- some call it a concession by Columbia -- which includes $76 million set aside in a fund, to be paid out in installments over 16 years.
The corporation's first grant cycle, for this, the first year, will distribute $2 million to neighborhood nonprofit groups in March.
The agency received 101 applications for various projects, and most focused on education and economic development. Proposed budgets for the projects range from $5,000 to $350,000, the maximum, and together total $18.5 million.
''Most of the projects were very compelling,'' said Mr. Boateng, who noted that most of the organizations involved had a strong foothold in the community, though some had struggled to hold on to funds and volunteers over the years. ''This is going to be a case of feeding five thousand with five loaves.''
Selected projects must operate within West Harlem, defined in the community benefits agreement with Columbia as Manhattan Community District 9, which extends south to north from 110th Street to 155th Street, and east to west from St. Nicholas Avenue to the Hudson River. They also must focus on at least one of eight community need categories, defined as arts and culture; community facilities; education; employment and economic development; the environment; historic preservation; housing; and transportation.
One applicant, Skyponics Urban Farming, wants to teach about 25 youths how to raise organic fish and produce using an aquaponic system.
With its grant, a tenant advocacy group would expand legal aid to West Harlem residents fighting negligent landlords. Another nonprofit group would expand its year-round soccer and writing program to include 30 youths. A work force development group wants to train 50 West Harlem residents and ex-offenders for jobs in maintenance and customer service. The Creative Arts Workshops for Kids would hire about 35 teenagers and young adults to create large-scale artworks, including murals, in their West Harlem neighborhood. Through another program, underemployed artisans would train women with a history of incarceration and drug abuse to make jewelry, mosaics and other crafts in order to learn a trade.
The grants, however, are just one piece in the effort to strengthen West Harlem and only one part of the larger hope contained in the community benefits agreement, said Larry English, the former chairman of Community Board 9.
''At the end of the day, you can't judge whether this process is going to be successful until 10 years from now,'' Mr. English said. ''If the only thing is the W.H.L.D.C. gives away $76 million dollars, in my mind it's a failure.''
The number of grant applicants will be whittled down, Mr. Boateng said. Some will move on to the next phase of the process and will be asked to submit more detailed proposals. Others, he said, will be asked to reduce the scale of their projects, ''so we're not wasting anybody's time.''
''What's important,'' Mr. Boateng explained, ''instead of telling me 'I want to save 1,000 kids,' or 1,000 ex-convicts, show me how you can save 10.''
Some applicants, he said, will simply be asked to try again in June.
''We're all going to learn together,'' he said. ''These problems are not going to be solved in one year.''

HEADLINE: Resolve the Real Greek Crisis

BYLINE: By EDWARD P. JOSEPH and ANNA TRIANDAFYLLIDOU

 BODY:
FOR Greeks suffering from the wrenching pain of a long economic crisis, a youthful savior has emerged. Alexis Tsipras, the leader of the second-strongest party in Parliament, the Coalition of the Radical Left, or Syriza, is not yet 40, but his relentless attack on austerity has made him a favorite to head the next government.
Tsipras has been visiting power centers in Europe and the United States to bolster his credentials and to press his case for debt relief. He argues that Europe is bluffing with its threat to expel Greece from the euro zone if it doesn't implement severe cuts. 
But even if Tsipras wins the next election, he is likely to fail in his bid for an international conference that would provide dramatic debt relief. The reason is that Greece's main creditors, Germany in particular, suspect that Tsipras is bluffing as well. They know that the Greek economy hangs like a thread, and that failure to sustain debt relief would plunge Greece into economic free fall.
Thus the impasse over Greece that serves as a brake on Europe's recovery and has left a quarter of Greeks unemployed is likely to continue -- unless Tsipras widens his message. He could wring substantial concessions out of Germany and other creditors if he does what no Greek leader has managed to do: get Greeks to accept the need for national reform, not just austerity and not just debt relief.
The truth is that Greece is not only broke, it is broken. ''Uncompetitive'' does not describe the pathology of the Greek economy. It is a myriad of small businesses, unproductive subsidies, inflated state contracts and Byzantine regulations seemingly designed to inhibit productivity. In the past, it was sustained by tourism, olives and other small-scale produce, and, of course, loans -- which have evaporated. Real relief for Greeks can only come from foreign investment, not loans and not debt relief. And few will invest in Greece without real reform. Indeed, some of Greece's most successful companies are fleeing the country.
Ironically, even as segments of Greek society still unleash noisy protests, the public knows the truth: They are not innocent victims but willing, if small-scale, participants in a corrupt system. This helps explain why expressions of public anger have been -- given the breadth of the disaster -- relatively tame. A protest movement known as the ''aganaktismenoi,'' or the resentful, has emerged, demanding accountability. Long-concealed scandals have come to light, and some prominent members of the political elite have gone to prison, or face the prospect of being jailed. But there is no unifying agenda among protesters, many of whom are animated solely by the prospect of losing their benefits.
Moreover, for all their suffering, most Greeks are aware just how much worse their situation could become. They understand that they have a lot to lose if the country's fragile banks collapse or if the country defaults. The value of their euro-denominated bank accounts, if converted into new drachma, would plunge.
If anything, anger in Greece is focused outside the country, at Germany in particular, or disgracefully, on the most vulnerable people -- poor immigrants -- who have benefited least from the country's corrupt system. Either way, the misdirected anger only distracts Greece from much-needed introspection. And even when there has been reflection, such as the momentary pause in the spring and summer of 2010, Greece has been plagued by the paralysis of collective responsibility: ''So maybe I didn't pay my taxes, but who did?''
The focus of Greek energy these days is not on how to fix the country, but rather on how to survive within the existing system.
At their core, Greeks know better and are not condemned to perpetual cynicism and incipient poverty. They need a leader with the courage and the standing to tell them that the old ways of doing business will not return prosperity.
Greeks have proven that they can move toward meritocracy, as has been illustrated by the general public exam for public administration or university admissions. The unique aspects of Greek culture have their advantages and need not be discarded. Small changes, for example simplifying regulations and putting more information on legislation on the Internet, can have a big effect.
These measures can pave the way for consensus on the larger labor reforms demanded by creditors, very possibly winning the major concessions that Tsipras seeks. Soon, with support from civil society and the Orthodox Church, momentum toward national renewal could reach a tipping point, where the rewards of complying with rules will outweigh flouting them.
In short, Greeks do not have to ''become Germans.'' They only have to face up to the fact that you can't get something for nothing forever. A politician with the courage to speak this truth and appeal for a new compact that matches individual and business responsibility with concrete steps toward state transparency can win an election, debt relief and real hope for a battered people.

HEADLINE: Spreading an Energy Revolution

BYLINE: By CHRISTOF RÜHL

 BODY:
London
ONLY two or three years ago, consensus was building among pundits that we had reached peak oil, that the fossil fuel industry was in its dotage and that the world would suffer repeated energy price shocks in the transition to a post-fossil fuel economy. Many people in the oil industry were skeptical of this dire prognosis, and the extraordinary recent expansion of unconventional gas and oil production in North America proved the optimists to be correct.
What many fail to recognize, however, is that North America's oil and gas renaissance, which has the potential to fuel a U.S. industrial recovery with cheaper energy, is not a happy accident of geology and lucky drilling. The dramatic rise in shale-gas extraction and the tight-oil revolution (mostly crude oil that is found in shale deposits) happened in the United States and Canada because open access, sound government policy, stable property rights and the incentive offered by market pricing unleashed the skills of good engineers. 
Last year, in BP's Energy Outlook 2030, we hailed the prospect of North American energy self-sufficiency. With the incentive of high oil prices and the application to oil of drilling techniques mastered for shale gas, we now estimate that tight oil will account for almost half of the 16 million barrel per day increase in the world's oil output by 2030. Almost two thirds of the new oil will come from the Americas, mainly U.S. tight oil and oil sands from Canada. The United States is likely to surpass Saudi Arabia in daily output very soon, and non-OPEC production will dominate global supply growth over the coming decade.
Policy, not geology, is driving the extraordinary turn of events that is boosting America's oil industry. East Asia boasts shale and tight-oil resources greater than those of the United States. Latin America and Africa too have very substantial endowments. However, the competitive environment, government policy and available infrastructure mean that North America will dominate the production of shale gas and tight oil for some time to come.
Markets play a dual role in changing the landscape. A decade of high prices spurred on the technological change that is now restoring North America's energy crown. And the same market forces are promoting efficiency and curtailing energy demand in countries where the price mechanism is allowed to do its job. Consumption of liquid fuel among member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development will continue to fall and be overtaken in 2014 by demand from emerging market nations, where fuel prices are still often subsidized.
One consequence, not often discussed, is the impact of these changes on today's oil market. The tight-oil revolution poses a challenge to the OPEC nations and their national oil companies. We predict that all of the additional oil supplied to the market over the next decade will come from unconventional sources outside OPEC.
The expected surge of new oil will lead to increased supply overall and continued market volatility. If history is any guide, OPEC will cut production and forego market share in favor of price stability. But as so often before, its policy response and its ability and willingness to manage spare capacity will be crucial in determining market conditions in the medium and longer term.
In the 1980s, oil from the North Sea and Alaska transformed the market. Today, market-led innovation has brought us to a crossroads again, and the time has come to make critical decisions about energy. Nations with abundant resources must decide whether to follow the path of open markets, including foreign access and competitive pricing. Alternatively, they can opt for restrictive investment regimes that risk becoming less rewarding.
Communities must decide whether the carbon-reducing benefit of using natural gas in power generation outweighs the fear of new drilling technologies. Europe too must grasp the market nettle. Without a clear signal that carbon has a price, European power utilities will be charmed by the cheapness of coal, increasingly available thanks to America's embrace of shale gas.
A surge in shale gas and tight-oil production is transforming our energy landscape. Forecasts of its potential differ widely. What is certain, however, is that our energy future is not wholly at the mercy of geology. The speed at which we can bring this useful resource to market will depend to a great extent on issues that will be decided by our governments, in our parliaments and in our town halls.
Christof Rühl is the group chief economist of BP.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Open to Residency for Illegal Immigrants

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER; Julia Preston contributed reporting from New York, and Jonathan Weisman from Washington.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- House Republicans on Tuesday staked out what they cast as a middle-ground option in the debate over immigration, pushing an approach that could include legal residency but not a path to citizenship -- as their Democratic counterparts favor -- for the 11 million illegal immigrants already in the country.
Republicans also signaled that they are open to the idea of breaking immigration legislation into several smaller bills, which would allow them to deal with the question of highly skilled workers, as well as a farmworker program, without addressing what Democrats and immigration advocates say is the larger issue of potential citizenship. Immigration advocates favor a comprehensive measure to enable them to use elements that have bipartisan backing to build support for broader legislation. 
At a House Judiciary Committee hearing exploring an overhaul of the immigration system -- the first of several such hearings expected in the House -- Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia and chairman of the committee, tried to frame what he called the question of the day: ''Are there options that we should consider between the extremes of mass deportation and a pathway to citizenship for those not lawfully present in the United States?''
It was a question later echoed by Representative Lamar Smith, Republican of Texas and the former chairman of the committee, when questioning Mayor Julián Castro of San Antonio. ''Do you see any compromise area between the current status quo and a path to citizenship for virtually all the 11 million who are illegal immigrants in the country today?'' he asked.
Mr. Castro, whose twin brother, Representative Joaquín Castro, is a newly elected Democrat from Texas, said he saw the compromise as ''a recognition that a path to citizenship will be earned citizenship,'' meaning that illegal immigrants would be forced to learn English, and pay fines and back taxes before they could become citizens.
Representative Spencer Bachus, Republican of Alabama, turned to the question of how to approach an overhaul of the system when he said he thought the panelists could all agree that ''it's going to be a much easier lift to solve the problem of highly skilled workers.''
''When you take comprehensive, then we're dealing with certain issues like full citizenship,'' Mr. Bachus said. ''And whatever else we disagree on, I think we would agree on that that's a more toxic and contentious issue, granting full amnesty.''
But Representative Cedric L. Richmond, Democrat of Louisiana, countered that the only way to tackle immigration is through comprehensive legislation. ''Why don't we just get the skilled labor part done first?'' Mr. Richmond asked. ''Well, politically, and just being very practical about it, if we got the skilled labor part done first, do you think we would ever come behind it and finish the job? I think it has to be a comprehensive approach or we'll never get to the hard part.''
Immigration advocates, who had been eagerly awaiting the hearing for an early hint of the tenor of the debate on immigration as it unfolds in the House, said the use of the word ''amnesty'' would most likely be a bad sign for those in favor of a comprehensive overhaul.
Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan, tried to set the tone early -- ''I hope no one uses the term 'illegal immigrants' here today,'' he said in his opening remarks. But the a-word, as immigration advocates have called ''amnesty,'' came up twice. In addition to Mr. Bachus, Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, also used the phrase: ''This is not our country's first foray into amnesty.'' He expressed concern for ''respect for the rule of law.''
Meanwhile, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the No. 2 House Republican, used a speech on his legislative priorities beyond the fights over deficit reduction to try to soften his party's position on immigration. Speaking at a research group downtown, he explicitly embraced offering illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children a pathway to legal residency and citizenship, a position he had opposed. And he endorsed in broad terms a comprehensive overhaul of the nation's immigration laws.
''I'm pleased these discussions make border security, employment verification and creating a workable guest worker program an immediate priority. It's the right thing to do for our families, for our security, and for our economy,'' Mr. Cantor said. But he warned, ''There are some who would rather avoid fixing the problem in order to save this as a political issue.''
Representative Raúl R. Labrador, Republican of Idaho, also challenged immigration advocates on the question of a political versus policy victory.
''If we want a political solution, you guys are going to insist on a pathway to citizenship,'' he said. ''You're going to beat Republicans over the head on this issue. But if we want a policy solution, I think there's good will here in the House of Representatives for us to come together, actually pass a pragmatic solution to the current problem that we have, and solve and modernize the immigration system for years to come.''
In a flurry of immigration legislation offered in recent days in the House, a bipartisan group of lawmakers, led by Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, introduced a bill on Tuesday that would allow American citizens with foreign-born same-sex spouses or partners to obtain permanent resident visas, known as green cards, for them. Mr. Nadler's proposal would allow a well-established same-sex couple to apply for a green card, avoiding any direct challenge to a federal law that bans recognition of gay marriage.

HEADLINE: Pete Flint

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Mr. Flint, 38, is chief executive of Trulia, a real estate Web site he founded in 2005 with Sami Inkinen while they were graduate students at Stanford University. The company, which is based in San Francisco, has more than 3.5 million residential sales listings nationwide.
Interview conducted and condensed by 
VIVIAN MARINO
Q. The way the story goes, your inability to find a home while attending Stanford was the inspiration for starting Trulia.
A. I moved to the U.S. from the U.K. in 2003 to go to business school. And after the first year I was looking for somewhere to live with some classmates in Silicon Valley. The first thing I did was go to the Internet to try to find information about a pretty important purchase or rental decision, and I was astounded by the lack of a good consumer-oriented site to help me with that information. So that was the light bulb, and since that moment I started understanding that not only was it a consumer problem, but one for the industry.
Q. Is Sami Inkinen, the other founder, still involved in the business?
A. He's on the board. He stepped away about a year ago from an operating role. He's still a significant shareholder, and he's a great friend.
Q. You have a master's degree in physics from Oxford. Did you ever want to be a physicist?
A. I found physics just a fascinating foundation for learning about the world, but I quickly got more excited about the world of technology. That academic background enables me to work with the engineers and technology. And I've got a good grasp of technology and how the pace of things is evolving.
Q. Trulia has been evolving at a swift pace as well.
A. The business is growing very rapidly. There are close to 25 million unique users across Web and mobile devices every month, and it's growing at around 50 percent a year.
Mobile is growing at 130 percent, year over year, as smartphones and apps become more pervasive. We went from seven apps at the end of 2011 to 14 different apps at the end of 2012.
Q. Won't that get a little confusing for your users?
A. Consumers use apps for very specific functions: to find a home to purchase, to find a home to rent, to look for mortgage rates. And we consult these very specific user cases by having these very specific apps.
Q. So your focus seems to be on mobile.
A. The area that I'm most excited about is mobile and how it's transforming the consumer experience, how we're able to monetize it at a high rate and also how we can help real estate professionals build their business while they're out and about. It's a revolution in the housing market. We have a dedicated app just for agents. Agents can check into open houses, sort of like a Foursquare model. We're connecting the offline with the online.
Q. Has going public helped your business?
A. We went public in September 2012.
On a day-to-day basis business hasn't changed that much, but it's enabled us to build our presence, both for consumers as well as real estate professionals. We've staffed up our team significantly over the last 12 months, and we'll continue to add more people to help us build more products.
Q. Like what?
A. We are continuing putting out not just data but mapping experiences to help consumers, whether it's consumers interested in transport information or commuting information. We're continually expanding the services that we have. But I'm not going to give you a detailed product road map -- it's our secret.
There are millions of things on our to-do list; it feels like we're just getting started. Our goal is to help consumers not only find a place to live but ultimately move in successfully, and that means connecting them with the right agent, mortgage professional and the other service providers to help them to consummate that transaction.
We're at the pace now where we release new products every week, some very big and some very small.
Q. What are some of these new products?
A. Probably the most recent significant release was our commute maps, enabling consumers to find properties that match their criteria, say, within 45 minutes of their office, and you could choose by public transportation or by driving.
And all of our new iPhone apps got a new, fresh look and feel across the board. All of our developers are internal.
Q. Based on the data you collect, are there some markets doing better than others?
A. Yes. The markets that have been hardest hit are the markets coming back the strongest. The top three that we're seeing are Las Vegas, Seattle and Phoenix. That's in terms of list price growth, which is a leading indicator of home sales growth.
Out of the 100 markets we track, only 14 are declining in list prices, so 86 of the markets are on the upswing. Newark and Philadelphia are the ones that are still lagging.
Q. What about rentals?
A. The top three rental markets in terms of rent price appreciation are Houston; Oakland, Calif.; and Miami. New York is No. 7.
Houston is up 15.8 percent year-to-year change in rent; Oakland, 10 percent; and Miami, 9.1 percent. New York is 5 percent.
Q. So have you become a homeowner yet?
A. I'm currently looking to buy in San Francisco. Just started looking. Our office is in downtown San Francisco, so it needs to be not too far from our office. I'm looking for agents who are advertising on our platform. That's the first selection criteria.

HEADLINE: A Partnership Seeks to Transform Kent State and Kent

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

 BODY:
KENT, Ohio -- Though it is home to the second largest campus in Ohio's state university system by enrollment, this small Cuyahoga River city spent much of the last four decades neglecting, if not deliberately retreating from, its history as a college town and its place in the annals of the Vietnam War era.
But a $110 million mixed-use development that is under construction at the city's center is remedying that.
The project -- a melding of more than 500,000 square feet of office, retail, residential and public spaces -- is unfolding across a four-block, four-acre section of downtown. City and university leaders said the development, the largest downtown construction project in Kent's 208-year history, will outfit the city with new destinations that suit contemporary lifestyles and spending patterns. 
The project will also shift the entertainment and business center a few blocks south from the city's aging core and closer to Kent State University.
The development is specifically intended to open a new economic era in Kent by helping to recruit and retain young professionals, as well as Kent State students, faculty and staff members.
But city and university leaders said in interviews that the tight collaboration among the city, the university and private developers is also helping heal the psychic wounds from a previous era that has hindered Kent's development.
On May 4, 1970, four students were shot and killed by Ohio National Guardsmen during a demonstration against the Vietnam War. Nine other students were wounded. The cultural and geographic gulf that opened that day widened in 1975 with the completion of Haymaker Parkway, a five-lane downtown bypass that literally cut off the campus from Kent's center.
Two men, Dave Ruller, Kent's city manager, and Lester A. Lefton, president of Kent State University -- outsiders when they arrived here within a year of each other in 2005 and 2006 -- are credited with galvanizing the community to redevelop downtown and draw the city and the university closer.
''When I came here seven years ago I was aware of the undercurrent around that event and the strained relationship between the city and the university,'' said Dr. Lefton, an experimental psychologist who was raised in Brookline, Mass. He has spent much of his career teaching in the South, and has played a central role in fostering and managing the downtown development.
When he took the reins of the university, Dr. Lefton said, he became just as interested in the economy and the condition of the city.
''Why isn't there a hotel here? Where is the conference center? We need to develop a much stronger economy,'' he said. ''We have 28,000 students and 3,000 faculty members here that spend money. We need to generate some new business in this community.''
Mr. Ruller, who was raised in Rochester and spent much of his career helping to manage small cities in Virginia and Tennessee, said it was not that Kent had forgotten about its downtown.
''At least as far back as the 1980s and about every five years afterward, the city prepared a development plan that proposed much of what we're doing now,'' he said. ''Preserve the good old buildings. Demolish the bad ones and rebuild. Lester and I realized that it was time to work together and act like the future mattered.''
''It took two guys from someplace else who didn't know any better,'' he said.
Not since the early 1980s had Kent, a slow-growing city of nearly 29,000 south of Cleveland, invited new construction downtown. The city had been content to have a slowly evolving mix of sedate shops and family restaurants that attracted a trickle of students and faculty from the university.
The new office, retail, entertainment and residential spaces under construction are seen here as essential ingredients in a civic formula for attracting students and educated professionals, defining spending habits and rebranding Kent as a flourishing 21st-century college town.
The project's red brick buildings use traditional designs to meet modern retail, office and entertainment demands. They will define the boundaries of a new neighborhood that includes public spaces joined to alleys lined with inviting shops and restaurants.
The new construction will include facilities for the university, mixed-use structures that combine retail and office space, and infrastructure, including a $26 million transit center and parking structure. The transit center, financed in part with a $20 million federal grant, will house a bus station and a 300-space garage.
A $16 million, 80,000-square-foot, 94-room Kent State University Hotel and Conference Center is scheduled to open in June and will be owned and managed by the university's foundation. In addition, the university is set to start construction in spring 2014 on a 122,000-square-foot, $40 million building to house its College of Architecture and Environmental Design.
As for commercial space, two three-story office buildings opened last year on Water Street. Costing $20 million to build, they house two of the city's most prominent private employers -- the Davey Resource Group and Ametek -- and an assortment of restaurants and boutiques on the ground floors.
Two other, similar buildings, Acorn Alley I, which opened in 2009, and Acorn Alley II, which opened two years later, cost $18 million. They surround a public square and are linked by an alley of shops and restaurants.
Acorn Corner, a $4 million restoration of the former Kent Hotel, will house a ground-floor restaurant and offices on the upper three floors when it opens in the spring. Also scheduled to open in the spring is a $3.6 million esplanade that unfolds from an arch that faces Haymaker Parkway and the entrance to the hotel and conference center across the street.
Fairmount Properties, the Cleveland-based developer that opened the two office buildings on Water Street, will start construction this spring on a $6.5 million, five-story, 42,000-square-foot mixed-use retail and residential project across Depeyster Street from the new university hotel.
The project includes a restaurant on the ground floor, and 32 one- and two-bedroom market rate rental apartments on the upper floors. Rents will be $975 to $1,400 a month, said Adam Branscomb, a project manager at Fairmount Properties.
''In the competitive world of higher education, colleges and universities can no longer count on their own amenities to attract students or faculty,'' said Randy Ruttenberg, founder and principal of Fairmount Properties, which has made a specialty of developing projects with universities. ''Their long-term success depends on the role the surrounding environment plays in serving the college experience. Students want retail and housing choices adjacent to campus. Downtowns are such important assets for retention and recruitment.''

HEADLINE: The Global Farmland Rush

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KUGELMAN. 
Michael Kugelman, a senior program associate at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, is co-editor of ''The Global Farms Race: Land Grabs, Agricultural Investment, and the Scramble for Food Security.''

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
OVER the last decade, as populations have grown, capital has flowed across borders and crop yields have leveled off, food-importing nations and private investors have been securing land abroad to use for agriculture. Poor governments have embraced these deals, but their people are in danger of losing their patrimony, not to mention their sources of food.
According to Oxfam, land equivalent to eight times the size of Britain was sold or leased worldwide in the last 10 years. In northern Mozambique, a Brazilian-Japanese venture plans to farm more than 54,000 square miles -- an area comparable to Pennsylvania and New Jersey combined -- for food exports. In 2009, a Libyan firm leased 386 square miles of land from Mali without consulting local communities that had long used it. In the Philippines, the government is so enthusiastic to promote agribusiness that it lets foreigners register partnerships with local investors as domestic corporations. 
The commoditization of global agriculture has aggravated the destabilizing effects of these large-scale land grabs. Investors typically promise to create local jobs and say that better farming technologies will produce higher crop yields and improve food security.
However, few of these benefits materialize. For example, as The Economist reported, a Swiss company promised local farmers 2,000 new jobs when it acquired a 50-year lease to grow biofuel crops on 154 square miles in Makeni, Sierra Leone; in the first three years, it produced only 50.
Many investors, in fact, use their own labor force, not local workers, and few share their technology and expertise. Moreover, about two-thirds of foreign investors in developing countries expect to sell their harvests elsewhere. These exports may not even be for human consumption. In 2008 in Sudan, the United Arab Emirates was growing sorghum, a staple of the Sudanese diet, to feed camels back home.
Much of the land being acquired is in conflict-prone countries. One of the largest deals -- the acquisition by investors led by the Saudi Binladin Group of some 4,600 square miles in Indonesia -- was put on hold because the area, in Papua, was torn by strife.
The prospects for conflict are heightened by legal uncertainties. Often, an absence of authoritative land registration and titles makes it easy for foreign investors, with the connivance of host governments, to secure land that local communities have long depended upon, even if they cannot demonstrate formal ownership. About 500 million sub-Saharan Africans rely on such communally held land, and land sales can be devastating, as in Mali. Access to food is often cut off, livelihoods are shattered and communities are uprooted.
Not surprisingly, the land sales provoke protests and then repression. Last year, in Cambodia, where 55 percent of arable land has been acquired by domestic and foreign agribusiness interests, the authorities killed an activist, a journalist and a teenage girl facing eviction; jailed other activists, and harassed politically active Buddhist monks.
To be sure, financiers have invested in farmland for centuries: Ancient Romans acquired assets in North Africa, just as American fruit companies secured plantations in Central America a century ago. But today's transactions are far bigger. Nearly 200 private equity firms are expected to have almost $30 billion in private capital invested by 2015.
Some speculators just sit on high-value land they have acquired without cultivating it. In many traditional communities, this feels like a desecration, a violation of land's purpose and meaning. That kind of capitalist disregard can set the stage for pitched battles over land that investors see as uninhabited, but that local communities cherish as a source of food, water and medicine, or venerate as ancestral burial grounds.
The chief drivers of the global farmland race -- population growth, food and energy demand, volatile commodity prices, land and water shortages -- won't slow anytime soon. Neither will extreme weather events and other effects of climate change on natural resources.
In theory, host countries could limit how much land can be acquired by foreigners, or require that a minimum portion of harvests be sold in local markets. Argentina and Brazil have announced measures to limit or ban new land concessions. But investors use their wealth and their own governments' power to impede regulation. Host governments should establish better land registration practices and enact safeguards against the displacement of their citizens. The World Bank and other international entities must ensure that their development projects are free from the taint of exploitative practices.
Of course, this will be difficult because so many host governments are riddled with corruption and prioritize profit-making land deals over the needs of their populations. Cambodia, Laos and Sudan -- all sites of transnational land purchases -- are among the world's 20 most corrupt nations, according to Transparency International.
''Buy land, they're not making it anymore,'' is a quotation often attributed to Mark Twain. These days, that advice is being heeded all too well.

HEADLINE: Big Firms Back Away From Trusts And Estates

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
Last month, the nation's leading trusts and estates lawyers convened at a Florida resort to discuss the latest in estate planning.
Between lectures and workshops, some of the lawyers exchanged whispers about an unsettling piece of gossip: Debevoise & Plimpton, the prominent white-shoe law firm, was eliminating its trusts and estates practice.
Debevoise's decision surprised members of the trusts and estates bar. If an institution as prestigious and financially sound as Debevoise was abandoning its practice, were they vulnerable too?
The news also raised eyebrows across the legal industry because it seemed to run counter to Debevoise's reputation for a strong partnership culture. At a time when many large law firms have discarded the traditional partnership model and embraced a more bottom-line approach, Debevoise has been seen as retaining an old-school ethos - a genteel law firm known for its camaraderie and decency. 
"It saddens me to see a great law firm terminate its estates department," said William D. Zabel, a partner at Schulte Roth & Zabel and one of the country's leading trusts and estates lawyers. "Although I don't know the reasons for this decision, it would seem to be a byproduct of the economics of our society, making the law into more of a business than a profession. That saddens me even more."
In a statement, Michael W. Blair, Debevoise's presiding partner, confirmed that it was jettisoning trusts and estates, and that the group's eight lawyers - including Jonathan J. Rikoon, the partner in charge of the practice - were trying to find another home.
"Debevoise supports the group in this process and will work to ensure that in this transition the needs of the firm's clients continue to be served," he said.
New York-based Debevoise is the latest big corporate law firm to discontinue the practice. In 2011, Weil, Gotshal & Manges, a 1,200-lawyer firm, got out of trusts and estates, deciding it did not fit the firm's business model. Another firm, Gibson Dunn & Crutcher, with 1,100 lawyers, ended its trusts and estates practice about a decade ago.
Corporate law firms once viewed trusts and estates as a small yet important practice that discreetly advised wealthy families. But drafting wills and trusts, and the legal matters that flow from that, is less lucrative than the primary revenue drivers at big law firms: multibillion-dollar corporate transactions and high-stakes litigation.
And there are problems with trusts and estates within a big law firm model. The practice, to use the law firm management parlance, is not as leverageable as other areas. Corporate and litigation partners generate big fees by assigning armies of junior lawyers to megamergers and complex lawsuits. By comparison, trusts and estates work requires far less manpower, which mean far less profit.
Another issue in sustaining these departments is that individual clients bristle at billable rates that now reach more than $1,000 an hour. While big corporations grudgingly pay those rates, wealthy families often resist them.
As a result of these dynamics, firms' trusts and estates practices have remained small and, in many cases, decreased. At the same time, firms have aggressively built up their corporate and litigation practices across the globe. They have also embraced hot, moneymaking practice areas like patent law and white-collar criminal defense.
There are some counterexamples to this trend, however. In 2011, seven trusts and estates lawyers from Weil, led by Carlyn S. McCaffrey, moved to McDermott Will & Emery, a firm with about 65 lawyers, one of the larger trusts and estates practices. Another firm committed to trusts and estates is Katten, which has more than 50 lawyers in the group.
Joshua S. Rubenstein, the head of Katten's trusts and estates practice, said that his business went well beyond comforting bereaved spouses and children. A successful practice, he said, includes assignments like advising families in the sale of closely held companies, overseeing trust-related litigation or even assisting in the purchase of a yacht or private jet.
"If done right, a full-service, high-end trusts and estates practice can generate a lot of work for other areas of the firm," Mr. Rubenstein said.
As large firms have de-emphasized their trusts and estates practices, boutiques have sprouted up. Sanford J. Schlesinger, a former partner at the New York corporate firm Kaye Scholer, left in 2004 along with several colleagues to set up an 11-lawyer shop, Schlesinger Gannon & Lazetera.
Mr. Schlesinger lamented the demise of the practice at big firms, and said he thought they were missing a business opportunity.
"Families are going to pass more wealth in the next 10 years than in the history of humankind, and someone is going to have to shepherd that wealth transfer," he said. "These firms are making a shortsighted, profit-driven decision without a view of the long-term big picture."
Debevoise, started in 1931 by two young patrician lawyers, Eli Whitney Debevoise and William E. Stevenson, does not see it that way. Three decades ago, the firm's trusts and estates practice had six partners, including Barbara Paul Robinson, now retired and a former president of the New York City Bar Association, and Theodore A. Kurz, the former head of the department. Today, there is only one, Mr. Rikoon, 57, who declined to comment for this article.
The firm formed a committee to study its trusts and estates practice, which has advised families like the Lauders (cosmetics) and the Dolans (cable television), according to people with direct knowledge of the group. After concluding that the practice did not have enough business to expand, the committee recommended closing it down. The firm will continue to employ Mr. Rikoon and the seven other lawyers while they interview elsewhere, these people said.
One factor contributing to Debevoise's move to discontinue the group, people say, is its unusual lock-step compensation system, which pays partners in a narrow range strictly according to seniority. That means that Mr. Rikoon is paid on par with a star deal maker from the same law school year, while bringing in less business. This created some discord in the partnership ranks. Debevoise's profits per partner are $2.1 million, according to The American Lawyer magazine.
Debevoise, with 650 lawyers, recently made headlines away from trusts and estates. The firm advised a special committee of Dell's board on the $24 billion leveraged buyout of the computer company. And President Obama nominated the Debevoise partner Mary Jo White to run the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Stephen J. Friedman, a onetime Debevoise partner who is now president of Pace University, said that he was unaware of the facts involved in his former firm's decision to close the trusts and estates practice, but noted that organizations are often faced with business realities that require painful choices.
"It's sometimes necessary to make a decision that's in the best interest of the firm but can hurt individual partners and associates," he said. "That's not a happy experience, but it's sometimes the right thing to do."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Market Rebounds on Stream Of Strong Earnings Reports

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The stock market bounced back on Tuesday from the previous day's sell-off as strong earnings reports continued to power gains and concerns about Europe's debt crisis eased.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 99.22 points, or 0.71 percent, to close at 13,979.30, erasing a large part of its loss from Monday. The Dow traded above 14,000 during the day before falling back in the last hour.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 15.58 points, or 1.04 percent, to 1,511.29. The Nasdaq composite index picked up 40.41 points, or 1.29 percent, to 3,171.58. 
The rise follows two days of whiplash. On Monday, the Dow dropped 129 points, its worst sell-off of the year so far, as fears about Europe's finances resurfaced. On Friday, the index gained 149 points, closing above 14,000 for the first time since 2007. The Dow is now 185 points below the nominal record high of 14,164 it reached on Oct. 9, 2007.
After strong gains for stocks this year, investors are wondering whether they should sell now, or wait and see if the rally still has legs, said Brad Reynolds, chief investment officer at LJPR.
''The market is extremely skittish right now, that's why we're seeing such big moves,'' Mr. Reynolds said.
Contributing to Tuesday's advance was new data showing that home prices rose in December at the fastest pace in more than six years. CoreLogic, a real estate data provider, reported that home prices rose 8.3 percent. In Europe, a measure of manufacturing and service businesses rose to a 10-month high in January.
Estée Lauder rose $3.66, or 6 percent, to $64.71 after reporting earnings that beat analysts' expectations. Profits surged 13 percent at the beauty products company as sales in the United States and emerging markets rose.
Computer Sciences, an information technology services company, was the biggest gainer in the S.& P. 500. Computer Sciences rose $3.84, or 9.2 percent, to $45.75 after the company said it was raising its earnings outlook for the year because its cost-cutting efforts were yielding better results than it had expected.
Stocks have gotten off to a strong start this year. The Dow advanced 5.8 percent in January, its best start to the year since 1994, according to data compiled to S.& P. Dow Jones indexes. The S.& P. 500 rose 5 percent last month.
Lance Roberts, chief economist at Streettalk Advisors in Houston, said that strength was related more to the Federal Reserve's commitment to keep money cheap than to companies' performance. If earnings are beating estimates, he said, it's largely because expectations were so low.
''If you lower the hurdles enough, companies can get over them,'' Mr. Roberts said.
The fact that individual investors are starting to return to stocks, as they have in recent weeks, is another sign that the market is due for a correction, Mr. Roberts and other analysts have said.
The McGraw-Hill Companies, parent of the Standard & Poor's ratings agency, fell $5.38, or 10.7 percent, to $44.92, after the federal government sued S.& P. The government said that Standard & Poor's knowingly misled investors about the quality of the mortgage-backed securities it was rating in the run-up to the financial crisis that caused the recession. The stock dropped 14 percent on Monday after early reports about the lawsuit.
Traders sold bonds as they moved money into stocks. The price of the 10-year Treasury note dropped 13/32, to 96 21/32, while its yield rose to 2.01 percent from 1.96 percent late Monday.
Among other stocks on the move, Kellogg gained 40 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $58.50, after reporting fourth-quarter results. It booked a loss because of a pension-related charge, but underlying earnings rose.
Dell, the struggling computer giant, rose 15 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $13.42 after the company announced a $24.4 billion buyout deal led by its founder, Michael Dell, that will take the company private at $13.65 a share.
Yum Brands, parent of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, fell $1.86, or 2.9 percent, to $62.08 after the company warned late Monday that 2013 profits could decline as it continues to reel from a controversy over its chicken suppliers in China.

HEADLINE: President Urges Congress to Act to Stave Off Cuts

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and JACKIE CALMES; Jonathan Weisman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama on Tuesday called on Congress to quickly pass a new package of limited spending cuts and tax increases to head off substantial across-the-board reductions to domestic and military spending set to begin on March 1, but his appeal for more revenue was dismissed by Republicans.
Trying to gain the upper hand in the latest fiscal clash, Mr. Obama said Congress should delay the reductions for at least a few months to give lawmakers a chance to negotiate a full deficit reduction package that permanently resolves the threat of a so-called sequester. 
''They should at least pass a smaller package of spending cuts and tax reforms that would delay the economically damaging effects of the sequester for a few more months,'' Mr. Obama said Tuesday afternoon in the White House briefing room. He said there was no reason to put at risk ''the jobs of thousands of Americans.''
The president said the economy, which unexpectedly contracted at the end of last year, had begun to recover slowly. But he warned that continuing fights over taxes and spending threaten to delay or derail that improvement.
''We've also seen the effects that political dysfunction can have,'' Mr. Obama said. ''We've made progress. And I still believe we can finish the job with a balanced mix of spending cuts and more tax reform.''
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, mocked the president's demands to close tax loopholes, calling them ''gimmicky tax hikes'' and said, ''It's time for Washington Democrats to get real.'' House Republicans noted that they had already passed their own plans to avoid the sequester.
With the deadline looming, each party is eager to blame the other for consequences that could include thousands of layoffs at military contractors, service reductions in programs for the needy and a new economic slump.
Mr. Obama, who missed a deadline this week to submit his annual budget to Congress, acknowledged on Tuesday that a broader deficit agreement is unlikely to be reached by the March deadline. He provided no details about the tens of billion of dollars in spending cuts and tax adjustments that he wants Congress to pass quickly. More specifics could come when he delivers his State of the Union address next Tuesday.
''While it's critical for us to cut wasteful spending, we can't just cut our way to prosperity,'' the president said, returning to fiscal issues after several weeks focused on gun control and immigration. ''I still believe that we can finish the job with a balanced mix of spending cuts and more tax reform.''
Without action in the next three weeks, federal law will set off automatic cuts worth about $1.2 trillion over the next decade. Mr. Obama and Republicans in Congress designed the cuts in 2011 to be devastating as a way to prod passage of a more thoughtful deficit reduction approach, but no agreement has been reached.
Mr. Obama spoke as the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released its annual economic report with the latest 10-year projections for the annual federal budget deficits. It provided some fodder to critics on the left and some economists who say that Washington's continued emphasis on immediate deficit reduction is constraining economic growth, though the budget office said lower deficits would help the economy starting in 2014.
''The federal fiscal policy specified by current law will represent a drag on economic activity'' this year and through 2017, the report said. It said that growth in 2013 ''would be roughly 1 ½ percentage points faster than the agency now projects if not for the fiscal tightening.''
Conservative House Republicans, as a price for their vote to suspend the debt ceiling, last month demanded that their leaders allow the automatic cuts to go into force as scheduled unless alternatives could be found on time. So far, Republican leaders have held firm to that promise even with some Republicans expressing anxiety about the cuts to the Pentagon.
House Republicans last year passed two bills that would reduce domestic spending enough to avoid the automatic military cuts, although those bills expired with the last Congress. Speaker John A. Boehner on Tuesday called their proposals ''common-sense cuts and reforms'' that the president and his Democratic allies in the Senate could immediately accept.
Democrats say the cuts favored by House Republicans would unfairly target domestic programs, and Mr. Obama again insisted on Tuesday that any short-term action in the next several weeks must meet his demands for a balanced approach that also closes tax loopholes for wealthy citizens and industries.
Democrats in the Senate are divided on how to proceed in the coming fiscal negotiations with Republicans. Like Mr. Obama, Senate Democratic leaders want a three-month replacement bill, just long enough to move the showdown past other budget deadlines like March 27, when the current stopgap law financing the government expires, and April 15, when the Senate and House must produce budgets.
Senator Barbara A. Mikulski of Maryland, chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, favors a yearlong agreement. Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has a broader, $200 billion plan to shut down offshore tax havens and other loopholes. And Senator Max Baucus of Montana, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, wants to defer any action on closing tax loopholes for the broader fight over taxes and spending.
''We are not going to have multiple bites at this apple,'' Mr. Baucus said Tuesday.
The report from the Congressional Budget Office was its first fiscal analysis since the year-end deal between the White House and Congress that raised taxes on high incomes, and it projected that the deficit for this fiscal year that ends Sept. 30 would be $845 billion.
That would be the first deficit below $1 trillion in five years, since the financial crisis of 2008. It would be equal to 5.3 percent of the nation's total output, or gross domestic product -- about half of what the deficit was relative to the size of the weaker economy in fiscal year 2009 when Mr. Obama took office, but still higher than the roughly 3 percent level that many economists consider the maximum that is sustainable in a growing economy.
While the budget office forecast that annual deficits will decline significantly as the economy recovers, the budget office once again emphasized that the deficit will rise later in the decade, beginning in 2016, and continue do to so as the population ages and health care prices rise.

HEADLINE: Playing With Passion for a Patron

BYLINE: By STEVE SMITH

 BODY:
Luminaries of the contemporary classical-music world, from New York and points beyond, gathered at Merkin Concert Hall on Monday evening to remember one of their own. Ralph Kaminsky, who died in January 2012 at 85, was not a performer, composer or arts executive but a music lover with a passion for discovery and a benefactor whose quiet generosity bolstered his community. 
Performing in Mr. Kaminsky's honor were representatives from five of the most prominent new-music ensembles in New York: Alarm Will Sound, Either/Or, the International Contemporary Ensemble, the JACK Quartet and the Talea Ensemble. (A sixth group, the Argento Chamber Ensemble, had to cancel at the last minute.) The sizable audience included family members, composers, record-label executives and others who had benefited from Mr. Kaminsky's interests.
Born in western Canada, Mr. Kaminsky began his career in academia; went on to hold positions in the fields of urban planning and economic diplomacy; and ultimately spent 23 years as a professor and administrator at New York University.
In retirement he devoted considerable time and resources to his passion for modern music. With his wife, Hester Diamond, he held private salons devoted to listening and discussion. He served on the boards of institutions like the American Composers Orchestra, and he helped nurture the careers of numerous ensembles ranked among the finest in the world, including those assembled on Monday.
''I listen to music by composers who are composing, not decomposing,'' he often said, according to a blog post by Bruce Hodges, a writer, arts consultant and friend who helped arrange this concert. No doubt the assembled throng could have provided countless additional quotations and remembrances.
Instead, after Charles Hack, another of the concert's organizers, welcomed the audience and announced a new fund for contemporary music named in Mr. Kaminsky's honor, testimony came solely in the form of the music Mr. Kaminsky loved and supported.
Either/Or opened with a hallucinatory account of Giacinto Scelsi's ''Pranam II,'' a work of haunting intensity and breathy flow. The JACK Quartet followed with Matthias Pintscher's exquisite ''Study IV for Treatise on the Veil,'' a spellbinding sequence of tiny, hushed gestures inspired by a series of drawings and paintings by Cy Twombly.
In ''Hooloomooloo,'' by Olga Neuwirth, waves of energy and pockets of repose caromed among members of the Talea Ensemble, who were split into mirrored complements and led by Eduardo Leandro. More conventional modes of virtuosity came into play in Marc-André Dalbavie's ''Fantaisies,'' an exhilarating cello concerto commissioned by Ms. Diamond for Mr. Kaminsky's 80th birthday. The conductor Cliff Colnot elicited a taut, focused performance from the International Contemporary Ensemble, with Michael Nicolas as the brilliantly assured soloist.
Afterward, the elegant simplicity of Arvo Pärt's ''Spiegel im Spiegel,'' played by the Alarm Will Sound representatives John Pickford Richards on viola and Caleb Burhans on piano, provided a fitting benediction for an evening of warm memories and high ideals.

HEADLINE: Iran: Nuclear Talks to Resume

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON and ALAN COWELL; Michael R. Gordon reported from Washington and Alan Cowell from London. Rick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Breaking a deadlock over the location and timing of new talks on its disputed nuclear program, Iran has agreed to resume its stuttering dialogue with world powers later this month in Kazakhstan, Iranian and Western officials said on Tuesday.
The agreement to meet in Almaty on Feb. 26 follows the imposition of punishing sanctions by the United States and its allies that has led to the devaluation of Iran's currency. 
There is a general sense among experts that 2013 will be a make or break year for the negotiations. President Obama has repeatedly said that he will not allow Iran to become a nuclear weapons state and indicated that military action is an option.
William Hague, the British foreign secretary, said Tuesday, ''The need to make progress is increasingly urgent.'' His statement said ''Iran continues to enrich uranium in contravention of U.N. Security Council resolutions and on a scale that has no plausible civilian explanation.''
Mr. Hague said that the world powers would present Iran with an ''updated and credible offer,'' but provided no details on the proposal.
Iran's negotiating team last met with the outside powers --the United States, Russia, China, France, Britain and Germany -- for high-level talks in Moscow in June, which ended in frustration.
At that encounter, Iran demanded the lifting of ever-tightening international economic sanctions as a precondition for discussions about reducing or eliminating its growing inventory of enriched uranium.
But the outside powers want Iran to suspend its enrichment program and satisfy the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations nuclear watchdog, that it does not have a nuclear weapons program.
Iran denies Western accusations that its nuclear program is intended to provide access to the technology for nuclear weapons.
At the same time, Iran told the I.A.E.A. last week that it plans to install more sophisticated centrifuges at its principal nuclear enrichment plant at Natanz, enabling it to greatly accelerate processing of uranium. Outside nuclear negotiations experts have suggested that Iran purposely timed that announcement to increase its diplomatic leverage at the coming talks.
Given how unproductive and unwieldy the talks have been, some experts say that the best approach would be to have one-on-one negotiations between the United States and Iran. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. offered such discussions when he spoke at a security conference in Munich last weekend.
Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Salehi, said on Sunday that his country was open to direct talks. But an American official indicated such direct talks have not yet been agreed to.
The agreement on the meeting in Kazakhstan follows months of haggling over venues and dates. At one point late last year, the United States and its partners proposed a meeting in Istanbul only to see Iran counter with an offer to meet in Cairo. That proposal was part of Iran's effort to forge warmer ties with Egypt, a move that was reflected in President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's visit to the Egyptian capital on Tuesday.
An overwhelmingly Muslim state and former Soviet republic, Kazakhstan voluntarily gave up a large cache of enriched uranium in 1994.
Wendy R. Sherman, the under secretary for political affairs at the State Department, will lead the American delegation to the talks.
Dennis Ross, a former senior Obama administration official who is an expert on the Iranian nuclear issue at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said that Iran might hint at some modest movement in the upcoming talks, perhaps to try to encourage divisions among the United States and the other powers involved in the talks.
One possibility, he said, was that Iran would press for the lifting of sanctions, a recognition of its right to enrich uranium while also signaling that it was ready to limit the production of uranium that is enriched to 20 percent. But that, he said, would not change the basic character of Iran's nuclear program.
''My immediate expectations would be that they will do enough to justify another meeting afterwards,'' Mr. Ross said of the Iranian position. ''I do not have high expectations on what this meeting will produce.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Harlem's 125th Street Attracts Big Retailers

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
The recession slowed commercial real estate development everywhere, but it was particularly hard on Harlem, which had only recently begun to attract national retailers after decades of disinvestment. A number of projects had to be shelved when the financial markets dried up.
Financing is still hard to come by in Harlem, but these days, 125th Street, the neighborhood's main shopping street, is beginning to hum with activity. Two new developments are currently under construction, each featuring the kind of chain restaurant that was rare in the neighborhood not so long ago. A third project that will bring Upper Manhattan its first Whole Foods supermarket is also expected to get started later this year.
''Retailers are seeking new neighborhoods in Manhattan where they can achieve great revenue,'' said Jared L. Epstein, a principal of Aurora Capital Associates, a New York development company that is the Adjmi family's partner in a four-story 100,000-square-foot shopping center rising at the corner of 125th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard. ''This is one of the last neighborhoods that has the density of foot traffic that can support their business model.'' 
Anchored by a 30,000-square-foot Designer Shoe Warehouse, the new development at 301 West 125th Street is directly opposite Harlem U.S.A., the pioneering retail and entertainment center that opened in 2000, giving the neighborhood its first movie theater in many years -- now called the AMC Magic Johnson Theater Harlem 9 -- as well as national retailers like a 35,000-square-foot Old Navy store.
The Adjmi development will include the city's first Joe's Crab Shack, as well as a health club under Equinox's lower-priced Blink brand and a party supplies store. (Mr. Epstein declined to say how much his project would cost.)
Half a block to the east, the developers of Harlem U.S.A., Grid Properties and the Gotham Organization, are putting up a $14 million, three-story retail building at 269 West 125th Street, next to the Apollo Theater, which will include a Red Lobster restaurant, also new to the neighborhood.
In the early days of Harlem U.S.A.'s existence, shoppers and moviegoers had few places to eat within easy reach, but first local restaurants and then chain restaurants have provided more choices, said Grid's president, Drew Greenwald. He said he expected to lease the shopping mall's only current vacancy -- an 11,000-square-foot space that was previously occupied by a bookstore and the Hip-Hop Culture Center -- to a casual sit-down restaurant whose name he was not ready to disclose. ''This corner is becoming a little bit of a food hub,'' he said in an interview in his office at Harlem U.S.A.
The two new developments have more in common than seafood, however. Both are being financed by their developers.
''The capital markets are still circumspect across the board, and in Harlem, where things are almost always more difficult, that's true as well,'' said Kenneth J. Knuckles, chief executive of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, an economic development program.
Financing is also not expected to be a problem for a development intended for a large, weedy lot at the southwest corner of Lenox Avenue and 125th Street. The site was acquired several years ago by the retail specialist Jeff Sutton, who is planning a five-story glassy building that will include two creditworthy tenants: a 40,000-square-foot Whole Foods supermarket and a 75,000-square-foot Burlington Coat Factory. The site is opposite the Harlem Center, whose tenants include Marshall's, Staples and other national retailers. But the Whole Foods lease came as a surprise to many people in Harlem. ''It was a shock, because of the price point,'' said Barbara Askins, president of the 125th Street Business Improvement District.
In 2010, one-quarter of the families in Central Harlem had incomes below the poverty level. But the neighborhood has been attracting more affluent residents, and many of them go out of their way to shop at Whole Foods, Ms. Askins said. And then there is the foot traffic: some 900,000 people walk along 125th Street each month, she said.
Chase Welles, an executive vice president at SCG Retail, an Atlanta company that represents the upscale supermarket chain, based in Austin, Tex., said that opening on 125th Street was not a tough call. ''There's real density there,'' he said ''The people meet the general Whole Foods demographic of income and education.''
Developers of other projects on 125th Street, however, have yet to pin down the financing they need to begin construction. Janus Partners, a company with a long track record in Harlem, and Monadnock Construction hope to start work this year on the redevelopment of the long-dormant Taystee Bakery complex. They were awarded development rights in 2011 after a previous plan involving the food market Citarella did not work out. The site was rezoned in November to permit a mixture of uses.
Jerry Salama, a principal at Janus, said the $100 million, 330,000-square-foot project, called Create@Harlem Green, hopes to attract the type of nonprofit, technology and creative industries that have been flocking to Midtown South, the office district between 42nd Street and Canal Street, in recent years. ''Lots of leases are expiring in Midtown South, where rents have doubled since tenants first signed leases,'' he said. ''We want to be the alternative that is affordable.'' Prospective tenants include the Harlem Brewery Company, which would move production there from Brewster, N.Y.; a biotechnology firm; some nonprofits -- and, appropriately enough, a bakery. The site is close to where Columbia University is building its new Manhattanville campus.
''The proximity to the Columbia expansion makes this project more feasible and exciting,'' said Blondel Pinnock, a senior vice president at the Harlem-based Carver Federal Savings Bank and the chairwoman of the 125th Street Business Improvement District.
Danforth Development Partners and Exact Capital say they also plan to break ground this year on the redevelopment of the Victoria Theater, a long-closed former vaudeville house just east of the Apollo Theater. Like several other projects in Harlem that have yet to materialize, the Victoria complex, which has been in the works since 2007, is challenging. It would include 229 rental apartments, half of them income-restricted; a 210-room Cambria Suites hotel with a ballroom; retail stores; and a cultural arts center with two theaters. Zoning regulations encourage developers to include cultural uses to give the street more character and prevent it from turning into a big-box strip.
Craig Livingston, a managing partner of Exact Capital, which joined the project in 2011, said lenders had been wary of committing to a new hotel in what was considered an untested market. The Cambria Suites would be only the second hotel built in Harlem since 1913, when the Hotel Teresa opened. The other new hotel is a 124-room Aloft, which lacks a restaurant and other amenities.
''You can't point to 20 other successful hotels in Harlem, but the economics are there to support a new hotel in Harlem -- definitely,'' Mr. Livingston said. He cited the popularity of 125th Street as a tourist destination and the pricing advantages of being outside Midtown.
Deborah C. Wright, the chief executive of Carver Federal, said some developments on 125th Street had probably been harder to achieve because officials had imposed requirements to foster job growth -- like including a hotel. But she expressed confidence that all the projects would eventually get done. ''We may have over-engineered the protection so it's taking a little longer than we like, but it's going to happen,'' said Ms. Wright, who first began working on Harlem development in the 1980s. ''It's zigging and zagging, and not following a straight line, but it's inevitable that sites will get developed and complete the circle that began 30 years ago.''

HEADLINE: Immigration Reform Issue: The Effect On the Budget

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
The stars could hardly have shone brighter on the prospects for immigration reform than in the early months of 2007.
The coalition pushing for change included the oddest of bedfellows -- roping together business groups like the United States Chamber of Commerce with the Service Employees International Union, the fastest-growing union in the country. It had an impeccable bipartisan pedigree, including President George W. Bush and Senator Jon Kyl, a staunchly conservative Republican, as well as the Democrats' liberal lion, Senator Ted Kennedy.
The economy was growing. The unemployment rate was at its lowest level since the dot-com bubble burst six years before. And the flaws of our immigration laws -- impotent to stop a river of unauthorized immigrants drawn across the border by job opportunities -- were obvious to all.
Immigration reform, however, was not to be. 
Immigrants' rights groups balked at the hurdles put in immigrants' path toward legalization. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. hated a provision creating temporary work visas, arguing that it was a license for businesses to bring in cheap foreign labor. Then, a Senate Democrat, Byron Dorgan, offered the coup de grâce with an amendment to phase out the worker visa program after five years. Though proposed at the behest of organized labor, the amendment got the support of some of the most anti-union Republicans in the Senate. And it killed the entire enterprise, stripping away corporate America's main reason to support a deal.
Today, the economy is not growing much. Unemployment remains stubbornly high. Yet President Obama thinks the stellar alignment may be better than six years ago. He is proposing a wholesale change to the same flawed immigration laws. He trusts that Republicans, who lost the Hispanic vote by an enormous margin in November, cannot afford to further alienate Hispanics by voting against their top priority.
Despite the strong case for an overhaul, however, changing our immigration laws may be tougher than the president appears to believe. While we may have overcome some of the obstacles of 2007, reform will probably face deep-seated opposition from many Americans -- including most conservative Republicans -- to what they will view as a potentially large expansion of welfare.
President Obama's proposal is based on principles similar to those of the 2007 attempt: a path to citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants in the country, a legal channel for future immigrant workers and their families, and a plan to better enforce the nation's borders and immigration laws.
Yet immigration reform today means something quite different than it did in 2007. Notably, the elements needed to stop the flow of illegal immigrants north are much less important to the enterprise. The Obama administration has already spent huge amounts of money on border enforcement. Today, border policing costs about $18 billion a year -- nearly 50 percent more than it did in 2006. And deportations have soared. What's more, illegal immigration has slowed to a trickle, as Mexico has grown more robustly than the United States. The illegal immigrant population has even been shrinking in the last few years. And it may continue to do so as the Mexican population of prime migration-age people stops growing.
Also, many employers have already gotten some of what they wanted: the number of workers entering the United States on temporary visas for low-end jobs in agriculture and other industries has increased sharply.
''The discussion is in a different environment,'' said Gordon H. Hanson, an expert on the economics of immigration at the University of California, San Diego. ''The flow of new immigrants is not the story anymore.''
This might help the cause of reform in some ways. It could allow the discussion about work visas to focus on the highly educated workers coveted by technology companies and pre-empt the kind of argument between business and labor over visas for cheap immigrant workers that sank reform in 2007. The A.F.L.-C.I.O., for instance, has heartily embraced President Obama's plan.
But what supporters of an overhaul of immigration law seem to be overlooking is that these very changes could also make it more difficult to build a coalition across the political divide. If reform is mainly about granting citizenship to 11 million mostly poor illegal immigrants with relatively little education, it is going to land squarely in the cross hairs of our epic battle about taxes, entitlements and the role of government in society.
It's hard to say with precision what impact offering citizenship would have on the budget, but the chances are good that it would cost the government money. Half to three-quarters of illegal immigrants pay taxes, according to studies reviewed in a 2007 report by the Congressional Budget Office. And they are relatively inexpensive, compared with Americans of similar incomes. Their children can attend public schools at government expense -- putting a burden on state and local budgets. But they are barred from receiving federal benefits like the earned-income tax credit, food stamps and Medicaid. Only their American-born children can get those.
Government revenue might not change much with legalization. Most illegal immigrants who don't pay taxes probably work in the cash economy -- as nannies or gardeners -- where tax compliance among citizens is low. Costs, of course, would increase. Once they became citizens, immigrants would be entitled to the same array of government benefits as other Americans. For Social Security and Medicare alone, offering citizenship to illegal immigrants would mean losing a subsidy worth several billion dollars a year in payroll taxes from immigrants who can't collect benefits in old age.
The White House and other backers of reform have made much of a 2007 Congressional Budget Office analysis concluding that the failed immigration overhaul would have increased government revenue by $48 billion over a decade while adding only $23 billion to direct spending on entitlements and other programs. But the report also said that including the costs of carrying out the new law would actually increase the budget deficit by $18 billion over the decade and several billion a year after that. What's more, it noted that most of the expected new tax revenue came from new immigrant workers, not from the newly legalized population.
Our history suggests we could have much to gain by turning illegal immigrants into citizens and putting an end to unauthorized immigration. The last time we permitted illegal immigrants to legalize, in 1986, incomes jumped for those who took advantage of the opportunity. Their children became more proficient in English and completed more years of school -- becoming more productive and paying more taxes over their lifetimes.
But the same history underscores how immigration sets off fears about further sharing of government resources. Ten years after the immigration reform of 1986, reeling from some public anger, Congress passed a law barring legal immigrants from means-tested government services. The same issue is likely again to be a major flash point. Professor Hanson pointed to ''the older white man who sees his entitlements at risk because of the demands placed by legalization on our fiscal resources.''
Conservative Republicans set on cutting government spending share those concerns. And for all their reasons to reach out to Hispanics, they might not find making illegal immigrants legal politically advantageous. On Tuesday, Republicans in the House argued against granting citizenship to illegal immigrants at all.
Hispanics are more liberal than the general population on economic matters, polls suggest, and more supportive of Big Government initiatives. Granting them citizenship would give them the vote.
As Steven A. Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, an advocacy group in Washington that favors more limits on immigration, said, ''They will see legalization as a voter-registration drive for Democrats.''

HEADLINE: Bulgaria Ties Hezbollah to Blast on Israelis' Bus

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH, ERIC SCHMITT and MATTHEW BRUNWASSER; Nicholas Kulish and Matthew Brunwasser reported from Sofia, and Eric Schmitt from Washington. Jodi Rudoren contributed reporting from Jerusalem; Hwaida Saad from Beirut, Lebanon; and Michael R. Gordon from Washington.

 BODY:
SOFIA, Bulgaria -- The clues to a fatal bomb attack on Israeli vacationers in Bulgaria included a charred tour bus, a decapitated head and a fake driver's license.
With help from the United States and Israel, investigators here broke the case -- and linked it to Hezbollah -- using a tip from a secret source and some old-fashioned detective work, tracing the printer that had produced two forged licenses back to Lebanon.
On Tuesday, Bulgaria's interior minister, Tsvetan Tsvetanov, announced that two of the people behind the July 18 bombing, which killed five Israeli tourists, a Bulgarian bus driver and the bomber, were believed to be members of the military wing of Hezbollah. 
Though investigators did not release names, they identified two of the plotters as a man with an Australian passport, believed to be the bombmaker, and a man with a Canadian passport, both of whom lived in Lebanon.
''We have followed their entire activities in Australia and Canada, so we have information about financing and their membership in Hezbollah,'' Mr. Tsvetanov said at a news conference.
Hezbollah has denied responsibility for the bombing.
The announcement could force the European Union to reconsider designating the Lebanon-based group as a terrorist organization and cracking down on its fund-raising. That would upend Europe's policy of quiet tolerance of the group, which, in addition to operating schools and social services, is an influential force in Middle East politics, considers Israel an enemy and has extensive links with Iran.
Mr. Tsvetanov did not mention Iran, but the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said in a statement on Tuesday, ''This is yet a further corroboration of what we have already known, that Hezbollah and its Iranian patrons are orchestrating a worldwide campaign of terror that is spanning countries and continents.''
The United States, too, urged the European Union to condemn Hezbollah. John O. Brennan, President Obama's chief counterterrorism adviser and his nominee to run the C.I.A., responded in a statement Tuesday: ''We call on our European partners as well as other members of the international community to take proactive action to uncover Hezbollah's infrastructure and disrupt the group's financing schemes and operational networks in order to prevent future attacks.''
But countries including France and Germany have been wary of taking that step, which could force confrontations with large numbers of Hezbollah supporters living within their borders.
Catherine Ashton, the European Union's high representative for foreign policy, responded with caution. ''The implications of the investigation need to be assessed seriously as they relate to a terrorist attack on E.U. soil, which resulted in the killing and injury of innocent civilians,'' she said in a statement.
Secretary of State John Kerry called Ms. Ashton to discuss the danger presented by Hezbollah, among other issues, including his statement on Tuesday urging governments around the world, particularly in Europe, ''to take immediate action to crack down on Hezbollah.'' Asked if Mr. Kerry had pressed the European Union to blacklist Hezbollah, Victoria Nuland, a State Department spokeswoman, said Ms. Ashton ''knows where we want to go.''
New details continued to emerge about the bombing, which analysts have called an episode in a shadow war pitting Israel against Iran and Hezbollah. Israel is believed to be behind the killings of Iranian nuclear scientists. Operatives of the Iranian Quds Force, an elite international operations unit within the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, in turn were blamed in plots against Israeli targets in Thailand, India, Georgia and elsewhere.
Amin Hotait, a retired general in the Lebanese Army who is close to Hezbollah, said the Bulgarian decision ''lacks unequivocal evidence.''
''The party doesn't usually retaliate against Israeli attacks by killing civilians,'' Mr. Hotait said. ''This decision is political in nature, since Bulgaria is not an independent country, but politically dependent on the West.''
After the attack, Mr. Netanyahu immediately blamed Hezbollah and Iran. United States officials privately supported that view, based on intercepted communications.
Bulgarian officials, wary about jumping to conclusions and concerned about alienating European Union allies, needed more proof before they would determine that the attack had been the work of Hezbollah.
Indeed, Mr. Tsvetanov chose his words carefully on Tuesday, leaving room for uncertainty. ''A reasonable assumption, I repeat a reasonable assumption, can be made that the two of them were members of the militant wing of Hezbollah,'' he said.
Bulgaria was chosen as a target not only because of the Black Sea's popularity with Israeli tourists, but also because security there was more lax than in other European countries, said a former senior Western official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The European Commission, the union's main administrative arm, has long slammed Bulgaria for its corrupt and inefficient judiciary. For years, the majority of contract killings in public places in Bulgaria, more than 150 since 2000, have gone unsolved. Mark Grey, a spokesman for the commission, was quoted by Bulgarian national radio on Tuesday as saying the commission expects ''fundamental reform of the judicial system'' here.
But Bulgarians living along the scenic Black Sea coast did not fear for their safety, or expect a terrorist attack. After the explosion ripped through the bus at the airport in Burgas, officials had to walk a diplomatic tightrope while investigating. Israeli forensic experts descended on the scene. American investigators joined in as well.
At first the authorities believed that the attack had been a suicide bombing. The bomb fragments told a different story. Experts from the European Union's joint law enforcement agency, Europol, found that ''the device had been remotely detonated,'' the agency said Tuesday.
Europol determined that a fake Michigan driver's license recovered at the scene had come from Lebanon. Police combed the beach-side towns and found an agency where another man with a similar fake license had tried to rent a car.
The identity of the Australian was the second major breakthrough. In September, a European intelligence service tipped off the Bulgarians about an Australian bombmaker of Lebanese descent, the former senior Western official said. The intelligence service said he had moved to Lebanon to join Hezbollah's military wing. Mr. Tsvetanov said Tuesday that the Australian and the Canadian moved to Lebanon, one in 2006 and one in 2010.
''It's time for Europeans to recognize that they can't look the other way when a terrorist organization is using their territory with impunity for fund-raising and logistics,'' said Daniel Benjamin, who until December was the top counterterrorism official at the State Department and is now a scholar at Dartmouth College.

HEADLINE: Profit Slides 6% at Disney as Movie and TV Divisions Lag

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES - Higher costs at ESPN and lower DVD sales resulted in a 6 percent decline in quarterly profit at Disney, the company said late Tuesday. But Disney's video game and Web unit finally swung to a profit and the conglomerate steered attention toward potential "Star Wars" growth.
Wall Street reacted positively; Disney shares climbed 3 percent in after-hours trading, to about $56. 
Robert A. Iger, chairman and chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, told analysts in a conference call that Disney's newly acquired Lucasfilm division is moving forward with "a few" additional movies that feature characters from the "Star Wars" universe.
Lawrence Kasdan, known for his work on "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi," and Simon Kinberg, a screenwriter whose credits include "Sherlock Holmes," are both working on the "stand-alone" films, Mr. Iger said. Disney has previously announced plans to make the seventh, eighth and ninth installments in the "Star Wars" saga; they will roll out over a six-year period starting in 2015 with one directed by J.J. Abrams.
Investors and analysts had been expecting a bumpy quarter. Disney made the unusual decision in November to note publicly some of its coming difficulties, like higher ESPN programming costs and a calendar quirk that would hurt theme parks by moving part of the New Year's holiday into a different quarter.
Even so, Disney beat Wall Street estimates of 76 cents a share. For the quarter, which ended on Dec. 29, Disney reported net income of $1.38 billion, or 77 cents a share, down from $1.46 billion, or 80 cents a share, in the same quarter a year earlier. Excluding one-time charges and gains, Disney reported 79 cents a share for the most recent quarter, the first in the company's fiscal year.
Revenue climbed 5 percent, to $11.34 billion.
ESPN had a significant impact on Disney's quarter, with programming expenses increasing for football and basketball. Those costs held back results for Disney's media networks unit, which houses the cable sports behemoth; operating income there increased a tepid 2 percent, to $1.21 billion. The growth came from the Disney Channel, ABC Family and higher ad sales at the ABC broadcast network.
Also dragging down quarterly results was Walt Disney Studios, which reported a 43 percent drop in operating income, to $234 million. The problem involved comparability: DVD sales for "Brave" and "Cinderella" were slight compared with disc releases in the same period a year earlier for "Cars 2" and "The Lion King."
Theme parks continued to be a bright spot. Operating income in Disney's parks and resorts division, watched as a barometer of the broader economy, increased 4 percent in the most recent quarter, to $577 million. Higher attendance at Disneyland Resort in California, where a "Cars"-themed area opened last summer, contributed to the growth, as did strong bookings on the company's Fantasy cruise ship.
Interactive media, a business unit that includes video games and Disney.com, turned to an operating profit of $9 million after 16 consecutive quarters of losses. The company cited growth from Disney-branded cellphones in Japan as part of the reason. But Mr. Iger told analysts that there would most likely be losses ahead. "We know we have more work to do," he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Toyota Says It Expects A Big Gain In 2013 Sales

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Lifted by strong sales in the United States and a weaker yen, Toyota Motor on Tuesday raised its profit forecast for the full financial year by 10 percent, to 860 billion yen, as the company, the world's largest automaker, recorded a return to profit levels it has not seen in years. 
Toyota said net profit was 99.9 billion yen, or $1.1 billion, in the three months through December, a 23.5 percent increase from results a year earlier, when the effects of the Japanese tsunami still weighed on its business.
Sales for the quarter climbed 26 percent, to 16.2 trillion yen, helped by a surge of almost 50 percent in sales of the company's fuel-efficient vehicles in the United States.
Cost reductions at the automaker, already known for its lean production, saved 320 billion yen during the quarter, the company said in a statement.
Now Toyota, whose Super Bowl ad ''Wish Granted'' topped viewership rankings, is set to get a wish of its own: the weaker yen, brought about by the economic policies of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who took office late last year, is set to lift Toyota's bottom line even further.
A weak currency helps Toyota because it lowers the cost of producing in Japan and inflates the yen value of overseas profits. Toyota is poised to get a particularly big lift from the weak yen because it manufactures more cars at home than its domestic rivals. Last year, Toyota made 53 percent of its vehicles in Japan and exported more than half of those cars.
Toyota shares have risen by almost 50 percent since mid-November, when the yen started to weaken. The currency has weakened by about 15 percent during the same period.
In 2013, Toyota expects to sell 9.91 million vehicles, improving on its record of 9.75 million last year, which helped it regain its crown as the world's top-selling automaker from General Motors. Those sales figures include Daihatsu Motor and Hino Motors, which are part of Toyota Group.
Such a performance could help Toyota get closer to the 1.7 trillion yen in net profit it reported in 2008, before the global financial crisis decimated its earnings.
Since then, a recall scandal, natural disasters and a strong yen have hindered a full comeback. But the combined challenges have also led executives at the 75-year-old automaker to revamp quality control, cut costs and take more risks with design.
''We believe that our efforts have been bearing fruit,'' Takahiko Ijichi, Toyota's senior managing officer, said in the statement on Tuesday. ''We are finally on the road to sustainable growth.''

HEADLINE: S.&P. E-Mails on Mortgage Crisis Show Alarm and Gallows Humor

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH and RON NIXON

 BODY:
10:17 p.m. | Updated
The executive at Standard & Poor's was clear: "This market is a wildly spinning top which is going to end badly."
That sober assessment of certain mortgage-related investments, delivered to colleagues in a confidential memo in December 2006, is now part of a trove of internal e-mails and documents that have come to light in a federal suit against S.& P., the nation's largest credit ratings agency.
The correspondence, made public in court documents late Monday, provide a glimpse at the inner workings of an institution that the Justice Department says fraudulently inflated credit ratings, with dire consequences for the entire economy. In a series of e-mails, tensions appeared to be escalating inside the firm's headquarters in Lower Manhattan as it publicly professed that its ratings were valid, even as the home loans bundled into mortgage-backed securities, or M.B.S., were failing at accelerating rates.
One comes from an S.& P. analyst in March 2007 borrowing from the Talking Heads song "Burning Down the House," creating new lyrics: "Subprime is boi-ling o-ver. Bringing down the house." S.& P. said prosecutors cherry-picked e-mails and that it would vigorously defend itself from "these unwarranted claims." 
In another 2007 e-mail, an analyst responds to a question about his new job: "Job's going great. Aside from the fact that the M.B.S. world is crashing, investors and the media hate us and we're all running around to save face ... no complaints."
Together, the documents show a portrait of some executives pushing to water down the firm's rating models in the hope of preserving market share and profits, while others expressed deep concerns about the poor performance of the securities and what they saw as a lowering of standards.
The United States attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., joined by attorneys general from 16 states, unveiled the case on Tuesday in Washington, accusing S.& P. and its parent, the McGraw-Hill Companies, of intentionally propping up ratings of shaky mortgage investments and setting them up for a crash when the financial crisis struck.
The government is seeking $5 billion in penalties to cover losses to investors like state pension funds and federally insured banks and credit unions. The amount would be more than five times what S.& P. made in 2011.
"The action we announce today marks an important step forward in the administration's ongoing effort to investigate - and punish - the conduct that is believed to have continued to the worst economic crisis in recent history," Mr. Holder said.
The government, by bringing the civil fraud charges under a 1989 law created after the savings and loan crisis, faces a lower burden of proof when the victims are federally insured banks. But prosecutors could still face a high bar in convincing a jury by a preponderance of evidence that S.& P. knew that its ratings were faulty and that it intended to deceive investors.
"If the facts prove out, it certainly seems like Standard & Poor's intentionally cooked its models in order to make the ratings higher than they otherwise thought they should be, in violation of the firm's own policies and standards," said Neil Barofsky, a former federal prosecutor who served as the special inspector general for the United States Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program from 2008 to 2011.
"What we don't know yet is, what's the other stuff that could be out there?" he added, noting that the vast body of internal documents might also contain exculpatory material for S.& P.
The ratings agency said in a statement: "Claims that we deliberately kept ratings high when we knew they should be lower are simply not true."
The company said that it had always been committed to "providing independent opinions on creditworthiness based on available information," and that its actions reflected its best judgments about the investments at the heart of the suit - about 40 collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.'s, an exotic type of security made up of bundles of residential mortgage-backed securities, which in turn were composed of individual home loans. Those securities were packaged by banks, rated by S.& P. and sold to investors in 2007.
"Unfortunately," the company's statement said, "S.& P., like everyone else, did not predict the speed and severity of the coming crisis and how credit quality would ultimately be affected."
Remarks that S.& P. employees made in internal memos and electronic communications show that as early as spring 2004, certain executives wanted to change the firm's rating methodology, but only after polling "an appropriate number of issuers and investment bankers" as to the "rating implications."
The idea of asking bankers what they thought about a change in the firm's methods shocked some S.& P. analysts and executives, including one who fired back, "What does 'rating implication' have to do with the search for truth? Are you implying that we might actually reject or stifle 'superior analytics' for market considerations?"
In May 2004, an analyst warned that S.&. P. had just lost to its competitor Moody's Investors Service the chance to rate a very large deal by being too hard-nosed about the amount of collateral that would be required to get a good rating. More collateral would mean less profit for Mizuho, the bank putting that deal together.
"We must address this now," she said - otherwise the firm would lose more deals.
The complaint describes a debate in 2004 and 2005 about whether S.& P. should change its model for rating C.D.O.'s and what effect the proposed changes might have on its business. The change was scheduled for July 2005, but before it could happen, an analyst sent an e-mail saying that according to the investment bank Bear Stearns, the older model "had been the 'best' " at rating weaker pools of mortgages, compared with Moody's and Fitch.
As the housing market deteriorated in early 2007, the gallows humor in the e-mails intensified. Banks that had created mortgage-backed securities were unloading them quickly, to avoid being stuck with any duds.
"That means the market will crash," one analyst told another in an instant message. "Deals will rush in before they take further loss."
"Yes," said the analyst's colleague. "We should not push criteria," continued the first, "but we give in anyway. Ahahhahaha."
About a month later, another S.& P. employee wrote in another instant message, reproduced in the complaint: "We rate every deal. It could be structured by cows and we would rate it."
In its statement Tuesday, S.& P. said that the cow e-mail "had nothing to do with R.M.B.S. or C.D.O. ratings or any S.& P. model, and the analyst had her concerns addressed with the issuer before S.& P. issued any rating."
S.& P. said that there was a robust internal debate about how a rapidly deteriorating housing market might affect the C.D.O.'s, "and we applied the collective judgment of our committee-based system in good faith," adding, "The e-mail excerpts cherry-picked by D.O.J. have been taken out of context, are contradicted by other evidence, and do not reflect our culture, integrity or how we do business."
It was unclear whether the Justice Department was looking at the other two major ratings agencies, Moody's and Fitch. Tony West, the acting associate attorney general, said he would not discuss actions against other ratings agencies.
Settlement talks between S.& P. and the Justice Department broke down in the last two weeks after prosecutors sought a penalty in excess of $1 billion and insisted that the company admit wrongdoing, several people with knowledge of the talks said. S.& P. had proposed a settlement of about $100 million, while the government pressed for an admission of guilt to at least one count of fraud, said the people.
McGraw-Hill shares fell nearly 11 percent on Tuesday. Moody's shares fell about 9 percent, to $45.09.
Andrew Ross Sorkin, Michael J. de la Merced and Floyd Norris contributed reporting.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Hazards of Drone Strikes Face Rare Public Scrutiny

BYLINE: By ROBERT F. WORTH, MARK MAZZETTI and SCOTT SHANE; Robert F. Worth reported from Sana, and Mark Mazzetti and Scott Shane from Washington.

 BODY:
SANA, Yemen -- Late last August, a 40-year-old cleric named Salem Ahmed bin Ali Jaber stood up to deliver a speech denouncing Al Qaeda in a village mosque in far eastern Yemen.
It was a brave gesture by a father of seven who commanded great respect in the community, and it did not go unnoticed. Two days later, three members of Al Qaeda came to the mosque in the tiny village of Khashamir after 9 p.m., saying they merely wanted to talk. Mr. Jaber agreed to meet them, bringing his cousin Waleed Abdullah, a police officer, for protection.
As the five men stood arguing by a cluster of palm trees, a volley of remotely operated American missiles shot down from the night sky and incinerated them all, along with a camel that was tied up nearby. 
The killing of Mr. Jaber, just the kind of leader most crucial to American efforts to eradicate Al Qaeda, was a reminder of the inherent hazards of the quasi-secret campaign of targeted killings that the United States is waging against suspected militants not just in Yemen but also in Pakistan and Somalia. Individual strikes by the Predator and Reaper drones are almost never discussed publicly by Obama administration officials. But the clandestine war will receive a rare moment of public scrutiny on Thursday, when its chief architect, John O. Brennan, the White House counterterrorism adviser, faces a Senate confirmation hearing as President Obama's nominee for C.I.A. director.
From his basement office in the White House, Mr. Brennan has served as the principal coordinator of a ''kill list'' of Qaeda operatives marked for death, overseeing drone strikes by the military and the C.I.A., and advising Mr. Obama on which strikes he should approve.
''He's probably had more power and influence than anyone in a comparable position in the last 20 years,'' said Daniel Benjamin, who recently stepped down as the State Department's top counterterrorism official and now teaches at Dartmouth. ''He's had enormous sway over the intelligence community. He's had a profound impact on how the military does counterterrorism.''
Mr. Brennan, a former C.I.A. station chief in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, has taken a particular interest in Yemen, sounding early alarms within the administration about the threat developing there, working closely with neighboring Saudi Arabia to gain approval for a secret C.I.A. drone base there that is used for American strikes, and making the impoverished desert nation a test case for American counterterrorism strategy.
In recent years, both C.I.A. and Pentagon counterterrorism officials have pressed for greater freedom to attack suspected militants, and colleagues say Mr. Brennan has often been a restraining voice. The strikes have killed a number of operatives of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the terrorist network's affiliate in Yemen, including Said Ali al-Shihri, a deputy leader of the group, and the American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki.
But they have also claimed civilians like Mr. Jaber and have raised troubling questions that apply to Pakistan and Somalia as well: Could the targeted killing campaign be creating more militants in Yemen than it is killing? And is it in America's long-term interest to be waging war against a self-renewing insurgency inside a country about which Washington has at best a hazy understanding?
Several former top military and intelligence officials -- including Stanley A. McChrystal, the retired general who led the Joint Special Operations Command, which has responsibility for the military's drone strikes, and Michael V. Hayden, the former C.I.A. director -- have raised concerns that the drone wars in Pakistan and Yemen are increasingly targeting low-level militants who do not pose a direct threat to the United States.
In an interview with Reuters, General McChrystal said that drones could be a useful tool but were ''hated on a visceral level'' in some of the places where they were used and contributed to a ''perception of American arrogance.''
Mr. Brennan has aggressively defended the accuracy of the drone strikes, and the rate of civilian casualties has gone down considerably since the attacks began in Yemen in 2009. He has also largely dismissed criticism that the drone campaign has tarnished America's image in Yemen and has been an effective recruiting tool for Al Qaeda.
''In fact, we see the opposite,'' Mr. Brennan said during a speech last year. ''Our Yemeni partners are more eager to work with us. Yemeni citizens who have been freed from the hellish grip of A.Q.A.P. are more eager, not less, to work with the Yemeni government.''
Christopher Swift, a researcher at Georgetown University who spent last summer in Yemen studying the reaction to the strikes, said he thought Mr. Brennan's comments missed the broader impact.
''What Brennan said accurately reflected people in the security apparatus who he speaks to when he goes to Yemen,'' Mr. Swift said. ''It doesn't reflect the views of the man in the street, of young human rights activists, of the political opposition.''
Though Mr. Swift said he thought that critics had exaggerated the role of the strikes in generating recruits for Al Qaeda, ''in the political sphere, the perception is that the U.S. is colluding with the Yemeni government in a covert war against the Yemeni people.''
''Even if we're winning in the military domain,'' Mr. Swift said, ''drones may be undermining our long-term interest in the goal of a stable Yemen with a functional political system and economy.''
A Parallel Campaign
American officials have never explained in public why the C.I.A. and the Pentagon's Joint Special Operations Command are carrying out parallel drone campaigns in Yemen. Privately, however, they describe an arrangement that has evolved since the frantic, ad hoc early days of America's war there.
The first strike in Yemen ordered by the Obama administration, in December 2009, was by all accounts a disaster. American cruise missiles carrying cluster munitions killed dozens of civilians, including many women and children. Another strike, six months later, killed a popular deputy governor, inciting angry demonstrations and an attack that shut down a critical oil pipeline.
Not long afterward, the C.I.A. began quietly building a drone base in Saudi Arabia to carry out strikes in Yemen. American officials said that the first time the C.I.A. used the Saudi base was to kill Mr. Awlaki in September 2011.
Since then, officials said, the C.I.A. has been given the mission of hunting and killing ''high-value targets'' in Yemen -- the leaders of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula who Obama administration lawyers have determined pose a direct threat to the United States. When the C.I.A. obtains specific intelligence on the whereabouts of someone on its kill list, an American drone can carry out a strike without the permission of Yemen's government.
There is, however, a tighter leash on the Pentagon's drones. According to American officials, the Joint Special Operations Command must get the Yemeni government's approval before launching a drone strike. This restriction is in place, officials said, because the military's drone campaign is closely tied to counterterrorism operations conducted by Yemeni special operations troops.
Yemen's military is fighting its own counterinsurgency battle against Islamic militants, who gained and then lost control over large swaths of the country last year. Often, American military strikes in Yemen are masked as Yemeni government operations.
Moreover, Mr. Obama demanded early on that each American military strike in Yemen be approved by a committee in Washington representing the national security agencies. The C.I.A. strikes, by contrast, resulted from a far more closed process inside the agency. Mr. Brennan plays a role in overseeing all the strikes.
There have been at least five drone strikes in Yemen since the start of the year, killing at least 24 people. That continues a remarkable acceleration over the past two years in a program that has carried out at least 63 airstrikes since 2009, according to The Long War Journal, a Web site that collects public data on the strikes, with an estimated death toll in the hundreds. Many of the militants reported killed recently were very young and do not appear to have had any important role with Al Qaeda.
''Even with Al Qaeda, there are degrees -- some of these young guys getting killed have just been recruited and barely known what terrorism means,'' said Naji al Zaydi, a former governor of Marib Province, who has been a vocal opponent of Al Qaeda and a supporter of Yemen's president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi.
Mr. Zaydi, a prominent tribal figure from an area that has long been associated with members of Al Qaeda's Yemeni affiliate, pointed out that the identity and background of these men were no mystery in Yemen's interlinked tribal culture.
A Deadly Ride
In one recent case, on Jan. 23, a drone strike in a village east of Sana killed a 21-year-old university student named Saleem Hussein Jamal and his cousin, a 33-year-old teacher named Ali Ali Nasser Jamal, who happened to have been traveling with him. According to relatives and neighbors of the two men, they were driving home from a nearby town called Jahana when five strangers offered to pay them for a ride. The drone-fired missile hit the vehicle, a twin-cab Toyota Hilux, just outside the village of Masnaa at about 9 p.m. The strangers were later identified in Yemeni news reports as members of Al Qaeda, though apparently not high-ranking ones.
After the strike, villagers were left to identify their two dead relatives from identity cards, scraps of clothing and the license plate of Mr. Jamal's Toyota; the seven bodies were shredded beyond recognition, as cellphone photos taken at the scene attest. ''We found eyes, but there were no faces left,'' said Abdullah Faqih, a student who knew both of the dead cousins.
Although most Yemenis are reluctant to admit it publicly, there does appear to be widespread support for the American drone strikes that hit substantial Qaeda figures like Mr. Shihri, a Saudi and the affiliate's deputy leader, who died in January of wounds received in a drone strike late last year.
Al Qaeda has done far more damage in Yemen than it has in the United States, and one episode reinforced public disgust last May, when a suicide bomber struck a military parade rehearsal in the Yemeni capital, killing more than 100 people.
Moreover, many Yemenis reluctantly admit that there is a need for foreign help: Yemen's own efforts to strike at the terrorist group have often been compromised by weak, divided military forces; widespread corruption; and even support for Al Qaeda within pockets of the intelligence and security agencies.
Yet even as both Mr. Brennan and Mr. Hadi, the Yemeni president, praise the drone technology for its accuracy, other Yemenis often point out that it can be very difficult to isolate members of Al Qaeda, thanks to the group's complex ties and long history in Yemen.
This may account for a pattern in many of the drone strikes: a drone hovers over an area for weeks on end before a strike takes place, presumably waiting until identities are confirmed and the targets can be struck without anyone else present.
In the strike that killed Mr. Jaber, the cleric, that was not enough. At least one drone had been overhead every day for about a month, provoking high anxiety among local people, said Aref bin Ali Jaber, a tradesman who is related to the cleric. ''After the drone hit, everyone was so frightened it would come back,'' Mr. Jaber said. ''Children especially were affected; my 15-year-old daughter refuses to be alone and has had to sleep with me and my wife after that.''
Anger at America
In the days afterward, the people of the village vented their fury at the Americans with protests and briefly blocked a road. It is difficult to know what the long-term effects of the deaths will be, though some in the town -- as in other areas where drones have killed civilians -- say there was an upwelling of support for Al Qaeda, because such a move is seen as the only way to retaliate against the United States.
Innocents aside, even members of Al Qaeda invariably belong to a tribe, and when they are killed in drone strikes, their relatives -- whatever their feelings about Al Qaeda -- often swear to exact revenge on America.
''Al Qaeda always gives money to the family,'' said Hussein Ahmed Othman al Arwali, a tribal sheik from an area south of the capital called Mudhia, where Qaeda militants fought pitched battles with Yemeni soldiers last year. ''Al Qaeda's leaders may be killed by drones, but the group still has its money, and people are still joining. For young men who are poor, the incentives are very strong: they offer you marriage, or money, and the ideological part works for some people.''
In some cases, drones have killed members of Al Qaeda when it seemed that they might easily have been arrested or captured, according to a number of Yemeni officials and tribal figures. One figure in particular has stood out: Adnan al Qadhi, who was killed, apparently in a drone strike, in early November in a town near the capital.
Mr. Qadhi was an avowed supporter of Al Qaeda, but he also had recently served as a mediator for the Yemeni government with other jihadists, and was drawing a government salary at the time of his death. He was not in hiding, and his house is within sight of large houses owned by a former president of Yemen, Ali Abdullah Saleh, and other leading figures.
Whatever the success of the drone strikes, some Yemenis wonder why there is not more reliance on their country's elite counterterrorism unit, which was trained in the United States as part of the close cooperation between the two countries that Mr. Brennan has engineered. One member of the unit, speaking on the condition of anonymity, expressed great frustration that his unit had not been deployed on such missions, and had in fact been posted to traffic duty in the capital in recent weeks, even as the drone strikes intensified.
''For sure, we could be going after some of these guys,'' the officer said. ''That's what we're trained to do, and the Americans trained us. It doesn't make sense.''

CORRECTION-DATE: April 4, 2013

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption on Feb. 6 with the continuation of an article about the inherent hazards of the quasi-secret campaign of targeted drone killings that the United States is waging against suspected militants in Yemen, Pakistan and Somalia misidentified the date on which an American drone strike destroyed a building, the ruins of which were shown. And a correction in this space on Monday misidentified the country in which the drone strike occurred. The strike was in southeastern Yemen, not Lebanon, and it occurred on Oct. 14, 2011 -- not on Sunday, Feb. 3, of this year.

HIGHLIGHT: For no good reason. 

 BODY:
Duncan Black is struck by a Meet the Press transcript in which Bob Woodward declares that 
if you stabilize the debt in some reasonable way, we're going to have growth. The unemployment rate should come down. 
The confidence fairy lives!
It's not just Woodward -- and it's certainly not just Republicans. I made a note for myself last year when Steny Hoyer declared that a deficit reduction agreement would
provide the biggest single stimulus to the economy we could achieve. Setting our economy back on a sustainable, predictable fiscal path will help us create jobs by restoring certainty for businesses and enabling them to plan for a future without the brinksmanship that has characterized this Congress. Without certainty, businesses can only focus on the short-term, which leads to missed opportunities for growth and fewer investments that have wider economic benefits. There is over $2 trillion in cash being held on corporate balance sheets just waiting for the right time - just waiting for a restoration of confidence - to put that money back to use growing the American economy. A comprehensive agreement on our fiscal future would, I believe, restore the atmosphere of fiscal calm needed for businesses to unleash their capital to great effect. 
What is the evidence that fiscal uncertainty -- as opposed to overall lack of demand -- is the reason corporations are sitting on cash? There isn't any.
This is, of course, just another illustration of the amazing way in which conventional wisdom has become dominated by fantasies that make DC insiders feel good about their preferred efforts -- Bowles/ Simpson is the universal elixir -- despite a complete lack of evidence for these fantasies. And what's even more amazing is that I suspect that Woodward, for example, had no idea that he was saying anything questionable; it was just part of what everyone in his circle knows.

HEADLINE: For Women, Reduced Access to Long-Term Care Insurance

BYLINE: JANE GROSS


HIGHLIGHT: Gender-distinct pricing is a strategy that will raise long-term care insurance rates for single women by as much as 40 percent beginning in April. 

 BODY:
"This was a very, very good business for a short time, with people buying long-term care insurance like it was candy in a candy store,'' said Michael Perry, a vice president at the Opus Advisory Group, a strategic financial planning firm in Purchase, N.Y.
No more. Mr. Perry has sold only one long-term care policy in the last six months and is "backing off from marketing'' them as he watches this corner of the insurance business contract, raise premiums, tighten eligibility requirements and reduce key benefits. Long-term care insurance is a comparatively new product, launched in the late '80s, and only now, as claims begin to pour in, have the actual costs to insurers become apparent. 
Companies like MetLife, Prudential Financial, Allianz and Berkshire Financial (a subsidiary of Guardian) have stopped selling new policies and are hiking premiums for the ones already in place -- up 37 percent, by one estimate, in 2011. Insurers are increasing elimination periods -- the period during which a beneficiary must cover his or her own costs -- and reducing inflation protection to 3 percent from 5 percent, once customary. They are requiring home visits instead of phone interviews from new applicants, as well as blood tests and a thorough examination of their medical records. 
But the change that has generated the most public attention is so-called gender-distinct pricing, a new strategy that will raise rates for single women by as much as 40 percent beginning in April. Genworth Financial, the nation's largest long-term care insurance provider with more than a million policy holders, is the first to win approval by state insurance commissions to raise rates for single women purchasing new policies. Women, most of them single by the time they reach advanced age, cost the company $2 of every $3 in benefits paid so far, according to Steve Zabel, Genworth's senior vice president for long-term care insurance. 
The company also will introduce what Mr. Zabel called "enhanced underwriting," or more stringent qualifying standards, including blood testing to check for nicotine, drugs and markers of cardiovascular disease for all new applicants, regardless of gender or marital status.
Now permitted in all states except Montana and Colorado, gender-distinct pricing will not affect Genworth's current policyholders, only new applicants. But all other carriers are likely to follow, according to Jesse Slome, executive director of the American Association for Long-Term Insurance, a trade group in Westlake Village, Calif. With the entire industry headed toward higher rates, Mr. Slome recently warned women that "the window is closing" and that now is the time to grab a policy while the price is still manageable. 
Women have always paid less than men for life insurance. But because they live longer, women are the disproportionate beneficiaries of long-term care insurance, which paid out $6.6 billion in benefits in 2011. Mr. Slome expects that number to top $7 billion in 2012. 
The reasons are well known:
* On average, women outlive men by five years. Among those born in 1960, the average man will live to age 67 and the average woman to age 73. And women who reach age 65 can expect to live an average of 20 more years. 
* By age 75, 7 in 10 women are widowed, divorced or have never been married. Some 40 percent of them live alone, compared to 22 percent of men. Two-thirds of those past the age of 85 are women, as are 80 percent of centenarians.
* Women who live to age 65 experience on average two years of disability requiring assistance before death. Those who reach age 80 will require three years of assistance. 
* In nursing homes, the most expensive form of long-term care, 7 in 10 residents are women. They represent 76 percent of the residents in assisted living facilities and two-thirds of the recipients of home care. Virtually none of this is paid for by Medicare, the government's health plan for those 65-and-over. In nursing homes, Medicaid, a poverty program, kicks in for residents who run out of money. 
"Woman live longer than men," said Suzanna de Baca, a vice president of wealth strategies at Ameriprise Financial. "This may mean we experience a longer period of decline. Unfortunately, we are often less likely to have a partner around to help take care of us than our male counterparts.'' 
Long-term care, Mr. Slome said, "is truly a women's issue." 
While acknowledging the extra expense of caring for women, Mr. Slome said that in his view insurance carriers are being disingenuous in blaming the new policies on long-apparent gender differences. Rather he said, the culprit in the changing requirements is interest rates. "Blame the Federal Reserve,'' he said. 
Insurance carriers invest premiums and need to earn enough on that investment to pay benefits. When interest rates were higher, it was not all that difficult. Now the numbers don't pencil out, and stockholders are fuming. But it is illegal to file for premium increases with the state insurance commissions based on changes in the financial market, Mr. Slome said. 
This position does not endear Mr. Slome to his membership, at least one of whom disputes the claim. Asked if the new rate policies were related to interest rates, Mr. Zabel of Genworth, in an e-mail, replied with a succinct "no." 
Insurers say they were not able to judge the costs of care until the payouts began in earnest.
So what is a woman trying to prepare for old age supposed to do, especially after the elimination of the Class Act, a modest attempt to include long-term care in the Affordable Care Act? 
Ms. da Baca suggests "careful and thorough budgeting," "focusing on wellness," and "proactive steps" to research suitable places to live when home is no longer an option. Ms. da Baca also advises women to make home modifications -- incrementally, as one's budget permits -- to increase the chances that you'll be able to stay there longer. 
Mr. Perry, of the Opus Advisory Group, suggests an intriguing option: life insurance with a chronic care rider, which permits the policy-holder to spend money for such needs while alive, although doing so will reduce the tax-free death benefit. Still, not all buyers -- or their survivors -- are willing to sacrifice those benefits.
"The need is still there, no question about it,'' Mr. Perry said. But long-term care insurance is likely to become much harder for everyone to find and afford, especially women.

HEADLINE: A Look at the Role of Policy in America's Shale Oil and Gas Era

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: An energy economist explores how American policies and open markets, not just technology and geology, lie behind the surprising shale oil and gas boom. 

 BODY:
You probably already read about California being added to the list of states facing the economic opportunities and environmental issues that come with abundant shale oil or gas (oil in California's case, because of the Monterey Shale). And if you've been reading here for awhile, you're aware of the reality, for better and worse, of "oil's long goodbye" and "the gas age."
But there's now more vital reading for anyone interested in understanding the reasons for the U.S.-centric surge in oil and gas extraction from such shale layers, which exist in many places around the world. In an Op-Ed article, Christof Rühl, the group chief economist of BP, explains how this revolution -- with its attendant benefits and risks -- is not simply about geology or technology. Here's a core excerpt: 
North America's oil and gas renaissance, which has the potential to fuel a U.S. industrial recovery with cheaper energy, is not a happy accident of geology and lucky drilling. The dramatic rise in shale-gas extraction and the tight-oil revolution (mostly crude oil that is found in shale deposits) happened in the United States and Canada because open access, sound government policy, stable property rights and the incentive offered by market pricing unleashed the skills of good engineers.
Here are a couple of additional passages of interest to Dot Earth readers:
Policy, not geology, is driving the extraordinary turn of events that is boosting America's oil industry. East Asia boasts shale and tight-oil resources greater than those of the United States. Latin America and Africa too have very substantial endowments. However, the competitive environment, government policy and available infrastructure mean that North America will dominate the production of shale gas and tight oil for some time to come....
Communities must decide whether the carbon-reducing benefit of using natural gas in power generation outweighs the fear of new drilling technologies. Europe too must grasp the market nettle. Without a clear signal that carbon has a price, European power utilities will be charmed by the cheapness of coal, increasingly available thanks to America's embrace of shale gas.
These are strange and wondrous (that's different than wonderful) times, indeed, for those grappling with the world's entwined energy and climate challenges.
In a speech at Pace University yesterday, Veerappa Moily, India's minister of petroleum and natural gas, described how, as part of a government plan for energy self sufficiency by 2030, India is planning an aggressive push to extract natural gas from its large shale deposits.
There are hints that the country has many times more recoverable shale gas than the 2011 estimate of 38 trillion cubic feet from the United States Energy Information Administration.
But as Rühl explains, this is not simply a matter of more drilling rigs. For more on why this is so, it's worth a quick look back at what the energy analyst David Victor, from the University of California, San Diego, wrote here last year about impediments to shale extraction in Asia:
In the real world I suspect that this source of gas will emerge slowly because none of these markets has the conditions in place to encourage the kind of private-sector drive that has made the gas revolution so dramatic in the U.S. It's also important to remember that there are lots of other sources of gas. China, for example, is still struggling to tap its coal bed methane and other sources of gas, and a viable large-scale business model for gas doesn't fully exist in that country. Shale gas is still down the list of the best ways for China to boost its gas supplies. The same is true of India, where a nightmare of gas pricing regulations and pipeline troubles hobble gas of any kind.
I also encourage you revisit recent input on impediments to expanded Asian gas drilling from Derek Scissors of the Heritage Foundation and Julio Friedmann of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
Finally, this all points to another reality -- that if you care about blunting the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, you'd better start hoping for a lot more basic science on how to capture that gas cheaply and stash it away for safekeeping.
It was fascinating to read how basic science on sea urchin biology revealed a nickel catalyst that could greatly improve the efficiency of processes capturing carbon dioxide.
But investment in such basic science is still a dribble. Note to Obama (once again): "Are Chemists, Engineers on Green Jobs List?"
