HEADLINE: Business and Health;
Potential Savings Of National Care

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH business lobbyists generally oppose national health insurance, it could bring substantial savings to many companies, according to a new study by the Economic and Social Institute, a nonprofit research organization in Washington. The institute looked at medical costs in the steel and electronics industries and the additional taxes that these industries would face in a Government-financed system like Canada's.
The study found that under a Canada-style system, USX and Bethlehem Steel would have net savings of $2,300 to $3,200 for each union worker in the first year. It estimated smaller savings for technology-oriented companies like Xerox, Motorola and Hewlett-Packard, which typically have relatively young employees who have accepted the cost-slowing disciplines of health maintenance organizations and other managed care groups. The institute put the average savings for the three companies at $1,000 to $2,300 for each employee. 
 Such estimates of savings are disputed, to be sure, as the Bush Administration and Congress grapple with rising voter concern about health-care costs. The growing number of employers that provide little or no medical coverage would, of course, see their costs rise, which helps explain why business groups have had trouble finding common ground on health policy.
Walter B. Maher, who heads the Chrysler Corporation's health policy office in Washington, said many large companies were facing higher costs because hospitals and doctors had raised fees to cover services to millions of uninsured Americans. Among the uninsured, he said, are three-quarters of all restaurant and hotel workers, half of the retail employees and 60 percent of low-income people, who have been shut out of Medicaid by hard-pressed budget cutters in many states.
Mr. Maher said the institute study, directed by Jack E. Meyer, a health economist and official in the Nixon, Ford and Carter administrations, was consistent with official comparisons of spending in industrial countries. The United States spent $2,566 per capita on health last year, trailed by Canada at $1,795 and Sweden at $1,421. "The frightening thing," Mr. Maher said, "is that the gulf has widened between the U.S. and our main competitors." Germany spent $1,287 and Japan $1,113.
The study, paid for by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, said that under a Canadian-style system, national health spending would decline by $241 billion a year, even after the addition of $14 billion to cover uninsured Americans. There would be $113 billion in administrative savings, $114 billion through the reduced use of medical technology and the elimination of malpractice costs, waste and unnecessary care. It said reducing physicians' incomes to Canadian levels would save $28 billion.
Challenging the numbers, John Sheils, a health-care consultant who has studied the Canadian system, said administrative savings would be only $46 billion. Mr. Sheils, a vice president of Lewin/ICF, a management consulting firm in Washington, added that Americans would rush to use free care, which would inflate spending by $79 billion. That would wipe out the savings and produce net additional costs of $33 billion.
Uwe E. Reinhardt, a Princeton University health economist, said American physicians' fees were two and a halftimes those in Canada, largely because the American physicians spent nearly half of their $260,000 average gross income last year on overhead costs like extra clerks to handle paperwork, amortization of laboratory machines, and malpractice insurance. Overhead has been rising 6 percent a year. But in Canada, where there is less paperwork, and expensive equipment is discouraged in doctors' offices, overhead costs have remained constant, he said.
Dr. John M. Eisenberg, a member of a Congressional advisory commission on payments to doctors who is chief of general internal medicine at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, said reducing doctors' earnings to Canadian levels would save only about 5 percent of total health-care spending. He noted that although take-home pay was considerably higher for American surgeons, anesthesiologists and a number of other specialists, the incomes of family doctors and internists were similar in the two countries.
But even if physician incomes were held down, medical costs would continue to rise because 18,000 new doctors graduate from medical school each year, say Dr. Kevin Grumbach and Dr. Philip R. Lee of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California, San Francisco. In a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association last spring, they said there would be 176 active physicians for every 100,000 people by the year 2000, compared with 144 in 1986. Even if physicians' incomes were held to the general inflation rate, they said, the new doctors would increase national health expenditures by $21 billion in 2000.

HEADLINE: Japan Plans New Drive To Buy More U.S. Goods

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 11

 BODY:
In the surest sign that American trade officials are about to arrive in Tokyo, the Japanese Government said tonight that it would soon announce another program to encourage companies here to buy more components and materials from the United States and to enter more strategic alliances with American companies.
Details of the program, called the "Business Global Partnership," were sketchy, although it seemed less specific than last year's effort, which included a tax credit to companies that increased their overseas purchases by 10 percent or more. 
 Still, the announcement of the program by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry tonight seemed to reflect the deepening worries here over the ballooning trade deficit, which has soared as Japanese consumers slow their purchases of Western luxury goods.
 
Message for Baker and Hill
 The new program was raised briefly today by Michio Watanabe, Japan's new Foreign Minister, in talks with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. But it seemed intended for Carla A. Hills, the United States special trade representative, who arrives here later this week for the first time in two years.
A senior official of the ministry said tonight that the program, which will be officially announced this Friday, will initially involve 40 big Japanese companies that trade with the United States. Those 40 companies, he said, account for roughly half of all of the trade between the two countries.
He said the companies' performance would be "monitored at a regular interval." But there appeared to be no method of enforcement to assure that they carried through out purchases of American products and materials.
In an announcement that seemed timed to the Government initiative, the Toyota Motor Corporation, one of Japan's largest exporters, announced today that its purchase of American-made auto parts, materials and equipment would grow to $5 billion in the Japanese fiscal year that runs from April 1994 to March 1995. In the current fiscal year, the company has said, it expects to buy $3.2 billion in American-made goods.
 
'A Natural Progression'
 A spokesman for Toyota said today that because the auto maker was expanding its manufacturing in the United States and importing more American parts for similar models made in Japan, the increase was "a natural progression." But the announcement, he said, was part of the company's effort "to cooperate with what MITI is doing."
The Nissan Motor Company said on Friday that it would increase its American purchases to $3.3 billion in the 1994 fiscal year, up more than 40 percent from the current level of $2.3 billion.
In addition to purchases of more American parts and components, the plan described by officials today encourages Japanese companies to seek American partners so that they can design new products with foreign components. "We have asked companies to cooperate before, but never in so comprehensive a way," the senior Japanese trade official said tonight.
In addition to auto and electronics companies -- which get the most attention from the Government here -- producers of glass, paper, even electric power were asked to participate in the program.
The plan was originally planned for release during President Bush's planned trip here in late November. But Mr. Bush canceled his Asia tour last week in what appeared to be a concession to Congressional critics who said he was focusing too much on foreign policy and too little on the recession in the United States.
Officials at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry conceded tonight that their plans might be stymied unless the Japanese economy picked up. Through the 1980's, Japan's growth in imports was led by consumer spending. But recently, that has fallen off as Japanese have begun to worry about the effects of the economic slowdown.
During her visit here, Ms. Hills is expected to concentrate on the negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. An important point for the United States is to obtain a concession by Japan that it will gradually open its rice market. That concession appears to be near.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices Up in Light Day Overseas

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved a bit higher in light trading yesterday.
The gains were recorded during trading in Asian and European markets. Activity in the cash market for Government securities was closed in the United States in observance of Veterans Day. 
 Trading in Treasury bond and bill futures did take place at the Board of Trade. In a shortened session in Chicago, prices rose slightly. At the close of trading, the nearby December bond contract was offered at a price of 100 14/32, up by 5/32.
 
Economic Data Due Tomorrow
 The pace of activity should quicken somewhat today, but market participants said business was likely to remain sluggish until tomorrow, when new economic reports, including producer price data for October, are scheduled to be released.
At the close of overseas trading in the secondary market for Treasury notes and bonds yesterday, the new 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 7.86 percent, down from 7.87 percent late on Friday.
Among note issues, the new 7.50 percent 10-year notes were offered at a price to yield 7.40 percent in when-issued trading, compared with 7.41 percent late on Friday. And the outstanding 6 percent two-year notes were offered at a price of 100 21/32, down by 2/32, to yield 5.64 percent.
Rates on short-term Treasury bills were unchanged from late on Friday.
 
3-Month Bills at 4.61%
 Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 4.61 percent. Six-month bill rates were offered at a discount rate of 4.67 percent.
Because of the Veterans Day holiday, the Treasury's weekly auction of new three-month and six-month bills, normally conducted on Monday, will be held today.
Traders in the markets for investment-grade corporate bonds and tax-exempt municipal securities said activity was extremely slow. Prices of most issues in both markets were unchanged on the day, the traders said.
No new issues of corporate or tax-exempt securities were priced yesterday.

Ex-Head of C.F.T.C. Eager to Begin Fed Job

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Susan Meredith Phillips, the former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and a proponent of free markets, has sailed through the Senate confirmation process to become a governor of the Federal Reserve Board.
"This is every economist's ultimate dream," she said in an interview yesterday. "I'm thrilled." 
 Ms. Phillips, 46 years old, the vice president for finance at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, will finish the remainder of Martha R. Seger's 14-year term that began on Feb. 14, 1984. The Fed now has one remaining vacancy on its seven-member board. Lawrence Lindsay, a White House economist, has been nominated by President Bush and has been approved by the Senate Banking Committee, but not yet by the full Senate.
A finance expert, Ms. Phillips's hands-on administrative experience and membership on several corporate boards helped propel her into her new job, she said. "As a chief financial officer of a large university, I'm always trying to issue debt and financing projects."
Ms. Phillips is not known to have strong views on monetary policy. At her confirmation hearings, she said she shared everyone's disappointment in recent economic reports. But she also struck a cautious note when asked whether the Fed should act more aggressively. "We have to be very careful not to create new problems," she said yesterday.
At the Fed, Ms. Phillips is expected to focus on regulatory issues. She headed the futures commission from 1983 to 1987, in a period in which firms won greater ability to use options and futures.
"She'll put less stress on mandating minimums and maximums," said Jerry L. Jordan, the chief economist at the First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles, "and more on having institutions divulge more information so that the market can act as the ultimate disciplinarian."
But favoring free markets should not be confused with laissez-faire, Ms. Phillips warned. "I spent a lot of time at the C.F.T.C. strengthening commodity exchanges's audit systems," she said. "That's why they performed so well in the 1987 stock market crash."
Ms. Phillips, who was born in Richmond, was an Air Force brat who lived in half a dozen states, England and Germany by the time she started high school. A college math and chemistry major at Agnes Scott College in Georgia, Ms. Phillips went on to earn a Ph.D. in finance at Louisiana State University in 1974.
Ms. Phillips will be joining a male-dominated institution in which expertise counts for a lot and policy debates often take on the air of university seminars. But those who have known her for a long time have no qualms.
"She'll do superbly," said Linda Pickthorne Fletcher, the dean of business school at the University of Tennessee in Chattanooga and Ms. Phillips's doctoral adviser. "She's very analytical, and she'll concentrate on the things that she knows best."

HEADLINE: New Energy Bill Held Unlikely Soon

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 11

 BODY:
Despite optimistic predictions by proponents of conservation and renewable fuels that major new energy legislation would be on the Senate floor by Thanksgiving, Congressional officials say it may be impossible to pass anything more than a limited alternative for months.
Ten days ago, liberal Democrats and an unlikely coalition of environmental groups, small utilities and the automobile industry derailed the Bush Administration's energy bill. Building a coalition for a substitute will be much more difficult. 
 "It's going to be a tall order to come up with a new energy bill," said Senator Frank H. Murkowski, an Alaska Republican who is a member of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. "The birth pains that came with the last one were extensive."
The old energy bill, which was backed by the White House and the oil industry, tried to stitch together a grab bag of provisions that addressed off-shore and Arctic oil drilling, conservation, incentives to promote greater efficiency in buildings and appliances, deregulation of the utility industry and alternative energy sources like nuclear and hydroelectric power.
Without the impetus of a crisis, like the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait last year, which gave the old energy bill a push, Congress is likely to change its approach and deal with such issues individually, in a fashion that will fail to establish a coordinated strategy, analysts say.
"It's out of sight, out of mind," said Senator J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, a Democrat who is the chairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. He had sponsored the defeated legislation.
"The price of gasoline is O.K. now, so there must not be a problem," he said. "A Gallup poll shows that nearly a majority of the American people don't know that we import any oil." Nearly half the oil consumed in the United States is imported.
 
Several Bills Under Way
 A few alternative bills are now in play, but none appears to have a chance of passage until late next year, at least.
One, sponsored by Senator Richard H. Bryan, a Nevada Democrat, would mandate an increase in automobile fuel efficiency from the current 27.5 miles a gallon to 40 over the next decade. The Senate Commerce Committee passed the measure, which environmentalists say would conserve 2.5 million barrels of oil a day, but lobbying by the auto industry has so far helped impede action by the full Senate.
The auto industry helped defeat the original energy package because executives feared liberals would add amendments on the floor to mandate fuel efficiency. With the industry reeling from decreased sales, several senators who helped Mr. Bryan sink the original bill are now opposing his efforts to raise mileage standards.
Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who heads the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and is one of the strongest advocates of the auto industry in Congress, is working to keep anything similar to the Bryan measure from being considered in the House.
Daniel Becker, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club and a primary strategist for the environmental movement on energy legislation, said Mr. Dingell could stop his committee from considering the Bryan bill, but he would be unable stop the full House from adding it as an amendment to a House energy bill next year.
But a number of House staff members who monitor energy policy are not as confident.
"Dingell is a very formidable adversary," Mr. Bryan said.
But even if both Congressional chambers do pass the bill, the White House has threatened to veto any legislation that includes stricter fuel-economy standards, arguing that the country cannot afford to burden the industry with more costs.
 
Alaska Drilling Measure
 The House Merchant Marine Committee is considering legislation that would allow oil drilling in the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge. It was the strong opposition by environmental groups to opening up one of the country's last virgin preserves that sank the old energy bill, and the House measure is not considered any more passable.
Representative Philip R. Sharp, an Indiana Democrat who is chairman of the Energy and Power Subcommittee, is sponsoring legislation that would promote the construction of natural gas pipelines, seek reductions of carbon-dioxide emissions that cause global warming and encourage the development of renewable energy sources like wind, solar and geothermal power.
Mr. Sharp's panel overwhelmingly approved his measure, but not before it carved out several of his most ambitious proposals.

HEADLINE: U.S. Plans To Insure Soviet Deal

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 11

 BODY:
A Federal agency has agreed to provide partial insurance against expropriation, political violence and currency convertibility problems for an American investment fund that plans to purchase $250 million worth of minority stakes in the commercial affiliates of Soviet companies in the military industry.
James D. Berg, executive vice president of the agency, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, which is known as OPIC, said today that the agreement was reached on Friday and represented the agency's first dealings on investments in the Soviet Union. 
 The move came in response to President Bush's endorsement of closer economic ties with the Soviet Union at his meeting with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in July. Then, in September, the President waived for the Soviet Union a clause in the Foreign Assistance Act that barred OPIC from doing business in Communist countries, Mr. Berg said.
 
Helps American Companies
 OPIC's purpose is to further United States foreign policy and to enable American companies to compete with foreign rivals, which often receive more generous assistance from their governments.
Formidable barriers remain before OPIC actually provides the insurance. The managers of the investment fund, called the Soviet Companies Fund, have not yet struck any deals with Soviet companies. And no insurance policies will actually be written until the agency has an agreement with the Soviet Union or the republics for either Moscow or the republic governments to take primary responsibility for any claims.
Mr. Berg said he expected such an agreement by the end of this year.
The collapse of central authority in the Soviet Union has also made investing there more treacherous, with success no longer assured by cozying up to a few key ministers, said Eugene J. Milosh, president of the American Association of Exporters and Importers.
 
Confusing Signals
 A small company in northern Virginia recently held a news conference here to announce that it would be marketing Soviet jet fighters and aircraft engine parts. An official from the company's Soviet partners then took the podium and announced that the jet fighters would not be available at all.
The fund is being jointly sponsored by Batterymarch Financial Management, a Boston company, and the State Commission on Military Industrial Production in the Soviet Union. It will invest in commercial companies being created by military enterprises that the commission oversees.
OPIC is reserving for the Soviet Companies Fund $100 million of its available insurance coverage. The insurance will cost roughly 25 cents to 60 cents for every $100 of coverage for the fund's investors. American taxpayers will have to pay only if claims are filed and OPIC cannot collect from Soviet or republic authorities.
Given the mounting political, economic and financial chaos in the Soviet Union, the insurance premiums represent, "a fantastic buy," Mr. Milosh said.
 
A Good Loss Rate
 Mr. Berg said that OPIC's premiums were based on the type of project rather than the location. OPIC's loss rate is less than 1 percent, he said.
Marilyn J. Pitchford, chief financial officer of Batterymarch, said the company had identified six Soviet companies as likely investment prospects and eight additional companies as promising. Referring to recent reports that some Soviet entrepreneurs may be seeking to defraud foreign investors, she said, "We've certainly heard that, and it's something we're not naive about."
One of the likely prospects is Leningrad Optical Mechanical Enterprises Amalgamated, which makes both lenses for the military and microscopes and medical devices for looking inside the human body, Ms. Pitchford said. Another prospect produces aircraft and another specializes in metallurgy and ceramics.
Although Soviet consumer-goods industries have a dismal reputation for backwardness, the Soviet military sector is considered to have some of the world's best scientists pioneering some technologies.
 
$250 Milion Fund
 Based on informal commitments and expressions of interest from investors, mostly large pension funds, the Soviet Companies Fund will have about $250 million when legally binding commitments are made at the end of this month, Ms. Pitchford said. Batterymarch manages about $6.5 billion in the United States and abroad.
Each investor in the fund will have the choice of whether to pay for insurance; only 40 percent coverage would be available if all investors sought it and had to share the $100 million in coverage. OPIC insures up to 90 percent of any single investment, so that the $100 million could provide coverage for $111 million worth of investments.
The fund will be seeking stakes of about 30 percent in Soviet companies, with employees, cities, republics and the affiliated military enterprises owning the rest, Ms. Pitchford said.
Conservatives here no longer object to American partnerships with the Soviet military-industrial complex. "The idea that OPIC would be giving political risk insurance here seems to be right," said Stephen D. Bryen, who was Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for trade security policy throughout the Reagan Administration.
Kim R. Holmes, director of foreign policy and defense studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington, said that he was skeptical of using Government money to insure private business risks anywhere abroad, but had no objections to American money being invested in deals with Soviet military-supply companies.
"Any kind of American investment that could help conversion I think would be a good idea," he said.
Ms. Pitchford said that even if the joint ventures proved successful, she doubted that military companies holding stakes in them would use the profits to produce more weapons. "We do believe what we've heard about Yeltsin and Gorbachev, you know, having a commitment to scale down the military," she said.

HEADLINE: Careers;
For Nurses, Travel and A Job, Too

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
TO fill their nursing vacanies, hospitals around the country can draw on Travcorps Inc. of Malden, Mass., and its data bank of 10,000 nurses willing to travel.
"At any one time we have 1,200 to 1,500 nurses actively placed in hospitals around the country." Bruce M. Male, 49 years old, the president and owner of the company, said last week. "This is a people business." 
 Hospitals pay one fee to Travcorps, and out of that Travcorps pays a nurse anywhere from $17 to $27 an hour. It also pays for the nurse's travel to the hospital and arranges for living quarters. Its benefits package for nurses includes standard life, health and accident insurance. "We don't have a pension plan for them," Mr. Male said.
He would not say how much above expenses Travcorps charges as its fee. "It's proprietary information," he said. But he did say: "We are less expensive than the typical local nursing registry; they have higher overhead than we do. We only advertise in national journals."
"We send the hospitals who need nurses a complete personnel file on each referral," he said, "plus we require mandatory phone interviews with the nurses by hospital personnel. We do get occasional rejections of nurses by the hospital, but on the other hand we accept only about one out of five nurses who apply for job placement."
Travcorps does not charge anything if a nurse goes to a hospital and does not work out, he said.
His favorite story involves a hospital, no longer in existence, in Muleshoe, Tex. "It's a nowhere town that had a little hospital with about 25 beds," Mr. Male said. "The nurses found the people there to be very appreciative and ready to open their homes because of a lack of rental living quarters. Over a period of time we supplied about eight nurses for that hospital, since closed because of financial problems about three years ago."
As for turnover, he said: "No, we do not have shock troops to send in case a nurse gets sick or leaves the job, but we do have that computer system. If the nurse leaves suddenly, replacement becomes top priority."
Unlike nurses who sign with a local registry to work for a week or so, his nurses sign for three months, and often stay for another three months.
Sometimes they are assigned to work the difficult-to-fill night shifts that typically are 11 P.M. to 7 A.M.
"We also do a lot of 12-hour shifts," he said. "This gives nurses a shorter workweek and more time to explore the area."
A nurse might be sent to a relatively exotic location like Alaska or Hawaii. More typical would be an assignment to Florida to help meet the big winter demand for nurses to treat retirees and vacationers. In the summer, nurses might be needed at hospitals in northern vacation areas. "Not in Masachusetts," he said, "because of our recession."
"Some do private-duty work," he said. He recalled a nurse who spent months caring for an Arab sheik and helped get him home to the Middle East. "But that is not our main business," he added. "Supplying hospitals is."
"We have two profiles of our typical nurse," he said. The majority are single women about 27 years old. "We get several wedding invitations every month from this age group," he said, Others are single women over age 45 who are interested in travel.
Once the assignments are over the nurses can stay with the hospital or they can return home and await another assignment.
Mr. Male said he founded the company as "a frustrated entrepreneur about 14 years ago."
He had graduated from Tufts University, where he majored in biology and chemistry, and then got a master of health sciences degree at Northeastern University, also in the Boston area. He worked for a health-care supplier but wanted to "get out on my own."
The growing shortage of hospital nurses "gave me the concept of traveling nurses to fill shortages around the country," he said.
"To start, I had $1,739 in my checkbook, a telephone, plus an American Express card to use for booking flights for the first nurses I sent out," he added. "I also had two kids, a mortgage and no income."
His first client was Maureen McGuire, then director of nursing at the Tulane University Medical Center in New Orleans. "She was brave enough to take my first nurses," he said.
Today Travcorps has "a very large computer" and about 100 staff people, many of them working in data processing and accounting, he said.
"We have some nurse representatives who do customer service work with hospitals that might hire the firm's nurses," he said.
He does a lot of traveling himself -- yesterday he was at Brackenridge Hospital in Austin, Tex., where his company has about 60 nurses.
Dr. Joyce J. Fitzpatrick, dean of nursing at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, said the traveling nurses concept "is a very good idea," adding that "it keeps many nurses in nursing."
She warned that some agencies had not adhered to professional standards, and she urged the hiring hospitals to check the nurses they hire carefully. Travcorps has been around 14 years, she pointed out.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Mixed Signals On Westinghouse

BYLINE: By John Holusha

 BODY:
WHEN the Westinghouse Electric Corporation unexpectedly announced last month that it was taking a $1.68 billion write-off because of problems with property loans at its credit subsidiary, it became part of the real estate mess of the early 1990's. The price of the stock dropped steadily from the low 20's to the midteens.
It bottomed out -- at least temporarily -- at $15.75 in late October and then began a slow recovery, closing at $17 yesterday, down 25 cents. But a lot of uncertainty remains. 
 Has it taken all the bad medicine, or are there more surprises? Can the dividend be held at $1.40 a share? Will it be trimmed or eliminated as the price for a new package of credits from banks?
Nicholas Heyman, an analyst at County NatWest, predicts the worst is yet to come. The current dividend, he said, "is not sustainable." The only question, he continued, is how much will it be reduced? "At this point, the best case is a cut to 70 cents; the worst is elimination."
In Mr. Heyman's view, the latest write-off coupled with a write-off taken earlier this year but charged against 1990's results merely trimmed the price of Westinghouse Credit's portfolio to the level of properties being marketed by the Resolution Trust Corporation, which is cleaning up the remains of collapsed savings and loans. To sell its properties aggressively, Mr. Heyman said, Westinghouse will have to make further price cuts.
"We are talking another $500 million to $1 billion" in write-offs, he said.
When this news comes out, perhaps in the fourth quarter, he expects the stock's small recovery to evaporate. "The second bounce down will probably be lower," he said, noting that Westinghouse shares bottomed at about $13 in the early 80's.
Company officials have tried to send signals that they are concerned about preserving the dividendbut will do what is necessary to arrange the bank credits. In a statement provided by the company, the chairman, Paul E. Lego, said, "Cutting the dividend is one of the last things I would like to do" in shoring up the company's financial structure. But, he added, "I will do what I have to do."
The company also said it was encouraged by its talks with banks but did not expect to have agreements in hand before the end of this month.
As might be expected of a company that has given off such mixed signals that analysts' estimates of earnings for the year range from $1.25 a share to $2.03, there are other points of view.
Kemp Fuller Jr., an analyst with Baird, Patrick & Company, sees sun through the clouds.
Mr. Fuller points out that credit is only a small part of the Pittsburgh-based company, adding that "the remaining parts of the business will recover when the economy recovers."
He said the most recent write-off had cut Westinghouse's real estate to market value and the properties could probably be sold without much more fuss.
Mr. Fuller added that even though it would take three to five years to clean up Westinghouse Credit's real estate and leveraged buyout portfolio, the company had already absorbed the cost.
And he noted that dividends were paid out of cash flow, not reported earnings, so that payments were likely to continue, though he warned that the payout might be trimmed to $1 a share.
As a result, he considers the stock a good buy at the current level. "By the end of the fourth quarter, the stock price is going to start reflecting next year's expected earnings," he said.
Mr. Fuller said he estimated that Westinghouse would have operating earnings of $2.25 a share in 1992, compared with his estimate of $1.75 a share this year. In 1993, he sees $2.75 a share.
Based on these estimates, he expects the stock to rise to $27 in a year and as much as $33 by late 1993.
"Westinghouse is one of the beaten-up stocks" he said. "It is in a testing phase now" and should begin to rise by the end of the year.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off in Light Trading As U.S. Banks Take Holiday

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled lower in light trading on world currency markets yesterday.
Gold prices rose across the board. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $355.30 an ounce, up $1.10 from Friday. The Republic National Bank said gold rose $1.30 an ounce, to a late bid price of $355.10. 
 American banks were closed for the Veterans Day holiday, though many kept their currency-trading operations open. Still, the trading session was shortened and activity was extremely light, traders said.
The dollar opened higher in Europe, but traders tested the downside in the absence of any market-moving news and succeeded in pushing the American currency lower. Analysts said the dollar ran into strong support at 1.6440 German marks.
"That is a very important number," said Richard Levine, a foreign-exchange broker at Merrill Lynch & Company. "It is in between the dollar's high and low for the year, and it's going to be very hard to get momentum going one way or another" without some fundamental development.
He said interest-rate moves in either Europe or Japan would still influence dollar trading, but there was only speculation that any changes were on the horizon.
"The market is actually starving for some new information fundamentally," Mr. Levine said.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.18 yen to close at 130.05 yen. Later in London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 130.20 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 130.05 yen, down from 130.43 yen on Friday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.7695, from $1.7680 late Friday. In New York, it cost $1.7705 to buy a pound, compared with $1.7630 on Friday.
Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $354.50 an ounce, up 35 cents from late Friday. In Zurich, the metal rose $1.15, to a closing bid of $354.80. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.41, to close at $355.35.

HEADLINE: O.E.C.D. Lowers Outlook On Growth in U.S. for 1992

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 11

 BODY:
Because of longer-than-anticipated economic weakness in the United States, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has significantly reduced its forecast for American growth for next year but does not foresee the economy slipping into a recession.
The revised forecast places growth in the United States in 1992 at about 2.5 percent, down from the 3.1 percent predicted six weeks ago. 
 In addition, senior officials at the Paris-based organization said that for the second half of 1991, American economic growth would be about 1.4 percent, about half the 2.7 percent rate that it predicted in early October.
"We're not looking for a double dip, but the economic weakness may continue into early next year," said an O.E.C.D. official who would speak only on the condition of anonymity.
At a news briefing, a senior official said that for 1991, American economic output would decline by between two-tenths and five-tenths of 1 percent.
The O.E.C.D., which is often called the club of rich nations, has 24 members, including the United States, Japan, and the nations of Western Europe. The group fosters economic cooperation and is respected for its forecasting ability.
In early October, the organization's staff prepared a fall forecast for the industrial nations, but officials said the only country that had required a significant downward revision was the United States, because of its stubborn economic sluggishness.
The organization's top economists are to present their projections on Tuesday at a meeting of the organization's main economic policy committee. That committee is headed by Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers.
The O.E.C.D.'s revised forecast for 1992 compares with a forecast of 3 percent by the International Monetary Fund in October. The Federal Reserve has projected growth in the gross national product for 1992 at between 2.25 and 3 percent; the Bush Administration has been more optimistic with a prediction of 3.6 percent growth, though it may yet revise its figure.
 
'Weak, Slow, Feeble'
 "We have said the rebound will be weak, slow, feeble," said a senior O.E.C.D. official. He said the Federal Reserve Board's recent interest-rate cuts had not done enough to spark cuts in other rates that are pivotal for investment, like bank lending rates and long-term interest rates.
"The rebound we were expecting at a certain date hasn't happened," he said. "We think it will be delayed several months. There is uncertainty right now for business investors. There are credit worries, and the budget deficit worries a lot of people."
He added, "There isn't a contraction; there is just an absence of expansion."
Despite the recent economic weakness, the O.E.C.D. is holding to the forecast it made last July for 3.3 economic growth in the United States in 1993.
The organization's forecast for inflation in the United States has improved since July. It projected that American inflation would be 3.9 percent this year, 3.4 percent in 1992 and 3.1 percent in 1993, falling to 2.9 percent in the second half of 1993. Last July, it forecast that inflation would be 4 percent this year and 3.6 percent next year.
 
Soft Landing for Japan
 The organization also revised downward its projection for Japanese economic growth next year. In July it forecast that Japan's economy would grow by 3.5 percent next year, but its newest report predicted growth of 2.5 percent next year, partly because of the pressure on the financial sector.
Japan is going to have a soft landing, one official said.
But for this year, the organization predicted growth for Japan at a robust 4.6 percent, while in July it predicted 3.5 percent growth. It said Japanese growth would be 3.6 percent in 1993.
For Germany, the O.E.C.D. predicted growth of 3.5 percent this year and 2.1 percent next year, as Germany's high interest rates slow the economy. For 1993, the organization projected growth of 2.5 percent.

HEADLINE: Dow Dips 3.36, to 3,042.26, in Thin Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Most stocks traded higher yesterday on light volume, while the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 3.36 points, to 3,042.26, pulled down by General Motors. The Nasdaq index, meanwhile, reached its third high in as many days.
Without the influence of the Treasury bond market and banks, both closed for Veterans Day, stocks traded in a narrow 10-point range most of the session. 
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 129.1 million, down from 183.3 million on Friday, as the composite scratched out a 0.25-point gain, to 217.07. Gaining issues narrowly outpaced losing stocks by 838 to 748.

HEADLINE: Power of the Mortgage Twins

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 11

 BODY:
In a spacious office just north of Georgetown, James A. Johnson has the latest technology: a video monitor that flashes both the news and prices from Wall Street and displays a small window with a television screen showing live debates from Congress.
It is a neat symbol for Mr. Johnson, whose job as chairman and chief executive of the Federal National Mortgage Association bridges political and financial circles. Fannie Mae, as it is informally known, and its smaller brother, Freddie Mac, a second Government-created mortgage financing company, have scored their greatest successes this year in both worlds. 
 As the main sources of credit for American home buyers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which is also known as the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, finance about one home in four. So far, they have enjoyed their most profitable year on record. Propelling their earnings, which are expected to approach a total of $2 billion, are low interest rates, which have encouraged a wave of mortgage refinancings, and the decline of savings and loan associations, their main competition.
 
Mission of the Companies
 The two companies were created by the Government to make the purchase of homes more affordable. These publicly traded corporations accomplish their mission by raising money relatively cheaply in debt markets, using the cash to buy mortgages from banks and savings and loans, and then either holding the mortgages or repackaging them into securities that are sold to investors.
The process provides banks and savings and loans with fresh cash to issue more mortgages. In the last few years, favorable interest rates have also enabled Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to post larger profits by taking advantage of the difference between the price at which they borrow money and the price at which they issue their mortgage-backed securities.
But critics in the Bush Administration and on Capitol Hill assert that over the long term, the two companies have become so unrestrained that they could pose enormous liabilities to taxpayers, because no one thinks the Government would stay on the sidelines should they ever encounter difficulties.
Senior executives at the two companies say that the criticism is misplaced and that they are in a sense becoming victims of their success.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have grown more than two and a half times in the last five years, issuing more than $1 trillion in obligations. The Government provides the companies with a wide array of tax benefits, regulatory breaks and securities law exemptions not shared by any of their competitors in the banking and savings and loan industries.
The two companies are the nation's largest issuers of corporate debt, and since the markets generally view their securities as Government-backed, they are able to raise money more cheaply than any other business. They also enjoy multibillion-dollar credit lines with the Treasury.
So far, their defense has staved off the critics from making any legislative or regulatory inroads that threaten their autonomy. The companies have resoundingly rebuffed calls for a drastic overhaul that would put them under tighter Government control. And despite suggestions of phony bids by customers who buy their debt, they have managed to keep the lid on the details.
In a reflection of their persuasive political power, the companies wrote much of a bill, adopted overwhelmingly by the House in September, that would give them more autonomy in some areas than they had before and impose less onerous capital requirements than some lawmakers wanted. They also have put the brakes on an effort to get the Securities and Exchange Commission more actively involved in regulating them.
 
Generous Contributions
 Some critics say their successes are not solely the product of their policy choices and business acumen, and point to the roster of prominent former Government members on their employee and lobbying payrolls, including former White House officials and Cabinet members from both parties -- and to generous campaign contributions.
These critics maintain that the companies continue to pose significant potential risk to taxpayers, particularly if interest rates rise drastically, and that they have railroaded Congress into adopting rather lenient legislation.
Alfred A. DelliBovi, Deputy Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, said Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac "have the broadest constituency in the United States after the President," since they serve so many homeowners and also have the support of mortgage bankers, real estate development groups and customers on Wall Street who make tens of millions of dollars selling their debt.
Executives at the two companies attribute their political gains to their track record of providing enormous amounts of cash to the housing market, and in so doing keeping housing costs lower while simultaneously providing returns on equity averaging about 25 percent for the last few years.
 
'A Great Success Story'
 "This has been the greatest year and most eventful year ever for Freddie Mac," notes Leland C. Brendsel, chairman and chief executive of the company.
Mr. Johnson's view is similar. "It's a great success story," he said. "One of the points I generally make to people in the Administration and people on Capitol Hill is that in the context of there being so few clear public-policy successes, you should rejoice in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac rather than fight them. This is a very unique idea that Congress and the Presidency put in place that works beautifully."
Their critics include a number of lawmakers, members of the Bush Administration and competitors who assert that the companies' political victories have been the result of forging alliances with powerful interest groups, paying off some critics to gain their support, playing the different regulatory agencies off of each other, and wielding influence through an unusually heavy reliance on a cadre of executives and lobbyists who had previously served as officials in the Government and in Congress.
The critics also assert that shareholders instead of homeowners receive too much of the billions of dollars that the companies receive in Government subsidies through tax breaks and perceived Government guarantees, estimated by some to be $2 billion to $4 billion annually.
 
'Laughed Out of Town'
 "To me, the rules totally change when you get a subsidy," said Mr. DelliBovi, who as H.U.D.'s Deputy Secretary is the Administration's second senior housing official after his boss, Jack Kemp. "If Lee Iacocca came to town and said give us this kind of subsidy for these kinds of returns, he'd be laughed out of town."
"They want to make us a regulator in name only," he added.
Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa and a respected member of the House Banking Committee, was the lone dissenting vote in his committee on the legislation about the companies, because he believed that it does not set adequate capital standards to insure that there would not be a taxpayer bailout if the economy ever turns against them.
And Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, Democrat of Massachusetts, asserted that executive compensation at the two companies was excessive, pointing to this year's $27.5 million retirement compensation package for Fannie Mae's former chairman, David O. Maxwell, as well as the $1 million-plus salaries of six officials. Three of the 10 highest-paid executives in Washington work at Fannie Mae.
 
Exception to the Critics
 Mr. Johnson and Mr. Brendsel take strong exception to the critics, pointing to studies they have commissioned that conclude that most of the benefits flow not to their shareholders but to homeowners. Mr. Johnson said salaries and bonuses at the company were "at about the median for large financial institutions."
The legislation adopted in late September by the House imposes three sets of capital levels to be monitored by H.U.D.. Perhaps the most important capital level requires the two companies to hold capital of 0.45 percent to 2.5 percent of their assets. Banks and savings associations, in contrast, will be required to have a minimum capital to asset ratio of 4 percent, adjusted for risk, beginning next year.
Administration officials had originally proposed more strict capital measures, but senior Treasury officials decided on lower limits in the face of a lobbying blitzkrieg.
The companies have put an impressive bipartisan list of former Government officials on their lobbying and employee payrolls, including Joseph A. Califano Jr., the Health, Education and Welfare Secretary in the Carter Administration; Kenneth M. Duberstein, President Ronald Reagan's last chief of staff; Harry C. McPherson, a White House adviser in the Johnson Administration, and Leonard Garment and Henry C. Cashen 2d, two former senior advisers to President Richard M. Nixon who are partners at the Washington law firm of Dickstein, Shapiro & Morin.
Mr. Johnson himself has strong bipartisan connections, having served as chairman in Walter F. Mondale's Presidential campaign in 1984 and as managing director with Richard G. Darman, President Bush's budget director, in the Washington office of Shearson Lehman Brothers.
Freddie Mac recently added to its well-connected roster Mitchell Delk, the former chief lobbyist for the S.E.C., and Fannie Mae recently hired John Buckley, the former director of communcations at the National Republican Congressional Committee and deputy press secretary to the Reagan-Bush campaign in 1984.
 
Political Action Committee
 The two companies' legislative agenda has been assisted by generous campaign contributions. Fannie Mae is the only known federally created organization to have a political action committee, which in recent years has contributed more than $110,000 to lawmakers. Tens of thousands of dollars have also been contributed by its senior executives.
In the thick of the Congressional debate over the legislation this summer, Fannie Mae went on a grant binge, donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to almost a dozen low-income housing, community and consumer groups that had initially expressed strong support for tougher legislation, but ultimately backed down. Both the groups and Fannie Mae assert that the grants did not affect the outcome of the legislation, but Mr. Leach believes otherwise.
"The timing of the grants is self-evident," he said. "This is the most important legislation since the inception of Fannie and Freddie and they pulled out all the stops to make sure potential critics were silenced."

HEADLINE: Southland Posts Slight Profit

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: DALLAS, Nov. 11

 BODY:
The Southland Corporation today reported lower-than-expected third-quarter earnings of $5.8 million, as the economic downturn and cool weather took a toll on its 7-Eleven convenience stores.
Southland said the performance weakened its ability to meet some terms of its agreements with major bank lenders, which were made as part of a Chapter 11 reorganization. 
 The company said it hoped to renegotiate some of the lending terms. Under Southland's accord with its banks, the company had been expected to post higher year-to-date earnings before taxes and other items.
Southland finished the bankruptcy process in March and is now largely owned by the Ito-Yokado Company of Japan and the Seven-Eleven Japan Company.
The company's earnings for the three months ended Sept. 30 came to 1 cent a share. During the corresponding period last year, Southland lost $122.8 million. Revenue was $2.15 billion, down 4.9 percent from $2.26 billion a year ago, when the company operated 180 more stores.
Southland's chief executive, Clark Matthews, said the company did not expect an improvement the rest of this year or in 1992 because of greater competition and weakness in the United States economy.
The company owns or franchises more than 6,000 7-Eleven stores in the United States and Canada. Seven-Eleven Japan operates about 4,300 7-Eleven stores in Japan under an agreement with Southland. Licensees operate 2,300 more 7-Eleven stores in 19 other countries.

HEADLINE: Doctors View Health Plans As Eroding Their Autonomy

BYLINE: By LISA BELKIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DOBBS FERRY, N.Y., Nov. 11

 BODY:
In Dr. Stephen P. Kelly's red-brick office building here, medicine's past shares space with medicine's future. This is a doctor who still makes house calls. Yet as he leaves to visit ailing patients, he passes a computer that contains the billing requirements of 16 health-care networks, each of which has different rules about how much he can charge and what procedures he can perform.
Dr. Kelly cannot continue in this medical time warp much longer. He feels an obligation to join the networks, he says, because his patients' employers have joined them, and this is the only way he can keep his patients. But the networks pay less than his customary fees, which means that he has to see more patients, going farther afield in Westchester County, to maintain his income. That leaves him less time for the patients he was trying to serve in the first place. 
 "Something has to give," he says.
He is making fewer house calls.
 
Networks Gather Patients
 The choice Dr. Kelly faces -- autonomy vs. income -- is being faced by doctors throughout the region as the "managed care" medical system strengthens its foothold here. Many patients are attracted to the reduced costs and the lack of paperwork offered by the networks. Employers admire the networks' ability to limit health-care costs. But doctors have their own point of view.
Like so many other changes in health care in the last decade, this one reminds doctors of something many prefer to forget: Medicine is no longer the sacrosanct profession romanticized by Dr. Marcus Welby; it is a business, and a difficult one at that.
"One of the reasons I went into medicine in the first place was I didn't want to work for anyone else," said Dr. Richard Fass, an oncologist in Yonkers who recently resigned from a network a week after joining because the network told him where to send blood samples for analysis, something he has been doing in his own office for several years.
"They're going to win eventually," he said, conceding that he will probably join other networks soon, "but at least I'm putting up a fight."
Under "managed care," an employer pays a fee to a health-care network that may describe itself as a "health maintenance organization" or "preferred provider organization" or may use an individual name, such as Pru-Care, Physicians Health Service, Oxford or Healthnet.
When a company joins a network, employees are given a list of the doctors who have agreed to be part of it. The doctors must agree to accept the fees set by the network and to clear all major procedures with the network before performing them. Some networks pay doctors a flat yearly fee for each patient, but most pay them for each visit and procedure.
If an employee visits a participating doctor, the patient pays a small "co-payment," usually about $10, and the rest is covered by the network at the rate it has set with the doctors. If an employee visits a non-participating doctor, some networks will reimburse the patient for a percentage of the outside doctor's fee, usually 80 percent. A few will pay nothing.
With health-care costs rising and the economy slowing, more employers are joining networks, which means that more patients are in such plans, so more doctors have to join as well.
Most doctors do not join happily, and their major objection is financial; the plans pay less for each visit than the doctors would otherwise charge.
 
Lower Fees Charged>
 "Your charge per visit becomes a fiction," said Dr. Steven Golub, an internist in East Meadows, L.I. "The company decides what you charge."
Dr. Tracey Jayne Fein, an obstetrician in White Plains, refused to join one network because it would reimburse her $12 a visit, compared to her standard rate of $100. Her fee for delivering a baby, including nine months of prenatal care, is $4,500. The one network of which she is a member pays $3,000.
Dr. Kelly, in Dobbs Ferry, charges $40 for an average office visit, and most of the 16 plans to which he belongs pay about $25, though a few pay as much as $45. "I'm seeing more patients and recouping less from each patient," he said.
Dr. Fass, the Yonkers oncologist, said he quit one network a week after joining it because he was told that patients would not be reimbursed unless all blood analysis was done at one Westchester center. For several years, Dr. Fass has been doing much of his blood analysis himself to increase his earnings.
Doctors also object to the plans on the basis of sentiment. "It's a terrible way to choose a doctor, just a name on a list," Dr. Kelly said.
Doctors and patients traditionally found each other through recommendations from friends or referrals from other doctors. Under the network system, physicians complain, doctors are treating patients who know nothing about them.
"If someone I've worked closely with sends me someone who he feels I would be good for, that's one kind of relationship," said Dr. Bruce Yaffe, a Manhattan gastroenterologist and internist. "But when a guy I never heard of looks down the list and chooses me because of where my office is and he can pronounce my name, well, that's a different level of communication."
Doctors say they are equally uncomfortable referring patients to other network physicians whom they have never met. The referral system is a tradition, part collegial camaraderie and part financial quid pro quo. The networks allow referrals only to other member doctors, if they have no personal and professional relationship with the primary physician.
The practice makes Dr. Richard Mones, a Manhattan pediatrician who belongs to six health networks, uneasy. "I have to tell my patients outright, 'I don't know who this person is, and that's the way we have to do it in 1991,' " he said. "It makes everyone very uncomfortable."
While all the doctors interviewed stressed that they treat all patients alike, regardless of the insurance, many said they knew of others who were not as thorough or as kind with the patients who belonged to network plans.
"If you come in and my schedule's a little tight, my initial reaction is to treat you over the phone," said a doctor who declined to be named of the attitude he sees in some colleagues toward patients in network plans, particularly the "per capita" plans that pay a flat yearly fee for each patient.
"If you do come in, I'm not going to do anything that's going to wow you so you come back all the time. There's no added incentive for docs to be on their best behavior. They may not meet somebody in an emergency room at 6 o'clock on Sunday night, they may just send them to the emergency room."
Why, then, do doctors join the plans?
 
Patients Are the Key
 Some do so to retain patients. "I saw patients who I really liked as people and as patients leaving me because their employers had decided on a different health plan," said Dr. Kelly, who joined his first plan about five years ago when the Ardsley and Dobbs Ferry school districts, where many of his patients worked, adopted a network plan.
Others join to find more patients. "The economic fact of pediatric practice is volume," Dr. Mones said. "You have to see a lot of patients to make a nice living."
A few join to get their first patients. "It's a good way to start a new practice," said Dr. Maryellen Romano of Staten Island, who was the sole gynecologist on the Pru-Care doctor list when she opened her practice two and a half years ago. She normally charges $100 for an initial visit, but Pru-Care pays only $78.
There are doctors who refuse to participate in the plans. "I can still make a healthy living without them, thank God," said one surgeon in Weston, Conn., who declined to allow his name to be used.
Others limit the number of plans they join. Dr. Fein, for instance, belongs to only one.
And a growing number are making their peace with the new reality. "Complaining doesn't change anything," Dr. Kelly said. "Whatever private practice used to be, now it means I'm basically running a small business. I could walk out of here and run a small clothing company. It's all the same."

HEADLINE: BAKER ASKS JAPAN TO BROADEN ROLE

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 11

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d called on Japan today to assume a more active role in protecting democracy and advocating free trade, instead of relying on "checkbook diplomacy" to protect its narrow interests or waiting for foreign pressure to force it into action.
"We recognize that Japan's leaders, and its people, are now grappling with a difficult adjustment in Japan's world role," Mr. Baker said in an address to the Japan Institute for International Affairs. 
 "You are beginning to fully appreciate your national capabilities -- and your responsibilities -- around the globe. Your 'checkbook diplomacy,' like our 'dollar diplomacy' of an earlier era, is clearly too narrow."
 
A U.S. Blueprint
 The remarks by Mr. Baker, who met today with Japan's new Prime Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, and its Foreign Minister, Michio Watanabe, did not mark any sharp departure from United States policy. But they pointed the way to future Japanese-American relations as envisioned by Washington in the post-cold-war era.
Specifically, Mr. Baker is seeking a greater Japanese role in promoting a compromise in global free-trade talks; in United Nations peacekeeping efforts, and in a campaign to dissuade North Korea from developing nuclear weapons.
An example of the stance urged by Washington is Tokyo's participation in an international conference on Middle East issues that is expected to convene in the next three weeks as part of the peace process begun in Madrid last month.
Mr. Baker's comments here were seen in particular as public support of pending Japanese legislation that would permit the Government to send troops on limited United Nations peacekeeping missions, their first duty abroad since World War II.
The bill moved toward approval today when the leaders of the small Komeito party said they would back it, assuring enough votes for passage.
A debate over the bill began in Parliament this week, with Prime Minister Miyazawa assuring opposition lawmakers that participation in such peacekeeping efforts would not violate the Japanese constitutional ban on the use of military force.
Mr. Baker seemed to voice American frustration, particularly in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf war, that Japan had not assumed a fair share of the global burden of defending democracies or sufficiently supported free trade, even though it is a prime beneficiary of both. Although Japan contributed roughly $13 billion to the gulf war effort, it did so reluctantly, and Americans gave it scant credit.
 
Postwar Minesweepers
 Mr. Baker said the gulf war might turn out to be a "watershed event" in a transformation of Japanese policy.
"We recognize the difficulty of achieving a consensus on a security challenge in what might have appeared to be a far-off land," he said. "We appreciate Japan's generous financial contribution to the allied effort. And we know the significance of Japan's minesweepers plying the troubled waters of the Persian Gulf." He referred to the decision to send minesweepers to the gulf after the war was over.
In his meetings today with Mr. Miyazawa and Mr. Watanabe, Secretary Baker reassured the two leaders that President Bush's sudden cancellation of a visit to Tokyo intended no slight to Japan and that he wanted to reschedule the trip very soon.
Some American officials have suggested that the President regrets having canceled the trip, apparently in response to domestic criticism that he was spending too much time abroad. They hint that the President could reschedule it as early as next month.
Mr. Baker, in his speech today, his first major policy address on Asian affairs, also called on North Korea to match the offer of the South to forgo development or possession of any material used in building a nuclear bomb.
The Secretary of State, who will begin a three-day visit to South Korea on Tuesday, is trying to step up pressure on the North to open its installations to international nuclear inspection and dismantle a complex north of Pyongyang, the capital, that is suspected of being the center of a nuclear-bomb-making project.
This comes as Japan and other Asian countries are expressing fear that the United States may be missing important warning signals about the North Korean nuclear project, much as it missed some in Iraq. American officials concede that they know even less about North Korea's abilities than they did about Iraq's. And because they don't want to be accused again of overlooking a major threat, they have begun to sound the alarm.
"We learned from the case of Iraq," Mr. Baker said, that even International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards "cannot insure that a renegade regime will not seek to acquire nuclear weapons."
"The only firm assurance against a nuclear arms race on the Korean peninsula," he said, "would be a credible agreement by both Seoul and Pyongyang to abstain from the production or acquisition of any weapons-grade nuclear material."
North Korea on Sunday rejected Seoul's initiative. American officials say their first response will be to try to enlist China, Japan and the Soviet Union in diplomatic efforts to induce the North to comply.
Mr. Baker urged the Japanese to exercise greater leadership not just in economics but also in building democracy, promoting respect for human rights, stopping the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and facing up to challenges of the environment, narcotics and refugees.
"Japan should step forward as a leader in confronting global issues rather than relying on 'gaiatsu' -- foreign pressure -- to justify decisions on economics or security affairs that are in its own interests," Mr. Baker said.
 
Contentious Rice-Import Issue
 In particular, he said, Tokyo should take a much more active role in helping to forge a compromise in the Uruguay Round of trade talks that are aimed at removing or lowering tariff barriers to trade and investment.
Mr. Baker reiterated that Japan begin by lifting its longtime ban on rice imports, a concession by the governing Liberal Democratic Party to politically powerful rice farmers. The Japanese told Mr. Baker that they were ready to consider this longtime American request but made no firm commitments.
"As one of the primary beneficiaries of the open world trading system," the Secretary of State said, "Japan should lead, not follow, in the effort to preserve and strengthen that system."
Although Prime Minister Miyazawa speaks English fluently and has known Mr. Baker for many years, he chose to speak to him in Japanese through an interpreter.
Mr. Miyazawa, who has been Prime Minister less than a week, has been criticized in the press for showing off his English, and has stirred concern that he might somehow give something away in English that he would not in Japanese.
When Mr. Miyazawa informed Mr. Baker today that he would speak through an interpreter, Japanese officials said, the Secretary laughed loudly, apparently appreciating the political humor in the situation.
In a rather unusual move, Mr. Baker, while praising Japan for upgrading its military, said there must be a "balanced two-way flow of defense-related technology -- an increasingly critical resource in the security system."
American officials said the Japanese should help contribute to the defense of democratic countries by sharing more advanced defense technology, particularly that used in fighter aircraft.

HEADLINE: LEADERS IN ALBANY DRAFTING NEW PLAN ON BUDGET DEFICITS

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 11

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and New York State's legislative leaders are considering an unusual multiyear fiscal plan that could remove the state's budget woes from the political spotlight until after the 1992 election.
In talks that began over the weekend in Albany, budget negotiators have been discussing a plan that would simultaneously attack this year's budget gap of $689 million and the gap of more than $2 billion projected in the next fiscal year's budget. They would then draft a grand budget solution that would stretch into 1993, thus spreading the pain, proponents argue, over a longer period. 
 The proponents of the plan argue that it clearly would benefit Mr. Cuomo, who has said the budget problems afflicting the state and New York City pose the primary obstacle to his running for President.
 
An Election Year
 But in an election year in which incumbency could prove a liability, the plan also could prove helpful to members of the Legislature, which has irritated many voters in recent years by repeatedly failing to pass budgets that were balanced and on time. Assembly Speaker Mel Miller, the primary proponent of the plan, suggested today that both the Democrats who control the Assembly and the Republicans who control the State Senate would benefit politically if the public perceives they are making a serious attempt to restructure the state budget.
As outlined by top legislators, legislative aides and Cuomo administration officials, the plan would require selected cuts in state programs and a freeze in spending for most state agencies at this year's levels.
If that freeze persists for at least 15 months, some state officials believe they could eliminate not only the $689 million gap in this year's $30 billion budget but also a gap in next year's budget that is projected to exceed $2 billion and could be far larger.
 
'Helps All of Us'
 "I think," said Mr. Miller, a Brooklyn Democrat, "it helps the Governor. I think it helps all of us. This lets you do your cutting more fairly. And it gets people out of Albany quickly and helps solve the problem."
The state officials made clear that the concept was embraced far more enthusiastically by the Assembly and by the Democratic Governor than by the Senate Republicans. Senate leaders have said they prefer to close the state's budget gap with stiff cuts in social services.
But aides to Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Miller said the Democrats were encouraged that the Senate negotiators had not knocked the plan off the bargaining table.
As outlined by officials familiar with this weekend's discussions, the multiyear budget would control state spending either through the end of the next fiscal year on March 31, 1993, or through June 30, 1993, if the fiscal year was changed.
Because of the plan's technical and political complexity, state officials said their ability to structure such a solution was far from certain. In previous years, the Legislature and the Governor have spent months trying to break their annual budget impasse.
Last summer, for instance, the Legislature did not pass a budget until a record 65 days after the start of the fiscal year. It could be particularly difficult for the Legislature to deal with this year's budget gap in a special session in the next two months because Mr. Miller will be on trial in Brooklyn on Federal fraud charges. The trial starts on Tuesday.
 
'A Useful Approach'
 The Governor's press secretary, Anne W. Crowley, confirmed that Mr. Cuomo was interested in the concept of a multiyear budget but said the political and financial feasibility of such a plan remained uncertain.
"It would be a useful approach if we could find a way to do that," she said. "We don't know yet whether we'll be able to, but that's what we're discussing."
Ms. Crowley said that if the negotiations over the multiyear plan broke down, Mr. Cuomo would present a budget-cutting plan to close this year's budget gap and would call the Legislature to Albany for a special session.
 
Preparing Own Plan
 A spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, Republican of Oyster Bay, L.I., played down the idea that the Republicans were actively negotiating a plan. "I wouldn't call them earnest discussions," said the spokesman, John E. McArdle. "Have they met a couple of times? Yeah. But that is not the direction we prefer to proceed with."
Mr. McArdle said that the Senate Republicans were preparing their own plan for dealing with this year's budget gap and that it would rely heavily on deep cuts in Medicaid and other social services. He also complained that a multiyear plan would require the state to borrow money.
Mr. Cuomo has identified unexpected growth in Medicaid expenditures and unexpected weakness in revenue collections -- both of which he attributed to the recession -- as the main causes of the budget gap. The Governor and both legislative leaders have said they do not want to close the budget gap by raising taxes in a recession.
 
Political Difficulties
 That the multiyear plan remains on the negotiating table reflects both the severity of the state's budget problems and the political difficulties they pose for Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature.
Mr. Cuomo, in his public comments, has said it would be extremely difficult to run for President while the state and New York City are suffering severe budget problems. Having established that connection, the Governor needs to be able to convince New Yorkers that he has not abandoned the state and city in times of crisis if he chooses to run.
The passage, or even the announcement of an agreement in principle, of a multiyear budget plan might allow Mr. Cuomo to make the case that the state's finances are sound. That would give him more freedom to devote the winter and the spring to the Presidential primaries and not to budget talks with the Legislature.
 
Anti-Incumbent Sentiment
 The Legislature faces its own elections next November, and legislative leaders took full note of the anti-incumbent sentiment registered by voters across the state and the nation in last Tuesday's elections. In local elections from Long Island to Rochester, voters eagerly tossed out incumbents from both parties.
Both Mr. Miller and Mr. Marino have said they want to pass a budget quickly next year so their members can go home to campaign. And in light of last week's election results, both want to give New York voters the sense that the Legislature has taken a bold step to cure the state's recurring fiscal problems.

HEADLINE: Duke Campaigns on Distorted Facts Despite Rebuttals and Clarifications

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Nov. 11

 BODY:
Whether he is rallying his supporters or defending himself on a talk show, State Representative David Duke often twists the statements of others and distorts facts to make his point.
The subjects of his false claims include his record of fighting in Southeast Asia, his criminal record, his positions on the environment, the structure of welfare payments, the potential effect of his election on tourism in Louisiana, and the record of his Democratic opponent, former Gov. Edwin W. Edwards. 
 Also, while continuing to say that his Christian beliefs have led him from the intolerant views he expressed as a leader of the Ku Klux Klan, Mr. Duke has admitted that he underwent this religious conversion as a teen-ager and that as an adult he has not belonged to a church.
Most politicians, Mr. Edwards included, repeat the same stock phrases and examples in their campaign statements and sometimes stretch the truth. But, in his campaign to become governor of Louisiana, Mr. Duke has repeated a variety of blatant misrepresentations even after his opponent,news organizations and the subjects of his statements have publicly tried to clarify the record.
 
Talking Affirmative Action
 An essential element of Mr. Duke's political philosophy is his assertion that affirmative action programs discriminate against white people.
A favorite example of his involves postal jobs. Last week on the CNN television interview program "Larry King Live," Mr. Duke said: "I mean when you take a test for the Post Office in this country right now and you're white, you're very likely to have your test score dropped 15 or 20 points and if you are a minority you are liable to have it raised 15 or 20 points, and I think when you take a test for a job or a promotion or a scholarship you should get what you score on that test. I think that is basic human rights."
Asked whether this assertion was correct, Sandra Stewart, a spokeswoman for the United States Postal Service in Washington, said "absolutely not." No test scores are altered on the basis of race, she said. Veterans receive an extra 5 points on their scores and disabled veterans are given 10 points.
Mr. Duke, who is running as a Republican, continually misrepresents facts about his personal history. For example, in asserting that he would bring a new era free of corruption to the state if elected on Saturday, he says, "I have never broken any laws."
But court records analyzed by the Louisiana Coalition Against Racism and Nazism show that Mr. Duke was arrested and convicted in 1976 for incitement to riot when he led a group of his followers in an assault on a plainclothes police officer who was observing a meeting of neo-Nazi and Klan groups that Mr. Duke had organized.
In 1972 he was arrested twice, one time when the authorities said he was making firebombs and another time when the authorities said he fraudulently solicited money for George Wallace. Those charges were later dropped.
 
Activity in Laos
 Similarly, he often says at campaign rallies that "I fought Communism in Southeast Asia." His campaign biography says specifically that he worked for the State Department in Laos and that he was a volunteer for missions with Air America, the air transport company operated by the Central Intelligence Agency.
An investigation of these assertions in 1990 by The New Orleans Times-Picayune found that in 1971 while Mr. Duke visited his father, who was working for the Agency for International Development in Laos, he taught a State Department English class to Laotian military officers. But the director of the language schools said Mr. Duke was dismissed after six weeks because a drawing of a fire bomb was found on the blackboard in his classroom.
In addition, two Air America pilots in Loas at the time denied Mr. Duke's account of clandestine flights, and Selective Service records cited by the newspaper show that Mr. Duke obtained a student deferment as soon as he was classified 1-A, meaning he could be called immediately for military service.
 
Assertion on Welfare
 Mr. Duke has continued to make misrepresentations despite efforts by his opponents and news organizations point out the facts.
For example, the main theme of his campaign is a call to change "the liberal social welfare system which encourages the rising illegitimate welfare birthrate." He agitates his white audiences with statements like, "middle-class families have difficulty affording children of their own right now and yet we are financing a very high illegitimate welfare birthrate."
He has continued to state this even after Mr. Edwards and several Louisiana newspapers have noted that the average size of a welfare family in the state is three, typically a mother with two children, and that the increased payment for an additional child is $11 a week.
"That's hardly an incentive to have a baby," said Mr. Edwards.
While Mr. Duke asserts that a change in the welfare system would help cure the state's budget crisis, Mr. Edwards and newspaper reports have noted that welfare eligibility standards are set at the Federal level, that the Federal Government pays nearly 75 percent of the costs of Louisiana's welfare program and that state expenditures amount to about 2 percent of the state budget.
 
Meetings Do Move
 In what is developing as a major issue in the governor's race, executives in the tourism and convention industry have protested that Mr. Duke's election would cause the cancellation of meetings and sporting events, a portion of the economy that has accounted for a large part of Louisiana's meager economic growth in the past few years.
Mr. Duke has countered this by repeatedly saying that Arizona was threatened with similar losses when it chose not to make a holiday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday. "There was no net loss of convention business," Mr. Duke said.
Larry Hilliard, vice president of the Phoenix and Valley of the Sun Convention and Visitors Bureau, said in an interview that from the time that Gov. Evan Mecham rescinded the holiday in January 1987 to this week, "we've had 148 groups cancel meetings, representing 134,000 delegates with an economic impact in excess of $77 million."
In addition to these losses, the owners of National Football League franchises voted last March to remove the 1993 Super Bowl from Phoenix because of a state referendum Nov. 6, 1990, that upheld the decision not to have a King holiday. According to the N.F.L., a Super Bowl generates between $125 to $150 million for a local economy.
Mr. Duke has dealt with the Super Bowl issue, as he did at a news conference last Friday, by saying repeatedly: "Its been said we would loose the Super Bowl if I were elected, but the N.F.L. issued a formal statement that we don't enter politics. We don't care who the governor is. It has nothing to do with our site-selection process."
After Mr. Duke made a similar statement last Monday on "Larry King Live," Greg Aiello, director of communications for the National Football League, told reporters, "We have consistently said the same thing and we have certainly not said what Mr. Duke said that we said."
Mr. Aiello said that Mr. Duke was apparently referring to a response by Paul Tagliabue, commissioner of the National Football League, to reporters who asked about Mr. Duke. Mr. Tagliabue said: "We have not given it any thought. We are in the football business and we are following the Saints in Louisiana not the governor's race."
Mr. Aiello noted that the Phoenix case showed that the football owners, rather than the commissioner, choose Super Bowl sites and do take political issues into account.
Mr. Duke sometimes offers false information when he has other options. For example, Mr. Edwards's record on the environment in his three terms as Governor could easily be attacked for his weak enforcement of pollution laws, but Mr. Duke repeatedly says that "during that time we had the greatest toxic waste dumping of any state in the country."
In fact, Texas has three times as many sites on the Federal National Priorities List of toxic waste sites requiring cleanup. And by several other measures Texas ranked as the leader in dumping.
Mr. Duke then usually goes on, as he did at a rally Friday, to declare: "I'm not going back to that. I'm going to protect our precious environment."
His arguments did not move the New Orleans Sierra Club, which today joined other environmental groups that have already endorsed Mr. Edwards. The club issued a statement saying that contrary to his assertion, Mr. Duke had voted in the Legislature to cut financing for the state Department of Environmental Quality and once referred to the department as a "witch hunting gang of political flunkies."

HEADLINE: Pittsburgh Builds Airport of Future Now

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH

 BODY:
Through a haze of dust stirred up by earth movers, one of the most innovative major aiport terminals in the United States is nearing completion in a clearing twice the size of downtown Pittsburgh. Scheduled to open in October 1992, the collection of new buildings, their centerpiece an unusually designed X-shape, is being counted on to redefine the 39-year-old Greater Pittsburgh International Airport.
Planners hope the terminal, with its vaulted ceilings and driverless underground trains, will complete an image transformation begun decades ago. Once known as a gritty old steel town of blue-collar workers, Pittsburgh has become a commercial center of office towers and high-technology industries. 
 The new airport buildings, known informally as the midfield terminal because of their location between two runways, are also being seen as a way to lift the economy in a region of 2.2 million people.
"This is the single greatest economic generator this area has seen," said Scott Simmons, an economic development specialist for Duquesne Light Company, an area utility.
 
Gamble or Good Investment
 Nonetheless, with the American economy in a lingering slump, the building of an airport terminal in the shadow of an old one, refurbishing runways and putting in a 7.5-mile expressway to tie it all to the region's highways, amounts to a $1 billon gamble.
Supporters of the 900-acre project 16 miles west of Pittsburgh said they view the airport construction and related projects as a prudent investment.
Several other cities, including Denver, Newark and San Jose, Calif., have started or plan to begin airport projects. The plans are being made in spite of projections that the number of American air travelers, flat for the last three years, is not expected to increase soon.
Officials of USAir, the airline that is to use 53 of the new terminal's 76 gates as one of the focal points of its route network, say they do not see their heavy financial commitment as a gamble.
 
Airline at the Limits
 "We are concentrating on it being an opportunity," said David Shipley, a USAir spokesman at the airline's corporate headquarters in Arlington, Va. He agreed that there is a "risk factor" is being a major participant in such a monumental project, but he said the airline wanted to expand in Pittsburgh and was "maxed out in capacity" at the current terminal, in which USAir has 36 gates.
But the new terminal is seen as more than an economic gamble and a symbol of civic pride. It is also an attempt to advance airport efficiency. Unlike those at most airports in the United States, the terminal was designed specifically for jet travel and the rapid movement of passengers.
It is divided into three sections, separating the passengers according to their needs. In one section, called "landside," passengers will be able to buy tickets, check or claim baggage and rent cars. The second, "airside," section, is the X-shaped building, where passengers will be boarding or getting off planes. The third section includes, among other things, a 25-gate commuter terminal and the aiport's only security check-point. The buildings are connected by underground passenger and luggage shuttles.
The X-shaped concourse building is the centerpiece of the new design. Because the building's arms are studded with gates, airliners can reduce their taxiing to pick up or discharge passengers. Airport officials estimate that airlines will be able to save $12 million to $13 million a year in fuel costs.
In planning for more than 20 years and under construction since June 1987, the terminal may be one of the largest current construction sites in the United States.
For Pittsburgh, which long ago had to transform its economy from one almost literally built by steel to one balanced on high-technology industries, corporate offices and service industries, the airport project has come to mean as much to further development and diversification as it does to area aviation.
"This airport meant far more than transportation," said Steven George, director of Penn's Southwest Association, a not-for-profit organization that recruits businesses to the Pittsburgh region. "It means jobs, development, growth."
In a report earlier this year, the Greater Pittsburgh Office of Promotion for the Allegheny County Department of Aviation estimated that more than 81,000 jobs will be created over the next 20 years by the new airport complex.
Already, a number of motels and office buildings have sprung up near the new terminal.
"I think whole new cities will grow up around the airport," said Tom Foerster, chairman of the Allegheny County Board of Commissioners that governs the county in which the airport is situated. Mr. Foerster, who has served as a county commissioner for 24 years, has long supported expanding and improving the airport.
The county will own and operate the airport, but much of the cost of building the new terminal and operating it will be paid by increases in USAir's fees. A 30-year lease binds the airport's economic health to that of the airline.
Ultimately, some increases in fees will be passed on to travelers, said USAir officials.
Allegheny County contributed $42.5 million to the project. It also issued $608.7 million in county bonds, which will be repaid by USAir. The Federal Aviation Administration is contributing another $101 million and the state $85 million.
The $190 million access expressway being built to the airport is a separate project of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. In addition, Allegheny County has spent $150 million in the last five years to improve the airport's landing field.
The new terminal includes 3.3 million square feet, which will make it about four times bigger than the present terminal, about two miles away. Although the new terminal will have 76 jet gates initially, it can accommodate about 100 if necessary.
The existing terminal, built in 1952, has 54 gates, and has been expanded four times. "We were just unable to add onto it anymore," Patrick J. Boyle, deputy director of marketing and public affairs for the County of Allegheny Department of Aviation.
Joseph Schofer, a professor of civil engineering and transportation at Northwestern University's Transportation Center in Evanston, Ill., said making airports faster and more efficient makes sense, particularly in anticipation of an economic upturn. "Better than half of air travel in the U.S. is for business purposes," he noted.

HEADLINE: Veto of California Job-Bias Bill Unites Gay-Rights Forces Against Governor

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 11

 BODY:
For most of his adult life, Scott Greig has been building his career and, though homosexual, seldom paid much attention to the gay-rights movement. A Republican, he voted last year for Pete Wilson for Governor, seeing him as a moderate Republican who was sympathetic to gay people.
But these days Mr. Greig, a 30-year-old executive with a computer manufacturer here, regularly marches in demonstrations denouncing Mr. Wilson and has joined forces determined to hound the Governor at every turn and to drive him from office. 
 The main instrument of Mr. Greig's conversion was Governor Wilson's veto of a bill that would have protected homosexuals against job discrimination in California. Six weeks after Mr. Wilson vetoed the bill, which he said was too burdensome for small businesses, the gay-rights movement appears to have been galvanized in a way that has not happened in years, drawing a large number of professional and white-collar protesters like Mr. Greig into the fray. After nearly a decade of preoccupation with AIDS, the focus is shifting back to equal rights.
 
'They Become Equal'
 "For years, the civil rights issue had been overshadowed by AIDS," said Valsin A. Marmillion, a political consultant here who is a co-founder of a fast-growing new gay organization, League America, that is attracting large numbers of people who were uncomfortable with more radical groups like Queer Nation. "Now they become equal, or civil rights predominant."
The issue has compounded Governor Wilson's growing troubles. Having already alienated conservatives with recent tax increases, he has now also offended many liberals because of this veto and other recent actions. Political experts, Democratic and Republican alike, are beginning to doubt that Mr. Wilson, once spoken of in some circles as a Presidential contender in 1996, can win re-election as Governor.
Leaders of national gay rights groups say that the anger that began in California and has been widely reported in publications written for homosexuals has begun to spread across the country. Urvashi Vaid, executive director of the Washington-based National Gay and Lesbian Task Force,said the anger recalled that following the assassination in 1978 of Harvey Milk the gay San Francisco supervisor, by a jealous political rival. and a
And she compared the mood to that surrounding the 1969 confrontation with police officers outside The Stonewall Inn, a tavern in Greenwich Village, an event that spurred the current gay-rights movement. "People are calling it Stonewall II," she said.
Torie Osborn, executive director of the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center, said, "The last time I felt this kind of energy was in the 70's."
A demonstration is planned at a fund-raising dinner here on Friday for state Senator Ed Davis that Mr. Wilson plans to attend. And an effort begun by state employees to recall the Governor has been joined by gay groups.
It remains to be seen how long the protests will last, but for now Mr. Wilson has found himself involved in a confrontation almost everywhere he has ventured since the Sept. 29 veto. The night after, protesters did $250,000 of damage at a state office building in San Francisco. The next day, protesters rushed a stage at Stanford University where Mr. Wilson was speaking. That same day, also at Stanford, he found himself at a luncheon sitting near Tom Nolan, President of the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors, who is gay. "I told him he was wrong," Mr. Nolan said.
The gay protests have taken other forms as well. Michael Moore, a furniture designer and interior decorator in San Francisco demanded that his $2,000 campaign contribution be returned. Mr. Moore, who describes himself as an "old-school Republican," said he had heard Mr. Wilson promise to sign such a bill in a number of fund-raising events. When his request was rejected, he threatened to sue for "breach of promise," and received a check from the campaign committee.
"He will be hounded by gay people wherever he goes for the rest of his political life," said Thomas B. Stoddard, of the Lambda Legal Defense and Educational Fund, a gay legal advocacy group in New York.
The measure, designated as Assembly Bill 101 and sponsored by Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman, a Democrat from Los Angeles, would have prohibited job discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation under the state's Fair Employment and Housing Act. Governor Wilson had given strong indications that he would sign it. In his veto message, Mr. Wilson denounced "gay-bashing bigots" but said the bill was unnecessary because existing laws, policies and court opinions conferred many of the same protections.
Many experts said that an underlying reason for the veto was to protect the Governor's ally, Senator John Seymour, against a challenge next year from Representative William Dannemayer, a conservative Orange County Republican who is a dogged foe of gay rights. They said the veto also was intended to shore up Mr. Wilson's flagging support among Republicans.
The merits of the bill have been lost in the symbolism the veto has acquired for homosexuals. What has been particularly unusual about the protests is that they are coming mainly from the Los Angeles area, rather than from San Francisco, the traditional focus of gay politics on the West Coast.
 
Change in Los Angeles
 "What's amazing is to have it in Los Angeles," said Randy Shilts, national correspondent for The San Francisco Chronicle. "They'd usually rather have a cappuccino than go to a riot."
Over the last decade, the AIDS epidemic diverted most of the attention among gay groups away from politics, and the traditional leadership was depleted. In the last two or three years, a new, more radical movement has been building, embodied in such organizations as Queer Nation and Act Up, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power. But according to Mr. Shilts, these groups had limited appeal to the vast majority of gay men and women who were more interested in earning a living.
The Wilson veto, with its implications for job security in fragile economic times, observers say, served to politicize the non-political.
But some fear that the protests, and particularly television images of violent ones, will backfire, and they have already strained relations between gay leaders and Assemblyman Friedman. "The demonstrations have led to a backlash from the majority of Californians who previously supported the bill," said Mr. Friedman, the bill's sponsor. "Though I understand the frustration, it is most important to channel it in an effective way that can lead to a law."
As for Mr. Wilson, his chief spokesman, Bill Livingstone, said Mr. Wilson would veto a similar bill if passed by the legislature next year. He added that Mr. Wilson had backed gay causes while in the Senate but that the Governor had felt that there was no evidence that gay people suffer from "long-term pervasive discrimination" in the workplace.
For many, the issue is Mr. Wilson'sleadership and credibility. "He angered all the gays, and all the right wing by calling them bigots," said David Townsend, a Democratic political consultant in Sacramento. "He's really acting like a one-termer right now. He seems to be under siege."

Pete Wilson vetoed Assembly Bill 101, which prohibits job discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, there have been protests by gay-rights supporters wherever he goes.

B-o-o-m! It's Bush's Message and Sweet to Kurds

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ERBIL, Iraq

 BODY:
President Bush woke up this Kurdish capital at 4:30 A.M. one day recently with a sonic boom from a United States Air Force jet that shattered glass and startled the residents. But it was difficult to find a Kurd who was angry about it.
"In spite of all the broken windows, we would like them to come even more," said a 60-year-old Kurdish elder, who smiled and offered his hand and a blessing to a visiting reporter instead of giving his name. 
 "Hajji Bush," one of Kurdistan's terms of endearment for the American President, can be heard in the murmur of the city market crowd as a distant, dull roar heralds another flight of American warplanes.
"Here comes the taxi" is another common refrain as Kurds look skyward several times a day to follow the passage of the silver streaks of American air power.
 
Deterrent Against Army
 In the state of a precarious peace with Baghdad, Iraq's Kurdish minority is clinging to the visible deterrent these warplanes represent against any threat of repression from the still formidable remnants of President Saddam Hussein's army, part of which is encamped south of the city.
For the first time since Mr. Hussein and his Baath Party came to power in 1968, the Kurds have been living, for months now, without the omnipresence of Baghdad's security forces and secret police. Many say they have become used to it.
"We will never agree to the return of the regime of Saddam Hussein," said a young Kurdish guerrilla named Ali, his chest crossed with ammunition belts.
In Erbil recently, there was a wedding party on every vacant lot in some neighborhoods. Hundreds of Kurds locked arms in a circle of song and dance as the sun glinted off the bright sequined gowns of the women.
In the countryside, where the valleys are wearing the golden stubble of the harvested wheatfields and the sunflower crop is drooping from the first frost, the Kurds are busy rebuilding earthen-roofed homes before winter. About 135,000 still have refugee status, with many living in tents.
 
The Gunships Have Gone
 What is different this year, however, is the absence of the Iraqi helicopter gunships that since 1988 had prowled the slopes and valleys of the Iranian and Turkish border regions searching for infiltrations by Kurdish guerrillas, smugglers and refugees.
As a consequence, tens of thousands of Kurds are moving back to what remains of the villages destroyed by Mr. Hussein in his attempts in 1975 and 1988 to collectivize the Kurds in new towns on the arid and dusty flatlands of Kurdistan.
Though the exhaustion of war and insurrection continues to combine with the economic pressure of the international trade embargo, which is hurting every Iraqi household, a measure of joy is not hard to find among the Kurds today.
"The people are suffering in a very happy way because they haven't had this experience in 23 years," the Kurdish elder said. "They are experiencing freedom and the absence of the regime of Saddam Hussein."
How long this absence will continue is the unknown that provides much of the political anxiety that exists here.
The deterrent value of the "Hajji Bush" flights underscores the delicate balance that exists eight months after the allied coalition defeated the Iraqi Army in Kuwait, a defeat that touched off insurrection and a harsh crackdown by Mr. Hussein's army.
As they wait for the conclusion of negotiations with Baghdad over the future of Kurdish autonomy, talks carried out by Massoud Barzani, chief of the Kurdish Democratic Party, Iraq's 3.5 million Kurds have taken responsibility for their own survival. An army of "pesh mergas," the guerrilla fighters of Kurdistan who sign contracts to "walk before death" in the name of Kurdish self-rule, is now administering most major cities in the region.
Kurds now control their traditional lands throughout the mountainous border region, from the disputed city of Khanaqin less than 100 miles northeast of Baghdad in an arc that goes north along the Iranian border and westward along the Turkish border all the way to the disputed city of Sinjar near the Syrian frontier.
The Iraqi Army has generally fallen back to protect major Arab cities like Mosul and the oil center at Kirkuk, whose status is a major point of contention. Mr. Hussein has been preventing thousands of Kurds who fled Kirkuk during the March uprising from returning to their homes.
 
Army Abandons Positions
 Iraqi tank and infantry brigades could be observed recently abandoning their dug-in positions east of Erbil and on the northern and eastern approaches to Sulaimaniya, apparently in an effort to cede additional Kurdish territory to the administration of the pesh mergas.
Kurdish leaders say they are trying to work in close cooperation with the army to maintain the peace in Kurdistan and to prevent the kind of outbreak of fighting that began in October in the disputed towns of Kifri and Kalar and then spread to Sulaimaniya, where Kurdish forces captured and executed 60 Government soldiers.
Abdul Mohaiman Barzani, a Kurdish leader and a cousin of Massoud Barzani, says his most pressing problem now is the wheat crop, which must be planted before the snows come. There is a desperate shortage of spare parts for tractors and other machinery needed for planting.
"If we don't plant the wheat this month," he said, "this will not only be the biggest problem in Kurdistan, but in all of Iraq."

HEADLINE: Its Eye on Election, White House To Propose Health Care Changes

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 11

 BODY:
Bush Administration officials say Senator Harris Wofford's victory in Pennsylvania will force them to propose significant changes in the health care system sooner than they intended, but they insist that the election results last week cannot be read as an endorsement for any specific proposal, and many Democrats agree.
Thus, Mr. Wofford's success guarantees an impassioned debate on health policy by candidates for President and Congress in 1992, but it does not necessarily mean that successful candidates must follow him in advocating a comprehensive program of national health insurance with a major new role for the Federal Government. 
 Mr. Wofford, a Democrat, trounced former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh in the election last Tuesday after making a demand for national health insurance a centerpiece of his campaign.
The Administration has stepped up its deliberations on health care in an effort to respond to Democratic accusations that President Bush neglected the issue for three years.
 
Issue for '92 Election
 White House officials had expected that Mr. Bush would sidestep the issue next year, on the assumption that Congress would not take up comprehensive health care legislation until after the 1992 elections. But Administration officials now say that for political reasons they must have more to say about the issue before then.
While attending a NATO meeting in Rome on Friday, Mr. Bush said he would "like to have a comprehensive health care plan that I can vigorously take to the American people" before the 1992 election.
The problems are well known. The United States spends $2 billion a day on health care, far more for each person than any other country, yet 34 million Americans have no health insurance.
"More and more, health care is a voter issue, up there with crime and education," said Alixe R. Glen, spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services.
In January 1990, Mr. Bush said in his State of the Union Message that Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, would lead a review of how to improve access to health care while restraining its cost.
"I am committed to bring the staggering costs of health care under control," Mr. Bush said. Since then, health care prices have shot up 15 percent, while the Consumer Price Index for all items has increased 7.7 percent.
Dr. Sullivan's long-delayed study has now been virtually completed, but it has not been formally sent to President Bush, apparently because no one at the White House has requested it. But White House officials are generally aware of its contents because they participated in the review.
Dr. Sullivan rejects the idea that the United States should emulate Canada by offering health insurance to everyone through a Government-financed program. Rather, as he has said in speeches and Congressional testimony, he favors state experiments to test new ways of delivering health care; changes in the ways people live to foster better health; legislation to make health insurance more available to small businesses, and new restrictions on the award of damages in malpractice lawsuits.
Administration officials say Dr. Sullivan's package is significant. But it is not nearly enough to satisfy Democratic lawmakers or medical economists who have shaped the debate on this issue for more than a decade.
Rather than propose any grand, sweeping plan, Administration officials say, President Bush would attack Democrats on the ground that their proposals would lead to Government price controls, the rationing of health care, a deterioration in the quality of care and an increase in taxes.
 
'At Pentagon Prices'
 Constance Horner, who studied the issue as Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services from May 1989 to September of this year, came up with one of the Republicans' favorite lines. A program of national health insurance run by the Federal Government, she has warned, would have "all the compassion of the Internal Revenue Service and the efficiency of the Postal Service, at Pentagon prices."
Dozens of Democrats in Congress, like Representatives Marty Russo of Illinois and Pete Stark of California, say Mr. Wofford's victory shows that voters want national health insurance, and they predict that his success will embolden other candidates to exploit the issue.
Another signal came from a ballot question in New Jersey, where voters were asked if Congress should enact "a national health care program" covering everyone, with "minimal out-of-pocket expense to taxpayers." Of the 1.4 million voters answering that ballot question, 78 percent said yes. The question said nothing about how the program would be financed.
Mr. Wofford himself says the Pennsylvania result was not necessarily an endorsement of any specific health care proposal. "The vote of Pennsylvania was not for my plan, but it was for action," he said. "It was for action now."
Edward H. Lazarus, a Democratic poll taker who conducted surveys in Pennsylvania after the election, agreed, saying, "Voters want to see action on health care, but they don't know what action they want."

PAINFUL CHOICES FOR PHYSICIANS
As more and more companies in the New York region join "managed care" networks -- organizations that require patients to choose from a set list of physicians, and physicians to charge certain fees for certain procedures -- doctors are facing painful choices: personal care vs. volume, autonomy vs. income. Like so many other changes in health care, this one reminds doctors of something many prefer to forget: medicine is a business, and a difficult one at that. Page A1.

HEADLINE: Belt-Tightening Crimps Westport Dining

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WESTPORT, Conn., Nov. 10

 BODY:
There is no Indelicato's now, no old-fashioned spaghetti house like the one in the 1964 novel "Reuben, Reuben," where working-class locals and New York commuters uneasily encountered each other at tables topped with red-and-white checked tablecloths in a Westport that was disguised as the town of Woodsmoke.
These days, the commuters are the locals, and places like Indelicato's and the coffee shops that once represented the range of restaurants in bedroom communities were long ago overwhelmed here by Francine's and Pancho Villa's, Onion Alley and Soup's On, the Pompano Grill and Panda Pavilion. There are more than 60 restaurants in Westport, making this wealthy town of 24,000 -- the home of celebrities, artists, advertising executives and writers -- the dining capital of Fairfield County and the restaurants themselves one of its largest industries.
 
Feeling the Tax Bite
 But not all is well. Just as restaurateurs from midtown Manhattan to Southampton, L.I., have found that people are staying home -- and eating less when they do dine out -- those in Westport have seen the region's recession enter their dining rooms. The always-sharp competition has become sharper, especially since the state's first income tax kicked in last month, and the gulf between the winners and the hangers-on has widened. 
 For the customers, as always, bad times are a good time to have money to spend. But many restaurants are being reminded that there are other ways to spend it.
"The video stores are all busy, and that's because people are getting a video and going home," said Sean Coughlin, who has owned the Mooring, overlooking the Saugatuck River on Riverside Avenue, for 15 years. "Everybody thought Westport was a rich town and everybody had money, but one of the first things people cut out was this business."
Riverside Avenue, which runs along the Saugatuck River for a mile and a half from Boston Post Road to the train station in Saugatuck, has 9 restaurants -- until recently, 10 -- ranging from the Hot Dog Stand to Da Pietro's, one of the most highly rated, and expensive, in Connecticut.
Some, like the Mooring, have made adjustments to bolster business. After a good summer, Mr. Coughlin has gone into his off-season with early-bird specials, dinner specials and a lighter menu that lets people eat more quickly and cheaply. "Westport has always been a very competitive town," he said. "The good restaurants are buckling down and doing what they have to do to ride it out."
 
Some Are Always Busy
 Others, like David DeRosa, the owner of noisy, always crowded De Rosa's, near the station, still have people waiting outside. He has also started a delivery service to meet a growing demand for takeout orders. And while he still gets business customers, he says they are changing the way they do business. "I do notice they're cutting back," he said. "We have more companies calling and asking for detailed checks for their employees' expense accounts."
If signs of stress are not obvious at Mr. DeRosa's doorstep, they are evident just across the street, where Tang's Westport, a Chinese restaurant, closed in September.
Jean Cronin, assistant vice president of the Connecticut Restaurants Association, said many restaurants did not start feeling pinched until spring or summer. Things got worse in October, when the state's income tax took effect.
Pietro Scotti, the owner and chef of Da Pietro's, a northern Italian and French restaurant near Boston Post Road, blames the income tax for a 15 percent drop in his weekday business.
Da Pietro's is still jammed on weekends, but the regulars who make up a large part of its business show how Westport's restaurants are tied to the entire region's economy. They come from as far as New Haven and New York, but ever since he opened in 1988, Mr. Scotti said, "very, very little from Westport."
At the Mooring, Mr. Coughlin said he had heard plenty about the income tax as he walked through his dining room. "A lot of them say they don't have to live here, and they can move out," he said.
He has no illusions that Westport, by itself, supports 60 restaurants. He lists where people come from -- Stamford, Wilton, Orange, the Naugatuck Valley -- and then the corporations that are leaving or cutting back: United Parcel Service in Greenwich, Richardson-Vicks in Shelton, Norden Systems in Norwalk, Saab Cars USA in Orange.
The people most hurt by the changing business are the waiters and waitresses, who serve fewer, less expensive dinners. "Waiters are working twice as many shifts to make the same money," said Laura Tamburo, the manager at Porky Manero's.
Adding insult is the one bit of good news for most Connecticut residents: the recent reduction in the sales tax to 6 percent, from 8 percent. For diners accustomed to doubling the tax on their bill to figure their tip, it suddenly adds up to a 12 percent tip, instead of 16 percent.

HEADLINE: Charting a Poor Community's Future

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD

 BODY:
There are business people and homeowners, a nurse and a police officer, people who live on Social Security and the president of Hartford's Board of Education. There is the owner of a body repair shop, who is also coach and mentor to the 360 teen-agers of the Martin Luther King Soccer League.
Together they are charting an ambitious plan to restore one of Hartford's poorest neighborhoods, Upper Albany, and improve life for the 10,000 people who live there. 
 And standing behind the 17 members of the Upper Albany Neighborhood Collaborative is the Ford Foundation and its long history of involvement in urban renewal, including its support in 1967 for the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation in Brooklyn, the country's first community development with private and public funds.
"What makes Upper Albany exciting is we're addressing a community in its entirety, not piecemeal," said Franklin A. Thomas, Ford's president, who once headed the Brooklyn renewal project. "We're building on Bed-Stuy roots, but doing it better." Ford is also financing neighborhood collaborations in Detroit, Memphis and Milwaukee in the hope that the four will create models that will have national impact.
 
A Choice for Residents
 So far, the Upper Albany Collaborative, which began operating 13 months ago, has no visible improvements to show off. But that does not trouble Ford officials or the Hartford Foundation for Public Giving, which was delegated by Ford to assist the Collaborative. The Hartford philanthropy banks the Collaborative's funds but clearly, it's the neighborhood members who lead.
"If there already was a grand plan, I would be worried because it would mean we were doing what always has been done in the past -- telling the community what's good for it without giving its residents a choice," said Alan E. Green, assistant director at the Hartford Foundation. "Choice is what is important. We have an opportunity here in Hartford that may not come again."
Mr. Green, 45 years old, grew up in Upper Albany, and as a youth delivered newspapers along the tree-lined residential streets, which still have handsome Victorian-era homes that are on the Federal Register of Historic Places. But there are also stretches of empty factories and vacant stores where the jobless congregate and drugs are sold.
In giving Upper Albany $1.1 million and pledging "multimillions more" in coming years, Ford stipulated that the renewal must be comprehensive, addressing an array of social and economic concerns. Ford also insisted that the collaborative be run by a diverse mix of people from the neighborhood. According to the 1980 census, 81 percent of the people in Upper Albany are black while another 15 percent are Hispanic.
Still, one Collaborative member, Esther Bush, director of the Urban League of Greater Hartford, maintains the board is overly middle-aged and wants to add younger people, maybe a gang member or a youth who kicked a drug habit.
 
Weighing Goals and Concerns
 The collaborative, after many weeks of weighing goals and the concerns of residents, agreed to focus initially on education, employment, homeownership and economic development. The board moved slowly, acknowledged Ralph Knighton, its chairman. "Some members did not have an in-depth understanding of poverty," he said. "It takes time to expose them."
Even so, deciding priorities has not been easy in a neighborhood where crime is high, schools are crowded and joblessness is widespread. At least 38 percent of the households receive public assistance and 73 percent are headed by a single parent.
But the neighborhood also has its assets like access to Keney Park, at 693 acres one of the largest recreation areas in New England. It also has a commercial strip and an active merchants' association with more than 160 members and bus lines that carry thousands of commuters to jobs downtown. The Artists Collective, a multi-arts cultural organization, is moving into the neighborhood.
Some people look at the Upper Albany factories, now shuttered, and envision them transformed into housing or into marketplaces for vendors who now sell their wares on the street.
So far, the Collaborative has operated without voting, whittling away at disagreements until the dissenting members were willing to say "I can live with that." The phrase became the board's slogan, and the members have had it printed on T-shirts.
Few of the members were acquainted before they were brought together by the Hartford Foundation with the help of a researcher, Gerald Waite, who grew up in the neighborhood and who canvassed the 21-block area to prepare a profile of the neighborhood.
The members, who serve without pay, meet at least twice monthly. Many ideas have been floated: some members would like to see a loan fund developed to help promote homeownership. Others are concerned that the community is not getting enough help to keep its streets clean and safe. And some would like to see residents compile report cards on city services as a way of keeping up pressure on government.
Inevitably, the Collaborative's first year has been used mainly to build trust and confidence among its members, said Prof. Harold A. Richman, a social-welfare analyst from the University of Chicago who will evaluate the projects in Hartford and the other three cities.
"They must develop a sense that working together, they can accomplish changes," he said, "but the test of concrete achievments is still ahead."

HEADLINE: Bishop H. Donegan, Episcopal Leader, Dies at 91

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
Bishop Horace W. B. Donegan, the Episcopal Bishop of New York from 1950 until 1972 and an early church advocate for the rights of blacks, women and the poor, died yesterday at his home in Sanibel, Fla. He was 91 years old.
His longtime chaplain, the Rev. Geoffrey R. M. Skrinar, said the Bishop died of cancer of the throat. 
 Bishop Donegan, in his 22 years as spiritual leader of the New York diocese, transformed its social conciousness. A slender courtly man with cool blue eyes, he took a diocese with some of the most patrician families in the country and focused its attention on the needs of the growing ranks of the poor.
A landmark in that journey was his announcement in 1967 that money that had accumulated to finish the construction of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, on Amsterdam Avenue at West 112th Street, would instead be given toward housing and development projects in nearby Harlem.
 
'Broken and Incomplete'
 The structure, seat of a diocese that embraces Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island and seven counties north of the city, is the world's largest Gothic-style cathedral. Its construction began in 1892.
"This unfinished cathedral, towering as it does over this great and suffering metropolis, shall be the prophetic symbol that our society is still as rough-hewn, ragged, broken and incomplete as the building itself," he said.
The halt in construction continued for a time under his successor, Bishop Paul Moore Jr., a lanky activist with a more forceful public style who intensified the diocese's involvement in several social causes. Work on the cathedral resumed in 1973.
Bishop Donegan had worked to expand the role of women in his church. In 1956, he approved their election as wardens, vestry members and delegates to the national conventions.
 
Ordained Women as Deacons
 In 1971, after the national church permitted it, he ordained two women, Carol Anderson and Julia Sibley, as deacons. The Episcopal Church has since decided to ordain women as priests and bishops.
"He bridged the gap between World War II and the tumult of the 1960's," Mr. Skrinar said.
Bishop Donegan lived quietly in the bishop's residence on the cathedral grounds or other church homes. He enjoyed reading biographies, listening to Gilbert and Sullivan operettas, swimming, painting landscapes and playing an occasional game of golf.
After his retirement as bishop, he joined the staff of St. James Church on Madison Avenue at 71st Street, where he had once been rector. He took up the duties of a parish pastor, though in lighter fashion, preaching occasionally and assisting at communion.
 
Honored by Queen Elizabeth
 The retirement included long summers in England, where he was born Horace William Baden Donegan in Derbyshire on May 17, 1900. In 1957, Queen Elizabeth II named him an honorary commander of the Order of the British Empire.
His family left England when he was 10. He lived in Toledo, Ohio, and did his undergraduate work at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., when it was known as St. Stephen's College, and later at Oxford. Mr. Donegan received his divinity degree from the Episcopal Theological Seminary in Cambridge, Mass., in 1927 and became a priest in 1928.
After serving as rector of Christ Church in Baltimore from 1929 to 1933, he became the rector of St. James, which has one of New York City's most prominent congregations.
After 14 years at St. James and several appointments in national church posts, in 1947 he was elected Suffragan Bishop of New York, the second highest post in the diocese. On the retirement of Bishop Charles K. Gilbert in 1950, Bishop Donegan was enthroned as the 12th Bishop of the diocese.
 
'Evil Days' for the City
 Presiding at a church situated on the edge of an area of poor black and Hispanic people, he quickly began speaking out on the need for equality of opportunity. In 1953, he denounced conditions in schools and housing and high incidence of crime and urged different faiths to pool resources to alleviate "the evil days" the city had fallen on.
The church may have to "sacrifice much that is time-honored" to minister effectively in a city whose racial and economic patterns were changing, he said in 1954.
In 1957, he announced a $5 million program for building new churches in poorer areas of Manhattan and the Bronx, saying New York City was "the most strategic missionary opportunity that faces the church."
In his genteel way, he crusaded for civil rights within his church as well. He chastised the Church Club, a prominent organization of Episcopal laymen, for failing to admit black members, declaring that in the Episcopal Church "there is no room for prejudice."
 
'Sins of Segregation'
 In a pastoral letter in 1956, he asked the diocese's churches to acknowledge "our own sins of segregation in our own community." He chose to read the letter in one of the city's most fashionable churches, St. Bartholomew's Church on Park Avenue at 51st Street.
His forthrightness had its costs. At a special service marking his 15th year as Bishop, he observed that his civil rights stances had resulted in the withdrawal of substantial gifts pledged for completion of the cathedral.
"I am faced with the fact," he said, "that one reason it is unfinished is because I, as Bishop of New York, have taken certain positions which I had to do as your Bishop."
Outspoken on other causes as well, Bishop Donegan condemned the "un-American tactics" of the Congressional investigations led by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy and deplored efforts to introduce religion into the public schools. In a pluralistic society, he said, the public schools should not be a vehicle for teaching "a religiously grounded ethic."
 
Drew Line at Draft Refusers
 Shortly before Christmas 1955, the Bishop sponsored an apartment near the cathedral for a family of four refugees from Germany, and he later helped the husband find a job.
During John F. Kennedy's campaign for President in 1960, the Bishop told churchgoers that Mr. Kennedy's Roman Catholic religion should not be an issue. In the same address, he assailed the South African policy of apartheid as "morally unsupportable, spiritually unpardonable and shamefully tragic in its consequences."
There were, however, nuances to his liberalism. During the Vietnam War, in a 1965 address to the Patriotic Societies of New York, he said he could not understand young men's refusal to serve their country, even as conscientious objectors.
"Were it in my power," he said, "I would fine every person who did not vote, and reward doubly everyone who enlisted in the service of our country, whether as an Episcopalian in the armed forces or as Quaker in the courageous group who will carry the wounded off the field of battle."
The Bishop is survived by two nephews and a niece.
A Liturgy of the Resurrection will be at 10 A.M. Saturday at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. The body will lie in the cathedral Thursday from 4 P.M. to 8 P.M. and Friday from 10 A.M. to 8 P.M.

One Woman's Quiet Battle Against Child Abuse

BYLINE: By Andrew H. Malcolm

DATELINE: LEVITTOWN, N.Y.

 BODY:
TUCKED in among all the junk mail dumped at her house here the other day, Norma Lemily got a letter with neat but unfamiliar feminine handwriting. The postmark was from Maine, of all places. "Dear Norma," it began, "you may not remember me."
It went on to recount some problems the woman had experienced with her young children. Now, they are in high school, the woman reported, and she regularly receives compliments on their behavior. "I can't hear those compliments," the woman wrote, "without thinking of you." 
 Mrs. Lemily stuck the salmon-colored card into a small file. Such appreciative notes are the total wages she receives as a volunteer counselor in the silent guerrilla war against one of society's secret sins: child abuse. Hundreds of such dedicated but unsung volunteers toil in the metropolitan area and beyond. Some work for church or social agencies. Others, like Mrs. Lemily, work for Parents Anonymous, a California-based organization whose nationwide phone line, (800) 421-0353, steers troubled parents into more than 1,100 local group-therapy sessions where everyone has problems but no one has a last name.
Most Monday nights for the last 11 years, the 63-year-old Mrs. Lemily has left her own grown family and comfortable home to spend two hours in some borrowed conference room or church basement listening to terrifying tales of physical and emotional abuse of children by parents of all economic classes. Members of the small self-help groups are referred by themselves. They attend one time or scores of times. Typically, they are silent at first. Most are mothers, who know what they do is wrong but seem unable to unlock such destructive behavior.
Enrollment is easy but scary. Since child abuse is such a social taboo, there are few safe forums where abusive parents can vent feelings, find out they are not alone and learn better ways of being a parent.
"So often over the years," says Mrs. Lemily, "I find myself swallowing shock." There are tales of slaps or punches thrown at youngsters, often repeatedly. Emotionally destructive are details of tiny tortures inflicted, praise withheld for earnest effort, needless criticisms, epithets tossed. "You are so stupid!" many say so often the youngsters come to believe it -- and to pass it on to the next generation. The children also learn what behavior ignites the abuse, which can seem better than no parental attention, especially when it's often followed by remorseful hugs.
"You're told you're stupid by your parents," says Mrs. Lemily, "so you're attracted to a man who says the same thing. It's perversely comfortable. Then your child regularly spills his juice. And out comes all that anger."
In families of several children, one typically attracts parental lightning, such as the 5-year-old whose mother made him eat apart from the family. Mrs. Lemily might well expect her counseling successors (or possibly the police) to see that youngster in trouble sometime down the road. She might also expect to see the boy's siblings, who swallowed with their dinners a powerful dose of guilt for not trying to protect him from such injustice over the years.
Given that there are no skills tests to earn the right to parenthood, Mrs. Lemily contents herself with cleaning up corners of the inevitable mess. She likens her job to that of a surgeon who wastes little time lecturing a writhing patient on healthier living habits. "I tell them that what they did was terrible, but they are not terrible people. They've heard enough of that for years."
"You were never judgmental," wrote the Maine woman.
Which, if you think about it -- and Mrs. Lemily would be delighted if you did -- is precisely the sort of behavior she is trying to instill in parents.
This all comes, of course, with rewards and costs. Mrs. Lemily's three children quickly became sensitive to not pursuing the identity of the many distressed telephone callers. "At first," adds Mrs. Lemily's husband Tom, a lawyer, "she'd come home and have to talk, talk, talk to let off steam. I'm Irish. I'd just blow up if I heard all that. But she's from Canada, so it was harder for her."
There are times now when Mrs. Lemily's mind starts to glaze at the 800th parental account of inexplicable anger. But she reminds herself that although she will never see them, each case involves vulnerable children. "The permutations and combinations of human behavior are infinite and fascinating," she says. "The work, even the midnight calls, lets me feel like part of a solution."
Parents come and go in the group with no formal graduation. And stress seems worse in these tough times. But occasionally another handwritten missive arrives from a parent saying, with amazement, how much the children have changed since the parent entered the group.
That's when Mrs. Lemily smiles.

Designers' Credos
It was a week for fashion manifestos, some of them pips, some of them squeaks. 
 "I believe in intentional chic," wrote Christian Francis Roth in the program for his show last Tuesday. "I hope this doesn't sound sexist, but as a man, the most attractive woman for me is the one who looks really polished . . . totally 'done.' "
Donna Karan appeared on the runway to introduce a recession rap song:
"Accentuate the positive. Eliminate the negative. Latch on to the affirmative. Don't mess with nothin' in between. To illustrate what I say, picture petticoats, a hot new bustier."
Oddly enough, a substantial part of Ms. Karan's collection was gray.
Mary McFadden's program included some wispy prose about "the turgid dream world of Beaudelaire" and "Gaughin." Atmospheric but iffy in the spelling department.
Liza Bruce's manifesto included three cards with the headings "Liberte," Egalite," "Modernite." (What about Maternite?) "She believes that women now have the opportunity to make radical changes in the way they dress," her statement read. "This is not to say that Liza is a feminist or that she espouses feminist dogma." Heaven forbid.
Isaac Mizrahi did not present any overall written statement, but his program was peppered with witty gems to introduce each series of styles: "FTD" for a group of dramatic floral dresses and coats, "Rattlers" for Western-inspired long black dresses.
"High Heels in the Park" was one splendidly evocative phrase. Can't you just see the clothes?
 
Marc Jacobs's Attitude
 The Perry Ellis showroom was hopping a day after Marc Jacobs's rousing spring show last week.
Faxes were already pouring in from magazine editors who wanted to borrow clothes, for layouts or dancing. Buyers from Bergdorf Goodman indicated that they were upping their order over last spring's, a positive sign in today's retail climate. Executives from R. H. Macy said they wanted to take the collection to their I. Magnin store in Beverly Hills for an encore show.
This would be appropriate, since most of the clothes were inspired by Los Angeles. They included wild Technicolor ball skirts with cabana scenes from the Beverly Hills Hotel, cacti and Oscars, all hand-painted by Bill Beilke and Sissi Siska, from sketches by Mr. Jacobs. (The skirts will be available by special order only, at about $7,000.)
The key to this collection's success was attitude.
"For several seasons, I'd been worrying about the needs of the market," Mr. Jacobs said. "But business in general has been so bad, I decided to just let go and have fun."
 
Waterproof Leather
 Timberland has come up with what it calls the first waterproof leather apparel collection: field jackets, bombers and leather pants, for men and women.
Timberland developed the first guaranteed waterproof leather work boot about 20 years ago, according to Jeanne Wallace, a spokeswoman for the company in Hampton, N.H. Most waterproofing agents are sprayed on after the clothes have been made.
The new line, made of nubuck leather, which resembles buckskin, was treated during the tanning process with a special agent developed by Timberland and the 3M Company.
The clothes, which cost from $500 to $1,060, are sold in the Timberland store at 709 Madison (63d Street).
 
Young Men and Macy's
 Macy's Herald Square is opening a new 30,000-square-foot selling floor on Sunday to showcase clothes targeted toward young, fashionable men. Among the labels are Cavaricci, Marithe and Francois Girbaud, Guess, Boy London and Cross Colours.
"It's a brand new space within the store," said Steven Kornajcik, senior vice president of sales promotion for Macy's Northeast. The area, on the balcony, was used for offices.
On the street, on movie screens, on MTV, it seems that today's fashion leaders are young urban men.
"It's a trendy market that moves quickly," Mr. Kornajcik said. "It's related to music and life style."

HEADLINE: Argentina Films a French Classic

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Nov. 11

 BODY:
It is enough of a risk anywhere to try to create a popular movie out of a monumental work of literature. But to attempt it in this country with its history of hyperinflation, social turmoil, horrible telephone system and military uprisings would seem to guarantee disaster.
Yet three small production companies, from the United States, France and Argentina, have persuaded William Hurt, Raul Julia and Robert Duvall to team up with this country's most celebrated director, Luis Puenzo ("The Official Story"), to create a screen version of "The Plague," by Albert Camus. Since early August, this polyglot production has been working 6 days a week, 14 hours a day in the Bohemian section of La Boca, the quaint 19th-century Plaza Dorrego and the elegant residential neighborhood Palermo Chico, to transform Mr. Puenzo's script into a movie.
 
Hope for Future Films
 With a budget of $14 million, the project is small by world standards but large for Argentina, and possibly significant to the country's future as a center for filming. 
 "If we can come in on time, on budget, we can put Argentina on the map as a place for the international movie industry," said Oscar Kramer, the Argentine associate producer of "The Official Story," which won an Oscar in 1986.
Unlike Camus's novel, which was set in North Africa in the 1940's as a metaphor for the Nazi occupation of France, Mr. Puenzo's version is set in a port city somewhere in Latin America in 1991. Despite the differences, the core narrative is the same: a recounting of how the plague, brought to the city by rats, radically changes the character and conduct of people making desperate efforts at self-preservation.
So far, the film makers appear to be beating the odds against filming in Buenos Aires. Since many Argentines have Italian, British, German, Spanish or French ancestry, it has been easy to find scores of bit players. The riches accumulated in Argentina in the first part of this century have given the country a large inventory of fine European antiques, providing a valuable source of props.
And since the Government of Carlos Saul Menem adopted a new economic policy in March, inflation has stabilized and the country's currency, the austral, is no longer wildly fluctuating. It has been noted that if the movie had been done in France, the cost would have been two or three times greater.
"Now we can sign a contract and have no fear about what the currency will do," said Mr. Kramer. "I can meet my budget. The unions aren't working against us so we can work extra time if we need to. We don't have to use black-market tricks like before."
With the Latin American setting, the political message of "The Plague" should be unmistakable. Mr. Puenzo says he hopes the movie will be a warning that while military dictatorships are on the wane, the plague -- or political oppression -- is biding its time.
"Camus's point was that the plague might go away for a time, but will always come back in a little different form," Mr. Puenzo said in a recent interview. "Everyone seems to be embracing a new form of pragmatic optimism. We're talking about the end of history, the end of philosophy. That is very dangerous, because to believe that, you have to sacrifice values based on true ideals. We're thinking that everyone will live happily ever after."
For Mr. Puenzo, the movie version of "The Plague" represents a continuation of "The Official Story," which he made in 1984 on a budget of $300,000. The first Argentine film to win an Oscar, it dealt with the days of military dictatorship in Argentina and the Government's systematic program of killing, or making disappear, people who opposed it.
 
Multiple Offers
 The movie version of "The Plague" has had a long and complicated history. The owners of the rights to Camus's masterpiece -- his daughter, Catherine, son, Jean, and his publishing house, Editions Gallimard in Paris -- were trying to decide among a number of offers in 1986, including bids from the producer David Puttnam, from Israeli, Italian and Japanese producers, and from Mr. Hurt himself.
AIDS had become an explosive issue, and many saw Camus's work as a metaphor for that disease.
But the rights were eventually sold to an independent American producer, John R. Pepper, of Pepper-Prince Company Ltd., based in New York, primarily because his vision was different.
"We did not want to make this a statement on AIDS," Mr. Pepper said. "This has a much broader application. Camus was making a political statement and we wanted to be true to that. We told them we would not make the movie without heavy French influence since this is a French national monument. And that while it was important to be faithful to the soul of the novel, it was also important to be irreverent."
To provide the French dimension, Mr. Pepper asked the Compagnie Francaise Cinematographique to join him and Mr. Kramer on the project. The head of the French group, Cyril de Rouvre, contributed $3 million of his personal fortune to get the stars he wanted.
Mr. Julia said it would be "a mistake to go and see the film and compare it with the novel."
The actor plays Cottard, a shady operator who is fleeing from the law and who actually enjoys the panic provoked by the plague. "We don't want to be the novel," he said. "You have to leave the novel in your home when you see the movie."

Bonilla Heads Class Of '91 Free Agents

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
When the results of last year's chase were complete, seven free agents had attained contracts worth $3 million or more a year. This year's chase begins today, and Bobby Bonilla will try to reach $5 million, perhaps $6 million, a year. Jack Morris, Frank Viola and Danny Tartabull are other free agents seeking the stratosphere of the salary scale.
This is the first day free agents can negotiate and sign with any of the 26 teams, and after expiration of last night's midnight deadline, a record 98 players made up the free-agent class of '91. 
 Morris, Minnesota's World Series hero, and Otis Nixon, Atlanta's drug-suspended outfielder, filed yesterday, as did Mike Pagliarulo, Junior Ortiz and Al Newman of the Twins, Max Venable of California and Steve Ontiveros of Philadelphia.
Just short of filing, Bill Wegmen, whose 15-7 performance this year gave him a 51-51 career record, reached agreement with the Milwaukee Brewers on a four-year, $9.5 million contract. He earned $440,000 this year. Glenn Davis of Baltimore, who filed for free agency on Nov. 1, agreed to a two-year contract with the Orioles.
Morris became a free agent because the Twins had shown no inclination to elevate his economic status to the area Roger Clemens and Dwight Gooden inhabit. Earlier this year, the two pitchers signed contract extensions that made them baseball's highest-paid players, Clemens with an average of $5,380,250 a year and Gooden at $5.15 million a year.
"Now that Jack is a free agent, he has an open mind," Richard Moss, the pitcher's lawyer, said yesterday. "He didn't become a free agent just to raise the price for the Twins."
Morris signed with the Twins last winter as a second-look free agent, the result of the union's collusion cases against the owners. Under terms of that contract, Morris could have earned $3.65 million next year, but he opted not to exercise his option, deciding to seek a contract in the $5 million-a-year range.
Last spring Bonilla rejected the Pittsburgh Pirates' offer of $4 million a year for four years and subsequently did the same with a $4.2 million-a-year offer. At the time, he wanted five years and might have accepted $20 million.
Now he stands to gain $5 million a year for five years, although with Gene Autry and the California Angels geared to sign him, the price could go even higher. The Pirates reportedly made Bonilla a new offer, valued at $18.5 million for four years with an option for a fifth year, during the weekend. Dennis Gilbert, Bonilla's agent, did not return telephone calls seeking comment on their response.
The Mets are one of the teams interested in the outfielder, who this season batted .302, hit 18 home runs and drove in 100 runs. Last year, the Mets refused to offer Darryl Strawberry, their own free agent, a fifth year, steadfastly holding to what they said was a club policy not to sign a position player for more than four years.
Strawberry defected to the Los Angeles Dodgers, who gave him $20.25 million for five years. Now the Mets have acknowledged that they may have to ignore their policy and go to five years for Bonilla.
The Mets, hoping for an early strike, may make Bonilla a substantial offer quickly, but they don't figure to go as high as $5 million a year. Furthermore, Bonilla isn't expected to bite at an early offer. In rejecting the Pirates' offer eight months ago, he gambled that he would not be injured and he would have a good season. If he was willing to wait until after the season, then he probably would wait a few weeks now.
Whereas Bonilla won his gamble, Viola, in effect, lost his. He rejected the Mets' offer of $13 million for three years, then had a dreadful second half, compiling a 2-10 record. He may still command $4 million or more a year simply because teams are so desperate for pitching.
After Bonilla, the best hitter in the free-agent class is Tartabull, who this season batted .316, hit 31 home runs, drove in 100 runs and led the American League with a .593 slugging percentage. Although he has been a consistent run producer, Tartabull is not valued as highly as Bonilla because some teams question his attitude.

Hiatus in the Fun

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER

 BODY:
Reality dropped in on America twice last week. One visit any time is remarkable; two in a week, extraordinary. Press and television were flabbergasted. They are so benumbed by make-believe that so much reality was bound to make them giddy.
The first visit occurred at midweek. Scattered election results, subjected to intense scrutiny, revealed that, yes -- yes! -- there really was a middle class. What a commotion in the press. What an upsetment in television. "Middle Class Lives!" 
 This was followed almost instantly, so swift is the analytic genius of the media, by "Middle Class Suffers!" What it suffers has, of course, been obvious for months to everybody not addicted to kidding himself. For the first time in maybe 50 years people who cannot be dismissed as shiftless louts are worrying about how they are going to pay the doctor, pay the rent and pay the butcher.
To recognize this had been impolite until last week's elections, for press and television, despite conservative belief that they are hotbeds of Bolshevism, have been exceedingly timid about offending Republican Presidents since The Washington Post took on Richard Nixon way back when.
Not surprisingly then, they largely accepted the official statistics and official pronouncements from official pronouncement issuers, and played the Republican tune on the economy, which went, "Let's make believe and keep our fingers crossed." With last week's elections, economic reality finally became an acceptable subject for press and TV to dwell upon.
The more timid received official approval to say "hard times" when the President canceled a grand tour of Asia, obviously to create the perception that he preferred to stay home and deal with the causes of middle-class discontent.
Before the country could relish this rare onset of reality about the economy it was confronted by Earvin (Magic) Johnson forcing it to face another reality, which is that AIDS is a disease that threatens absolutely everybody. So far it has been politically and economically convenient to consider it an affliction visited only on certain luckless minorities.
As Johnson pointed out with such eloquence in his news conference, it can strike even the noblest among us, and surely will, if not directly then through those we love. The media response to Magic was an astonishing torrent of film and print such as one rarely sees except for the start of wars and the fall of tyrants. It filled newspapers and television for three or four days, instantly obliterating from memory the big midweek visit of economic reality.
This is one reason reality has such a hard time surviving in America. Media overdosing quickly wears out reality's welcome, stimulating appetites for the relief of make-believe. After bombardments of news about the pain of unemployed fathers and the despair of young home buyers in a world of $150,000 "starter homes," we want to cry out: "Enough! I've been hit by reality from my cradle. Now stuff me with fun!"
Magic Johnson may escape this destiny and keep the country at grips with reality for the long run. Let's hope so. The precedents, however, are not encouraging. Remember Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf? Remember everybody saying he might be a good Presidential candidate? That was right after he led the armies to victory in the desert war. Remember the desert war? Remember the victory?
The overwhelming media absorption in Magic's case reflects the astonishing importance which Americans give to sports and sports heroes. To be sure, it helps that Earvin Johnson is not just another sports hero, but also a gentleman of surpassing charm. Still, is there any actor, any statesman, any warrior, any politician less than a sitting President who could produce such massive outpourings by announcing that he had tested positive for HIV?
Sports are almost as hostile to reality as politics. Sports lull us with romantic speechifying about the glory of team and teamwork while it corrupts our universities and exploits poor talented kids not quite talented enough ever to play in Magic's league. Politics beguiles us with shabby hocus-pocus which creates "images" and "perceptions" to distract us from realities.
Magic Johnson has shown us how to deal elegantly with reality. It's something refreshing in sports, as it would be in politics.

HEADLINE: Discussions of Poverty Can't Leave Out Race

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Oct. 29 article about studies comparing poverty rates in Europe and the United States confuses and misleads on two counts. Though race is the throbbing reality underlying the conflict, you never address it directly. That omission oversimplifies our social problems and makes them substantially more difficult to solve. 
 You quote an explanation of our poverty rates by the social scientist Timothy Smeeding -- "we choose to tolerate a lot more poverty than do other countries" -- but never probe for an explanation of this tolerance. It might, for example, have been instructive to note that the poverty rate for blacks in the United States is three times that for whites.
In an era when Reagan-Bush racial politics shape our national social policies, the omission of the racial factor is a profound journalistic error. Particularly when a central point in the study you describe is the comparison of the performance of our racially divided society with that of relatively homogenous European countries.
More troubling are quotations from Douglas Besharov of the American Enterprise Institute. In attacking Mr. Smeeding's thesis that European poverty rates are lower because of more generous and effective social policies, Mr. Besharov says, "the problem is we don't have the same kind of poor people," and "Our problem is with poor people who don't work."
In a country that has become accustomed to code words, nobody has to ask what he means.
One of the problems with Mr. Besharov's position is that the facts get in the way. In a study for the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, a Northwestern University economist, Rebecca M. Blank, has found that though the work effort of the poor increased at a faster rate in the 1980's than in the 60's, the decline in poverty in the 80's was minimized by a sharp reduction in wages. By contrast, poverty dropped sharply in the 60's because of rising wages.
Moreover, poverty rates of families that included both workers and children increased by one-third in 1979-90, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. Two million poor Americans worked full time in 1990, and the center estimates there are 5.5 million to 6 million people in the families supported by them. All in all, at least 8.7 million poor people worked full- or part-time last year, according to the center.
Carol Fennelly, a director of the largest homeless shelter in Washington, recently said on television that 65 percent of the people who use that facility work full- or part-time.
Finally, Mr. Besharov's analysis, resting on the fecklessness of the American poor, omits considering the bias of employers. Recent studies for the University of Chicago urban poverty and family life study suggest that employers prefer immigrant male workers to native-born black males even when blacks are willing to work for lower wages and the immigrants have less language facility. Those studies might help explain why there are so many discouraged workers, who want work, but have given up looking, among the black poor.
Avoidance and denial have characterized much of America's treatment of the racial issue for centuries. Those devices have made it extremely difficult to solve our racial problems and to address social issues related to them.

HEADLINE: Discussions of Poverty Can't Leave Out Race;
Value of Comparisons

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In an Oct. 29 article reporting research findings on how badly the United States compares with other advanced industrialized countries on poverty, you quote Douglas Besharov stating that European comparisons are meaningless ("I think it's hokum," he says). 
 Mr. Besharov argues that European policy solutions would produce harmful side effects in the United States, and that if comparisons are made, the United States should be compared with Bulgaria and Romania rather than Germany, France and the Scandinavian countries. Mr. Besharov, a noneconomist, attacks two economist-researchers of high standing for "technical flaws."
Even a casual observer of history or current affairs knows that in fact countries can and do learn from the experiences of others and that European comparisons have meaning and value in the United States policy debate. For example, the most popular social program in the United States is Social Security, a program that we and more than 100 other countries around the world "borrowed" from Europe, where it was "invented" more than a century ago.
Then, if we are concerned about economic competitiveness, we would certainly want to compare ourselves with those countries with which we compete -- and clearly countries in the European Community are among our competitors. Since when does the United States -- one of the richest countries in the world -- look to Romania and Bulgaria as a standard by which to judge ourselves?
Furthermore, if international comparisons are so meaningless, why is United States industry so concerned about how the Japanese and the Germans are achieving their economic successes? International comparisons do not tell us what to do, but they enrich significantly the options to consider in a search for wise policy.
The United States has a high poverty rate not because many of the poor are not working, but because about half the poor are still poor despite working. European countries emphasize work-incentive policies and assure those who work -- especially those with children -- adequate family income through supplementation.

HEADLINE: President of Troubled Bridgeport University Quits

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON

 BODY:
Janet D. Greenwood resigned last night as president of the financially ailing University of Bridgeport.
A spokesman for the university said she would remain as a tenured faculty member and president emeritus. 
 Her resignation was announced after a five-and-a-half-hour meeting of the university's board of trustees. Dr. Greenwood had served as president of the private Connecticut nonsectarian university since 1987.
"She served the university during a very difficult period," said Colin Gunn, chairman of the board.
The board of trustees announced that Edwin G. Eigel Jr., the university provost since 1979, has been named interim president.
The change of leadership comes three weeks after the trustees voted unanimously to reject a possible takeover of the university by a group founded and largely financed by the Unification Church and its leader, the Rev. Sun Myung Moon.
Both Dr. Greenwood and Mr. Gunn had urged serious consideration of the church's proposal that included the promise of $50 million to help the university solve its financial crisis. The university has been weakened by a decades-long slide in enrollment and the longest faculty strike at any American university.
Some students said Dr. Greenwood's resignation was a positive sign. "We need some new leaders and hopefully they'll find someone," said Suzi Murray, editor of the student newspaper, The Scribe, in an interview with The Associated Press.
Dr. Greenwood left the campus after the board meeting and did not comment on her resignation. In earlier statements, she had said the university was suffering because of the recession and because of Bridgeport's own financial problems.

Banking on Currency Union

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
IS one currency, controlled by one central bank, the next logical step to a truly integrated European economy? Or is it an act of hubris, a marriage that will ruin a beautiful friendship?
Eight distinguished European economists assembled by the Center for Economic Policy Research, an independent think tank in London, dismiss fears that the prospective partners are fundamentally incompatible. They maintain that the European Monetary Union, anchored on Germany's determination to maintain stable prices, offers Europe a cheap way to banish inflation and lower capital costs -- provided national economies retain some fiscal flexibility to cope with shocks. 
 A more realistic worry, they argue in a report published a month before European heads of state are expected to announce the marriage banns, is that union will expose the checking and payments system to the sorts of pressures that destroyed America's savings and loans and cost taxpayers some $200 billion.
One attraction of a common currency is greater certainty in business costs: A French manufacturer who sells fork lifts in Milan will no longer have to worry about the franc-lira exchange rate on the day of delivery. But the real prize is price stability.
The community's high-inflation economies -- Greece, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Britain -- have all made progress in stabilizing prices. But the cost of anti-inflation credibility, measured in slower growth and high unemployment, can be substantial. By contrast, an irrevocable commitment to an independent central bank that operates under Germany's long shadow should lower inflation expectations overnight. And with currencies locked in permanent embrace, investors in the weaker economies should no longer demand more interest to compensate for the risks of future devaluation.
The authors of "Monitoring European Integration" acknowledge that the temptation to fiscal indulgence cannot be eliminated by putting a lock on the door of the central bank. It is possible, even likely, that national governments will resolve political conflict by spending more than they tax. And the resulting stimulus could spill into the rest of the community, much the way deficit spending in California can add to the inflationary demand for goods from Oregon. But the answer, they argue, does not lie in tight fiscal rules.
National economies need some fiscal flexibility to buffer shocks -- say, a natural disaster or a collapse in the price of a critical export. And in any case, a fiscal rule based on government deficits or national debt would be arbitrary if it were applied to all countries. Belgium, for example, typically runs bigger budget deficits than Britain or Spain, but is less inflation-prone. David Begg, one of the eight economists and a professor at the University of London's Birkbeck College, suggests a more promising approach is to reduce incentives to profligacy. The report recommends that governments that run big deficits be required to index their debts to inflation or interest rates. Thus any national government's "success" in exporting inflation to the rest of the monetary union would carry the penalty of increasing the government's debt burden.
Mr. Begg would also limit the risks that banks could take in holding government debts, thereby preventing a national government's default from threatening the overall European banking system. That would make it more practical -- and thus more credible -- for the European central bank to refuse to prop up government borrowers no longer deemed creditworthy in the private market.
This last point touches on what the eight economists cite as the greatest potential risk in monetary union. While Eurocrats have spent many a lunch devising fiscal and monetary rules for the new union, little effort has been put into the problem of regulating the integrated payments system. And if nobody bothers to check the impulses of imprudent lenders, European taxpayers could end up like their American counterparts.
That is why fully a third of the report is devoted to the design of banking regulation. The authors, in brief, would opt for a system of deposit insurance, with premiums tied to risk. They also want banks that make riskier loans to buffer the risks with fatter cushions of capital.
One might still wonder, though, whether incentive-based regulation, which strives for safety with the least possible interference in private capital markets, is really enough. The debacle in America does not prove that a healthy balance is impossible to manage. But it has certainly left many American analysts wary of any reform that does not build a wall between the checking and payments system and other banking services.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Scott Paper Redraws Organizational Chart

BYLINE: By KIM FOLTZ

 BODY:
Struggling to cut costs and raise sagging profits, the Scott Paper Company announced a management reorganization yesterday that reshuffles executives worldwide.
The moves are intended to focus the company on its two main businesses, coated paper for publishing and personal-care and cleaning products, said Michael Kilpatric, a spokesman for the Philadelphia-based company, which makes Scott tissues, Cottonelle toilet paper and Viva paper towels and other brands. 
 "We need to be more aggressive in order to get in shape," said Mr. Kilpatric, who said the reorganization resulted from a four-point plan the company announced in January.
That program called for a reduction in working capital, greater control of capital spending, the divestiture of some assets and such cost reductions as employee layoffs.
The company has laid off about 600 workers in Britian and has said it will make additional job cuts worldwide. It also plans to sell three of its businesses: the food-service container business; bulk nonwoven products like disposable diaper liners, and the specialty papers division.
Because of the recession and increased competition from rivals like Procter & Gamble, Scott's business has taken a battering this year. For the third quarter, profits dropped 58 percent, to $28 million, compared with $64.8 million in the comparable period last year.
One of the more significant executive changes announced yesterday was the appointment of P. Newton White, a senior vice president, to head a newly formed global unit that will oversee commercial business for tissues and other paper products. Mr. White, who is 49 years old, joined the company in 1967 and most recently had been in charge of Scott's Pacific operations.
The consumer business in the Pacific will be headed by Clemens S. Andes Jr., who had been the managing director of Scott Ltd., the company's business in Britain.
John J. Butler, who had headed Scott's European unit, will become the company's chief administrative officer, replacing J. Lawrence Shane, who will retire. Paolo Forlin, managing director of Scott's Italian operations, will head the consumer business in Europe.
Ashok Bakhru, previously the chief financial officer, will be in charge of Scott's international wet-wipes business and will continue to head the company's health-care operations.
Ellis A. Horwitz has been appointed vice president and general counsel. He replaces Norman M. Heisman, who becomes counsel to the board of directors.

One State Rating Affirmed, Another Is Cut by Moody's

 BODY:
Moody's Investors Service has taken a look at two states' general obligation bonds, affirming one and downgrading the other.
The ratings service affirmed the A rating given to New York State's general obligations, which total $22.1 billion of tax-supported debt. Despite what it calls "a diverse and substantial economic base" in New York, Moody's notes that "real reforms have not yet been devised" to solve the state's financial problems, including the unrestrained growth of Medicaid payments. 
 At the same time, Moody's lowered by a notch, to Aa from Aa1, the rating assigned to New Hampshire's general obligation bonds. New Hampshire's bonds still have a higher rating than New York's.
The rating change affects an issue of $60 million in capital improvement bonds to be offered on Monday, as well as the state's general obligation bonds, of which about $566 million are outstanding.
Moody's said the change also affected all state-guaranteed bonds of local government units and of the New Hampshire Municipal Bond Bank.
Moody's noted that "the effects of the nation's economic recession are worsened in New Hampshire by real estate property deflation, bank failures, and consequent reduced access to credit." Such negative factors "may persist for a protracted period," Moody's said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Narrowly Mixed Amid Uncertainty on Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed against other currencies yesterday as traders continued to speculate about the direction of interest rates in the United States and overseas.
Analysts said the dollar drew some support from a Los Angeles Times article quoting senior officials at the Federal Reserve as saying the central bank has virtually decided against any more interest rate cuts this year. 
 The dollar is raised by stable or higher interest rates, so the possibility that United States rates will not drop is a positive sign for investors.
But the dollar's advance was small. Robert Ryan, corporate foreign exchange manager for Bank of New York, said the American currency was not on an upward trend, and he attributed its gains to traders adjusting their holdings.
Mr. Ryan said the market's was also interested in reports that German officials believe they cannot reduce rates in their country. Those reports strengthened the mark.
The dollar was little changed against the mark in New York, edging up to 1.6400 marks from 1.6399 late Monday. In earlier European trading, the dollar fell to 1.6355 marks from 1.6410.
In Japan, interest rates are expected to decline. But traders there say the drop has been anticipated for so long it may not have a severe impact on the yen.
The dollar slipped against the Japanese yen, falling to 129.95 yen in New York, from 130.05 yen on Monday. Overnight in Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.10 yen, to 129.95 yen, and in London, it was quoted at 129.60 yen.
The British pound fell slightly against the dollar, dropping to $1.7700 in New York from $1.7705. In London, sterling fell to $1.7730 from $1.7810.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's prices, included: 1.4535 Swiss francs, up from 1.44725; 5.6045 French francs, up from 5.5990; 1,235.00 Italian lire, up from 1,232.00, and 1.13475 Canadian dollars, up from 1.13275.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Monday, included: 1.4508 Swiss francs, up from 1.4487; 5.5880 French francs, down from 5.6055; 1.8425 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8505; 1,231.50 Italian lire, down from 1,232.72, and 1.1315 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1314.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
With Acquisition of Agency, Girgenti Enters a New Area

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
UNDERSCORING the growing strength of agencies that specialize in health-care advertising, one of the largest such independent shops is acquiring an agency that specializes in consumer accounts.
Girgenti, Hughes, Butler & McDowell Inc., which creates campaigns for health-care clients like 3M Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi-Winthrop, is buying Rubin Reid Noto & Ehrenthal Inc., an agency at which food, fashion and cosmetics companies are the main clients. 
 "It's a bit of a twist," Mel Rubin, chairman of Rubin Reid, said in an interview yesterday in New York, at which he and principals of Girgenti, Hughes discussed the deal.
While the sluggish economy wreaks havoc at many companies, the health-care field is thriving. Steve Girgenti, president of Girgenti, Hughes, said the turnabout makes sense because "most medical agencies today are doing significantly better than their consumer counterparts."
Several trends are helping the explosive growth of health-care advertising.
One is the marketing of prescription drugs, like the hair-growing drug Rogaine, directly to consumers. Both agencies have enjoyed success in those endeavors: Girgenti, Hughes with Minitran, 3M Pharmaceuticals' nitroglycerin patch used to treat heart disease; Rubin Reid with Nicorette, the nicotine-based chewing gum made by Marion Merrell Dow.
Another trend is the increasing number of over-the-counter products that are marketed through big-budget consumer-ad campaigns.
The deal is being described as a stock-swap acquisition of Rubin Reid, with an office in Manhattan, by Girgenti, Hughes, with offices in Manhattan and Minneapolis/St. Paul. Each agency will operate as separate divisions under a Girgenti corporate entity. (New names for the corporate parent and the agency divisions are likely.)
The deal combines Girgenti, Hughes, founded in 1986 by former executives of the Bologna International health-care agency, with Rubin Reid, founded a year later from what was the Shaller Rubin agency. It forms a shop with billings that exceed $90 million -- and no client conflicts, Mr. Girgenti and Mr. Rubin note -- and more than 70 employees.
Already, the combination is paying off, said Mr. Girgenti and Mr. Rubin: The two agencies, in their initial joint new-business presentation, received special-project assigments from the Wyeth-Ayerst drug division of the American Home Products Corporation. Billings, they added, will be more than $10 million.
A new executive structure is being put into place as a result of the deal. Mr. Girgenti becomes chairman and chief executive of the Girgenti corporate entity, and Mr. Rubin becomes vice chairman of Rubin Reid. And each agency division gets its own chief operating officer: for Girgenti, Hughes, Bill Butler, who was executive vice president of Girgenti, Hughes; for Rubin Reid, Herb Ehrenthal, who was president of Rubin Reid.
On the creative side, Frank Hughes and Mark McDowell, who had been vice presidents and co-creative directors at Girgenti, Hughes, become executive creative directors of the new agency.
For now, each agency will remain in its own office in Manhattan, Girgenti, Hughes at 11 East 26th Street, and Rubin Rein at 386 Park Avenue South. Later this year, they will move into a larger, combined space at 100 Avenue of the Americas.
The deal is the latest in a series of transactions in which smaller agencies are joining forces to better meet the challenges of the continuing sluggish economy and their mega-agency competition. Other examples include the merger of Weiss, Whitten and Carroll Raj Stagliano in June to form Weiss, Whitten, Carroll, Stagliano, and the purchase in August of two agencies by Griffin Bacal Inc., which merged them to form an agency within the agency called the Business Marketing Communications Group.
On a personal note, Mr. Girgenti and Mr. Rubin said, the deal serves to reunite them: In the early 1970's, Mr. Girgenti was Mr. Rubin's client when the former was in product management for the drug division of Du Pont and the latter was at Shaller Rubin.

HEADLINE: USAir Sets Off a Round of Discount Fares

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
USAir yesterday announced discounts of 10 to 25 percent off most existing excursion fares for travel to almost all its destinations between Jan. 7 and March 31 -- usually the period of least air travel. American, United and Continental Airlines said they would match USAir, while Delta Air Lines said it is likely to do so today.
While the nonrefundable fares will not necessarily result in the lowest fares offered on each route during the last 12 months, during which Eastern Airlines cut fares extensively in a futile attempt to avoid liquidation, USAir's announcement comes when most carriers have been trying to raise fares -- or at least hold the line -- to stanch the industry's continuing losses. 
 Last year United States airlines lost almost $4 billion, the worst combined loss in history, and they have continued to lose money as a result of recession and the fallout from the Persian Gulf war.
Continental will also match the $1,100 round-trip international air fares announced by Trans World Airways yesterday, while American, United and Delta are still studying whether to do so. T.W.A. said the new fares would be discounted by at least 50 percent.
All T.W.A.'s overseas destinations are included except Cairo and Tel Aviv, and the fares are good from 88 of the 102 cities in the United States served by T.W.A. and Trans World Express. Among the gateways excluded from the T.W.A. promotion, which requires that tickets be purchased by Nov. 29 for travel through March 31, 1992, are New York, Newark, Boston, Baltimore, Philadelphia and Washington/Dulles.
"Those are already competitive markets, and we're trying to generate more international traffic from the South, the Southwest and Midwest," a T.W.A. spokesman said.
The USAir fares require a 14-day advance purchase and a Saturday night stayover, and are based on a mileage formula that includes distance and whether the destinations are peak or off-peak. Travel to southern and central Florida, Arizona, Nassau, in the Bahamas, and Colorado must be completed by Feb. 9, 1992, and tickets to those destinations must be purchased by Jan. 25. The last date to buy a ticket for most other markets is Feb. 29.
Under the new fares, the lowest offpeak excursion round-trip fare from Pittsburgh to Los Angeles will be $378, a saving of $60 over the current lowest price of $438. The round-trip saving from Boston to Washington will be $70 -- $158 compared with a current $228.
 
Discounts to Houston
 Continental's new New York to Houston round-trip fare will be $318, a 14 percent saving over the carrier's current $368 fare, and Newark to San Francisco will be $378, 24 percent less than the current $468.
American said it had not formulated its new fares, but added that the discounts it offered would be off its current lowest advance purchase fares.
While USAir's market share for the first nine months of 1991 was only 7.8 percent, compared with almost 19 percent for United, 18.8 for American and 15.3 for Delta, according to Aviation Daily, the larger carriers almost always take the position that they have to match their smaller rivals to maintain market share.
But they have not felt the same urgency to match T.W.A.'s price cuts, which are aimed largely at attracting business travelers, in part because of T.W.A.'s weakened financial condition. The carrier's market share through September 1991 amounted to less than 6.4 percent.

Overseas Buying Sends Prices Up

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
A wave of overseas buying helped to push up prices of Treasury securities yesterday. But for the most part, domestic investors remained on the sidelines.
Traders emphasized that virtually all of the price gain, amounting to nearly a point for some longer-dated issues, was achieved during overnight trading in Asian and, later, European money markets. 
 "We are basically unchanged from where we were when I came in at 7:30 this morning," a government bond trader in New York said. "There has not been much activity to speak of since then."
 
Growth Report Cited
 Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montagu Economics, said foreign demand for Treasury securities might have been stimulated by sharply lower estimates for 1992 growth in the United States released on Monday by the Organization for Econonic Cooperation and Development.
The more sober view came as a real surprise to many overseas, Mr. Fabbri said.
"I believe that the information in Europe about the United States and what is going on here lags what is actually happening," he said.
Mr. Fabbri, who was in Britain last week for several speeches, told his audiences that growth in the fourth quarter "looks meager, and the first quarter looks dangerous."
He added, "I don't think that people expected that sort of talk when they came through the door."
 
Letter From Markey
 Traders in the United States, who had Monday off in observance of Veterans Day, were reluctant to speak about the letter that Representative Edward J. Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who is the chairman of a House subcommittee on telecommunications and finance, sent to dealers late last week.
In the letter, Mr. Markey asked for information pertaining to bidding at the Treasury's three-year note auction last week.
Demand at that auction was exceptionally weak, and Mr. Markey, responding to news reports that the auction represented a protest by dealers against new Treasury bidding rules, said he was seeking to determine if those accounts were valid.
Heather L. Ruth, the president of the Public Securities Association, an industry group, said that "in conversations with our members, market conditions at the time of the three-year were uncertain, but not because of the rule changes, and not because of a dealer protest, which I don't believe occurred."
Ms. Ruth said failure of the Federal Reserve Board to cut its discount rate on Nov. 5, the date of the three-year auction, and very low short-term interest rates were the primary causes for weak demand at the auction.
The decline in short-term rates that occurred after the Fed cut the discount rate on Nov. 6 was reflected at yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills. The securities were sold at the lowest interest rates since April 1977.
 
3-Month Bills at 4.64%
Three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 4.64 percent, down from an average rate of 4.74 at last week's auction. It is the lowest three-month bill rate since April 25, 1977, when it was 4.518 percent.
Bids on the new six-month bills produced an average discount rate of 4.71 percent, compared with an average rate of 4.80 percent a week ago. It is the lowest rate on a new six-month bill since the auction of April 18, 1977, when the average rate was 4.708 percent.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 103 14/32, up by 30/32, to yield 7.82 percent, compared with 7.90 percent late Friday.
Prices of issues sold by the Treasury at last week's refunding auctions continued to advance.
For example, the new 7.50 percent 10-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis late yesterday at a price to yield 7.34 percent, down from 7.40 percent on Monday.
Among secondary Treasury note issues, the 6 7/8 percent five-year notes were offered at 101 1/32, up by an eighth of a point, to yield 6.62 percent. And the 6 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 22/32, down by 1/ 32, to yield 5.62 percent.
 
Many New Debt Issues
 Corporations responded to the continued decline in interest rates by pricing a huge volume of new debt issues.
Yesterday, 10 companies offered more than $2 billion in asset-backed securities and more conventional debt obligations.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of new three-month and six-month Treasury bills:
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Growth Seen

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 12

 BODY:
The trade deficit, which has been improving for the last four years, will worsen next year as sluggish world demand dampens American export growth, the Bush Administration said today.
The statement by Treasury Under Secretary David Mulford, was the first public estimate of next year's trade deficit by the Adminitration. 
 Mr. Mulford, testifying to Congress on the Administration's semiannual trade and exchange rate report, said that the merchandise trade deficit was likely to widen by between $5 billion and $10 billion next year.
Mr. Mulford said the Administration expected this year's deficit to drop to $65 billion. That forecast, which is in line with private economists' expectations, would be down from last year's $101.7 billion deficit and be below $100 million for the first time since 1984.
The Treasury report noted with concern that trade imbalances are rising again in Japan. The deficit with Japan is likely to account for two- thirds of America's total imbalance this year.
While the total American trade deficit is expected to fall by 36 percent this year, the deficit with Japan is expected to show little if any improvement.

HEADLINE: Dow Rises 11.85, Closing At 3,054.11

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks rose smartly in active trading yesterday, with a firm bond market underpinning gains in equities. A number of indexes reached new record highs, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 11.85 points, to 3,054.11.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks, a measure of blue-chip activity, rose by 3.62, to a new high of 396.74, surpassing the old record of 396.64 set on Aug. 28. Trading on the American Stock Exchange moved the index up by 1.13 points, to 392.37. 
 Record highs were also set by the Nasdaq index of over-the-counter issues, which rose by 4.97, to 555.68, and by the Russell 2,000 index of small stocks, which rose by 1.23 points, to 188.02.
The Nasdaq and the Russell indexes have now hit new highs in four straight trading sessions.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy at 199.5 million, with the Big Board's composite index up 1.93, to 219.00. Monday's volume was 129.1 million. Advancing issues outpaced declining ones yesterday, 1,092 to 595.
Anthony Ludovici, the senior vice president and senior investment analyst at Tucker Anthony, said that yesterday's performance was impressive, with a cross section of the large stocks and broad market moving together. "And if it we get an economic recovery in 1992, the basic industry stocks will be in the vanguard," he said.
"Secondary and speculative issues that have been strong this year hopefully will not fade in a recovery," Mr. Ludovici added.
 
7 of 10 Big Stocks Up
 Birinyi Associates, which tracks program trading, reported that in yesterday's market, 7 out of 10 of the largest-capitalization stocks listed on the S.& P. 500 were up, confirming that the rally was led by the bigger issues. They also noted that the nearly 2-to-1 ratio of gainers over losers was in line with a broad base involvement.
In trading yesterday, analysts said Travelers had signed an agreement to sell all the stock in its New York-based investment banking unit, Dillon, Read, to Dillon's managers and the British merchant bank Barings P.L.C. The price was $122 million, and Travelers's stock rose 1/4, to 20 1/4.
In an announcement after the market closed on Monday, Tektronix, which manufactures electronic equipment, said its second-quarter results would be about 30 percent below results a year ago, as well as under all Wall Street's estimates.
Yesterday, the stock fell 3 3/4, to 17. The company said it had cut more than half its work force over the last 10 years and it saw very little fat that could be trimmed further.
Environmnetal Systems, which said on Monday that it had received a $16-a-share offer from Bramble Industries of Australia, fell 1/4, to 15 3/4.
The American depository receipts of British Airways, which are traded on the Big Board, rose sharply yesterday after the airline reported higher-than-expected earnings for the first half of the year. The receipts rose 3 5/8, to 39 1/8, a 52-week high.
Because of the increasing likelihood that McDonnell Douglas will find an Asian partner for its commercial jetliner business, traders said, Judith Bollinger, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs, raised her rating to a "buy" from a "hold." They noted that she had raised her 1992 earnings estimates, as the stock rose 4 5/8, to 77.
At a meeting in New York yesterday, Nucor, a steel-products company, told analysts that it expected its fourth-quarter earnings to be higher than the 72 cents a share it reported in the third quarter. Most analysts had been expecting results that were flat to slightly higher.
Nucor's stock rose 1 1/2, to 80 5/8, as analysts also noted that several new plants were ahead of schedule.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Pawnshops Shed Their Dingy Image

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG

 BODY:
With unemployment up and bank credit tight, more Americans are having difficulty getting loans. Consider then what Wall Street analysts are calling a superb bet on hard times: investing in stockholder-owned pawnshops.
Although pawnshop customers have traditionally been hourly workers whose low wages disqualified them from bank loans, more middle-income consumers, facing layoffs or salary cuts, are turning to them. 
 The rising demand for pawn loans might itself make an investment in a publicly held chain like Cash America Investments Inc., the industry leader, appealing. But what has piqued analysts' interest is the economics of the business. Because the usury ceilings governing pawn shops are typically much more liberal than for other lending operations, pawn operators can often charge annualized interest rates well into the triple digits.
 
A No-Loss Situation
 And because the collateral that customers post -- from electric guitars to jewelry to firearms -- is typically worth twice what is lent, a pawn operator has to work to lose money. An added bonus is that unlike banks, which must repossess collateral, pawn operators hold goods until a borrower repays. The merchandise on display represents forfeited collateral and is typically sold for a hefty profit.
"They make 20 percent gross profit on defaulted loans and 205 percent interest" on loans repaid, said Steven Kent, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs who specializes in emerging growth companies.
In recent years, however, the pawn industry has been consolidating. Although it continues to be dominated by thousands of small operators, the business has a number of larger concerns that because of their size have the money to make their stores larger, lighter and brighter. The new pawnshops more closely resemble the showrooms of major catalogue retailers than the traditional shabby storefronts. These big pawnbrokers can also make more loans and achieve economies of scale.
Besides Cash America, based in Fort Worth, the publicly held chains include Ezcorp, Express Cash International and First Cash, all also based in Texas., and U.S. Pawn Inc. of Denver.
 
The Top Attraction
 But Cash America is attracting the most attention on Wall Street. Not only is Cash America's network of more than 150 pawnshops in eight states the largest in the industry, but it is also one of the most sophisticated pawn operators, having recently installed a new computer system to track merchandise inventory levels and borrowers' repayment histories.
Believing that Cash America's expansion and modernization will generate double-digit earnings growth, Dennis C. Van Zelfden, an analyst with Rauscher Pierce Refsnes, recently issued a "buy" recomendation. Although the company's shares slipped 12.5 cents, to $19.125, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. many analysts see the stock rising to the mid-20's over the next year.
"What we're talking about is applying modern management techniques to an industry that has not had the capital to apply those techniques, let alone expand," Mr. Van Zelfden said of Cash America. "I see continued, fairly stable 20 percent annual earnings growth."
 
'Stronger Balance Sheet'
 David H. Hochstim of Bear, Stearns is another analyst looking closely at Cash America. Although he has not yet made a recommendation, Mr. Hochstim said Cash America "has a stronger balance sheet than the typical individual pawn operator who lends less than the market will bear because of his or her personal financial situation."
Mr. Van Zelfden is also recommending Ezcorp, No. 2 in the industry with more than 50 stores, all in Texas. Because it is starting from a smaller base than Cash America, Ezcorp is growing faster, with the number of Ezcorp pawnshops expected to triple in two years. Mr. Van Zelfden is also impressed by Ezcorp's management-training program, which trains prospective pawnbrokers to evaluate pawned merchandise and to run Ezcorp's point-of-sale inventory-tracking system.
Trading over-the-counter, Ezcorp could also be a $25 stock in two years, Mr. Van Zelfden said. It gained 62.5 cents yesterday, to $14.75.
"Ezcorp is what Cash America was three years ago," Mr. Van Zelfden added,
The pawnshop business does have risks. Laws limiting the interest rates have been on the books for years in most cases, so it is unlikely that the limits will be lowered significantly. But a number of states have tightened licensing requirements for pawn operators, which could drive up acquisition costs for the big operators by reducing the number of shops for sale.
Additionally, pawnshops always run the risk of accepting stolen merchandise. Mr. Van Zelfden, who recently wrote a long report on pawnshops, said Ezcorp was currently facing investigations at two of its shops in connection with stolen goods. Finally, because a new pawnshop can be opened for less than $175,000, the industry could attract a slew of new competitors, leading to more risky lending on everyone's part and lower profits.
For now, most analysts remain bullish on the industry, particularly Cash America, which they say has a significant lead over any rivals. And while worsening economic sluggishness could lead to more borrowers' defaulting on their pawnshop obligations, any increase in default rates could be offset by sharply higher demand for loans.
"Pawnshops don't necessarily benefit during a recession," Mr. Kent of Goldman, Sachs said, "but they can remain successful during hard times."

HEADLINE: A New Discipline in Economics Brings Change to Latin America

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile

 BODY:
Suddenly, a look at the economic map of Latin America shows a startling change. After a decade of no growth, crippling inflation, rising foreign debt, protectionism and bloated state payrolls, governments -- at least for now -- have found a new economic religion.
Balanced budgets are in, as is privatization, the buzzword for selling off government enterprises. Negotiations to reduce foreign debt have been successful in some countries, especially Mexico, and are continuing in others. Stabilization and discipline have become winning political slogans. The free market, open economies and deregulation are now part of the vocabulary of taxi drivers and laborers. 
 In Latin American cities there are signs of change everywhere.
In Concepcion, 200 miles south of here, three new paper plants costing more than $1.3 billion are opening. In Buenos Aires, the Park Plaza Hotel is overrun with investment bankers from New York, London, Bonn and Paris looking for deals. In Lima, adventurous business executives talk with the Peruvian Government about its plans to sell off state-run enterprises.
 
'Committed to Free Enterprise'
 "We have a country committed to free enterprise, where there are established rules, a central bank you can deal with and zero bribery," said Vincent A. Russo, general manager of Santa Fe Forestal y Industria, a $460 million pulp plant in Nacimiento, Chile, that is owned by Shell Oil, Scott Paper and Citicorp. "There's not a lot more you can ask for."
Driving this new-found optimism and economic activity are profound policy changes that run from the Rio Grande to Tierra del Fuego. The new consensus says that inflation is bad, particularly for the poor, that governments do not know how to run businesses, that printing money is political suicide and that tax evasion, a time-honored sport here, should be punished severely.
Also, in the face of democracy's growing popularity, Marxism has all but disappeared. All of Latin America, except for Cuba and Haiti, have democratically elected governments. In early 1979, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay were all run by military dictatorships. Military governments -- except in Chile -- have been unable to run stable economies. Huge amounts of unpaid debt borrowed over the last decade or so underscore the insolvency of those governments and their inability to meet social needs. Now, the only alternative seems to be to generate jobs through internal growth.
There has been a psychological lift for several countries, including Mexico and Venezuela, from the Bush Administration's debt reduction plan. Especially in Mexico, the negotiation of a successful debt plan lowered the level and cost of billions of dollars in foreign commercial bank loans and eased the economic burden on a new Mexican administration. With the added imprimatur of aid from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, a successful debt reduction agreement has made Mexico and some other countries more attractive to foreign investors.
Even though both Argentina and Brazil have yet to frame a debt reduction agreement, the mere prospect of one has been a spur to foreign investor interest.
 
Country by Country
 In Argentina, President Carlos Saul Menem has announced a vast deregulation of his country's economy, reversing decades of protection for industries. In Chile, a prospering free-market economy generated by Gen. August Pinochet, who stepped down from office 18 months ago, has been maintained by a coalition of his successors. In Bolivia, the poorest country on the continent, a general and his leftist opponent have teamed up to impose tight monetary discipline and promote growth. And even in Peru, long plagued by poverty, President Alberto Fujimori has instituted a severe package of economic restrictions that are unpopular but accepted as necessary.
In the last two months three respected organizations -- the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Development and the United Nations -- have all issued cautious reports predicting a new era of vigorous, through sporadic, economic growth.
But none of these new policies have been able to wipe out poverty. In 1980, 40 percent of the Latin American population was considered living in poverty. By last year, that had risen to 44 percent. In Peru, where the minimum wage is $50 a month, 90 percent of the people are considered to be either unemployed or underemployed. In Chile, five million people, or a third of its population, is considered to live in poverty.
What astounds economists and analysts is that the tough economic medicine continues to be popularly supported even though it has resulted in large government layoffs, a precipitous drop in the buying power of the average citizen and less spending on public needs like housing, water and electricity. In both Mexico and Argentina the incumbent political parties won large midterm elections because of economic stability.
 
Brazil Plans Frustrated
 Brazil is the only country still struggling to produce a plan to stop perennial inflation. President Fernando Collor de Mello has been frustrated by an opposition Congress and has failed to persuade the public that with the dole and a relaxed life on the beach, Brazil will remain in the past.
In other Latin nations, results are more impressive. In Chile, inflation is under 20 percent and foreign investment this year, at $3 billion, is triple what it was in 1990. Mexico will record 20 percent inflation for the third year in a row, and its economy will grow close to 5 percent. Venezuela, an oil importer that benefited from last year's oil run-up, has scored 10 percent growth so far this year, with higher levels of inflation, around 35 percent, but far less than the 90 percent inflation in 1989. Argentina, after 1,000 percent inflation in 1990 and 6,000 percent in 1989, imposed a stringent economic policy earlier this year, and has had an annual inflation rate of less than 20 percent in the last three months. Colombia is also generating about 20 percent inflation and 2.2 percent growth.
The new governments defy old Latin stereotypes. Parties that promoted highly nationalistic, isolationist policies in the past, like President Menem's Peronist Party in Argentina, are now seeking friendship with the United States for economic and political reasons.
"We can't wait for anybody to help other than ourselves," said Oscar Imbellone, president of CPC International in Buenos Aires. "We need to use our own management know-how, capitalist structure, innovation and research and development. We have to do the things all civilized countries do."
 
A Risky Game
 Still, politicians know they are playing a risky game -- just how long will people endure the pain of unemployment for the sake of future prosperity? That worry has generated efforts to add some social spending to the economic plans, without risking their effectiveness. Chile has doubled business taxes to 10 percent, and used the new funds on education, medical care and housing.
"The thinking here is that there will be stability as long as the poor see the Government is making an effort," said Oscar Altimir, director of the Economic Development division in the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, based in Santiago.
But while the rich continue to get richer, the gap between them and the middle and lower classes widens.
In Bogota, Colombia, Pilar Barco, a language professor, and her husband, Francisco Garcia, a fine arts professor and commercial artist, together make about $500 a month, which is four times the minimum wage, "and still we never buy clothes and we live a minimum existence," she said.
One response in the attempt to spur economies is to get government out of business and privatize everything from state oil companies to railroads to park maintenance, with the hope of creating an industrial sector that generates jobs.
Chile was long the leader of the privatization movement under General Pinochet. More recently, Mexico has led the way with the privatization of its telephone company, which raised $2.3 billion in foreign capital from a stock sale. Some countries seem in a race to privatize before the public gets tired of seeing its patrimony on the auction block. President Menem of Argentina has ordered his Economy Minister to finish all such sales in 1992.
A second self-help response is the formation of alliances aimed at creating more competitive economies. Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay are trying to create a free-trade zone by 1994 called Mercosur. Mexico and Chile have signed a free-trade agreement. Colombia and Venezuela are trying to integrate their economies. And everyone is looking to the negotiations between Mexico and the United States on a free-trade agreement.
"When they sign that, we are going to be the next ones knocking at the door," said Guido Di Tella, Argentina's Foreign Minister.
 
Spillover Is Feared
 In all this, the trouble spot is still Brazil, a vast country of 125 million people, the largest debtor in Latin America and so large that troubles there will always threaten to spill into other countries.
While President Collor de Mello was easily elected in 1990, and seemed poised to revamp the economy, he has failed so far. A bank account freeze followed by wage and price controls eventually collapsed. Recent attempts to privatize the state's crown jewel, a big steel plant, were nearly undone by protesting union workers.
Since then, a loss of confidence in the President has pushed the country close to hyperinflation. Late last month, for example, the cruziero fell 10 percent in one day against the dollar.
Latin businessmen, who have kept some $170 billion outside their home countries for years, are beginning to bring some money home. Some are taking advantage of higher dollar interest rates, but much of the money is for long-term investment.
Latin countries are also devising ways to raise capital. Eduardo Stern, vice president of Chile's newest and largest ski resort, Valle Nevado, is trying to get Government approval to allow pension fund managers -- by law restricted in the types of investments they can make -- to invest in a new hotel. "I dreamed of this project from my youth, but no way was it possible then," Mr. Stern said. "This type of transaction is proof this country has changed."

THE LEADERS
 ARGENTINA: Efforts to stabilize currency, toughen tax collection and stop printing money to cover the deficits have cut inflation and given Argentina reputation as the next emerging economy. President Carlos Saul Menem, using executive power, has decreed the deregulation of almost all industry. Now seeking to renegotiate $60 billion debt.
 CHILE: The new Government retained most open-market policies left by General Augusto Pinochet, but has raised some taxes for social programs. After bout with inflation in 1990, the central bank has restricted money growth. Foreign investment pouring in.
 COLOMBIA: Years of sound money and fiscal policies have made this country one of the continent's most stable. Broad reductions in tariff barriers have forced protected industries to compete or close. Austerity has limited domestic growth and consumer demand. Also, the continued flow of drug dollars has stymied real industrial development and fight against drug trafficking has drained resources.
 MEXICO: The three-year-old Government of Carlos Salinas de Gortari has sold off 150 state-owned companies in an aggressive privatization program, stabilizing the economy and resulting in almost $7 billion in foreign capital this year.
 VENEZUELA: A cut in taxes and tariffs by President Carlos Andres Perez returned economy to growth last year after a drop of 8 percent in 1989. The Gulf crisis and th rise in oil prices also helped, but added to Venezuela's perennial problem of excessive inflation.
 
THE LAGGARDS
 BRAZIL: The Latin American giant is struggling to end the days of excessive state employment and the habit of paying for government deficits by printing money. A freeze on bank accounts and wage and price control failed to halt inflation. A privatization program is struggling. Loss of confidence in President Fernando Collor dePello could cause severe inflation.
 PERU: Despite tight monetary controls, a refusal to raise Government salaries, layoffs of thousands of workers and broad deregulation, Peru is still struggling with recession, which is worsened by terrorism and drug trafficking. President Alberto Fujimori trying to gain investor confidence by settling disputes with three U.S. companies.

HEADLINE: Favored Credit Card Holders Quietly Given Lower Rates

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Banks are reducing the interest rates they charge on credit cards for some customers, but many bankers would just as soon not advertise it.
The rates are going down as the banks try to keep their best customers, many of whom have wondered why the interest rates on their bank cards had not fallen along with the prime rate, mortgage rates or the interest they receive on deposits. Frustrated by the stubbornly high rates, card holders have been doing comparison shopping for the best credit card deals and have been turning in their costliest cards. 
 The First National Bank of Chicago, Banc One of Columbus, Ohio, and a growing number of other banks now offer cards with annual interest rates of about 14 percent, far below the 19.8 percent that has been the standard at the largest banks for years.
 
Higher Annual Fees
 The availability of the lower rates is often jumbled, and sometimes the price of a rate cut is a higher annual fee. Many small banks that offer lower-rate cards do not advertise them outside their local market, while the largest banks that do advertise widely are trying to stick with higher-rate cards. Some banks are trumpeting lower rates to snare more customers, while others, like Citibank and First National of Chicago, are granting the lower rates only to their most creditworthy customers. First National is not taking any applications for the lower-rate cards and is not advertising them.
As the lucrative credit card business attracts new competitors each year, from the Universal Card issued by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company to ones affiliated with the likes of the Ford Motor Company, banks face growing competition in a market already saturated with cards.
Many new rivals have tried to make their cards more attractive to consumers by touting no annual fees, or low fees, discount-buying programs and slightly lower interest rates.
And if competition was not enough, bankers are feeling increased pressure from Washington. Just yesterday, President Bush, noting the declines in other interest rates, said, "I'd frankly like to see the credit card rates down."
In New York for a $1,000-a-plate Republican fund-raising luncheon, Mr. Bush said lower credit card rates could help the economy by encouraging more consumer spending. Until now, the strongest criticism in Washington of high credit card rates had come from Democratic members of Congress like Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn and Joseph P. Kennedy 2d of Massachusetts.
"A little over a year ago, our consumer research showed growing interest for lower-rate cards," said Ray S. Costner, a senior vice president of the Wachovia Corporation, a big banking company in Winston-Salem, N.C. Wachovia currently offers three types of cards, including one that charges the prime lending rate plus 2.9 percentage points, or 10.4 percent -- but a higher-than-usual fee of $39.
Mr. Costner added, "We think a lot of people are coming to realize that they had too darn many credit cards, and are deciding to keep just one or two instead of four or five."
David Robertson, vice president of the Nilson Report, a newsletter for the credit card industry, said some banks were losing more than 10 percent of their customers annually to cards offered by competitors. "Many large banks are suffering because the rate at which they are losing customers has nearly doubled," he said.
"The banks can make money at lower interest rates," Mr. Robertson added. "They just can't offer the lower rates to everybody." He noted that it was now much cheaper for banks to keep good customers by lowering rates than it was to replace them by advertising for new customers or buying the credit card businesses of other banks.
 
Increased Losses
 Bankers have said they need to keep rates high to compensate for increased losses from defaults during the recession. Losses are running at about 5 percent of all card loans this year, up from 3.8 percent last year, according to the Nilson Report.
Because banks are loath to give up more of their highly profitable card business than necessary, the low-rate cards are not being offered to all customers. In Chicago, First National selected its best customers -- those with the lowest risk of default and who frequently pay interest on the cards -- and notified them of the lower rate a few weeks ago. The bank, the nation's sixth-largest issuer of credit cards, did not announce its action, but it was reported by American Banker, a trade newspaper.
First National reduced the rate for its best customers to the prime rate plus 6.9 percent, or 14.4 percent, down three percentage points from its previous rate. The prime rate, which is currently 7 1/2 percent, is set by banks as a benchmark for various consumer and business loan rates.
Many other major banks have been adopting lower rates as an option. Bank One Wisconsin of Milwaukee recently announced a 13.9 percent rate for existing and new customers to replace its old 18 percent rate.
In North Carolina, the credit card affiliates of the two largest local banking companies, Wachovia and the NCNB Corporation, each announced lower interest rates this year. They report a strong consumer response.
Since the Federal Government phased out the deductions for credit card interest payments, which were completely eliminated last year, consumers have become more careful shoppers when it comes to credit cards and interest charges.
"Consumer awareness of credit cards is at an all-time high," said Robert B. McKinley, president of RAM Research, a Frederick, Md., firm that publishes newsletters about the card industry for consumers and bankers.
Fleet Bank of Massachusetts, which is owned by Fleet/Norstar Financial Group of Providence, R.I., offered a new card in September -- with no annual fee -- to all customers. The card carries an interest rate of 12 percent for cash advances, but 17.9 percent for purchases.
The bank had been charging 17.9 percent for both cash and purchases. The lower rate was intended to attract customers who could borrow from Fleet to pay off other cards charging higher rates.
John A. Russell, a vice president of Banc One, said there was enough variation in consumer preferences that Banc One was experimenting with more than 10 types of credit cards, which have different mixes of interset rates and fees.
Besides the 13.9 percent rate Banc One offers nationally through its bank in Wisconsin, it also has cards that charge an 18 percent rate. And it has cards with a credit line tied to a second mortgage on the card holder's home, offering interest rates as low as half a percentage point above the prime rate, or 8 percent.
In addition to the card that is currently charging 10.4 percent, Wachovia offers a 14.98 percent card with a $25 fee and a 17.98 percent card with a $15 fee. The bank says it freely lets customers apply for any of the cards and to switch from card to card.
The continued dominance of the 19.8 percent rate "is not a case of price gouging," said Scott P. Marks, president of F.C.C. National Bank, the credit card affiliate of First National of Chicago. He noted that some of the bank's customers had benefited from falling interest rates because their cards were pegged to the prime lending rate. "There are 6,000 different issuers of cards in the country," he said. "It's a free market where there is room for lots of variety."

HEADLINE: Kissinger Firm Denies Reports of B.C.C.I. Link

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 12

 BODY:
A senior associate of Kissinger Associates Inc. has denied a report in The Boston Globe that Henry A. Kissinger recommended that the Bank of Credit and Commerce International hire a Washington firm to initiate a "public relations offensive" a day after the bank was indicted on charges of money laundering.
The Globe said it based its account on B.C.C.I. documents it had obtained.
Alan Stoga, senior associate of the New York-based economic consulting firm, said Monday in a telephone interview that "Henry never met or talked with them," and that nobody in his firm gave B.C.C.I. that advice. 
 "They approached us in the fall of '88," Mr. Stoga said. "We considered it and had some conversations, and in the end, in early January '89, we said 'no, we're not interested.'
 
Millions for Influence
 "We were never employed by them, and we are not in the habit of giving free advice."
B.C.C.I.'s wooing of Kissinger Associates was consistent with the bank's policy of spending millions around the world in efforts to influence government policy by enlisting powerful present, former and future government officials.
Mr. Kissinger, chairman of the firm, served as both Secretary of State and national security adviser in the Nixon Administration, and two of his firm's principals joined the Bush Administration in early 1989. Lawrence S. Eagleburger, formerly president of the firm, who was a top national security aide to Mr. Kissinger, is now Deputy Secretary of State. Brent Scowcroft, who was the firm's vice president and was President Gerald Ford's national security adviser, now has that same role in the Bush White House.
The documents reported by The Globe include a letter, dated Oct. 7, 1988, from Mr. Stoga to Abol Fazl Helmy, head of the bank's New York office, saying, "I enjoyed lunch yesterday and, even more, your suggestion that B.C.C.I. might be interested in developing a relationship with Kissinger Associates." With the letter, Mr. Stoga enclosed biographical sketches of the principals of Kissinger Associates, and said that "I am reluctant to be more specific, at least on paper, about the kinds of consulting projects we undertake for clients."
 
After the Indictment
 A day after the bank was indicted in Tampa, Fla., on Oct. 11, 1988, Mr. Helmy wrote Swaleh Naqvi, a high B.C.C.I. executive, that "I received a call today from Mr. Stoga, who informed me that Dr. Kissinger recommends that a public relations offensive be made by us and in that context has suggested using Burson-Marsteller, a highly reputable public relations firm that successfully dealt with the First Chicago crises last year." He continued, "Kissinger Associates Inc., have indicated that they shall be happy to use their personal contacts with the firm and make the necessary recommendations."
Mr. Stoga acknowledged sending the Oct. 7 letter but denied ever saying that Mr. Kissinger had recommended a public relations offensive or that it be handled by Burson-Marsteller.
Gary Auxier, executive vice president in Burson-Marsteller's office, said in a telephone interview that his firm did not represent B.C.C.I. and that "as far as I know, we were never approached."

HEADLINE: MOSCOW AID PLAN DYING IN CONGRESS

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 12

 BODY:
A plan to divert up to $1 billion from the Pentagon budget to aid the Soviet Union appeared all but dead today, the victim of political miscalculations by two of the most powerful lawmakers in Congress and a growing public perception that Washington is putting foreign aid ahead of domestic problems.
Efforts to salvage the Soviet proposal, which seemed headed for approval two weeks ago, were virtually exhausted today as the Bush Administration failed to offer a public endorsement of the plan. Democratic leaders in Congress had said that without that public support from the White House, they would drop the proposal rather than bear the political heat alone. 
 The House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley, said today that he expected the proposal to be "postponed," clearing the way for final passage of the Pentagon's $291 billion budget bill for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
 
Colleagues Not Fully Consulted
 Representative Les Aspin of Wisconsin and Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, the plan's main architects and usually among the most astute deal makers and power brokers in Washington, did not fully consult with Democratic colleagues until the last minute. More importantly, they evidently failed to anticipate the storm of bipartisan criticism against retraining Soviet officers, among other things, when Americans were homeless and out of work.
The demise of the Soviet aid plan is a rare political embarrassment for Mr. Nunn and Mr. Aspin, both Democrats. Mr. Nunn is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee; Mr. Aspin leads the corresponding committee in the House.
Although both contended that United States security would be enhanced by using $1 billion to help the Soviet Union avoid further political instability and keep control of its 30,000 nuclear weapons, they never showed that the plan could lead to direct financial savings for Washington.
 
'A Down Payment
 "I look at this as a down payment on greater savings, but those savings are only really possible if the reform elements stay in power in the Soviet Union and continue to unwind their military-industrial complex," Mr. Aspin said.
The idea was condemned, and eventually undone, by legislators from both parties who argued that any money the Pentagon could spare should be spent in the United States. Opposition to the plan gained strength after last week's elections, particularly the Pennsylvania Senate race in which the Republican candidate and heavy favorite, former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, was upset by Harris Wofford, a Democrat who called for tackling domestic problems.
"It was very unfortunately caught up in a very, very bad time," Mr. Aspin said in an interview. "It was at a time when Democrats saw a nice opening to take on Bush for having too much priority on foreign policy and not enough domestic policy, but the Republicans did not want to be caught up in that."
In a desperation move last Thursday, Democratic supporters in the House and the Senate frantically tried to shift responsibility for the plan's fate to the Administration, with Senator Nunn complaining that the proposal had received "tepid and ineffectual White House support."
"It's too bad we can't get out in front of problems for a change," Mr. Nunn said in an interview today, warning against the spread of Soviet weapons around the world. "We're facing the breakout of the largest arsenal in the world, and people in economic distress will be selling things."
But the effort to defuse Republican opposition in Congress and give Democrats political cover to support the measure failed. Democrats ended up singed by the same fire they have used to brand Mr. Bush as a leader more interested in global summit meetings than unemployment.
Coming only days after the failed Soviet coup in August, Mr. Aspin's idea initially appeared to have some appeal: Transfer up to a $1 billion from the Pentagon budget for humanitarian aid to the Soviet Union, and help avert chaos in a splintering nation that has more than 30,000 nuclear weapons.
Beginning in early September, Mr. Aspin and Mr. Nunn quietly worked with a small group of staff members to build on Mr. Aspin's original idea to forge a relief package that would also clean up environmental damage caused by Soviet weapons plants and subsidize American businesses that invested in Soviet military conversion to civilian industries.
 
Scowcroft Backed Idea
 The two lawmakers also consulted with senior Administration officials, including Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, who privately endorsed the proposal.
As envisioned by the lawmakers, the plan would use Air Force planes to transport food and medical aid to the Soviet people this winter. It also suggested giving American companies economic incentives to invest in Soviet defense industries that converted to commericial businesses, and earmarkeding money for a joint United States-Soviet program to destroy nuclear and chemical weapons in the Soviet Union.
By late October, even Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who called Mr. Aspin's original idea "a serious mistake," was grudgingly won over, but only on the condition that the Pentagon had the authority to make the budget cuts and to decide how the money would be spent on the Soviets.
Supporters of the measure sought to include the Soviet aid plan in a compromise military budget bill that House and Senate negotiators had been working on since early September. Since the House and the Senate had approved conflicting military budgets before the abortive coup, the aid plan was not considered in the normal budget authorizing process. Lawmakers on the negotiating teams did not see final details of the aid plan until Mr. Nunn and Mr. Aspin tried on Oct. 31 to wrap up the conference committee's last outstanding issues.
Initially, Senate Republicans balked, but the uproar quickly spread to Democrats in both chambers.
"I was not consulted and I felt I should have been," said Representative Earl Hutto, a Florida Democrat who heads the House Armed Services subcommittee on military readiness.
Mr. Aspin said today it was "hard to have full consultation" when the measure was included in neither House or Senate version.
By early last week, the measure had also drawn criticism that it infringed on the prerogatives of the Congressional committees normally responsible for foreign aid.
"It ought to run through the regular authorization process," Representative Dante B. Fascell, a Florida Democrat who heads the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in an interview.
By late last week, voices like those of Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, were rare. "An opportunity comes along every few decades to reduce the threats to our security interests," Mr. Levin said in an interview. "This is not a gift to the Russians. If a relatively small expenditure can reduce the number of missiles and nuclear weapons floating around the Soviet Union, the American people's security is advanced."

HEADLINE: AGREEMENT IS NEAR ON MEASURE TO AID LONG-TERM JOBLESS

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 12

 BODY:
Lawmakers from both parties and the Bush Administration moved to the brink of an agreement today on legislation to provide up to 20 weeks of additional unemployment benefits for about three million Americans out of work at least half a year.
The $5.1 billion plan is intended to pay for itself. And it seems likely to end more than three months of partisan arguments over how to aid the long-term jobless who have been unable to find employment in the continuing economic downturn. 
 "We have the makings of a deal" if the numbers add up, said Representative Robert H. Michel, the House Republican leader.
 
A Case Against Bush
 The Illinois Republican, who estimated the measure's cost at "$5.1 billion or so," said the Labor Department was analyzing the figures to make sure the benefits did not cost more than the bill would raise in revenue.
Since the Democrats began pushing the legislation in July, the issue of unemployment benefits appears to have helped them make a case against President Bush, who has all but announced his plans to run for President again in 1992, as interested only in foreign affairs and unconcerned about suffering Americans.
But continued delays in agreeing to a bill appear to be blunting that advantage. And even as White House aides were working on the benefits bill in Washington, Mr. Bush was in New York lashing out at Democrats, whom he referred to as "liberals," and what he said was their yearning to raise taxes. [Page A20.]
 
'It's About Time'
 Representative Thomas J. Downey, the Long Island Democrat who has been the leading House sponsor of the legislation, said tonight that if agreement was reached, "It's about time."
"The only winners in all of this will be the three million who have been waiting for a lot longer than they needed to for us to get our act together," he added.
House leaders said that if an agreement could be reached that would bring the measure substantial backing from Republicans, this bill might be quickly adopted by the House and the Senate. Mr. Michel said he hoped the bill could be sent to the White House by the end of the week.
Unlike two previous versions of the measure, which President Bush killed in August and October after contending they would raise the deficit, this bill is intended to pay for itself. It would increase estimated tax payments by some high-income taxpayers, continue deducting payments on unpaid student loans from tax refunds, and continue in 1996 a two-tenths of one percent surcharge on unemployment taxes paid by employers.
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate Republican leader, said he was optimistic that the costs could be matched to the benefits. He and Mr. Michel met with Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Treasury SecretaryNicholas F. Brady, after Mr. Michel had the plan laid out for him by Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
"We're getting close enough that with a little more work we'll get there," Mr. Darman said.
The Senate Democrats did not appear deeply involved in the political equation today. Senators George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, and Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, who is chairman of the Finance Committee, argued at their party caucus today for a bill they offered last week that would offer Mr. Bush three ways to pay for benefits. But one senator said there was considerable criticism of that proposal at the caucus.
The Mitchell measure would give Mr. Bush the choice of paying for benefits by increasing the deficit, holding down foreign aid or using a method to finance the benefits similar to the one in the latest House bill.
 
A Temporary Measure
 The measure proposed by Mr. Rostenkowski, which would expire next August, would supplant an existing program of extended benefits whose terms are so stringent that even though the national unemployment rate was 6.8 percent in October, no workers in any state now qualify for benefits. Ordinary jobless benefits, which average $170 per week and cover about half of all workers, are limited to 26 weeks in most states.
No written summary or detailed briefing on the measure was offered by any of its advocates tonight. But Mr. Michel, Mr. Downey and various aides discussed it generally.
They said it would provide up to 20 weeks of extended unemployment benefits for workers in states with the highest unemployment rates. Jobless workers in a second tier of states, including New York and California, the nation's two largest states, would be eligible for 13 weeks of benefits. In all other states, long-term jobless workers would qualify for 6 weeks.
In about 32 states, Mr. Downey said, workers who had exhausted their unemployment benefits since March 1 and were still unemployed would be eligible for whatever level of benefits was allowed newly unemployed workers in their states.
The formulas by which different states would fit into different categories were not made public.
 
Arguments Ahead?
 The financing provisions in the bill were also not outlined in detail, and may face some arguments in the Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday, especially from Republicans there. But Mr. Michel said the Republicans who objected "are going to basically have to back off."
Lawmakers and aides did describe the bill's financial provisions in general terms:
The extension of the surtax on employers' unemployment tax contributions would bring in $900 million. The student loan withholding provision would raise $1.7 billion.
Another $2.6 billion would be raised by a change in the rules for estimating income tax. Most taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes of $75,000 or more whose income increases by $30,000 or more would be required to estimate their tax and make quarterly payments on the basis of the increased income. Under current law, they can estimate their tax based on the previous year's taxes, and then pay the balance on April 15 of the following year. This change would be a one-time bonus for the Treasury.
The bill would also put people who leave the military on an equal footing with people who leave civilian jobs. Ex-servicemen and women would be eligible for 26 weeks of benefits, instead of the current 13, and would be able to start collecting after one week, instead of the current four.

HEADLINE: Transit Agency Asks $1.40 Fare Or a Rise in Subway and Bus Aid

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
The New York City Transit Authority set the stage yesterday for what officials say is an inevitable increase in the subway and bus fare in January, and then began haggling with legislative leaders over how much the fare would go up.
The authority formally recommended a rise of 25 cents, to $1.40, but at the same time said the increase could be smaller if the state agreed to provide additional subsidies. 
 The announcement served to alert the riding public that the days of the $1.15 fare -- adopted two years ago -- were numbered and to pressure city and state officials for additional help.
 
At Least a Dime on Jan. 1
 The Transit Authority had already warned that the current fare might rise at least 10 cents on Jan. 1, and possibly as much as 35 cents.
One argument for a $1.25 fare is that it would help reduce the fumbling for change that now annoys riders and leads to delays at booths.
But the Transit Authority said yesterday that its budget would require an increase to $1.40 unless Albany intervened. The budget was submitted to the authority's parent agency, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
The M.T.A. board is expected to vote on the proposed fare increase at a meeting on Dec. 20, said Tito Davila, an agency spokesman. The increase would take effect Jan. 1.
Over the next five weeks, the Transit Authority and the M.T.A. are expected to joust with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, the State Legislature and City Hall in an effort to hold down the size of the increase. The jockeying began in earnest after the budget announcement yesterday, with some politicians openly questioning the Transit Authority's credibility and its motives.
"The obvious concern," said Senator Norman J. Levy, the Republican chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee, "is whether they are creating a horror story to try to stampede a source of revenue to close a deficit that may or may not exist."
But Alan F. Kiepper, the Transit Authority president, insisted yesterday that the deficit was very real.
The authority had estimated as recently as this summer that its deficit in the 1992 fiscal year would be $460 million, because of a decline in riders and a drop in subsidies from taxes on corporate profits and real-estate transactions. But Mr. Kiepper said yesterday that the authority had trimmed that figure to $263 million, in part by reducing operating expenses and its payroll through attrition. That figure includes a $251 million budget deficit plus additional money set aside for future expenses.
"We think we've done a diligent job at cutting costs," Mr. Kiepper said at a news conference yesterday. "It's up to a higher power to determine how the budget shall be balanced."
Mr. Kiepper's superior, Peter E. Stangl, the M.T.A.'s chairman, endorsed the budget and raised the specter that the fare could go even higher. The M.T.A. previously proposed a five-year, $10.6 billion construction and improvement plan and the Legislature has yet to respond to it.
Mr. Stangl said yesterday that unless Albany acted on the construction proposal, the M.T.A. would be forced to finance more of the plan itself through fares even higher than $1.40.
"The Transit Authority has proposed a lean budget that cuts costs through significant reductions in personnel while preserving vital transportation services for our customers," Mr. Stangl said in a statement. "Without additional help from Albany, the increase could be more severe."
 
Cuomo Is Unconvinced
 Mary Ann Crotty, a spokeswoman for Governor Cuomo, said yesterday that the Governor was encouraged that the Transit Authority had reduced its estimated budget gap. But Ms. Crotty said the Governor did not endorse the $1.40 fare, saying other ways might be found to close the deficit further.
"They have to prove to him why they need the fare increase," she said.
Mayor David N. Dinkins is opposed to a $1.40 fare, said a spokesman, Jeff Maclin, who added that the Mayor would instruct his representatives on the M.T.A. board to find an alternative to such a large increase.
Groups representing subway and bus riders also opposed the 25-cent fare increase.
 
History of Fare Retreats
 "A $1.40 fare is too high because it's too much for people to pay, especially in this time of economic hardship," said Beverly Dolinsky, executive director of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee, a state-mandated oversight board for the M.T.A.
At least four times in the last nine years, the Transit Authority and the M.T.A. have proposed large fare increases, only to retreat after legislative action was taken or opposition was mounted.
In 1986, for example, the agencies were struggling to win support for a five-year, $8.6 billion capital plan for construction and improvement. The M.T.A. proposed raising the fare to as much as $1.35, from $1. Three days later, the Legislature extended an existing tax and agreed to the capital plan. The fare remained at $1.
In 1989, the Transit Authority asked the M.T.A. to raise the fare to $1.25, from $1, but it backed down in the face of fierce criticism from transit riders, the Governor and other political officials. The M.T.A. eventually approved an increase to $1.15, which took effect Jan. 1, 1990.

HEADLINE: Aide in Duke Campaign Resigns, Questioning the Candidate's Piety

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Nov. 12

 BODY:
As he tried to mobilize supporters in southern Louisiana today, State Representative David Duke found himself on the defensive. One of his top aides announced that he was quitting because he no longer believed Mr. Duke's assertions that a Christian conversion had caused him to reject views he held as a Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi leader.
Mr. Duke's opponent, former Gov. Edwin W. Edwards, had only one public appearance on his schedule today, a speech before a women's group, as he continued to wage a campaign that relies heavily on television advertising. 
 The defection of the Duke aide, Bob Hawks, who had served as state coordinator for the campaign, insured that Mr. Duke's religious beliefs would remain a major issue in the race.
Before leaving for his home in Memphis this morning, Mr. Hawks, a former member of the Tennessee Legislature, told reporters, "I have thoroughly satisfied myself that David's relationship with Jesus is not as he portrays it to be when he is on stage center trying to obtain public support."
 
Doubts Arise on Sincerity
 Mr. Hawks said he began to doubt Mr. Duke's assertions when he realized that he had never seen the candidate read the Bible or pray. He said he became convinced that Mr. Duke's comments were false when Mr. Duke said he belonged to a church that did not exist.
As he campaigned in Jennings and Lake Charles today, Mr. Duke insisted that Mr. Hawks, who had volunteered his services to the campaign last summer, had no knowledge of his religious practices. Mr. Duke said Mr. Hawks was an agent of the Edwards campaign, an assertion that Mr. Edwards and Mr. Hawks denied.
Conservative Christians are a major element of the swing vote in this election. They accounted for most of the 5 percent of the vote that went to United States Representative Clyde C. Holloway in the nonpartisan primary on Oct. 19 as well as some supporters of the incumbent, Gov. Buddy Roemer.
Both Mr. Duke and Mr. Edwards find themselves in a situation in which they have to try to lure voters who are unenthusiastic about the choice that will be on the ballot Saturday. But the rivals are applying very different strategies to the same task.
Mr. Duke, a Republican, is repeatedly reminding voters of the scandals that once engulfed Mr. Edwards, while portraying himself as the hapless victim of a smear campaign.
In a television advertisement, Mr. Duke says, "Have you ever heard such weeping and gnashing of teeth?"
"The news media," he said, "have given up any pretense of fair play. The liberals have gone ballistic. The special interests have gone mad. The politicians who play to them are lining up on cue."
He continues: "Principles lie abandoned, and hypocrisy rules the day. I raise issues that must be discussed and get back venom instead. Try a little experiment. Next time you hear them accuse me of intolerance and hatred, notice who is doing the shouting."
Mr. Edwards, a Democrat who served three terms as Governor between 1971 and 1987, is relying on surrogates to constantly remind voters of Mr. Duke's past as a neo-Nazi and leader of the Ku Klux Klan. Mr. Edwards depicts himself, meanwhile, as the veteran politician come back to do battle once more for an array of constituencies that have come together because of their distaste for Mr. Duke and their fear of what his election would do to the state's economy.
A survey of television stations in six Louisiana cities showed that the Edwards campaign is spending at least twice as much on television advertisements as the Duke campaign.
Emphasizing the economy as an issue in one Edwards commercial, an announcer says, "Edwin Edwards has a proven record of attracting new jobs to Louisiana; the skills to work with business with labor and the legislature to help put Louisiana back to work again."
Then the commercial offers an implicit warning to those who might cast a protest vote for Mr. Duke, with the announcer saying, "So if we want to send a message to the world with our election let's make sure it is the message we want to send." It closes with the printed message: "Louisiana wants jobs."
 
Overflow Crowds
 With an appearance last Friday night in Monroe, Mr. Duke began a series of seven rallies in major cities. So far, he has drawn overflow crowds, each about 1,000 people, and he has been greeted with the wild exuberance normally accorded to a rock star.
Each rally begins with a long slide show that lacks the polish of a professional production. It alternates between pictures of the Louisiana countryside that could have come from a tourism promotion and snapshots of Mr. Duke posed in hunting gear and on the campaign trail.
While Mr. Duke has rallied his supporters in rented halls, Mr. Edwards has held a series of highly effective events to pay for his media campaign. Last Saturday, about 3,000 people filled a hotel ballroom at $500 a ticket and feasted on crab and roast beef.
Jeff Giles, a direct mail specialist with close ties to the Republican Party and conservative Christian leaders said that predicting the impact of Mr. Hawks's defection on conservative Christians is difficult because "Duke and Edwards are in the same boat."
He went on: "The Christian voters dislike Edwin Edwards because of his gambling and the corruption, but they are also uncomfortable with David Duke's past even though Duke speaks to their issues."

HEADLINE: BUSH STRIKES BACK AT 'TIRED LIBERALS'

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
The liberals are back, at least as far as George Bush is concerned.
Still battling troublesome public opinion polls and groping for ways to strike back at the Democrats, the President took up a weapon yesterday that had proved extremely potent in his 1988 campaign: painting himself as the guardian of the political center and the Democrats as far-out liberals. 
 In a speech at a $2.2 million fund-raising event at the New York Hilton that seemed to try out virtually every campaign theme the Republicans are preparing for 1992, Mr. Bush referred to the leadership in Congress and the Democrats in general as "liberals" more than 10 times in a 25-minute speech, and as "Democrats" only once or twice.
 
Can't Trust Democrats, He Says
 America, Mr. Bush declared, is "tired of hearing a liberal litany." The "liberal leadership" in Congress, he said, is blocking his efforts to bring the country out of an economic slowdown. Proponents of the "tired old liberal mindset" on Capitol Hill, the President asserted, carped and criticized while he made America into "the pre-eminent power" in the world.
The "liberals," said a President who is trying to overcome criticism that he spends too much time on diplomacy and not enough on fighting the economic downturn, do not understand that foreign policy and domestic concerns are linked. And they cannot be trusted to run the country while the President is abroad, he said.
"You see, I saw that movie, 'Home Alone' and I owe it to the American taxpayer to make sure Congress never stays home alone," Mr. Bush said, explaining his decision to cancel a trip to the Far East that had been scheduled for later this month.
The White House had come to New York trying to play down the importance of opinion surveys that suggest Mr. Bush was still politically vulnerable on domestic issues and has yet to recover from a slide in his approval rating that began after the flush of victory in the Persian Gulf. The luncheon speech was clearly intended as an old-fashioned tub-thumper to rally the party faithful.
Asserting that he had tried to extend a bipartisan hand to Capitol Hill, only to be met with a storm of criticism, Mr. Bush said, "I'm not going to be the javelin catcher for the liberals in Congress anymore."
But the speech, his third at a fund-raising event for his 1992 campaign in about 10 days, also left the impression of a candidate groping for effective themes, an impression bolstered by the relative lack of loud or sustained applause from a partisan crowd that paid $1,000 apiece to attend the event.
Outside the hotel, a small knot of protesters sought to remind Mr. Bush of two domestic political issues that are likely to trouble his re-election candidacy: abortion and AIDS.
Inside, Mr. Bush ran through a standard Republican list of accusations against the Democrats: They are soft on crime, weak on foreign policy, irresponsible on government spending and yearning to raise taxes.
Apart from the tension between domestic priorities and foreign policy, two other themes kept bobbing up like markers in the political currents of the 1992 race: the Persian Gulf and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York.
Although Mr. Bush and the other lunchtime speakers never mentioned him by name, they referred several times to the possibility that Mr. Cuomo might seek the Democratic Presidential nomination. Indeed, the President's schedule in New York, which included a meeting with prominent figures in the New York Jewish community, seemed at least in part aimed at shoring up the President's support here in anticipation of a Cuomo campaign.
Sounding one theme, the Persian Gulf, that the Republicans intend to use against Mr. Cuomo if he runs, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican, said: "One unnamed Governor, who may or may not be running for President, said he thought we should be reasonable, give Saddam just a little oil or a little land. But everyone knows you can't appease a glutton with one piece of pie."
The President took up Mr. D'Amato's theme as he sought to turn the issue of foreign policy against the Democrats.
He said: "We have a Congress that is out of step with the times and out of touch with the heartbeat of the American people. They're pushing the same old tired liberal agenda to a country that is hungry to build on what we've done abroad and bring that to success here at home."

HEADLINE: Study Finds Heart Treatment Differs for Men and Women

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANAHEIM, Calif., Nov. 12

 BODY:
Men are twice as likely as women to receive newer life-saving treatments for heart attacks, a study that was reported here today has found.
The study involved nearly 5,000 men and women treated for heart attacks in 19 hospitals in the Seattle area since 1988. It was reported at a meeting of the American Heart Association. 
 In the study, 26 percent of the 3,232 men with heart attacks received injections of "clot buster" drugs like streptokinase and TPA that can stop heart attacks in progress. Of the 1,659 women, 14 percent received treatment with the drugs.
Also, more men underwent a procedure to open up coronary arteries that had been narrowed by deposits of fat. The procedure, known as angioplasty, involves inserting a tube with a balloon at the tip. The balloon is inflated to flatten the fatty deposits that block the arteries. Of the men, 27 percent received such treatment, as against 14 percent of the women.
 
Disturbing Findings
 Researchers from the University of Washington who conducted the study called the findings disturbing because they "call into question whether women are being appropriately treated for heart attacks."
The researchers said they could not explain why the gap between men and women existed and called for new studies to pinpoint the factors. One possible explanation is that the initial studies proving the value of the treatments were carried out chiefly in men.
The therapies are considered equally effective for men and women, however, and the study found no difference in survival rates between the men and women who received them.
Heart disease is the leading killer of Americans. Of the 500,000 Americans who die of heart attacks each year, about 48 percent are women.
 
Missing a Diagnosis
 The study reported today was intended to provide a profile of patients who were treated for heart attacks and the therapies they received.
"There may be a true bias," said Dr. Douglas Weaver, a co-author of the study. But, he added, "it may be that there is something different about the way women experience heart attacks, something that fools physicians into coming to the wrong conclusion, so that the diagnosis of heart attack is initially missed and thus not treated."
Cardiologists say that the symptoms of a heart attack are less apparent in many women; for example, fewer women than men in the Seattle study had angina. Women therefore may delay seeking medical treatment or the diagnosis may be delayed.
But clot-buster drugs are beneficial only if injected within the first few hours after a heart attack. If the diagnosis is delayed, the women may have missed the "window" for treatment, the researchers said.
The study found no difference for coronary bypass surgery. But it said women were twice as likely as men to die from the operation, in which an artery or vein is taken from elsewhere in the body to bypass the blocked coronary artery.
 
Benefit for Older Patients
 In a related report, researchers from Oxford, England, found that heart attack victims who are 70 years and older can benefit from clot-buster drugs. In the past, many doctors have not given such drugs to elderly patients because of the risks of bleeding and strokes. But Dr. Rory Collins of the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford said data from the studies showed that the drug was safe in the elderly and reduced the risk of death from heart attacks by 4 percent.
In another study, researchers from Emory University in Atlanta found that complications from balloon angioplasty occurred more often when the balloon was inflated more than twice. Doctors often do several inflations to remove as much blockage as possible. The study of 699 patients who underwent the procedure at Emory from 1985 to 1990 found that formation of a new blockage increased proportionately with the number of inflations. New blockages occurred in 42 percent of those receiving one or two inflations. For those receiving three or four inflations, new blockages occurred in 60 percent. More than six inflations led to a complication rate of 68 percent.
But repeated angioplasty did not significantly lower survival rates. A related study from Emory found that the five-year survival rate for 1,793 patients was 96 percent for those who did not experience a new blockage and was was 94 percent among 1,120 patients who underwent a second angioplasty.

HEADLINE: Business and Labor Call for Health Tax

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 12

 BODY:
A coalition of big businesses and labor unions proposed today to guarantee access to health care for all Americans by requiring employers either to provide health insurance or to pay a new Federal tax that would finance coverage for the uninsured.
The proposal adds to the growing debate on alternative forms of national health coverage and increases political pressure on the Bush Administration to come up with its own proposal to assist the 34 million Americans who have no health insurance. 
 Under the proposal, a new agency, with representatives from government, business and labor, would set an overall annual goal for national health spending and would set uniform rates to be paid to all suppliers of medical goods and services, including doctors and hospitals. The rates would have the force of law.
The proposal came from the National Leadership Coalition for Health Care Reform, which said its members included the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, the Chrysler Corporation, the Dayton Hudson Corporation, the LTV Corporation, the Lockheed Corporation, Safeway Stores Inc., the Westinghouse Electric Corporation and the Xerox Corporation.
 
Similar to Legislation
 The coalition's proposal resembles a bill introduced in June by Democratic Senators, including George J. Mitchell of Maine and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, but it has more stringent measures to control health costs.
Under the coalition's proposal, all employers would offer health insurance to their employees or would pay a tax equal to 7 percent of their payroll. The Federal Government would use the money from that tax to buy private health insurance for people who do not receive coverage through an employer.
Some businesses involved in the coalition's deliberations refused to endorse its recommendations, saying they objected to its price controls, Government mandates and new taxes.
Herb Linnen, a spokesman for the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, said the coalition had made a major contribution to discussion of the nation's health-care problems. But he said that A.T.&T. had withdrawn from the coalition because the company "does not support mandates on all employers to provide health insurance coverage to employees, or a mandatory level of employer financial support for such a program, or a mandatory design for covered services."
But heavy-manufacturing companies and some retailers say the proposal would relieve them from the crushing burden of health costs for employees and retirees. Such costs, they say, often make their goods uncompetitive in world markets.
"We must accept the need for a stronger Federal role in health care," Walter F. Williams, chairman of Bethlehem Steel, said today at a news conference announcing the coalition's proposal. He said that health costs for Bethlehem Steel shot up 26 percent from 1989 to 1990, reaching a total of $205 million, even though the company tried to control costs.
Former Presidents Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter, were honorary co-chairmen of the coalition. In a letter of endorsement, Mr. Ford said its proposal "steers a middle course between drastic measures (such as national health insurance) and ineffective ones (such as just tinkering with the present system)."
The coalition said its recommendations were supported by the American Federation of Teachers, the American Nurses Association, the Service Employees International Union, the United Food and Commercial Workers Union and the United Steelworkers of America, among other groups.
But Carolyn E. Miller, a lobbyist for the National Federation of Independent Business, which represents 550,000 small businesses, criticized the coalition's proposal as "a very simplistic approach to a very complex problem." She said the proposal's new taxes and requirements would impose new costs on small businesses, forcing them to lay off employees and, in some cases, to cease operations.
"This proposal comes from tired old industries that gave away the store to their workers by providing health benefits in lieu of wages," Ms. Miller said. "Now they face stiff competition in this country and abroad. They're in trouble, and if their proposal were adopted, the rest of us would be in trouble, too."
Michael D. Bromberg, executive director of the Federation of American Health Systems, which represents 1,400 investor-owned hospitals, said: "Most members of the business community are well aware of the dangers of price controls, especially those on one sector of the economy."
"Such controls would inevitably have an adverse effect on the quality of health care," Mr. Bromberg said.

HEADLINE: Businesses in Louisiana Fear Duke

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Nov. 12

 BODY:
Along with issues of race and religion, right and wrong, sin and redemption, the Louisiana gubernatorial race between Edwin W. Edwards and David Duke is increasingly focusing on something more mundane -- dollars and cents.
Among business people, particularly in New Orleans, which lives and dies on tourism, there is something approaching panic about what a victory by Mr. Duke, a Republican State Representative who is also a former Ku Klux Klan leader, could mean for the state's sagging economy. 
 "Some people said that David Duke will hurt the New Orleans convention industry," said Dave Dixon a French Quarter antiques and art dealer and civic promoter. "That's nonsense. He won't hurt the convention industry; he will eliminate it."
Beverly Gianna, director of public relations for the Greater New Orleans Tourist and Convention Commission, said 15 organizations, whose conventions would bring in about $87 million, have postponed their decisions until after Saturday's election.
 
Business Backs Edwards
 Tourism organizations and other business groups have mounted aggressive public relations efforts on behalf of Mr. Edwards, a former Governor who served three terms. Individual businessmen have organized letter-writing and phone-bank networks on his behalf.
Virtually all of the state's past and present major public officials, including former Gov. Dave Treen and Gov. Buddy Roemer, have called for a vote for Mr. Edwards, a Democrat, on economic grounds. Mr. Roemer, a Republican like Mr. Treen, said a victory by Mr. Duke would be "death for the state."
Mr. Duke and his supporters say that kind of talk is simply a scare tactic, which could aid his campaign in the end as voters rebel at the idea that their choice should be dictated by outsiders. And Mr. Duke's spokesman, Howie Farrell, said Mr. Edwards's long stewardship of Louisiana's economy is the best reason to cast a ballot for Mr. Duke.
"Fortune magazine said last month Louisiana was last for business opportunity of all the states in the U.S," Mr. Farrell said. "So can we do any worse than last?" The magazine ranked New Orleans 50th in business climate in a survey of 50 cities.
 
Economy Still Frail
 Many experts say Louisiana's fragile economy, which has still not stabilized after the collapse of the oil industry in the early 1980's, is precisely why a victory by Mr. Duke could have such impact. To many, the spectacle of the race between a lifelong racial extremist and a former Governor who survived two racketeering trials has already given the state an economic jolt. A victory by Mr. Duke, they say, would torpedo the recovery that has been starting to take hold.
"There are people who are going to redline our businesses," said Jim Bob Moffett, chairman of Freeport-McMoran, a New Orleans-based energy company. "We are going to be X-rated, and we're not going to get our fair shake to try to continue this economic recovery."
Much of what could happen after a victory by Mr. Duke is speculative. And Mr. Farrell said much of the state's economy base would be unaffected.
 
Waiting for the Election
 "We're still going to have the Port of New Orleans and the Mississippi River," he said. "We're still going to be centrally located on the Gulf of Mexico. We're still going to be one of the premier ports for import and export. That's not going to move to Utah if David Duke is elected."
But experts say New Orleans's $2.3 billion-dollar-a-year tourism industry is particularly vulnerable because it is overwhelmingly dominated by conventions, as opposed to a city like Orlando, Fla., which has a higher percentage of vacationing individuals and families.
Mr. Dixon, who is spending $35,000 to $40,000 of his own money on radio advertisements about the economic impact a Duke victory would have, said that New Orleans could lose 75 percent of its tourism business and that its Superdome would lose any chance of getting Super Bowls, college basketball championships and other big events.
Tim Ryan, an economist at the University of New Orleans, estimated the impact of a Duke victory at $1.8 billion -- $600 million in convention and tourism business and its ripple effects and "a $1.2 billion chilling effect on new investment."
The concern is statewide. Officials in Shreveport, who are bidding with eight other cities for a McDonnell-Douglas plant that would employ 7,000 workers, worry that Mr. Duke's election would ruin their chances of getting the plant.
Jack Shaffer, managing director of Sonnenblich Goldman Inc., the largest lender in the United States for major real estate projects, said his firm would stay out of Louisiana if Mr. Duke was elected.
Pres Kabacoff, president of Historic Restorations Inc., a New Orleans real estate development company, said a meeting last week with about 100 businessmen brought out stories about the impact just of Mr. Duke's presence in the runoff. "Several people told stories about projects that have been put on hold," he said.
 
Roemer's Loss Is Lamented
 Economic development experts say that neither candidate is likely to do as much for the state's image as Buddy Roemer, who failed to make the runoff after one term as Governor.
But most say the election of Mr. Duke, the signals it would send and the degree of turmoil that could ensue would have the most potential to scare off industry.
"You have the problem of corporations who simply take Louisiana off their list because it's too unpredictable, it's too controversial," said Doug Ross, senior consultant with the Corporation for Enterprise Development, a not-for-profit research organization dealing with economic development strategies. "Unless you're in the extraction of oil or in petrochemicals, where you need to be near the source, there are few other compelling reasons for being in Louisiana as opposed to some other part of the South."
 
What Arizona Lost
 But Mr. Farrell, Mr. Duke's spokesman, said talk of canceled conventions was "smoke and mirrors." Alluding to the controversy in Arizona, which was the target of boycott threats after Gov. Evan Meacham rescinded the state holiday honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1987, he said: "The convention scare was used against Arizona. They had immediate cancellations of some conventions, and they were immediately replaced by other conventions. They had no net loss of conventions."
Arizona officials tell a different story. The state has lost the 1993 Super Bowl, originally scheduled for Tempe, whose effect on the state has been estimated at $125 million to $150 million. And officials say the state has also lost 148 conventions and gatherings, which would have brought in about $77 million.
"I can't tell you if Duke's election will have an impact on New Orleans," said Dave Radcliffe, chief executive officer of the Phoenix and Valley of the Sun Convention and Visitors Bureau. "I can tell you the controversy in Arizona did have some impact."
Mr. Duke announced during an interview on "Larry King Live" that he had letters from billion-dollar corporations that said they were looking forward to doing business with him. But when asked to provide names, he declined, saying that the companies wanted their names left confidential.
 
The 'Outsider' Issue
 Still, it is not entirely clear which way the economic issue will cut. Mr. Duke has used criticism from outsiders in the past to mobilize support within the state. "People don't want outsiders coming in here and intimidating them, using terrorist tactics to try to coerce a vote," Mr. Farrell said.
Some critics see something unsettling in the idea that it may take an economic issue rather than a referendum on his ideology and background to defeat Mr. Duke. "I'd like to get a victory for the right reasons, but I think it's so important to defeat Duke, I'll take it whatever way it comes," said Lawrence Powell, a history professor at Tulane University.

HEADLINE: Sentiment Grows in Washington for Shift in U.S. Zaire Policy

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 12

 BODY:
In Congress and the Bush Administration there is now broad agreement that the United States must press for the installation of a transitional government in Zaire if the country is to be saved from further violence and economic ruin. There is also a consensus that the interim Government should be led by a newly unified political opposition.
Where Congress and the Administration differ is over the immediate fate of President Mobutu Sese Seko, Zaire's ruler for 26 years. Both sides agree, however, that his Government has lost all legitimacy and is out of step with the growth of democracy throughout Africa. 
 Today, Senator Paul Simon, the Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on African affairs, sought to force the debate on President Mobutu's future into the open by asking the Administration to persuade him to leave Zaire, at least temporarily, after turning power over to an interim Government.
 
'Very Grim Times'
 "There is a general feeling that we're facing some very grim times in Zaire," Senator Simon said in an interview. "One of these days we're going to have people in the streets either celebrating an election or causing chaos. We have to be more firmly on the side of saying we need a new government. Let's get people into the streets for constructive reasons."
Senator Simon said Administration officials, and Republican legislators involved in African affairs, have been remarkably forthcoming in their critcism of the Mobutu Government.
"What I'm trying to do is push them a little further," the Senator said.
A resolution similar to Senator Simon's call is working its way through the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee. A Congressional staff member said today that the moves in both houses are prompted by a sense that the Administration has allowed President Mobutu to believe that Washington will not press for his ouster or exile.
Herman J. Cohen, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, told Senator Simon's subcommittee on Nov. 6 that "the best hope for Zaire is now genuine power-sharing between President Mobutu and the opposition." But he also said that the Mobutu Government "had lost the legitimacy to govern Zaire during the transition to democracy."
And he acknowledged that the situation in the central African nation was very critical, two months after rampaging troops ran wild in several cities, looting and killing at least 100, possibly more than 200, people.
"Zaire still does not have a functioning government, there is no consistent control over the military, the economic catastrophe continues and the threat of national disintegration looms larger every day," Mr. Cohen told the Senate subcommittee before leaving on a trip to Africa.
 
Foreigners Flee Country
 Thousands of foreigners have fled the country, leaving embassies operating with skeleton staffs, businesses abandoned and Zaire's copper and cobalt mining industries stripped of overseas experts. French and Belgian troops arrived to protect and evacuate their citizens. Zaire was formerly the Belgian Congo.
The violence that erupted in September came not long after Mobutu loyalists packed a conference called for August to allow all parties to discuss a new political order for Zaire. President Mobutu, bowing to opposition pressure, appointed a political foe, Etienne Tshisekedi, to the prime ministership in late September, but the experiment collapsed within a month. Bernardin Mungul-Diaka, named to replace him, was denounced and disowned by the opposition of which he said he was a member.
Mr. Mungul-Diaka has since announced that he will reconvene a national political conference. Mr. Tshisekedi's followers have since established an alternative government.
 
Military Aid Cut Off
 Congress took the lead in forcing policy changes on Zaire more than a year ago, when President Mobutu first showed signs of being unwilling to grant the political freedoms he promised in April 1990. Military aid was cut off, although economic and humanitarian assistance has continued to reach the country through nongovernmental organizations.
With further scope for action limited, and with Zaire becoming increasingly unstable, members of Congress say that their tactic now must be to force policy action from the Administration. Mr. Cohen in his testimony said American officials had been meeting with Belgian and other European officials to discuss possible action, while awaiting news of the promised reconvened national convention.
Criticism of Bush Administration policy statements on Zaire is not confined to Democrats. Today Representative Dan Burton, Republican of Indiana, said he had joined forces with those who think that President Mobutu must go immediately. Mr. Burton was once a supporter of President Mobutu, who was aiding Jonas Savimbi's United States-backed rebel faction against the leftist government of Angola. Mr. Burton says he still believes that the Mobutu Government helped bring peace to Angola, where Mr. Savimbi has put down arms and is now preparing to join in contesting national elections.
"But Mobutu's excesses and his obvious lack of concern for the people of his country have led me to the conclusion that he must go," Mr. Burton said. "The support we have given him in the past has got to end. His country is in chaos. The people want change."

HEADLINE: Interns See Washington as Key to Post-College Job

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 12

 BODY:
For an increasing number of college students, internships in Washington provide the crowbar to pry open access to shrinking job opportunities after graduation.
As a result, college-sponsored internship programs that give academic credit for jobs in Washington during the semester, at costs comparable to that of living and going to classes on campus, are growing in size and popularity. The programs help students avoid the problem of the cost of living in Washington while working for an intern's meager salary that in the past barred many students from being able to make acquaintances and get practical job experience during summer vacations, let alone during an academic term. 
 Some colleges and universities run programs offering students a semester in Washington when they live in a group setting and take classes from adjunct faculty members in addition to working for a Government office or private-interest organization. Other institutions, with fewer resources, arrange internships for credit through a group like The Washington Center, a not-for-profit organization that provides classes and finds jobs and housing for students from hundreds of colleges across the country.
Although no single organization keeps a count of the number of programs, all the program directors contacted agreed that internships for credit have become more popular in these harder economic times, a trend reflected in the growing numbers of applicants with better credentials. Judy Carbone, program coordinator for Boston University's Washington internship program, said, "For this spring, we're seeing students with much higher G.P.A.'s" as well as an increase in the number of students expressing interest in the program.
But some educators are concerned about the emphasis these programs place on practical experience over liberal arts education. Many also dispute the merits of giving academic credit to students who could end up faxing and filing for 40 hours a week.
Jeff Crawford, a senior from Stockton State College in Pomona, N.J., said his job with Representative William J. Hughes, Democrat of New Jersey, entails "getting the mail, processing it, responding to constituents who have complaints and problems back home" and occasionally going to hearings to listen and take notes..
 
'Your Utmost Attention'
 And Rachelle St. Louis a senior psychology major at Montclair State College in Montclair, N.J., said that although she does take one class "your job definitely gets your utmost attention."
While Ms. Carbone said "getting full-time substantive work experience" was the main incentive for students to work in Washington for a semester, she added that Boston University's program was structured to avoid becoming purely a resume-building service. The 45 students in the program get a full semester's credit for a full-time internship plus three classes on policy-related topics.
Ms. Carbone said, "All in all, it's much more rigorous and more time-consuming than going to school on campus."
Mr. Crawford, the Stockton State student, said he was taking two classes on top of his full-time job: one class is about legal writing and trial advocacy, taught by an adjunct professor from a local law school; the other consists of writing a four-page paper once a week on difference places in Washington, like museums or monuments, and sending it to Stockton State for a professor to grade.
The Washington Center, through which his internship was arranged, promises that the 250 to 300 interns for whom the center finds jobs every semester will not spend more than 20 percent of their time doing clerical work.
But skepticism about clerical chores is a main reason that Georgetown University in Washington does not have an internship program, said Claire Carey, assistant dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. "We believe that just letting students go off on their own is not a good idea in terms of keeping track of an academic product," she said.
Many students argue that today's sagging economy demands that they be practical -- a strictly liberal arts education just does not leap out from a resume, they say, the way working in the Office of Management and Budget does. And then there are the contacts. As Mr. Crawford explained, "If you don't have access to people, doors get slammed, especially in this job market."
Figures are not available for the number of students who actually get job offers directly because of their experience in Washington, but anecdotal evidence suggests the numbers are high.
Amanda Fuchs, a Boston University senior who worked for Representative Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, as an assistant to his press secretary, was asked to come back in the summer as a paid intern. She did, and when the professional press secretary left, Miss Fuchs filled in until Mr. Wyden hired someone else permanently.
Miss Fuchs said the experience and contacts she made were valuable and she was "hoping to go back to Washington" after graduating this spring.

HEADLINE: Missouri's Rejection of Education Plan Is Seen as Bad Omen

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

 BODY:
Missouri voters used last week's elections to make a decisive statement about education spending, rejecting a $385 million package that would have been financed by higher taxes. But in the only other state with an education measure on the ballot, Texans approved a $300 million increase for a college loan program.
Education analysts saw the Missouri vote as a significant blow to the national movement to improve school programs by raising more money. Voter backlash toward higher taxes finally materialized in the voting in Missouri, analysts said, after two recent efforts to cut spending failed. Citizen groups in Nebraska last year and in Oklahoma last month got measures on the ballot to repeal expensive state education plans, but both measures lost. 
 Not only was the Missouri referendum's failure largely unexpected, but the margin of defeat, 34 percentage points, also surprised state education and elected officials. Many Missouri officials had said they expected the measure to pass narrowly.
"The measure was slaughtered," said Jim Morris, a spokesman for Robert Bartman, the Missouri Education Commissioner. "The sentiment seems to be people aren't interested in talking about taxes right now, even for education."
Several groups opposed to the Missouri plan said they were not against higher taxes for education but were protesting that state mental health programs and other state agencies, hobbled by recession-induced budget cuts, would not receive a share of the proposed tax increase. Others opposed the plan largely because it resulted in higher taxes. The plan won approval in only two of the state's 115 counties.
The proposal would have raised $385 million from increases in sales and personal income taxes and a ceiling on some state income tax deductions. The additional revenue would have gone for a variety of programs in public schools and state colleges and universities.
A bulk of the new tax revenue, about $150 million, would have gone toward a new formula for distributing state tax money to school districts. Missouri, like 21 other states, is currently being sued by school districts that contend the current formula favors property-rich districts. In Texas, voters approved, 65 percent to 35 percent, a plan to raise $300 million through the sale of state bonds. The money will be used to finance a popular student loan program, which would have run out of money without the extra funds.
The measure was defeated last August by voters because they confused the higher education loan program with one for students attending trade schools. This time, Texas officials conducted an aggressive campaign to educate voters and to clear up confusion over who is served by the program. Texas education officials said the campaign was the difference.

HEADLINE: Dinkins, in South Africa, Says He's 'Finally Home'

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Nov. 12

 BODY:
To the buoyant greeting of a chorus of cleaning women and airport mechanics, Mayor David N. Dinkins landed on South African soil today, embraced his hero, Nelson Mandela, and proclaimed himself "finally home." He then set off to tour a black hospital and shantytown, where he passed out Mets caps and crayons to poor children.
Accompanied by his wife, Joyce, and more than three dozen business and civic leaders and city officials, the Mayor began his six-day trip with high emotion and pride. While he received nothing like the blizzard of ticker-tape showered on Mr. Mandela, the African National Congress leader, in New York last year, the white-minority Government allowed him a clapping, dancing greeting on the tarmac by A.N.C. officials and workers that American diplomats said was rare. 
 "We're here," Mr. Dinkins told reporters at Jan Smuts Airport. "They said we weren't going to get here, but we are here, and we are delighted to be here. People say that I've come a long way from home, and it's true I have come a long way, but today I am finally home."
 
The Mayor Bristles
 But later the Mayor bristled when some New York reporters traveling with him asked if he saw any similarities between the disparity of health care for blacks and whites in this rich country and the disparities between rich and poor in his own backyard.
"For God's sake, you can't be serious," he told a reporter who asked about inadequacies in New York as Mr. Dinkins toured the Baragwanath Hospital, whose 3,000 beds must serve some three million black residents in Soweto Township.
Dr. John Pettifor, the head of the Government hospital's pediatric unit who guided the Mayor through a children's cancer ward and a neonatal intensive care unit, noted that mortality rates among black babies born there are about 40 per 1,000 births, perhaps three times the 12 to 16 per 1,000 rate for whites. Infant mortality rates in Central Harlem run in the mid-20's, more than three times the average in the upper-middle class neighborhood of Kips Bay.
But as Mr. Dinkins picked up an infant crying "Mama" and cuddled it into silence while television cameras panned the scene, he was not in the mood for thoughts of New York. A few minutes later, in a neighboring squatter settlement known as Mandela Village, where skinny dogs sat still in dusty courtyards and children fought over the hats and sweatbands mayoral aides passed out, Mr. Dinkins said no poverty in the United States was comparable.
 
Disadvantaged 'by law'
 "Nothing quite like this exists," Mr. Dinkins said. "We have Appalachia, we have the South, we have ghettos in cities. But the big difference here is that this is calculated to say that black folks will have nothing, and white folks will have everything, in a sense, by law."
Mr. Dinkins says he hopes his delegation of experts in fields from housing to health can help rectify that in an exchange of ideas with black South Africans at meetings this week.
The Mayor said that the inequity of the system is one reason why he is pressing to maintain economic sanctions against the regime and seeking an interim multiracial government to share power while a new constitution is drafted. It also explains, he said, why his delegation would be meeting with both black and white South African business leaders Wednesday to try to foster new investments.
Mr. Mandela said he hoped to pursue the idea, first broached to him last year in New York by Peter C. Goldmark, head of the Rockefeller Foundation, of establishing an economic development bank that could assist in the reconstruction of a post-apartheid economy.

HEADLINE: Democrats Court Labor By Hammering at Bush

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 12

 BODY:
The six major Democratic Presidential contenders vied for support before the A.F.L.-C.I.O. convention here today, pledging their commitment to the unemployed and the economically squeezed, hammering President Bush and promising drastic new measures to spur economic growth.
Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa seemed to be the emotional favorite of the crowd, judging from the frequency and decibel level of applause when he railed against "scab-hiring employers" and promised to be a friend of labor in the White House. But many officials here said the race for organized labor was still wide open, particularly since it is unclear whether Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York will seek the Democratic nomination. 
 What was clear was the elated mood among labor officials after last week's Democratic victory in the Pennsylvania Senate race. It was widely seen here as vindication for a labor-oriented message -- particularly the health-care issue -- and a sign of new possibilities in the 1992 Presidential race.
"We've got some very acceptable candidates and they're all singing from the hymn book now, since Pennsylvania -- middle-class, economic populism," said Frank Garrison, president of the Michigan A.F.L.-C.I.O., alluding to Senator Harris Wofford's sound defeat of former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh last Tuesday.
 
Videotaped for Membership
 Indeed, the candidates spent considerable time preaching to the choir today, assailing the Bush Administration's handling of the economy, calling for major investments in roads and bridges, for instance, and urging a new emphasis on education and job training. The candidates' forum was videotaped and will be circulated throughout the 89 affiliated unions of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations -- a crucial component of the Democratic nominating process.
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas outlined a plan to "jump start the economy" that included extending unemployment benefits, cutting the interest rates on credit cards, expanding mortgage availability and cutting taxes on the middle class. Mr. Clinton has some critics among the ranks of organized labor, stemming, in part, from his days as head of the Democratic Leadership Council, a group that has often faulted the party for seeming out of touch with middle America and too much in thrall of constituent groups like organized labor.
Today, Mr. Clinton told the more than 700 labor delegates here, "We won't always agree, but if I'm your President, we'll be full partners in restoring the middle class and America's greatness." After the forum, David Wilhelm, the Clinton campaign manager, said, "We stayed true to our message, we didn't pander, and we made some friends."
Edmund G. Brown Jr., the former Governor of California, used the forum to highlight his message, turning nearly every question into a relentless attack on modern politics and the influence of special interest money upon it. While none matched him in vehemence, others candidates took time to rail against Washington today, reflecting the new popularity of outsider campaigns.
Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who is trying to cast himself as the change-oriented candidate, argued that there was a "life and death struggle" occurring among working people increasingly squeezed by the recession. He used the forum to highlight his plan to provide universal health care, which he asserted was at the heart of much of the nation's economic strain.
 
Wilder on Fiscal Care
 Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia, whose message often centers around fiscal responsibility, was striking a different tone today. He accused Republicans of conducting a "decade of code word politics" that has exacerbated racial divisions. But he also criticized Democrats who suggest the party has grown too close to minorities and labor.
Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, who is trying to position himself as a pro-business liberal, was the only candidate today who said he would oppose a bill now at the top of organized labor's agenda, a measure that would outlaw the hiring of permanent replacements for striking workers. Mr. Tsongas sought to use today's forum to present himself as the candidate with a detailed plan to rebuild the nation's manufacturing base and halt the country's economic decline.
It was Mr. Harkin who made the most full-throated appeal to labor today. "I come from labor," he said. "I'm proud of labor, and I'm proud of what labor's done for America. And I won't just take your money and your support and then treat you like some illegitimate cousin."
Many labor officials here said they were doubtful that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. would reach an early endorsement of a candidate for the nomination.

HEADLINE: President of University of Bridgeport Quits as Fiscal Woes Deepen

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn., Nov. 12

 BODY:
The president of the University of Bridgeport resigned on Monday as the struggling private university's financial crisis deepened.
The resignation of the president, Dr. Janet D. Greenwood, came a month after trustees rejected an offer from a group financed by the Unification Church to invest $50 million in the nonsectarian university and enroll 1,000 students a year. Control would have passed to the group, the Professors World Peace Academy. Dr. Greenwood said at the time that trustees had to consider the offer because of the university's financial condition.
 
'Very Difficult Period'
 Three days before Dr. Greenwood resigned Standard & Poor's lowered the rating on $3 million in bonds for the university from BB to CCC, a very speculative rating that carries significant risk, saying the university was nearly out of cash and "there is a possibility that U.B. may consider closing in the near future." 
 Dr. Greenwood was not available for comment today. The trustees, in announcing that she had resigned and would become a tenured faculty member and president emeritus, said she had joined Bridgeport in 1987 "during a very difficult period" and had faced conditions that placed "unusual burdens on her presidency."
A spokesman for the university, Walter Wager, said Dr. Greenwood had said recently that she was not in accord with some options being considered to deal with the university's fiscal crisis. Among other things, the university is considering a reduction in tuition, which totals more than $18,000, including room and board, and consolidating the 85-acre campus on Long Island Sound, where a third of the more than 50 buildings are unused.
The school now has 4,000 full-time and part-time students, Mr. Wager said, down from 9,100 in 1969. Full-time enrollment was hurt, he said, because parents balked at Bridgeport's high tuition, while part-time enrollment was suffering because many businesses were cutting back on tuition subsidies for employees.
But the university also faces an immediate financial threat. According to Standard & Poor's, it is in technical default on a $10.2 million loan from a group of local banks because it has not complied with the loan's conditions and has "exhausted all of its unrestricted monies."
Founded in 1927 when Bridgeport was a thriving industrial city, the University of Bridgeport grew rapidly in the 1960's as the baby-boom generation went to college. But its reputation did not grow in proportion, and the campus was already becoming isolated by poor neighborhoods around it. Enrollment began declining in the 1970's as the college-age population shrank and competition among colleges intensified.
The decline was well under way when Dr. Greenwood arrived from Longwood College, a state college in Farmville, Va., where she had been president for eight years. Conditions worsened as she immediately ran into a faculty strike and the university incurred $4 million deficits in both 1988 and 1989.
In 1990 the faculty struck again when Dr. Greenwood sought deep salary cuts and concessions on tenure. Seventy of the 157 faculty members at that time have remained out, keeping up a chorus of criticism of Dr. Greenwood and the trustees as the recession and publicity from the strike have cut further into enrollment.
"This has come too late to make any real difference as far as the survival of the university is concerned," Richard Tino, a spokesman for the striking faculty, said today. "It doesn't seem to me that anyone with any sense would extend credit to the university."

HEADLINE: And This Little Piggy Is Now on the Menu

BYLINE: By TRISH HALL

 BODY:
STYLISH foods are supposed to have weird and unpronounceable names, like cherimoya, a custardy fruit from South America, or offer a new and exciting eating experience, like pizza with goat cheese.
But pork? Pork, a prosaic food if there ever was one, is finally getting some respect. According to several surveys, pork in all its guises, from spareribs to roast loin with five-chili chutney, is one of the most rapidly growing items on restaurant menus. Sales of pork have grown by 20 percent, from $25 billion to $30 billion, since the pork industry started a costly and intensive public relations campaign five years ago, emphasizing pork's leanness for consumers who are increasingly concerned about health. 
 Not only is more pork being sold, but as demand grows, it is fetching a higher price. Pork is even showing up in fancy places that once shunned it in favor of more stylish dishes like free-range chicken or rack of lamb.
"I never had pork on my menu until last year," said Gordon Sinclair, the owner of Gordon, an elegant American restaurant in Chicago. "I didn't think it was good enough." But Mr. Sinclair decided that pork's image had been changed by the industry's campaign and the news media's response to it.
In Dallas, Stephan Pyles never had pork on his menu at Routh Street. "I looked at pork as a humble dish," he said, "and would use wild boar instead." But a year or so ago, he began serving pork, using the tenderloin in a dried cherry and chipotle sauce.
That's not to say that pork has surmounted all of its image problems. Chefs at some fancy restaurants still refuse to put pork on their regular menus. "It's not that popular," said Christian Albin, one of the chefs of the Four Seasons in New York.
Nor does it lack detractors who question its health value. The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer group in Washington, has complained to the Federal Trade Commission that the pork industry is misleading shoppers by implying that all pork -- "the other white meat," as the ad campaign puts it -- is low in fat; the truth is, only certain cuts are.
"The pork industry is running a nutrition disinformation campaign," said Bruce Silverglade, director of the center's legal affairs. "The last thing we need is to increase consumption of foods that are relatively high in fat and cholesterol."
Pork also has image problems completely unrelated to nutrition concerns. Its consumption is taboo in some religions, Judaism and Islam. Even some people with no tie to these traditions consider pork an unclean meat. Nevertheless, while beef and chicken are eaten more in this country than pork, worldwide, pork is the most widely consumed meat.
The mixed feelings about pork showed up in a survey last year of 1,304 households done for the National Pork Producers Council in Des Moines. For a large segment, pork did not have a special or fancy image: 38 percent said they were not likely to serve pork for a festive occasion. And, 93 percent of the respondents said pork must be overcooked to be safe to eat.
The conviction that pork must be overcooked is a big hurdle to greater acceptance. It is based on the fear of getting trichinosis from pork. But since the industry changed the way it raises pork in the 1960's and the Federal Government made it illegal in the 1970's to feed pigs untreated garbage, the trichina worm is rarely found in pork.
"Our own studies indicate that less than 1 percent of all pigs slaughtered contain the parasite," said James Greene, a spokesman for the food safety and inspection service of the United States Department of Agriculture. Trichinosis is now a rare illness that is less likely to occur than food poisoning from chicken or turkey. "We would characterize that as a very low public health problem," Mr. Greene said. If the parasite is present, it is killed when the meat is cooked to 137 degrees.
But the Federal Government recommends cooking to 160 degrees to assure that bacteria are also eliminated. At 160 degrees, the meat is slightly pink, or has just turned white, and is juicier and less well done than most people would expect pork to be. Cooks who do not use a thermometer should cook pork until it has turned white and the juice runs clear, according to Susan Conley, a home economist who oversees the meat and poultry consumer help line at the Agriculture Department.
The pork industry has not convinced the public that pork doesn't have to be overcooked, but its surveys show that its slogan, "the other white meat," has become widely known. And, although it is natural to assume that any industry that is trying to burnish its image has something to hide, some pork really is less fatty than it used to be.
The pig, the animal whose very name has long been synonymous with fat, has actually become, on average, about 31 percent leaner since 1983 because of changes in breeding and a lower-fat diet, according to a University of Wisconsin study released last year. The leanest cut, pork tenderloin, has four grams of fat in a three-ounce serving, compared to three grams in a skinless chicken breast, and far less than a beef tenderloin, with nine grams of fat. But tenderloin accounts for only a small part of the pork that is sold. The more popular kinds of fresh pork cuts, like spareribs, are still very fatty.
Nevertheless, because of the five-year-old campaign, the pork industry has avoided the taint that has hurt beef. Pork producers have stopped the decline in per capita consumption and have even managed to raise it somewhat, while the beef industry has seen a significant drop. Pork producers have spent $150 million on the research and promotion campaign, financed by a fee of 30 cents on each pig sold. The money is collected by the National Pork Board, which hires organizations like the Pork Producers to promote pork.
For producers, the program has paid off. The average farmer this year will get more than $49 for every 100 pounds of pork sold, said Michael Simpson, executive vice president of the pork board. "If we had the demand scenario of the early 80s, they would be getting between $37 and $39 on average," he said.
Besides producing leaner pork, producers have barraged consumers and restaurants with advertisements in publications and on television. Restaurants have responded to the overtures; according to the pork council, it has fulfilled 80,000 requests from restaurants in the last three years for pork recipes and promotional materials.
Culinary trends may have made it easier to sell the public on the virtue of pork. In the last decade, the growing popularity of Southwestern and Mexican cuisine, both quite dependent on pork, has stimulated its use. At the Granite Cafe in Austin, Tex., the chef, Luke Bibby, is serving two pork entrees: a boneless, butterflied pork chop stuffed with sweet potato and sage, and a smoked pork tenderloin in a peanut mole sauce. "It's much more versatile than chicken," he said. "It can take a heavier sauce."
But all kinds of restaurants, which often set the trends in home cooking, have been using more pork. A recent survey of 1,000 restaurants published by Restaurant Business magazine showed that of 21 meat, poultry and seafood items, pork had the greatest percentage growth as a menu item from 1988 to 1991.
And in a study released last year by the NPD Group, a research company in Chicago, pork was found to be one of the fastest growing menu items in all parts of the United States, except in the Midwest, from 1987 to 1989, along with items like frozen yogurt, pasta and pan pizzas.
Because pork is cheaper than beef, it is appealing to restaurants that are trying to keep entree prices low. "I can't sell something over $20," said Peter Hoffman, the chef of Savoy at 70 Prince Street in Manhattan, a new bistro. People don't want steak, but they might be interested in pork, he said; he just added it to his fall menu.
While fat-conscious consumers may now be more willing to eat pork than in the past, the thinner pigs are not an unmitigated boon. Chefs say they are much harder to make tasty because they have less fat. At the Coyote Cafe in Santa Fe, N.M., pork accounts for a quarter of meat sales. But it can't just be thrown on a grill. "By marinating and brining it, we give it more flavor," said Mark Miller, the chef and owner.
Though he has noticed an increase in the sale of pork dishes over the last three years, Mr. Miller is not sure that that points to an upsurge in pork's popularity. In Santa Fe, he said, most of the diners in his restaurant are visitors on vacation. "People tend not to think about their normal diets," he said.

HEADLINE: THE PURPOSEFUL COOK;
Re-creating a Four-Alarm Chili That Still Lingers in Memory

BYLINE: By JACQUES PEPIN

 BODY:
ONE-DISH meals are often our favorite way of eating at home, and when cold weather comes, I long for chili. Many years ago, a friend sent me a chili recipe that had been given her by the warden of San Quentin State Prison in California. It was hot, very hot, but my family liked it as much as I did. Even though I lost the recipe long ago, the taste of that chili remains in my memory, and I think this recipe is close to the one I remember.
My wife and I always serve our chili with boiled long-grain white rice and garnish it with shredded sharp Cheddar cheese and chopped red or white onion. In addition, I serve it with hot corn tortillas or dry tacos. Although "real" Texas chili doesn't accommodate beans, we make ours with red kidney beans or another variety of dried beans. We like it better that way, and the beans extend the dish greatly, make it healthier, more of a complete meal, and more economical, because the quantity of meat can be greatly reduced. 
 Although any type of beef can be used in this chili recipe, the best choice is chuck, shoulder or shank, all of which are moist and tender. I like my beef coarsely chopped, in 1/4-inch pieces, not finely chopped or ground.
The spice mixture includes dry mustard, cumin powder, red pepper flakes, chili powder and coriander seeds. I grind the seeds to a powder in a mini-chopper or small coffee grinder. If you don't have one of these small devices, use a mortar and pestle or the bottom of a heavy saucepan to crush the seeds.
Chili is an ideal dish to make ahead. It freezes well and will keep under refrigeration for four days to a week. It actually improves in flavor with reheating. Freeze the chili in small enough containers so that you can thaw it easily on short notice.
A simple green salad is a refreshing and cooling companion. And apple fritters make a delightful dessert. The fritters are made with a simple batter consisting of a cup of flour, a cup of ice-cold water and one egg.
Use the least expensive apples you can find for the fritters; any variety works well in this recipe. Notice that the apples are not peeled. They are stood upright and cut on all sides into 1/2-inch-thick slices as far as the core, which is then discarded. The apple slices are then stacked and cut into sticks, and these sticks are mixed into the batter. Large spoonfuls of the mixture cook in just a few minutes in hot oil.
If the fritters are made ahead, be sure to cook them until they are crisp and well browned. Then reheat and recrisp them in a toaster oven or under the broiler just before serving. Dust them heavily with granulated sugar.
With this hot, earthy chili, I suggest beer or an ordinary jug wine, perhaps a Gallo burgundy or an Almaden chablis.
 
Batter Up!
INSTEAD of making apple fritters, you can use the same batter for vegetable pancakes. Stir in some thinly sliced leftover vegetables -- anything from carrots to parsley, onions and zucchini. Pour large spoonfuls of the mixture into a very hot, heavy skillet that has been generously oiled with corn or canola oil, and cook the pancakes for 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Serve one large pancake per person as a vegetable side dish with a roast or stew.

A Meal In One Dish: Beef and Beans
 
Fiery Chili With Red Beans
 
Total time: 2 hours, 45 minutes
 
 2 pounds dried red kidney beans
 12 cups cold water
 3 teaspoons salt
 2 pounds stewing beef (chuck, shoulder or shank)
 1/2 pound ham rind or bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
 1 pound onions, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces, and for garnish, 1 cup chopped onion, washed in a sieve and pressed in a kitchen towel to prevent discoloration
 8 cloves garlic, crushed, peeled and chopped (2 tablespoons)
 2 tablespoons chopped jalapeno pepper (more or less to taste)
 1 large (1-pound, 12-ounce) can whole Italian tomatoes in juice
 2 teaspoons coriander seeds
 2 teaspoons cumin powder
 2 teaspoons dry mustard
 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
 4 tablespoons chili powder
 Tabasco sauce
 1 cup grated Cheddar cheese
 Corn tortillas or tacos.
1. Rinse the beans under cool water, removing and discarding any damaged beans and any foreign material. Place the beans in a large pot with the cold water and 1 teaspoon of the salt, and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce the heat, and cook gently for 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours, until the beans are tender but not mushy. Set aside; do not drain.
2. Cut the beef into 1-inch pieces, and then chop coarsely by hand or in a food processor. When using a food processor, place about 1/2 pound of the chuck in the bowl at a time, and pulse the motor for about 10 seconds.
3. Place the pieces of ham rind or bacon in a saucepan, and cook over medium heat for about 10 minutes, until most of the fat has been rendered and the rind is dry and brown. Add the 1 pound of onion pieces and the beef, and cook, stirring, for about 5 minutes, until the meat separates and loses its red color. Stir in the garlic, jalapeno pepper and tomatoes.
4. Using a mini-chopper or small coffee grinder, process the coriander seeds, and add them to the saucepan, along with the cumin powder, mustard, red pepper flakes, chili powder and the remaining 2 teaspoons of salt. Bring the mixture to a boil. Combine the meat mixture and the beans (liquid and all), return to a boil, cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 1 hour. (The mixture will be soupy.)
5. Spoon over boiled rice, and garnish with the Cheddar cheese and the chopped onion. Pass the Tabasco sauce and the corn tortillas or tacos.
Yield: 12 servings.
 
Boiled Rice
 
Total time: 25 minutes
 
 1 tablespoon corn oil
 2 cups white long-grain rice
 4 cups water
 1 teaspoon salt.
1. Place the oil and rice in a saucepan, and mix well. Add the water and salt, and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, over high heat. Cover tightly, reduce the heat to very low, and simmer gently for 20 minutes.
2. Fluff with a fork, and serve with the chili.
Yield: 12 servings.
 
Apple Fritters
 
Total time: 12 minutes
 
 1 cup all-purpose flour
 1 egg
 1 cup ice-cold water
 1 pound apples (about 3), any variety
 1 1/2 cup canola oil
 1/2 cup granulated sugar for dusting the fritters.
1. Put the flour, egg and a third of the water into a bowl, and mix vigorously with a whisk. The mixture will be fairly thick. When smooth, add the remaining water, and mix again until the water is incorporated.
2. Stand the unpeeled apples upright on a board, and cut them vertically into 1/2-inch-thick slices, stopping when you reach the core. Pivot the apple, and cut again, until only the core remains. Discard the core, stack the apple slices, and cut them into 1/2-inch-wide sticks. You should have 4 cups. Stir the apple sticks into the batter.
3. In a large, heavy skillet heat the oil to 375 degrees. When hot, pour about 1/3 cup of the batter into the pan for each fritter, making four or five at a time. Using two forks, spread the batter so that it is not more than 1/2 inch thick. Cook for about 3 minutes on each side, until brown and crisp.
4. Drain the fritters on paper towels, and transfer them to a rack. Sprinkle liberally with the sugar, and serve immediately.
Yield: about 12 fritters.

HEADLINE: BASKETBALL;
Lakers Slowly Adjust To Life Without Magic

BYLINE: By MICHAEL MARTINEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 12

 BODY:
By the end of practice today, the players began to allow themselves a small luxury. They finally smiled.
It was a small step for the Los Angeles Lakers, who acknowledge that things will never really be the same without Magic Johnson. But they are slowly adjusting. 
 They have one victory and one loss since Johnson's announcement last Thursday that he was retiring after testing positive for the virus that causes AIDS. Now, they are trying to learn how to play without him.
"The guys are coming to grips with it," Coach Mike Dunleavy said after a morning workout at Loyola Marymount University. "They know he's not going to take part in practice; they know he's not going to be playing in games. There will always be a piece missing, but everybody understands what we're trying to do."
 
A Record of 2-3
 Five games, and only two victories, into the season, Dunleavy is attempting to reshape his team after losing its most important component. For 12 seasons, Johnson jump-started the offense, found seams in opposing defenses, took advantage of his height and made unfathomable passes.
"So much of what we did was predicated on his handling the ball," said Jerry West, the Lakers' general manager. "Give it to him, and he'll make a pass that nobody else can make. This team didn't win so many games simply because of Magic, but we did lose our team leader and best player, and that's something you don't replace."
In fact, the Lakers have no immediate plans to acquire another player. Tony Smith, a second-year guard from Marquette, is eligible to come off the injured list, but he was unable to scrimmage today because his injured right ankle remained tender. Even though he may not be available Thursday when the Lakers play at Golden State, West insists on caution.
"I don't think we'll do anything yet," West said. "We're hopeful of getting Tony back this week, which should give us depth in the backcourt and another ball-handler."
 
Salary-Cap Requirement
 From an economic standpoint, the Lakers will eventually have to sign someone or suffer for it next season. Under the rules of the salary cap, they can use half of Johnson's base salary of $2.5 million this season to acquire a replacement. If they don't, they lose the $1.25 million next season.
Even Dunleavy has said he would prefer to work with his current group rather than bring in a new player. But at the moment, with Smith out and with center Vlade Divac slow to recover from a back injury, the Lakers are short-handed and somewhat disjointed.
Finding a way to run their offense without the gifted Johnson remains their primary concern.
"We're definitely going to have to play a different brand of basketball," said Byron Scott, who was Johnson's backcourt mate for eight seasons. "Some of us will have to learn more things on a different level. It will call for individuals to give attention to playing a new type of game."
The loss of Johnson hurts the Lakers in two specific major ways, Dunleavy said.
"We can't post up the point guard like we used to, and we can't do some of the switching we did in the past to take advantage of the fact he was 6-foot-9," the coach said. "Almost every one of our plays has changed because they ended up with us throwing the ball into Earvin, who would take advantage of it in some way. That's all changed."
A lot of the new responsibility has fallen to Sedale Threatt, who was acquired from Seattle in October to be Johnson's backup. Now, Threatt is the Lakers' starting point guard.
"This team is used to winning," Threatt said. "The loss of Earvin is tough, but we have to get over it. He's still a part of the team, but now we have to find ways to win games."
 
'An Old Guy'
 Threatt, who is 6-2 and 30 years old, insists he is undaunted by his new role, even though he may be asked to do more within the offense. He is off to a creditable start, averaging 17.6 points and 7.6 assists a game.
"I'm an old guy," Threatt said. "I've been in this league for nine years. The biggest thing is learning the system."
And for the Lakers as a whole, the biggest thing is living without Johnson. The question now is: Are they just another basketball team?
"That could conceivably be," West said. "We don't know. People get hysterical when a tragedy strikes, and that's what has happened here. But we have to let this team see where it's going to go."
 
REBOUNDS
 Most of the players had already left when the Rev. JESSE JACKSON arrived unexpectedly. He spoke briefly with BYRON SCOTT and SAM PERKINS, then handed out a three-page statement to reporters that suggested that "the entire culture" must reassess its lifestyles and that called for a separate AIDS budget from the Government.

HEADLINE: Son of Kemp-Roth: Still Wrong

 BODY:
Alarmed by recession, Housing Secretary Jack Kemp has broken ranks with President Bush and proposed cutting taxes to prod the economy. Coming from Mr. Kemp, the idea is no surprise; he is, after all, a true believer. He was a sponsor of the Kemp-Roth tax and budget reductions that slashed income tax rates 10 years ago.
What Washington did then was accumulate $2 trillion of debt, and mire itself in an endless budget quagmire. Washington -- including Mr. Kemp -- should have learned something indelible from the experience. Tax cuts didn't solve economic problems then, and won't solve them now. 
 What probably makes Mr. Kemp's sudden initiative all the more galling for President Bush is that it embraces Mr. Bush's benighted ideas for cutting taxes on capital gains -- profit from the sale of investments. Such cuts supposedly would ignite investment, and the economy.
Mr. Kemp's fervent faith defies the evidence. Even if Mr. Bush felt free, in the face of his budget agreement with Congress, to make his capital gains proposal again, the White House's own estimates look trivial. It would boost production by only about one-fifth of 1 percent.
Triviality is the least of it. The capital gains ideas now circulating would produce a windfall profit for rich families on past investment. That couldn't possibly spur future investment. Neither are they targeted on productive investments like equipment. Finally, these capital gains cuts will probably cost the Treasury revenue, adding to the deficit and siphoning money away from private investors.
Mr. Kemp also goes along with the idea of reinstating tax breaks for higher-income families who put money into individual retirement accounts. If such a plan were carefully tailored, and paid for with some other tax, it would be worth considering. But that's not what Mr. Kemp, or sponsors of other tax cut proposals, have in mind.
The 1990 budget law requires Congress, come 1994, to cut spending drastically or else raise taxes. To throw away tax revenues now -- as Mr. Kemp recklessly proposes -- would force Congress to hack at spending for job training, child nutrition and other investments for the future.
There are good reasons Congress might wish to consider targeted tax cuts -- if offset by tax increases. For example, the low-income tax credit costs only $300 million but it accounts for an astounding 90 percent of multi-family low income housing starts. This lifeline to the poor hangs in the balance even as the Housing Secretary calls grandly for sweeping tax reductions.
Costly tax cuts that empty Washington's coffers can only starve public programs. Again. One orgy of Reagan-era tax and spending cuts is enough.

HEADLINE: We Need a National Health Plan for Everyone

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The "solution" you suggest for the national health care crisis in "A Plausible Revolution in Health" (editorial, Oct. 29) would work about as well as a Band-Aid on a compound fracture. 
 "Managed competition, a combination of public and private managed care plans" would go only halfway toward fighting medical inflation. The costs of managed plans may be rising "only half as fast" as traditional health plans, but they're still growing at least twice as fast as the inflation rate. And managed-care plans don't provide the choice of doctors Americans overwhelmingly want to preserve, according to all surveys.
Having the uninsured buy their own insurance from a Government insurer "at a fee based on income" is an insurance industry dream: The Government takes the bad risks, for which the Treasury or insurance premium payers pay the freight. Care providers keep wasting labor and money billing for services and supplies, and filling out all kinds of forms for the 1,500 insurance companies that pay differently for the same services -- after they do their best to pay nothing at all. And all the while, the profits of insurers keep running in the billions.
A better answer is offered by H.R. 1300, the universal health insurance bill, which was introduced by Representative Marty Russo of Chicago, with 40 co-sponsors in the House. Establishing "global" budgets and reasonable fee schedules for providers and eliminating duplication of expensive high-tech equipment effectively controls costs, as proved in Canada. A single governmental payer affords enormous savings in administrative costs (the General Accounting Office says $67 billion a year; others predict much more).
These billions pay to extend health care to every man, woman and child in the country, without a penny in out-of-pocket costs. Everyone chooses physicians, hospitals and other providers. And, believe it or not, it costs almost everybody less than we're spending now, without reducing the quality or quantity of our health care.
Adoption of "managed competition" and other "incremental" reforms proposed by the health care industry wouldn't end the health care crisis, only deepen it at a slower rate. Worse, the day when we adopt a comprehensive plan like H.R. 1300 will be delayed.

Not a Yawn: Real Help

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN

 BODY:
Technical assistance: that's what President Bush and Western allies typically offer when Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union plead for help. To most Americans, technical assistance is a yawner, about as enthralling as double-entry bookkeeping.
But as applied by Dan Arbess, who advises the Czechoslovak Government, and Peter Derby, who advises the Russian government, and dozens of other Western lawyers, accountants and investment bankers, technical assistance is economic sustenance, not pabulum. 
 Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary are rushing to market economies; the Soviet republics may soon do so. The key is to turn over state-owned enterprises to domestic and foreign investors. But that is a formidable task where there are no markets to signal fair, sensible purchase prices. Enter technical assistance.
In Poland, Western advisers have helped design an ingenious plan to give every adult citizen indirect title to hundreds of factories. In Czechoslovakia, they've appraised bids that foreign investors make for factories and have helped devise novel ways to auction hotels and other enterprises. In Russia, Mr. Derby, an American investment banker, is helping draft commercial codes and securities laws. Stephen Fuzesi, a New York lawyer born in Budapest, is doing the same in Hungary.
The stakes are huge. If securities laws are porous, ordinary citizens will lose their life's savings. That's why Poland has written, with Western help, intricate safeguards against exploitation of neophyte investors. And if foreign bids are inexpertly evaluated, countries will be fleeced of their most valuable property. That almost happened in Czechoslovakia, where the shoe industry was nearly given away to a foreign investor before Mr. Arbess and others found the offer full of debt, not equity, guaranteed to exploit consumers behind high tariff walls.
Foreign investment is not a zero-sum game: what's good for I.B.M. need not be bad for Eastern Europe. But when economic decisions are made by personal negotiation rather than impersonal markets, abuse can become rampant. And abuse could trigger public backlash against further market reforms.
Officials in former Communist governments need Western advice not because they're inept, but because they're inexperienced. In a matter of months they have been forced to drop what they know best -- centralized control -- and adopt what the West knows best -- capitalism. It will take years to develop their own experts.
The Westerners charge handsomely, but most aren't there for profit. If that were their primary motive, Mr. Arbess and company would have switched sides and only represented foreign investors. Western experts have made success more likely for newcomers to capitalism. It may sound lifeless when President Bush offers former Communist countries technical assistance. But technical assistance may well be the most precious gift America has to give them.

(Same Old) New Duke

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN

 BODY:
Some people wonder why so much has been made of David Duke's plastic surgery. The answer is simple. David Duke's new face is a symbol of what he seeks to do: turn back the clock and pretend to be something he is not.
For every avowal in the Louisiana gubernatorial race that he is a changed man, there is a revelation about his recent past that gives it the lie. Well into the 1980's he still had the standard racist/anti-Semite spiel: race mixing is ruining America, segregation is the ideal, the Holocaust didn't happen. Even the views of the new improved Duke are more of the same, couched in politicospeak with a nudge and a wink at his right radical supporters. 
 If you don't speak white supremacist, here's a handy guide: "the liberal social welfare system which encourages the rising illegitimate welfare birthrate" means "poor black people are having babies on your tax dollars." Mr. Duke has been confronted repeatedly with the fact that the average welfare family in Louisiana consists of only two children, and that the increased allotment for an additional child is a whopping $11 a week, just enough to afford a steady diet of cold cereal. But the rhetoric works better without the facts.
All over this country, among a substantial group of its citizens, there is longing, sometimes even organized support, for an era gone by. It was an era that saw the biggest, most pervasive, most extensive racial preference program in this nation's history, during which one group was routinely given preferred access to jobs, status, even votes.
That group was white men.
Things are in a mess in America right now: social problems that seem to have no simple solutions, economic problems that seem governed by nothing so much as the vagaries of fortune. And when things are tough there is always a temptation to go back: to go back to the days of illegal abortion as though that will make women stop trying to end pregnancies, to go back to the days of limited options as though that will soothe people overwhelmed by choices. Opponents of affirmative action say they want a return to a meritocracy. The meritocracy they evoke is the one in which, somehow, only white guys made the cut.
Ronald Reagan was the standard-bearer of the backward march; it was inevitable that someone, somewhere, would take Mr. Reagan's neglect of the poor and the disenfranchised and turn it into active hostility. No thoughtful conservative stepped up to the plate to talk about real inadequacies in the social welfare system; into the vacuum stepped a man who can have his face refashioned a dozen times and still have prejudice written all over him.
If this backwards ethos swept the United States, it would be a disaster. But it cannot. The most influential public figures in this country over the last month have all three been black, as though someone was trying to send a cosmic message to the David Dukes of the world, to counter them with Clarence Thomas, Anita Hill and Magic Johnson.
If the Duke ethos prevails in Louisiana, the state will suffer. Everyone has noted that millions of dollars in convention business will go elsewhere; in fact if David Duke loses, it will not be because he is a bigot but because he inspires fear that the Super Bowl will shun the Superdome. And perhaps some taxpayers will compute the cost of inept and inexperienced government. Mr. Duke's highest executive position has been as Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and his most intensive management training appears to have been at Est seminars. Demagogues make good dictators, but poor managers. Tax cuts are notoriously easy to promise and difficult to deliver.
People are angry in his state, as they are throughout this country, and it may relieve the pain for a short time simply to have someone personify their anger in rank prejudice. After that, people want results. They will want to know whether the man can run his state as well as his mouth, and I bet the answer is no. Mr. Duke cannot change the face of this country, or even of a part of it; it's not enough to take us back to the 19th century when what most of us seek is a road map for the 21st. It's not enough to foment simplistic hatreds when what we really need is some way to coexist in an increasingly complex world.

Earnings Decline in Quarter At Several Large Retailers

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The J. C. Penney Company, the Limited Inc. and Nordstrom Inc. said yesterday that their earnings for the third quarter fell from depressed levels of a year earlier, while the May Department Stores Company said its profits edged up 1 percent.
 Another retailer, the Caldor Corporation, said its third-quarter loss narrowed from the corresponding period last year. The improvement reflected the company's stock sale, the proceeds of which were used to retire debt. 
The results provided further evidence of the consumer spending slump that has sliced into the earnings of many retailers. A predicted rebound in spending has not happened, as consumers are weighed down by concerns about the economy and their jobs.
 Penney, Nordstrom and May also reported earnings declines in 1990 quarter, in the early months of the Persian Gulf war and the recession. The Limited's results were little changed during the period.
 Following are details of the retailers' results.
 
Penney
 The Dallas-based Penney said its profits fell by 13.4 percent, to $116 million, or 93 cents a share, compared with $134 million, or $1.07 a share, in the comparable period a year earlier. Its revenues fell slightly, to $4.20 billion from $4.24 billion.
 The retailer attributed its results to a sales drop. The consumer spending drought has taken a heavy toll on Penney.
 In the third quarter of last year, Penney's earnings plunged nearly 36 percent. The company's shares rose $1.875 yesterday, to $52, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Limited
 The nation's largest specialty apparel retailer said its earnings for the quarter that ended on Nov. 2 fell by 14 percent, to $72.8 million, or 20 cents a share, from $84.9 million, or 23 cents a share. Its sales rose by 15 percent, to $1.43 billion from $1.24 billion.
 Leslie H. Wexner, the chairman, cited the weak economy and slow store traffic in the quarter. But he said, "External factors are not an excuse for such mediocre performance."
 "I believe it is always our merchandising that produces success or failure," he said.
 The stock of the Limited, which is based in Columbus, Ohio, rose 75 cents yesterday, to $26.75, on the Big Board.
 
Nordstrom
 Nordstrom, based in Seattle, said its earnings fell by 4.9 percent, to $19.4 million, or 24 cents a share, in the quarter that ended on Oct. 31. That compared with $20.4 million, or 25 cents a share, in the 1990 quarter, when earnings fell by 7 percent.
 Its sales rose by 8.2 percent, to $687 million from $634.8 million.
 Nordstrom said its sales growth rate slowed during the quarter after improving in the first half of its fiscal year. The trend reflected the slowdown in consumer spending.
The company's stock rose 62.5 cents yesterday, to $39.125, in over-the-counter trading.
 
May Department Stores
 May Department Stores, based in St. Louis, said it earned $91 million, or 70 cents a share, in the quarter that ended on Nov. 2, up slightly from $90 million, or 69 cents a share. Its revenues rose by 8 percent, to $2.56 billion from $2.37 billion.
 Department stores have been particularly hard-hit by the slide in consumer spending. May's stores include Lord & Taylor, May and Hecht's. It also owns the Payless Shoesource chain.
 May, whose stock rose 62.5 cents yesterday on the Big Board, to $51.875, said it was merging its Thalhimer Brothers division with its Hecht's operation.
 The move will close seven Thalhimer's stores in Virginia and North Carolina.
 
Caldor
 Caldor, the discount-store chain based in Norwalk, Conn., reported a $3.8 million loss, compared with a loss of $5.7 million, before adjustments and other items, in the 1990 period. The company's sales rose by 4.5 percent, to $417.8 million from $399.8 million.
 The retailer, which returned to public ownership earlier this year after a leveraged buyout, is still paying down the costs of the transaction.
 Caldor's stock rose 37.5 cents on the Big Board yesterday, to $14.625.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 14, 1991, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a brief report in the Company News column in some copies of Business Day yesterday misstated the reason for a fourth-quarter charge taken by the Phillips Petroleum Company against pretax earnings of $15 million. It results from previous staff cuts, announced in September.

A Wave of Calls On Bonds Is Seen

BYLINE: By Jan Rosen

 BODY:
WITH interest rates on the skids, credit- market experts see a wave of bond calls not experienced for years. Just as many homeowners refinance mortgages when rates turn down, bond issuers call, or redeem, securities, so they can refinance at lower rates.
Even the Treasury recently called one issue for the first time in three decades. Although Treasury securities have been noncallable since November 1984, some $78 billion of older Treasury issues are outstanding. The call trend is most pronounced in the municipal market, where bonds are commonly issued with 10-year call protection, which is now expiring on many tax-exempts issued in the early 1980's at high interest rates. Corporate issues may also be called. 
 "Short-term rates are dropping so low that it may behoove issuers to refund the securities," said Stephen P. Rappaport, manager of municipal research for Prudential Securities.
John Breazeale, senior vice president and managing director of fixed-income securities at Mackenzie Investment Management Inc., the distributor and investment adviser of the Mackenzie Group of Funds, Boca Raton, Fla., said, "This may be wonderful for the issuer, but not for the investor."
Investors who have bonds on which call protection will expire in the next few years have a choice. They can hold onto their bonds to keep the income stream as long as possible, or, since bond prices go up as yields go down, and they are now holding appreciated securities, they can sell at a profit and reinvest the proceeds.
Deciding what to do "depends partly on your interest-rate forecast," Mr. Rappaport said, "because an investor who decides to hold the bonds may end up being forced to reinvest at much lower rates than he would have had he sold the bonds at the present time."
It also depends on whether the investor needs the bond income to pay for a current need like tuition bills, he added, or whether the holding is part of a portfolio whose total return will be affected if the bonds are sold before they are called.
The interest-rate forecast of most Wall Street analysts is for a continued downtrend. For example, Edward J. Campbell, senior economist with Brown Brothers Harriman & Company, expects interest rates to decline further before they turn back up. "This is a recovery that feels like a recession, a grudging, subpar recovery," he said. "Sideways movement in the economy is conducive to lower interest rates."
He foresees inflation remaining around 3.5 percent in the next year and the gross national product growing at a 2 to 2.5 percent annual rate. That could push the long bond down closer to 7 percent than its current 8 percent, he said. However, he expects short-term rates to turn back up in the next year.
"The yield curve now is over 300 basis points," or hundredths of a percentage point, "a very large amount," Mr. Campbell said. He anticipates "a less steep yield curve," with short-term rates climbing to 5.5 percent by spring from 4.5 percent now. Mr. Breazeale of Mackenzie said, "I've been concerned with this issue for a long time," and his general response as a portfolio manager has been to avoid bonds that lack call protection. However, he buys some callable issues if he sees a bargain.
But individual investors have not always been astute about call protection. Richard Ganz, president of the Fixed Income Management Group, Melville, L.I., which manages bond portfolios for the wealthy and advises brokers and financial planners, said: "It's a mistake to buy a bond and forget about it. You have to monitor that investment."
He gave these figures for call vulnerability in municipals. In 1981, $46.1 billion of munis were issued at an average rate of 11.3 percent, and with rates now closer to 6 percent, "the '81 issues are being called." In 1982, there were $77.2 billion issued at 11.7 percent; in 1983, $83.3 billion at 9.5 percent; in 1984, $101.8 billion at 10.1 percent, and in 1985, $204 billion at 9.1 percent.
"If I hold an issue today that is subject to call in 1995, I have a substantial gain in it," Mr. Ganz said. "I can sell it and buy a bond that will not be taken away." It could be worth $120 today, and would be called at $102 in 1995, he said.
"That bond is going down, but if the trend of rates is down, other bonds are going up in price," he said, so it can make sense to take the capital gain and buy an issue with a lower current yield to get the possibility of future price appreciation.
That entails some risk, he noted. "For income-intensive investors who need every dollar of yield, it may benefit them to stay with it," he said.
Mr. Ganz added two notes of caution for people who are reinvesting: Do not shop yield alone; buy quality, looking at the underlying bond, not just insurance. Also, look at total return on any bond -- that is, appreciation plus yield.

HEADLINE: Lawyers Now Learning Basics of Business

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
Corporate lawyers are known to call upon many talents to get their client companies out of jams, but odd as it seems, basic business acumen is not usually among them.
In the last year, however, several law firms across the country have started to change that. 
 Some, like Winston & Strawn in Chicago, have hired outside consultants to teach associates and partners alike how to peruse balance sheets and annual reports to understand their clients better. Other firms, including Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher in Los Angeles, have taught their lawyers sophisticated budget techniques that have allowed them, among other things, to begin providing clients with monthly and quarterly estimates of their services and costs.
Still others, like Malouf Lynch Jackson Kessler & Collins in Dallas, have implored their lawyers to become experts on their clients' financial health, as well as that of their clients' competitors.
"Right now it's on the agenda of every major law firm in the country," Brad Hildebrandt, chairman of Hildebrandt Inc., an international legal consulting firm, said of the trend toward on-the-job business education. "They're waking up and realizing their lawyers don't have a clue about business-related topics."
In the 1980's, corporate lawyers were occupied with the legal details of a litany of mergers, acquisitions and real estate transactions that left many of them neither the time nor the inclination to examine those deals in the context of a bigger financial picture.
"They never needed to," said Gary L. Fairchild, the managing partner of Winston & Strawn, a 138-year-old firm that also has offices in New York and Washington. "The legal profession has had the luxury of being in such demand that clients would tolerate behavior which I think gained the profession the reputation of being arrogant and disrespectful to business."
But the sluggish economy and the steep decline in the number of major financial transactions have dried up that demand and rocked firms from inside and out.
Many prestigious firms that expanded wantonly in the 1980's have been forced in the 1990's to contract, through layoffs of associates and even partners, in some cases. Forty-four percent of the nation's 250 largest firms have shrunk in size this year, compared with 16.6 percent in 1990, according to a survey published last month in The National Law Journal.
 
Formal and Informal Approaches
 It is hard to say just how many firms are beefing up their business knowledge. Some offer classes on business literacy, while others ruminate more informally on such topics as balance sheets. But lawyers and legal consultants agree that such activity has picked up in the last year.
Their clients, also sapped by the recession, have less work to offer, further increasing the competition among the law firms. Not only are those clients seeking more cost-effective legal service, but they are also increasingly looking for an edge that differentiates one law office from another.
To that end, Winston & Strawn, whose clients include National Westminster Bank USA and Heller Financial Inc., a subsidiary of Fuji Bank of Japan, has inaugurated a program called Above Client Expectations, ACE. Through the program, the firm assembles small groups of its 500 lawyers and drills them in a four-day business course. The teacher is Wiliam J. Flannery, the president of WJF Institute, a consulting firm in Austin, Tex., that specializes in training lawyers.
 
Reading a Balance Sheet
 In a presentation on financial research, for example, Mr. Flannery, who has a degree from the University of Baltimore law school, teaches the lawyers how to use basic financial documents -- from balance sheets to annual reports to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
For a discussion of ways to improve service, Mr. Flannery videotapes the lawyers' interactions with mock clients, and then evaluates their performances.
The goal of such training, which most lawyers have not had in law school, is to make them comfortable discussing a client's overall strategy. That, Mr. Fairchild said, helps earn a client's confidence.
"We're not trying to make instant experts out of our attorneys," Mr. Fairchild said. "What we're trying to do is give them the resources to deal intelligently with the management of the company so they can help the company succeed."
 
Preparing Estimates of Fees
 At Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, which has 715 lawyers in 18 offices, an increase in clients' questions about legal costs over the last year prompted the firm to borrow a standard technique from the business world: for the first time, its partners are preparing detailed budgets of what a case might cost.
Like other firms, Gibson, Dunn had traditionally avoided all but the most cursory of budgets, because the twists and turns of litigation, for example, are difficult to anticipate. But a customized computer software program on budgets, which the firm developed with an outside consultant, has helped generate better estimates of the hours that may be spent on services like pleadings, depositions and case planning. Those hours are then translated into dollars.
"This gives you something to sit down with the client and discuss," said Robert E. Cooper, the firm's vice chairman.
 
Fewer Surprises
 And to account for the vagaries of the legal process, those discussions now take place monthly and quarterly, meaning there are fewer surprises along the way.
The procedures have pleased Harland Reid, assistant general counsel at Nissan Motor, which is a client of Gibson, Dunn.
"It makes you focus early, in a detailed way, on what it's going to take to get to the result you want," Mr. Reid said.
 
Literal Field Work
 Though Gibson, Dunn and Winston & Strawn are among the nation's largest firms, smaller corporate firms like Malouf Lynch in Dallas, have started playing closer attention to business issues.
In a fresh approach, Malouf Lynch has taught its 16 lawyers to immerse themselves not only in the businesses of their clients, but also in those of the competition.
Gary S. Kessler, a Malouf Lynch partner, has as a client Gustafson Inc., an agricultural chemical unit of the Uniroyal Chemical Company. Mr. Kessler took his firm's know-thy-client mandate to heart and traveled to Kansas, where he quizzed farmers about the products they use, including an agricultural pesticide made by Gustafson.
In response to the increasing globalization of business, some firms are including the corporate customs of other countries in their training.
At Schulte Roth & Zabel, a New York firm, the topic is Japan, where the firm is harnessing an increasing stable of banks and securities firms.
Nine months ago the firm hired Bonnie L. Dixon, an associate with three years' experience at a Japanese law firm, who has since conducted lectures and private consultations to educate Schulte Roth's lawyers on Japanese business.
Ms. Dixon has, for example, discussed Japanese corporate structure, explaining that a general manager is ranked higher than a senior manager, who is higher than a section chief. She has also touched on areas of etiquette -- such as how to give gifts and how to seat executives in order of importance -- so that the firm's lawyers will not offend their clients through ignorance.
"We want to avoid any possibility of being described as arrogant lawyers," Ms. Dixon said. "We're trying to make some accommodation to their business practices."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off in U.S. Trading And Gold Is Up Moderately

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mostly lower in domestic trading yesterday in a muted reaction to a surge in inflation last month. It rose overseas.
Gold prices rose modestly, gaining 70 cents on the Commodity Exchange in New York, to $356.60 an ounce. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $356.10, up 45 cents. 
 Analysts said the Government's announcement that wholesale prices rose seven-tenths of 1 percent in October took the foreign exchange markets by surprise but had little impact.
"Not much credence was put on it by the market," said Ronald H. Holzer, chief dealer with Harris Trust and Company in Chicago.
Ordinarily, a surge in prices would be expected to move the dollar higher. Traders believe a unfavorable producer price report makes the Federal Reserve more likely to push interest rates up to control inflation. The dollar is supported by higher rates, which increase foreign demand for American investments.
But the Fed is seen as more concerned about the weak economy than a jump in inflation, so traders are shrugging off the one-month rise in prices.
Mr. Holzer said the dollar was locked in a narrow range. Traders are "continuing to look for evidence on the economy," he added.
More inflation news is scheduled for today, with the release of October consumer price figures. The Government will also announce real earnings figures for October, followed tomorrow by the October industrial production and September business inventories figures.
The British pound rose to $1.7745 in New York, from $1.7700 on Tuesday. But earlier in London, sterling cost $1.7715, down from $1.7730.
The dollar advanced against the Japanese yen, rising to 130.00 yen in New York, from 129.95 on Tuesday. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.03 yen, to 129.98. In London, it was quoted at 130.13.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's prices, included: 1.6360 German marks, down from 1.6400; 1.4515 Swiss francs, down from 1.4535; 5.5900 French francs, down from 5.6045; 1,231.00 Italian lire, down from 1,235.00, and 1.13145 Canadian dollars, down from 1.13475.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late on Tuesday, included: 1.6380 German marks, up from 1.6355; 1.4515 Swiss francs, up from 1.4508; 5.5960 French francs, up from 5.5880; 1.8455 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8425; 1,232.60 Italian lire, up from 1,231.50, and 1.1321 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1315.

Mercedes-Benz to Review Account With McCaffrey

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
IN a decision that left agency, and industry, executives stunned, Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc. said yesterday that it was putting up for review its estimated $90 million account that has been at McCaffrey & McCall since 1979.
The unexpected announcement came in a statement by Mike Jackson, the senior vice president for marketing and sales at the German automobile maker's American subsidiary in Montvale, N.J. 
 "McCaffrey & McCall continues to serve us well," he said. "However, we believe it is a prudent business decision to examine what other resources are available to insure we are receiving the best representation we can get, especially in today's difficult and competitive business climate."
A spokeswoman for Mercedes-Benz, Linda Paulmeno, said there would be no elaboration on the statement. She said, however, the decision to begin the review "is most definitely not a reflection on the work the agency is providing us with."
Ms. Paulmeno compared the review, which is to start later this month, to other steps by Mercedes-Benz to re-evaluate its business operations since 1988. The luxury car line has been under increasingly intense pressure to defend its territory from Japanese rivals -- Acura, Infiniti and Lexus -- as well as to cope with the continuing soft economy.
Through October, Mercedes-Benz's sales in the United States were down by 20.7 percent from the first 10 months of last year.
McCaffrey is being included in the review, which Mercedes-Benz expects to have completed in February.
"We're going to participate, absolutely," Bob Cherins, McCaffrey's chairman and chief executive, said yesterday, "with vim and vigor."
Agency executives are "disappointed" that Mercedes-Benz wants a review, Mr. Cherins said, "but we have every confidence that we will win, and win big."
McCaffrey has been turning out stylish, understated campaigns for Mercedes-Benz models, most recently under the theme "Engineered like no other car in the world," since it won the account 12 years ago from Ogilvy & Mather. McCaffrey is now running a significant campaign to introduce the redesigned Mercedes S-Class, the most expensive line of Mercedes-Benz automobiles ever.
Mercedes-Benz has retained a marketing and advertising consultant to advise it during the review. He is Bill Weilbacher of the Bismark Corporation in Dennis, Mass., who spent 30 years in the agency business at shops like Dancer Fitzgerald Sample.
Mr. Weilbacher said yesterday that he could not discuss his work for Mercedes-Benz. Among the recent reviews he has handled, he listed two in which the client changed agencies: Domino's Pizza Inc., which moved to Grey Advertising from Group 243 Inc., and the Prudential Insurance Company of America, which left Backer Spielvogel Bates for Lowe & Partners.
So far, no agencies other than McCaffrey will participate, or be invited to participate, in the review, Ms. Paulmeno said. Already, though, industry executives are rounding up the usual suspects -- the mid-sized and large creatively focused agencies that do not possess that badge of industry respectability, a car account.
Among those mentioned yesterday as possibilities were Altschiller Reitzfeld Tracy-Locke in New York; Carmichael Lynch in Minneapolis; McCabe & Company in New York; McElligott Wright Morrison White in Minneapolis, and TBWA Advertising, also in New York.
The Mercedes-Benz announcement is the latest in an unprecedented skein of decisions by giant marketers to put their large ad accounts up for review. Among others now pending are those of Amoco Oil; Bacardi Imports, also currently handled by McCaffrey, and the Compaq Computer Corporation.
In the two most recent car-account reviews, both companies switched agencies: Subaru of America, which left Levine, Huntley, Vick & Beaver, for Wieden & Kennedy, and American Isuzu Motors, which left Della Femina, McNamee Inc. for Goodby, Berlin & Silverstein.

Money Fund Yields Move Sharply Lower

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields on both tax-exempt and taxable money market funds fell sharply in the week that ended yesterday, mostly in response to the Federal Reserve's recent easing of credit, according to IBC/Donoghue's, which monitors the funds and issues The Money Fund Report.
"We expect it will take a few weeks before we see any further action by the Federal Reserve," said Walter S. Frank, chief economist for IBC/ Donoghue's. "The all-important Christmas season will determine the Fed's next move." 
 He reported that total assets of the tax-exempt funds had risen by $1.2 billion, to $91.1 billion. "That was a story for the week," he said, calling it a huge inflow of money. When yields on taxable funds are dropping fast, the tax-exempt funds become more attractive to investors, he explained.
 
Tax-Exempt Yield of 3.82%
 The average days to maturity of holdings in the tax-exempt portfolios slipped to 59 days from 60.
The seven-day compound average yield for tax-exempt funds was down to 3.82 percent, from 3.98 percent a week ago, while the seven-day simple yield dropped to 3.75 percent from 3.90 percent.
Meanwhile, the 30-day compound yield dropped to 3.89 percent from 3.93 percent, while the 30-day simple yield was 3.82 percent, down from 3.86 percent.
Among tax-exempt funds investing in individual state securities, the top New York fund was once again the Salomon Brothers New York Municipal Money Market Fund, with a seven-day compound of 4.50 percent this week, compared with 4.59 percent the previous week.
In Connecticut, the leader was Fidelity Spartan Connecticut Municipal Money Market Portfolio, reporting a yield of 4.13 percent, down from 4.28 percent.
Calvert Tax Free Reserves New Jersey led the way in that state, with a yield of 4.33 percent, down from 4.54 percent.
 
More Assets at Taxable Funds
 The highest-yielding tax-exempt fund among those with assets greater than $100 million continued to be Strong Municipal Money Market Fund, with a seven-day compound yield of 4.84, down from 5.05 percent.
Assets of taxable funds, Mr. Frank said, rose by $500 million, to a total of $464.1 billion. "All of the rise and more came from the institutional investors, because fund assets from such sources rose by $1.3 billion, which means that the public withdrew $800 million from the funds," he said.
"This is a pattern that we have seen recently and is to be expected." Mr. Frank explained that the institutions holding cash want the highest yield on it and they often find it in money funds when interest rates are falling. The public, he believes, is investing in the stock market or going into bond funds.
Average maturities of portfolio holdings were unchanged at 63 days.
 
Taxable Yield of 4.92%
 The seven-day compound yield on taxable funds dropped to 4.92 cent from 5.05 percent, while the seven-day simple yield for the taxable funds dropped to 4.81 percent from 4.93 pecent.
Meanwhile, the average compound 30-day yield fell to 5.06 percent from 5.11 percent, and the 30-day simple yield was down to 4.94 percent from 4.99 percent.
The top-yielding fund for the week among the taxables was Riverside Capital of Columbus, Ohio, with a seven-day compound yield of 6.07 percent.
By comparison, bank money market accounts, a main competitor of money funds, dropped to a yield of 4.78 percent, from 4.86 a week earlier, according to The Bank Rate Monitor's national index.

HEADLINE: Credit Survey Hints of Easing

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13

 BODY:
A survey of banks suggests that the worst of the cycle of credit tightening may be over, the Federal Reserve Board said today.
An October poll found that nearly all the banks surveyed said they had not changed their credit standards for approving business loan applications since an August survey. 
 "In light of the historical tendency of banks to report that they have tightened standards, the virtual absence of reported tightening of standards might be interpreted as indicating that standards actually have been eased," the central bank said in a footnote to the survey summary.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has said banks are partly responsible for a tightening of credit that has contributed greatly to the "demonstrably sluggish" condition of the economy.
The survey also found weakened business demand for loans from domestic banks in recent months, although there was some evidence of strength at foreign banks. The poll included both domestic and foreign banks operating in the United States.
"Demand for consumer installment loans also weakened recently, as did demand for home equity loans, though to a lesser extent," the summary said, while adding that "banks' willingness to provide consumer credit over the last three months appeared to increase some."

An Ethnic Push In Credit Cards

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn., Nov. 13

 BODY:
A Connecticut bank and a Spanish-language television network are embarking on a nationwide effort to market credit cards to Hispanic customers.
People's Bank, based in Bridgeport, began offering the cards today through a special toll-free number, and will make applications and monthly statements available in Spanish and English. 
 Telemundo Group Inc., one of two major Hispanic television networks, is co-sponsoring the Mastercard and Visa cards. The New York-based company will promote the cards through its 42 owned and affiliated stations, which reach 6 million Spanish-speaking households.
Advertising for the promotion, which will run on the Telemundo network, begins later this month in Miami and the San Francisco-San Jose area, and is scheduled to start early next year nationwide.
People's Bank hopes the offer will increase its base of credit card customers, who now number 300,000 in all 50 states. Telemundo hopes the offer will heighten the network's prestige and improve the financial standing of Hispanic people, whose use of credit cards lags far behind the general population's.
Both companies said Telemundo chose People's for the offer largely because of the bank's low 13.9 percent interest rate on credit card balances.

HEADLINE: LARGE RISE POSTED IN PRODUCER PRICES

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13

 BODY:
In an inflation report that startled analysts, prices received by American producers jumped seven-tenths of 1 percent in October, the biggest increase in a year, Government figures showed today. But close examination found the report much less worrisome than it first appeared.
Given the weak economy -- and perhaps lulled by a string of favorable reports -- most specialists had expected little change in the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods, which measures inflation in the cost of goods just before they reach retail shelves and showrooms. 
 Analysts said the report was likely to reduce the chances of a further easing of Federal Reserve monetary policy, a prospect that was not considered highly likely anyway because the central bank had moved just last week to lower interest rates.
 
Widespread Rise in Costs
 The surprise jump in producer prices, reflected in an array of products from energy to books, touched off quick declines in the securities markets. But then economists found the price data to be not so bad as the bottom line implied, and stock prices rebounded to finish with a modest gain for the day, while the bond market recovered about half its losses.
Most analysts, to one degree or another, regarded the October Producer Price Index as a fluke, a result of Labor Department difficulties in adjusting the figures to take account of seasonal variations. In addition, the October data gathered into one month a number of price increases, some of which seem unlikely to be sustained.
"I think it's an aberration," said Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montagu Economics. "We simply have not seen any sign of consumer or corporate demand for products" that would be consistent with high inflation, he added. "There's surplus labor, surplus capital all over."
The price of new cars, for example, rose five-tenths of 1 percent last month and that of light trucks surged 1.2 percent, today's report showed, but the figures are at odds with all the evidence about car sales. Indeed, auto makers issued another grim report today, saying sales were down 13.4 percent for the first 10 days of this month.
 
A Decline in One Sector
 Analysts said they were encouraged by the price report's finding that costs at the intermediate stage of production -- a sack of flour, say, as compared with a loaf of bread -- posted a decline of one-tenth of 1 percent, offsetting a September advance.
"The producer price increase appears to be an inflationary red herring in the road of a relatively non-inflationary, weak economy," said Ron Schreibman, vice president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, a trade association whose members pay the prices recorded by the finished-goods index.
"Producers increased prices on a broad range of goods in October," he said, "but whether these increases will stick, in the face of continued hesitancy to spend by consumers and businesses, remains to be seen."
There were some specialists, however, who found little to cheer in today's report, which included a rise of five-tenths of 1 percent in the so-called core inflation rate, the worst performance since January. The core rate, which omits the usually erratic food and energy components, was unchanged in September and monthly increases in the June-August period averaged just one-tenth of 1 percent.
 
A Negative Interpretation
 "A five-tenths of 1 percent core for finished goods is clearly a quantum difference from preceding months," said Joel Popkin, a former Labor Department price official who now runs a Washington consulting company.
Mr. Popkin, less inclined than many others to find significant improvement in the nation's price performance over the last year or two, described inflation as "intractable" and, though not accelerating, "not getting any better."
The increase in finished-goods prices, to a level 22.3 percent higher than its 1982 base but unchanged from its October 1990 level, was heavily influenced by a 1.7 percent gain in energy prices, twice the September increase, and a rise in food prices of four-tenths of 1 percent, which followed a decline of five-tenths of 1 percent in September.
Electricity and gasoline rose sharply, and liquefied petroleum gas soared 17.1 percent. But the price of natural gas fell, and home heating oil rose much less than in the preceding months.
Beef and veal, pork and processed chickens all turned higher last month, while dairy products and fish rose considerably more than in September. Fresh and dried fruits and vegetables and processed turkeys each fell more than 10 percent, the department reported, and confectionery products also declined.
 
Drugs, Soap and Books
 Elsewhere, prescription drugs climbed 2.2 percent, soaps and synthetic detergents jumped 4.7 percent, tires rose 1.7 percent, books rose 3.1 percent and tobacco products rose eight-tenths of 1 percent for the second straight month, after rising 1.1 percent in August.
Consumer durable goods, including cars, advanced eight-tenths of 1 percent in October after a decline of two-tenths of 1 percent in September. The department said the October rise "may be somewhat overstated" because of statistical problems related to the index's being directly adjusted for seasonal variation and not calculated as the sum of its seasonally adjusted components.
Janet L. Norwood, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, indicated that without the statistical problems the increase in the core rate, five-tenths of 1 percent, might have been one-tenth or two-tenths of a point less.
Among intermediate goods, the index for durable manufacturing materials, like aluminum and copper, fell six-tenths of 1 percent, while non-durable factory materials, like paperboard and paint, fell three-tenths.
Prices at the crude stage of production posted a rise of 1.8 percent, with energy prices accounting for most of that. The gain followed a drop of nine-tenths of 1 percent in September and unchanged readings in July and August.
Kevin Flanagan, an economist at Dean Witter Reynolds, said that while he was not particularly worried by today's report, which is to be followed on Thursday by the Consumer Price Index for October, the big increase should not be disregarded.
"It rekindles the thought that inflation forces are still with us," he declared.

HEADLINE: Report Says U.S. Industry In a Decline

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13

 BODY:
A new five-year Congressional study warns that American manufacturing has lost its competitive edge and recommends that the Government consider various strategies to halt the decline.
The Office of Technology Assessment, a Congressional research agency, said in its report that the Government could act in several areas: to help manufacturers obtain "patient capital" from investors who did not expect immediate rewards; to help upgrade education and training for managers, engineers and technicians; to help extend new technologies to companies throughout the manufacturing sector; to promote the development of new technologies, and to develop trade policies that protected infant industries."A protected home market can enable domestic firms to catch up with more advanced foreign companies without having to compete with them for domestic customers," the report said.
 
White House Opposition
 The Bush Administration has opposed such efforts as "industrial policy" that would reward industries with the most political influence, rather than those that would help America compete globally. Like the Reagan Administration, the Bush Administration has championed free markets and free trade, and has insisted that the market was better suited than Government to choose industries and technologies that would make aid the nation's welfare. 
 The report appeared to touch off a Democratic pep rally.
Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the Finance Committee chairman, noted last week's upset victory by Senator Harris L. Wofford, a Democrat, and said: "The message from Pennsylvania and from O.T.A. is the same -- it is time for change. It is time for policies that will put American manufacturers back in competition."
Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan, the chairman of the Banking Committee, said, "Our Government has refused to recognize the problem."
 
'Behind the Competition'
 The Congressional report stated flatly that "U.S. manufacturing is falling behind the competition." It noted that America's share of world imports rose to 17.5 percent in 1986, from 12.9 percent in 1970, while the United States share of world exports fell to 10.3 percent, from 13.8 percent in the same period.

HEADLINE: Bill on Credit Card Rates Advances

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13

 BODY:
The Senate approved a measure tonight to limit the interest rates that banks can charge credit card holders to 14 percent.
The measure passed 74 to 19. Some said it would help ease what they saw as a shortage of credit and others argued that it was pro-consumer. 
 The vote came a day after President Bush complained at a fund-raising luncheon in New York that credit card rates were too high and that lower rates would stimulate consumer confidence.
Although Mr. Bush's remarks were a result of a recent political strategy turn, an actual cap on interest rates is expected to be opposed by the Treasury Department, which views it as too restrictive on the banks.
Many banks charge customers rates of more than 19 percent, even though they pay far lower interest rates.
The measure approved today would limit interest to four points above the rate that the Internal Revenue Service charges to people who underpay their taxes.
The I.RR.S. rate is currently 10 percent.

HEADLINE: 13.4% Drop In Sales Of Vehicles

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 13

 BODY:
Sales of domestically built cars and light trucks fell 13.4 percent in early November, auto makers reported today. Some analysts said the figures confirmed their belief that the industry was in its second recession of 1991 after what had seemed a promising summer.
"It looks like it's a double-dip recession," said Ronald A. Glantz, an automotive analyst with Dean Witter in San Francisco. Many analysts had attributed sluggish sales through October to rebates and other big incentives in September, which helped raise the sales of leftover 1991 models. 
 But the continuing weak sales have cast doubt on that explanation, Mr. Glantz said. The industry can no longer talk itself into saying it was paying for the incentives in September with lost sales in November.
 
Showroom Traffic Drops
 Several dealers said showroom traffic and sales were down as much as 30 percent compared with 1990.
"We are dead in the water," said Joe Gentile, owner of Gentile Chrysler-Plymouth in Barrington, Ill., near Chicago. He said that after business soured further in the last two weeks, he started meeting with all customers before they left the showroom to give them a small gift. He has also doubled his direct mailings to former customers to drum up business. "You've got to do something to set yourself apart from other dealers," he said.
Maryann N. Keller, an analyst with Furman Selz Mager Dietz & Birney in New York, said the poor sales figures were consistent with other recent economic news. "Clearly something happened in late summer or early fall to change consumer attitudes," she added.
 
Annual Sales Rate Off
 Car sales declined 15.2 percent, to 116,848, from Nov. 1 to Nov. 10, the latest reporting period, when there were eight selling days, compared with nine selling days in the period last year. The seasonally adjusted sales rate of American-made cars was 5.7 million in early November, compared with 6.5 million at the corresponding time in 1990. Sales of light trucks, which includes pickups, mini-vans, and sport utility vehicles, dropped 10.1 percent, to 69,009.
Business is also down by roughly a third at Steven Mitchell's three dealerships near Hartford, which sell several lines of foreign and domestic cars. He estimates that his Subaru dealership, which sold 500 cars a year in the late 1980's, would not likely pass the 200 sales mark this year. In the last year, Mr. Mitchell has also trimmed his staff to 120 from 165, including telephone receptionists and sales managers.
But sales were roughly even with last year in recent weeks at Ackerman Chevrolet Geo in St. Louis, said Fred Sredl, general manager. Despite a drop in showroom traffic of roughly 25 percent, shoppers are generally interested in buying and have good credit, he said.
The Big Three's collective sales decline was 15.7 percent for cars in early November. Japanese companies that build cars in the United States reported an overall drop of 11.9 percent. These transplant manufacturers raised their share of the American car market to 13.5 percent in early November from 13 percent a year earlier. The Big Three saw their market share decline to 86.5 percent, from 87 percent a year earlier.
The General Motors Corporation's car sales dropped 7.7 percent, to 56,508, and light-truck sales dropped 20.7 percent, to 26,574.
The Ford Motor Company reported a drop of 22.5 percent in car sales to 32,466 and its light-truck sales fell 12.6 percent, to 24,439.
The Chrysler Corporation's car sales dropped 27.6 percent, to 12,150, based on estimates by Ward's. Its truck sales rose 21.3 percent, to 15,700.
The Honda Motor Company sold 6,983 American-built cars, a drop of 18.2 percent. The Toyota Motor Corporation reported a sales drop of 12.1 percent in the period, to 4,711 cars.

HEADLINE: Economic Memo;
Critics Want Fed Power Accountable

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve holds an anomalous position in the American system. An enormously powerful Government agency, it is only loosely accountable to the public and to elected officials, and it allows private citizens, basically a banking elite, to help set the Government's economic policy.
When the economy is sour, as it is now, this odd structure tends to become a focus of attention, a sponge that soaks up frustrations over the way the economy is going. 
 Critics of the central bank had a new twist this morning. At a Senate hearing, several prominent lawmakers, an economist who holds a Nobel Prize and a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board testified in favor of legislation to make the agency more politically accountable. The measure would prevent the presidents of regional Federal Reserve banks, who hold no Government office and answer to no Government official, from voting on Government policy as they do now.
The bill is not likely to be enacted, at least not any time soon, but the legislation has stirred up a new debate on the extent to which the Fed operates outside the bounds of an open society.
"Power without accountability does not fit the American system of democracy," said Representative Lee H. Hamilton, an Indiana Democrat who is a frequent critic of the Federal Reserve and one of the most widely respected members of Congress.
Using its power to raise or lower interest rates, the Federal Reserve has much more influence over the state of the economy than any other Government agency. That is especially true nowadays, when the large budget deficit has caused the White House and Congress to relinquish much of their grip on economic policy.
The Fed sets monetary policy on the basis of votes by the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board and five of the 12 presidents of the Federal Reserve banks, who vote on a rotating basis.
The governors are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. But the regional Federal Reserve banks are private institutions. Their presidents tend to be career employees of the Federal Reserve, steeped in its culture. They are selected by the banks' directors, who are mostly commercial bankers from the region and who pick officers likely to be sympathetic to their views.
 
Target of Politicians
 Many politicians blame the central bank for the current weakness of the economy, saying interest rates should have been driven down more quickly than they were. Reports in the last two years have said that Alan Greenspan, chairman of the board, and most of the other governors have been more inclined toward lower rates than the presidents of the regional banks.
For most of this year, there have been two vacancies on the board, meaning that the bank presidents had as many votes as the Fed governors. The published votes have shown few if any dissents from the policies adopted. But that may be because Mr. Greenspan is careful not to press matters to votes that would show a sharp split.
The legislation under discussion at today's hearing before the Senate Banking Committee would leave all voting on monetary policy to the members of the Federal Reserve Board and would relegate the bank presidents to an advisory capacity.
"Nowhere else in the Government," Mr. Hamilton said, "are private individuals similarly permitted to participate in decisions which have such an enormous influence over the prosperity and well-being of millions of Americans."
The central banks in the other leading democracies around the world vary in their independence from Government control. But in no other country, according to Prof. John B. Goodman, a student of the subject at the Harvard Business School, are votes on policy cast by people who are not appointed by the Government.
Some legal scholars believe the American system to be unconstitutional, a violation of the appointments clause of the Constitution, which requires policy-making officials to be nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. A lawsuit on the matter several years ago was dismissed on a technicality, and the main issue has never been addressed by the courts.
Meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee, where policy decisions are made, are held behind locked doors. No transcript or official notes are kept that would show who said what. The decisions are not announced for six weeks or more. Even then only a skeletal summary of what transpired is made public, and those who voted do not normally explain their votes the way, say, Supreme Court justices write opinions.
Further, no other branch of government can veto the central bank's decisions, and the Fed's accounts are not audited by any outside agency.
Over the years, Mr. Hamilton and his allies have offered legislation to change much of this, but the bills have never gotten past the hearings stage. In part, that is because monetary policy is so often unpopular that Presidents and legislators are happy to have those policy makers to criticize when the economy turns sour.
But another, perhaps more important reason is that the lawmakers and scholars who advocate changing the way the Federal Reserve works are almost always those who want lower interest rates. Preston Martin, who was vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board from 1982 to 1986, said at today's hearing that the regional bank presidents generally felt much more strongly about keeping interest rates high than did the members of the reserve board.
Many politicians say they favor low interest rates but believe in their hearts that higher rates are necessary to control inflation.
Mr. Greenspan has convinced lawmakers that changes in the Fed's operations would not only give the central bank less flexibility in setting monetary policy but could also cause instability in markets that are familiar with the current system.
Christopher Whalen, who runs an economic consulting firm here, told his clients in a recent newsletter that the bill to take voting power away from the Federal Reserve bank presidents would "vastly increase the exposure of U.S. monetary policy to overt political pressure."
But supporters of the legislation dismiss those fears. James Tobin, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, was a bit contemptuous of the political pressure argument in his testimony before the Banking Committee today. "Politics?" he said. "In a representative democracy? Think of it. Economic performance necessarily involves political choices."
Mr. Tobin said he knew of no instance when private bankers made use of inside information from the Federal Reserve. But he said in an interview during a break in the hearing that he worried about a potential conflict of interest.
He gave one example. Under the law, the Federal Reserve Board can change the discount rate, the rate the Fed charges commercial banks for loans, only at the request of the directors of at least one regional Federal Reserve bank. Sometimes, when the board wants to change the rate for economic policy reasons, it requests one regional bank or another to make an application. It can be days between the time the request is made and the time the Fed announces that the rate has been lowered.
During that time, Mr. Tobin observed, the commercial bankers who act as directors of the regional bank have potentially advantageous knowledge about the direction of monetary policy.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Comparing Central Banks in Some Industrial Economies"
In some large industrial democracies, the central bank is basically part of the elected Government. In others, the bank is more or less independent of the Government. Here is a rough ranking, from from the most independent to the least.
SWITZERLAND. Swiss National Bank. Completely independent. Members of Governing Board appointed by Cabinet, but private economic interests have considerable influence in the Board's direction.
GERMANY. Bundesbank. Almost totally independent. Government chooses members of the directorate, including the President. Other policy-makers chosen directly or indirectly by elected officials.
UNITED STATES. Federal Reserve. Has significant independence. Board members nominated by the President for fixed terms of office and confirmed by the Senate. They report regularly, by law, to Congress. The Federal Reserve bank presidents selected by private interests, have minority vote on the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.
CANADA. Bank of Canada. Under law, the Finance Minister can order a specific course of action. Such a directive has never been issued.
ITALY. Bank of Italy. In theory, all important decisions made by the elected Government. In practice, it rarely if ever overrules the bank.
JAPAN. Bank of Japan. Two top officials of the Government sit on the Policy Board. Under law, the Finance Minister can direct the Bank to act. In practice, though, disagreements are worked out informally. Unlike the others, the Bank of Japan does not control its own budget.
BRITAIN. Bank of England. Subordinate to the Government, although a majority of directors are drawn from commercial banking. With policy disagreements resolved under law in favor of the Treasury, the Government has never had to issue a formal directive.
FRANCE. Bank of France. Subordinate to Government. Its officials can be dismissed at will. In practice, the Treasury and the Bank consult frequently. (Source: Joint Economic Committee; John B. Goodman)

HEADLINE: Midway Air Shuts Down After Buyout Is Abandoned

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Midway Airlines said it had ceased operations early this morning. The announcement came just hours after Northwest Airlines said it was abandoning its effort to acquire the small Chicago-based carrier.
Midway, which employs 4,000 people, had been trying to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code and will now probably have to liquidate. 
 A recording on Midway's reservations phone line advised ticket holders to contact their travel agents and credit card companies. In past airline shutdowns, other carriers have honored tickets.
Midway Airport in Chicago, the home base for the airline, said no flights were scheduled in or out of the airport around midnight central time, when the airline ceased operation. There were also no Midway flights scheduled at La Guardia Airport in New York at that hour.
The carrier's collapse is another significant blow to deregulation, which had sought to create several airlines able to compete with older, larger carriers.
If Midway liquidates, only one important airline created after the industry was deregulated in 1979 will be left, America West Airlines. But it has also had troubles and is operating under the protection of the bankruptcy code.
Midway was born shortly after deregulation began. It underwent several changes in strategy, becoming an airline that provided upgraded service at coach prices to attract the business flier. The strategy did not succeed since Midway could not match the frequency of flights of competitors like United Airlines and American Airlines. Unlike the big carriers, Midway was unable to offer the frequent-flier programs that attract business travelers.
The airline struggled along, however, by offering lower fares than its competitors. It also had advantage of flying into Midway Airport, which is closer to downtown Chicago than O'Hare International Airport, which handles most flights.
The carrier was already financially weakened before the Persian Gulf war cut traffic and caused fuel prices to double.
Midway issued a statement late last night from Chicago, saying: "As a result of Northwest Airlines' unilateral decision to withdraw from its commitment to acquire substantially all of Midway's assets, effective midnight, Wednesday, Nov. 13, Midway will cease operations.
"Midway deeply regrets the inconvenience caused to our loyal customers by the cancellation of all Midway service."
 
Analysts Speculate on Motives
 The collapse of the deal with Northwest prompted analysts to wonder whether Northwest wanted to get out of the deal for some hidden reason or whether it simply felt deceived by Midway, as Northwest's president, John H. Dasburg, contends.
On the surface the deal was small potatoes. Northwest agreed to acquire the carrier mostly by assuming debt of about $153 million. The agreement was approved by the Federal court overseeing Midway's bankruptcy reorganization.
There have been concerns about Northwest's viability, however, since Alfred Checchi and a group of investors took over the carrier's parent, NWA Inc., in a $3.6 billion leveraged buyout in July 1989.
But earlier this week, Northwest considerably strengthened its balance sheet. Minnesota agreed to provide the airline with a package of financial assistance worth about $740 million.
The package includes a $390 million loan to the airline backed by the Metropolitan Airport Commission. Another $350 million will be used to build two maintenance bases in Duluth and Hibbing.
Jeffrey W. Hamiel, the executive director of the airport commission, said the agency had been seeking to find out what kind of economic impact an acquisition of Midway would have on Northwest.
As such, the agreement to buy Midway could have threatened to unravel the financial package.
The package is a coup for the airline, which is getting the state and its agencies to help it pay off its debts. In return, the airline must put up some assets as collateral and promise that it will not move its headquarters from Minneapolis. The package still has to be approved by some state agencies.
Accompanying the good news, however, was a dose of bad news from Price Waterhouse, which did a financial analysis of the airline for the Metropolitan Airport Commission.
 
Large Losses, Large Debts
 "Northwest has recently incurred large losses, continues to hold a large portion of acquisition debt and has little equity," the accounting firm said. "In addition, its prospects for the future are dependent on many circumstances that it does not control."
Thus, the financing agreed to by the state, it said, "has significant elements of risk."
The analysis has caused an outcry among legislators and the public, some of whom see the state becoming involved in a Chrysler-style bailout.
In order to get the state to go along with the financial package, Northwest had to be on its best financial behavior to reassure nervous officials that its future was secure.
Acquiring a Midway was not the best deal to reassure these officials. Midway has been losing close to $1 million a day.
The feeling among Midway executives is that they have been made the fall guy here.
The executives, along with some analysts, believe that Northwest was looking for a way to back out of its agreement to buy Midway and that assertions that Midway had provided misleading information about its finances was a smokescreen to hide the real reason.
 
Midway's Point of View
 The Midway executives contend that they provided Northwest with their own internal data on revenue and yields -- the amount of revenue generated by a passenger flying one mile -- which gave Northwest accurate information of the airline's condition for the last year.
But Mr. Dasburg of Northwest said the airline had understated its traffic by about 13 percent and overstated its yields by about 25 percent.
Kevin Murphy, an airline analyst for Morgan Stanley & Company, sees a connection between Northwest's getting the financing from the state and the airline's decision to drop the Midway deal.
He said Northwest appeared to be under pressure from Minnesota and the airport commission to be conservative in any acquisition.
As a result of the failed deal, Midway shut down. Midway was only able to keep operating as long as it did because it had received a loan from Northest.
Mr. Murphy also said Southwest Airlines, which had made an early bid for Midway, might now no longer be interested in the carrier.

HEADLINE: Bank of Japan Lowers Its Discount Rate Again

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Thursday, Nov. 14

 BODY:
In a sign of increasing worry over the health of the Japanese economy, the Bank of Japan this morning announced the second reduction in its discount rate this year.
The central bank announced the reduction, from 5.5 percent to 5 percent, early this morning, effective immediately. The key rate, which influences deposit and lending rates at banks, was reduced on July 1 by a half a percentage point. 
 In addition, the Government reduced this fall the amount of cash banks must keep on deposit with the central bank, putting more cash into circulation and putting downward pressure on interest rates.
These measures confirm that the central bank has altered its basic policy from containing inflation to trying to spur the economy.
 
Stock Prices Decline
 As usual, the news had been leaked to Japanese newspapers, nearly all of which reported that the rate reduction was coming. Thus, the financial markets already reflected today's actions in their prices.
The Tokyo stock market shrugged off the rate cut. The Nikkei index of 225 stocks fell 239.69 points, or nearly 1 percent, to close at 24,176.54. The reaction in the bond and money markets was also disappointing.
"This cut was why people bought, so now they want to take some profits," Daniel Marull, a broker with Sanyo Securities, told Reuters.
But most economists and Government officials hailed the reduction, though many described it as possibly too little too late.
The new Finance Minister, Tsutomu Hata, called the move timely and said it would bolster domestic demand and improve the increasingly negative sentiment among corporate managers.
Yasushi Mieno, the central bank governor, also emphasized the impact the rate cut would have on the gloomy psychology of corporate Japan. Recent surveys have shown that corporations are slashing their investment budgets.
A slowdown in Japan could have a ripple effect worldwide, particularly in the United States. Japanese manufacturers might be tempted to increase their exports to the United States to make up for a slowdown at home. That could cause an swifter increase in the trade surplus with the United States and aggravate trade tensions.
Minoru Itoh, a managing director here with Smith Barney, Harris Upham International, was one of many private economists who said the central bank's move might not arrest the economy's slowdown enough to avert a modest recession.
"What you can say is that this may stop decline in the growth rate, but it may not do much more than that," Mr. Itoh said.

HEADLINE: Three European Nations Propose U.N. Peace Force for Yugoslavia

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 13

 BODY:
In an attempt to buttress European efforts to end the Yugoslav civil war, Britain, France and Belgium urged the United Nations Security Council today to dispatch a peacekeeping force to Yugoslavia if the warring Serbian and Croatian factions will agree to a lasting cease-fire.
These three countries -- the three European Community members of the Security Council -- are now drafting a new resolution asking Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar to see whether the battling forces would agree to suspend the fighting and allow United Nations units to take up positions between their forces. 
 The proposed resolution, which is likely to be presented to the Council early next week, would also impose an oil embargo on Yugoslavia, requiring its principal suppliers, the Soviet Union and Libya, to cut off shipments to those portions of the old Yugoslav federation whose governments do not comply with the appeals for a cease-fire.
In addition, the resolution would seek to tighten the mandatory arms embargo the Security Council imposed on Yugoslavia just after the fighting started by creating a new mechanism to monitor compliance and seek ways to insure the blockade is effective.
Although the European Community has taken the lead so far in trying to end the Yugoslav civil war, it has little to show for its efforts. All 12 of the cease-fire agreements it has negotiated so far have collapsed, often within hours of their announcement. The Community has no armed forces, nor can it pressure countries that are not members, such as the Soviet Union and Libya, to join in the oil embargo it called to coerce Serbia into accepting and sustaining a cease-fire.
 
Experience in Peacekeeping
 As a result, diplomats say, the European Community is now seeking more solid backing for its peace efforts from the Security Council, which is the highest international body charged with insuring peace and order. Although the European Community has imposed its own trade and aid embargo on Yugoslavia, only the Security Council can order a mandatory oil embargo binding on all countries under international law.
In addition, no other regional organization has the same experience with peacekeeping operations as the United Nations, which is currently deploying over 10,000 soldiers in eight separate operations around the world. It is currently setting up another major peacekeeping and election-monitoring effort in Cambodia, involving several thousand soldiers and many thousands of civilians.
If the Secretary General recommends sending a peacekeeping force, the Security Council would then need to adopt a second, separate resolution dispatching it. European diplomats say they do not known what the likely size, composition or cost of such a force would be.
The new European initiative on Yugoslavia, which has United States backing, seeks to build on the surprise request made by both Serbia and Croatia in the last couple of days for the United Nations to consider sending peacekeeping troops to monitor a cease-fire between their forces.
This request has aroused a faint ray of hope among European politicians and diplomats, who wonder if both sides might finally be willing to accept mediation in their dispute.
Diplomats cautioned tonight that the new European proposal faces formidable political and technical difficulties.
One major problem is to determine where such a force should be deployed. Many diplomats fear Serbia will insist that the United Nations troops be stationed along the present front lines between the opposing forces, a way of asserting its right to keep the territory it has conquered from Croatia. Conversely, Croatia is likely to press for deployment of the forces along the traditional borders between the two republics, effectively returning lost territory to its rule.
 
Vance Backs Proposal
 The United Nations mediator in the conflict, Cyrus R. Vance, a former United States Secretary of State, gave his backing to the proposed new resolution when he briefed the Council on his latest trip to Yugoslavia today. But he stressed that United Nations peacekeeping forces could only play a role if they are invited in by all parties to the conflict and if the factions agreed to a meaningful cease-fire.
Afterwards, Mr. Vance painted a bleak picture of the Yugoslav situation, saying that "with the fighting increasing, winter approaching and the economy in free fall, time is running out for a settlement." But he said that neither he nor Lord Carrington, the European Community's mediator, have given up hope. "We have to get back to the table and start serious negotiations," he said.
Details of the proposed new Security Council peace initiative emerged as fierce fighting continued in Yugoslavia today, although there were some signs that developments are taking a more hopeful turn.
 
Talks in Belgrade
 After discussions in Belgrade with President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, which failed to produce any agreement, Lord Carrington said, "I still think there is a possibility, but keep your fingers crossed."
Meanwhile, France's Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Bernard Kouchner, arrived in Yugoslavia to seek support for a European Community plan to set up "refugee corridors" out of the besieged city of Dubrovnik, which is surrounded by Serbian forces, so women and children can be evacuated safely. Their evacuation would be supervised by the United Nations Children's Fund.
One possible function of the peacekeeping force, mentioned by Mr. Vance tonight, would be to take control of the military heavy equipment belonging to units of the Yugoslav federal army that are currently beseiged inside their barracks in Croatia.
 
Fate of Heavy Arms
 The Croats refuse to let these soldiers leave unless they surrender this equipment, saying that otherwise they will use it to strengthen the Serbian forces arrayed against them.
But the Serbs fear that the Croats would then use their own heavy guns and tanks against them as they go.
Some third-world Security Council members are reluctant to endorse an oil embargo against Yugoslavia, saying this constitutes illegal interference in the country's internal affairs.
But Western diplomats point out that the Organization of American States has recently imposed a total trade embargo on Haiti in the hope of reversing the military coup that toppled its democratically elected President.

HEADLINE: U.S. Calls North Korea Atom Plan a Global Concern

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Nov. 13

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d told South Korea today that Washington considered North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons a matter of urgent global concern and that it was now actively exploring with Japan, China and the Soviet Union ways to curtail the move.
South Korea's Foreign Minister, Lee Sang Ock, endorsed the American initiative to try to further isolate North Korea economically and diplomatically until it opened its nuclear installation to international inspection and halted work on what is suspected to be a reprocessing plant capable of producing hundreds of pounds of weapons-grade plutonimum, a senior Korean official said. 
 In his meeting with the South Korean Foreign Minister, Mr. Baker said Washington had come to see curtailment of the North Korean nuclear development as a "matter of urgency," and something that was "not just a Korean issue but a matter of global concern," according to a Korean official who attended the talks. The North Korean nuclear activity is at Yongbyon, a nuclear complex 60 miles north of Pyongyang.
While Mr. Baker is in Seoul for the annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, to discuss Asian trade issues, many of his private discussions have focused on how to generate pressures to halt the North Korean nuclear program before it sets off a nuclear arms race in Asia that could prompt South Korea and Japan to try to develop nuclear weapons.
 
Forcing Inspections
 Having been slow to react to the Iraqi nuclear bomb program, the Bush Administration is trying to make sure that it does not repeat the mistake by underestimating North Korea's moves.
For now, American officials say they are concentrating their efforts on finding ways to squeeze the North Koreans diplomatically and economically in order to force them to open their nuclear installation to the International Atomic Energy Agency for inspection, which the North is obliged to do as a signer of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
But a senior State Department official told reporters traveling with Mr. Baker today that while it is important to compel North Korea to open itself up to international inspection, "we need to go beyond that -- there should not be a reprocessing facility there at all."
Up to now, North Korea has refused to allow any inspection of its nuclear installations and has spurned a South Korean offer on Nov. 8 that both nations agree to forego development of any weapons of mass destruction.
 
Tokyo's Important Gesture
 The first sign of the multilateral American approach was manifested Tuesday when Japan, at Mr. Baker's behest, pledged that it would not go ahead with plans to establish diplomatic relations with North Korea unless it scrapped its center for reprocessing nuclear fuel. Japan's Foreign Minister, Michio Watanabe, who met Mr. Baker in Tokyo on Monday, made the pledge during a meeting in Seoul with his Korean counterpart.
That gesture was important to the South Koreans, who were annoyed by a visit to North Korea by senior members of Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party. Privately, some South Korean diplomats suspect that the Japanese would prefer that the peninsula remain divided so they would never have to compete with a unified Korea -- much the way many European countries preferred a divided Germany.
In addition, on Tuesday Korea's President, Roh Tae Woo, formally requested China's help in halting the North Korean nuclear program. The request was made in Seoul during the first meeting between a Chinese Foreign Minister and a south Korean President. The two countries still do not have diplomatic relations.
The Korean pres agency quoted President Roh as telling Foreign Minister Qian Qichen that continued North Korean nuclear development "would endanger stability, not only on the Korean Peninsula, but also in northeast Asia and the whole world."
 
Last Major Benefactor
 American officials said that in their tentative discussions with the Chinese on the issue, Beijing had indicated some willingness to be helpful, but the extent of cooperation remained to be seen.
With the Soviet Union having already slashed its economic aid to Pyongyang, and demanding to be paid in hard currency for its oil exports to North Korea, China remains the last major benefactor to the isolated Government of Kim Il Sung.
Speaking generally of the evolving American strategy on the North Korean nuclear issue, a senior State Department official said: "What we are doing at this stage is first trying to raise the profile of the issue as a way of starting to build some multilateral diplomacy to deal with it. Second, we are starting to discuss specific steps people might take. The overall strategy is to heighten the sense of isolation of the North Koreans."
Korean officials said Foreign Minister Lee indicated to the Secretary that while his country wanted to see the North Korean nuclear program stopped immediately, it was ambivalent about involving outside powers in too formal a manner.
 
Role of 4 Powers
 While the Koreans recognize that without outside pressure there is little hope that the North Koreans will respond, they have long maintained that the fate of the Korean Peninsuala, particularly questions involving unification and relations between north and south, should be resolved in a direct dialogue between Seoul and Pyongyang.
That is because the North insists that the South is simply a colonial creation of the United States and therefore it will only discuss security issues with Washington and not Seoul. The North wants to conclude a peace treaty with Washington that would ultimately lead to a withdrawal of American forces from the South.
As The Korea Times said in a lead editorial today: "The two-plus-four formula, or German unification method, is not applicable to the Korean case, as the Korean question is fundamentally in the South and North's own hands, whereas German unification required the sanction of the four allied forces -- the United States, the Soviet Union, France and Britain. Yet, it is the stark reality that Korean problems will be hardly unravelled without assistance and guarantees of the four neighboring powers."
Mr. Baker, Korean officials said, assured Mr. Lee that while Washington sought to enlist the help of Japan, China and the Soviet Union, it would not be in any institutionalized form -- as with the German unification process -- and that the United States still believed that the political future of Korea should be determined in direct talks between the North and the South.
Korean officials quoted Mr. Baker as saying that neverthless, "because of the urgency of the matter all interested countries should be involved."

HEADLINE: Japan Pressures Pyongyang To Dismantle Nuclear Center

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 13

 BODY:
Stepping up pressure against North Korea's efforts to develop atomic weapons, Japan's new Prime Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, said today that Pyongyang must dismantle a key part of its secret nuclear center if it hoped to have normal relations with Tokyo and receive economic assistance.
Until now, Japan has insisted only that the North Korean Government of President Kim Il Sung allow international inspectors to examine the secret project at Yongbyon, a move Mr. Kim's Government has so far refused. A senior Japanese official said tonight that Mr. Miyazawa was now "hardening our position considerably," insisting for the first time that part of the suspected bomb-making complex be taken apart. 
 Japan's new demand seemed to reflect increasing fears that Mr. Kim's Government was getting dangerously close to producing several crude nuclear weapons. In his speech, Mr. Miyazawa focused on the single element of North Korea's program that most worries American and Japanese officials: A fuel reprocessing plant that would enable North Korea to turn its nuclear waste into weapons-grade plutonium.
The plant is expected to be operational within two years, according to Western intelligence experts, and after that would produce enough plutonium to build several nuclear weapons a year.
Meanwhile, in a dispatch from Pyongyang that was monitored in Tokyo, the North Korean Government accused a Pentagon official, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Carl Ford, of urging "forcible inspection" of the nuclear installations. It said such comments were "a downright threat of war to the Korean people."
Today, Mr. Miyazawa said that in a new round of talks with Pyongyang over creating normal relations, scheduled to take place in Beijing next week, Japan would "urge North Korea to comply with a request by the Seoul Government to scrap its nuclear fuel reprocessing plant."
He was referring to a call last week by President Roh Tae Woo of South Korea for a "nuclear-free Korean peninsula." Mr. Roh said that Seoul would renounce the manufacture or possession of nuclear fuel, and would not build a fuel reprocessing plant of its own.
But Mr. Miyazawa's position puts Japan in something of a difficult negotiating spot because Japan is building a giant fuel-reprocessing plant, one that is intended to feed its civilian nuclear power plants. Japanese officials conceded that it would be difficult to argue that North Korea must shut its plant while Japan moves ahead with its own.

HEADLINE: Doctors Reach Tentative Pact In Brooklyn

BYLINE: By LISA BELKIN

 BODY:
A tentative agreement has been reached between striking doctors at Woodhull hospital and the corporation that pays their salaries, apparently after pressure was applied by the Mayor's office.
The doctors, whose walkout on Tuesday halted all but the most urgent business at Brooklyn's second-busiest hospital, could return to work as early as this morning, their union said. 
 The union's negotiating committee approved the agreement in a 6-to-3 vote last night. Members are to vote on the accord today at noon.
The agreement includes a pledge by the corporation to restore some medical services that had been cut at the hospital in recent months, said Barry Liebowitz, president of the Doctors Council, the union that represents the 300 striking doctors. It also includes a 1.5 percent pay increase, far short of the 3.5 percent increase the doctors had sought.
 
30 Hours of Negotiation
 But Dr. Liebowitz said that proposed changes in the doctors' benefits package mean the total increase in salary and benefits is 4 percent.
"This is a contract that meets the economic needs of doctors as well as the patient care needs of the community," Dr. Liebowitz said. "It is a contract in which doctors gave up money in order to finance the health needs of the community."
The agreement was reached after 30 hours of negotiation between the Doctors Council and the Woodhull Medical Associates Professional Corporation, a private group that receives about $40 million annually from the city to provide medical staff for the Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center.
The doctors began their walkout at 8 A.M. Tuesday, citing issues of salary and quality of patient care.
Negotiations were held at the city's Office of Labor Relations. Dr. Liebowitz said the two sides never met directly but conveyed messages through Labor Commissioner James F. Hanley.
Other officials said that at first Medical Associates refused to negotiate if city officials were involved in the talks, saying that the city did not have jurisdiction over the affairs of a private corporation. It took direct intervention from people close to Mayor David N. Dinkins, these officials said, to bring Medical Associates to the table.
The city has affiliation agreements to staff all of its 11 municipal hospitals, but only two, Woodhull and Coney Island Hospital, are with private corporations. The rest are with medical schools.
Cyril Alcee, the president of Medical Associates, could not be reached for comment. His office said he was attending the contract talks.
John Beckman, a spokesman for the Mayor said: "All along we wanted everyone to negotiate in good faith and we made our views known to both parties."
Although the strike by attending physicians is unusual, there is no state or Federal law prohibiting doctors from unionizing. Because the salaries of the Woodhull doctors are paid by a private corporation, they are not covered by laws that prohibit strikes by government employees. Doctors and administrators said the strike was the first by attending doctors anywhere in the country.
 
Terms of the Agreement
 Among the provisions of the agreement is a commitment by Medical Associates to restore orthopedic services to Woodhull, Dr. Liebowitz said. There have been no orthopedists there in the two months since the remaining four were laid off.
The agreement also includes a promise of a "continuing dialogue" to restore other services that have been eliminated in recent months, including ophthalmology, urology and rehabilitation medicine.
Under the agreement, a five-member panel will be established to review the planned layoffs of 50 doctors. The panel will include two representatives of Medical Associates, two representatives chosen by the union, and one representative of the Williamsburg neighborhood that Woodhull serves.
In addition to the 1.5 percent pay increase, the proposed agreement requires Medical Associates to provide $550,000 to pay for time off for doctors to attend continuing education programs. It guarantees a $1,500 raise for every nine years worked at the hospital and establishes a $25,000 fund to equalize salaries between the doctors working at the hospital's Cumberland Neighborhood Family Care Clinic and those working at Woodhull proper.
The Doctors Council said the average salary of its members who work at Woodhull is $65,000. Doctors who work at Cumberland make an average of $60,000.
The proposed agreement also states that all retirement, medical and other benefits will remain at current levels. Medical Associates had been seeking to cut some retirement benefits.
The agreement, if approved, would expire on June 30, 1992.
Beginning four days before the strike, the Woodhull emergency room was closed, elective surgery was canceled and patients were transferred to other hospitals, reducing the number of patients to 320 from 550. During the strike, care was provided by the hospital's 80 doctors-in-training and 36 nonunion department chiefs.

HEADLINE: For Philadelphia, a New Management

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 13

 BODY:
Edward G. Rendell, who was elected Mayor of Philadelphia last week by the largest margin in 60 years, is looking for volunteers to help paint City Hall's dingy corridors after he takes office in January.
It's his way of telling people that the city government, which has been in sharp decline for the better part of two decades, is under new management. 
 "People are skeptical," Mr. Rendell, a former District Attorney, said in an interview before leaving for a vacation this week in South Carolina. "But when I came up with the idea of painting City Hall, you should have seen the letters I got. People loved it."
By all accounts, Mr. Rendell has only six months to a year to show state legislators and Wall Street that he can make lemonade out of this city's sour finances and serve it to Philadelphians without a revolt. If he fails, the legislators and financiers will assume that it is business as usual and the city, which already has a cash crisis, will continue to head toward insolvency.
 
They Call Him 'Fast Eddie'
 Many people think Mr. Rendell, who won 68 percent of the vote with a promise of austerity and efficiency, is up to the task. His nickname is "Fast Eddie," and while there is some ambiguity about its origins, it refers to his quick wit and tongue. Mr. Rendell has also shown a flair for setting an agenda and promoting it.
On Election Day, for example, Joseph M. Egan, the Republican candidate for mayor, lost 63 of the city's 66 wards and conceded at 10:05 P.M.. But Mr. Rendell waited until just after 11 P.M. to give his acceptance speech so television stations around the state could broadcast the speech live during the nightly news.
"The things that bind us together are so much greater than the things that separate us," he told his supporters amid thundering applause, "and if we channel that energy the sky's the limit for Philadelphia. I promise that we will hit the ground running and that the change that we talked about will begin almost immediately."
Edward Gene Rendell was born to a wealthy Jewish family on Manhattan's Upper West Side 47 years ago. His father, Jesse, owned a textile business in the garment district and one of his aunts, Stella Sloat, designed sportswear for Jackie Kennedy. His father died in 1958; his mother, Emma, still lives in Manhattan. His older brother, Robert, is a lawyer in Dallas.
 
A Two-Lawyer Family
 The future Mayor graduated from Riverdale Country School in the Bronx, the University of Pennsylvania and Villanova University's School of Law. His wife of 20 years, Marjorie, also went to Penn and Villanova law school, and specializes in bankruptcy cases at a Philadelphia law firm. The Rendells live in East Falls, an affluent neighborhood in northwest Philadelphia, with their 11-year-old son, Jesse.
After law school and a stint in the Army Reserve, Mr. Rendell became an assistant district attorney in Philadelphia. In 1977, at the age of 33, he ran for election as district attorney and won an upset victory over the incumbent. In his eight years as District Attorney, Mr. Rendell is credited with reforming the management of the department and making the judicial system more sensitive in its handling of rape cases.
In 1986 Mr. Rendell lost the Democratic primary for governor to Robert P. Casey, and in 1987 he lost the Democratic mayoral primary to the incumbent, W. Wilson Goode. Mr. Rendell returned to private practice, but spent most of the last four years preparing for this year's campaign.
 
Peace Offering to Unions
 Mr. Rendell has already hit the ground running. At his first news conference after the election he made a peace offering to municipal union leaders, asking them to join a transition committee in an effort to help streamline city operations.
The unions, representing 25,000 workers and 68 percent of the city's $2.3 billion budget this year, opposed Mr. Rendell's candidacy because he vowed to bring the wages and benefits of municipal workers into line with those in private industry, which are, by some estimates, more than 20 percent lower than those of city workers.
At his second news conference, Mr. Rendell scored a public relations victory with Wall Street by announcing that the city's chief financial adviser would be Sam Katz, an expert on municipal finances who was a Republican mayoral candidate in the spring primary. He won 28 percent of the vote, coming in third.
Mr. Katz is one of two chief executives of Public Financial Management, a Philadelphia-based company that is a leading adviser of cities and states on financial planning. The firm, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Marine Midland Bank of New York, has agreed to work without pay this fall as it develops a five-year financial plan for the city. After January, it will become a paid consultant to the city.
The state's newly created financial oversight agency, the Pennsylvania Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority, will review the plan and, if the authority approves it, will borrow about $230 million to pay off the city's accumulated deficits.
 
The Edge of Insolvency
 In an interview, Mr. Katz said the new Mayor would not be able to solve the city's severe financial problems without more state aid, but must quickly show that he is making the best of a bad situation.
Mayor Goode, who is completing his second four-year term and is forbidden by the city charter to seek a third consecutive term, watched the city edge toward insolvency, where it still stands. And in the 1970's, Frank L. Rizzo served two turbulent terms as Mayor, making Philadelphia notorious for police brutality and for giving city workers pay raises before elections.
"To restore confidence, the city needs to outline a clear road map of how we're going to get back to having balanced operating budgets and how we're going to rebuild confidence among the people who are here and the businesses that are here," Mr. Katz said. "It's going to be a very long and difficult undertaking, and it's going to require some pain and sacrifices on the part of a lot of Philadelphians."
Mr. Rendell agreed. "The obstacles are overwhelming," he said. "But I believe if people see sparks of change, they will react."
He also conceded that in trying to save the city, he may lose his job: "It may take a one-term mayor to set this city right. I may be that mayor."

HEADLINE: Pact Reached on Benefits for Jobless

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13

 BODY:
Congressional leaders and White House officials reached agreement tonight on a $5.1 billion bill to extend unemployment benefits, with some recipients expected to get their checks by Thanksgiving.
After another day of intense negotiations, the House Ways and Means Committee approved the measure tonight 29 to 7, with only Republicans voting against, and lawmakers said they hoped the full House and Senate would approve the legislation and send it to President Bush on Thursday. 
 The bill would extend 6, 13 or 20 weeks of additional unemployment benefits, depending on unemployment rates in individual states, for about three million Americans who have exhausted the standard 26 weeks of payments. It would be paid for largely by increasing estimated tax payments by some high-income taxpayers.
Lawmakers said they viewed the benefit program as the most even-handed way to dole out additional benefits. They said it was fair for workers in states with lower jobless rates to get a shorter extension of benefits because they would probably have less difficulty finding jobs.
The plan is projected to run a $895 million deficit in its first year, fiscal 1992, but would run modest surpluses in the remaining four years, with a total surplus of $241 million.
On a speaker phone from Kansas City, Mr. Bush called Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, and several other Senate Republicans, to praise them for the bill.
"I feel that the deal which you've been able to hammer out is a good one," Mr. Bush said. "And I think it's something I know I can enthusiastically support."
Mr. Dole told the President that the legislation "meets the criteria that you set out -- that you pay for it."
 
Help Those 'Really Hurting'
 Mr. Bush had twice vetoed earlier versions of the bill, asserting first that the recession had ended and then that the bill would add too much to the Federal debt. But tonight, facing pressure from lawmakers in his party to show concern for the jobless, Mr. Bush described the measure as essential to benefit those who have been hit hard by the economy.
"We can help people that are really hurting," the President said, "and do it without burdening every other taxpayer by busting this budget agreement."
Representative Thomas J. Downey, a Long Island Democrat who championed the measure in the House, criticized the Administration for not taking the leadership.
"I am pleased that the President and the Republicans in Congress have finally recognized the need to do something to ease the suffering of jobless Americans," he said. "For months, the Congress has attempted to do something to help the unemployed who are the innocent victims of a recession that is deeper and longer than expected."
Taking issue with such attacks on Republicans, Mr. Dole said the agreement would "take heat off the Democrats who are going to pay for something for a change."
By late Tuesday, officials from the Bush Administration and Congress declared that they were on the brink of an agreement. But the pact came only at the end of a day of negotiations on Capitol Hill between top Labor and Treasury Department officials and lawmakers in both parties.
Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the House Republican leader, said a major hurdle was whether to intensify collections of student loans to pay for the measure. Without citing him by name, Mr. Michel said that Representative William D. Ford, the Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, resisted that provision. But he relented, Mr. Michel said, after Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and "the Speaker leaned on him."
Assuming the bill is signed by the President this week, Mr. Michel said there were "good prospects" that recipients would start receiving their chekcs by Thanksgiving.
While the financing would mostly be through speeding income tax collections from wealthy taxpayers with rising incomes who estimate their taxes quarterly, generating $2.6 billion, the bill calls for other tax changes.
 
Withholding Refunds
 In one provision, tax refunds would be withheld from people who are delinquent on Government loans. The legislation would also retain a 0.2 percent payroll tax paid by employers on the first $7,000 paid annually to each employee.
The high-income taxpayers would be forced to pay higher income taxes only if their adjusted gross income grew by more than $40,000 over the prior year, and if the taxpayer had an adjusted gross income over $75,000 in the current year.
People whose incomes were subject to witholding and do not now make estimated quarterly tax installments would not have to suddenly pay new estimated taxes.
Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic leader, had pressed for giving Mr. Bush three alternatives to break the impasse.
But today Mr. Mitchell indicated that he would go along with the compromise. "I'm encouraged by the apparent breakthrough in providing unemployment insurance benefits to the millions of Americans who need them," he said hours before the agreement was reached.

HEADLINE: Bush Assails Democrats And Defends His Travels

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Nov. 13

 BODY:
President Bush today moved to counterattack Democrats who had made his extensive foreign travel a political issue, painting them as isolationist demagogues who were taking "cheap shots" at his global leadership.
In speeches to a group of young farmers in Kansas City and Republican contributors here, the President charged that his critics wanted to "turn their backs on the historic opportunities before us" in global trade and diplomacy that he said his travels sought to exploit. 
 The remarks were Mr. Bush's latest and strongest effort to defuse what had been the Democrats' most effective attack on his Presidency: that he had paid more heed to crises in Moscow and the Middle East than to the recession in his own country.
The President told the national convention of the Future Farmers of America in Kansas City that that accusation was "hogwash." Later, in St. Louis, he accused Democrats of adopting "the ignorance that inspires people to hide from the rest of the world, wishing our problems away instead of creating solutions."
In remarks prepared for delivery to a fund-raiser here for Senator Christopher S. Bond, the President said, "When I go abroad, it's to help America at home in an economic sense and to help our kids live in a more peaceful world."
Today's statewide jaunt fit an emerging pattern in Mr. Bush's nascent, unanounced re-election campaign: daylong swings across a state, mixing party politics with official, but politically photogenic White House business.
As polls suggest that Democratic attacks on his handling of domestic affairs are striking a political chord, Mr. Bush has begun to appear at events where he can play the role of a lone crusader, struggling against Washington's entrenched Democrats to restore the nation's economic well-being.
Today, addressing the high-school students in Kansas City, he cast his critics as head-in-the-sand politicians who would thwart his lonely battle to carry an American peace and prosperity to the far corners of the globe.
Recalling his trip last month to Madrid, where he helped open peace talks on the Middle East, Mr. Bush said: "Let the isolationists turn their backs on the historic opportunities before us. I cannot give up the quest for peace on earth."
 
Arguing for Fair Trade
 He said that he would "never apologize for a single minute I devote to promoting America's interests abroad."
He continued: "When I fight for free and fair trade in Latin America or east Asia or Europe, some will carp and claim I'm pursuing foreign instead of domestic policy. Well, to borrow a word you all understand -- I'll clean it up for you -- that's hogwash."
The President told the students that their future depended on a sound American educational system and on an economy that could compete in world markets.
The President parlayed his remarks on the need to keep American agriculture competitive into another demand that Congress enact a cut in the capital gains tax, the focus so far of the White House's own plans to help the economy out of a recession. He said that a cut in the capital gains tax "would boost investment and jobs in every sector and every industry in the nation" and that "I wish you would help me get that message to Congress."
In an interview here with television station KTVI, Mr. Bush said that he did not believe the nation was in a recession but that it did need "a boost of confidence" before the economy will begin to significantly revive.

HEADLINE: Two Soviet Dancers Want to Stay in the U.S.

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13

 BODY:
Federal immigration officials said today that two 20-year-old dancers with the Kirov ballet have asked for "immigration benefits," a phrase that usually means a foreigner has requested asylum in the United States.
But bizarre circumstances surrounding the request by the two women underscored how the changes in the Soviet Union and the end of the cold war had transformed the artistic and political landscape. 
 In 1974, the defection of a Kirov star, Mikhail Baryshnikov, was seen as a grand statement about the artistic and personal freedoms of the West. Recent moves by Soviet ballet artists to work with American troupes seem decidedly more prosaic, involving questions of money, visibility and opportunity.
Against this backdrop, the apparent asylum request made by Aleksandra Koltun and Zhanna Sinitsina seemed more a fumbling gesture of dissatisfaction with their other alternatives than a carefully considered statement about artistic freedom.
"The people who talked to them Tuesday night said they didn't really seem to know what they wanted," said one official of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, speaking on condition of anonymity.
 
Harder to Show Persecution
 While the collapse of the Soviet economy has given many more people a motive to leave, the demise of Soviet Communism has made it harder to prove a "well-founded fear of persecution," the customary reason for granting political asylum. As Soviet travel restrictions have eased over the past five years, the number of Soviet citizens requesting political asylum has grown exponentially, from 40 in fiscal year 1986 to 1,043 in fiscal year 1990 and 1,891 in the first half of fiscal 1991.
These requests are no longer granted routinely. Duke Austin, a spokesman for the immigration agency, said that 264 Soviets were granted asylum and about 100 were denied in 1990.
The two dancers left the Kirov on Oct. 26. They showed up at the New York City Ballet on Nov. 1, took some classes but received no job offers, City Ballet officials said.
Oleg Vinogradov, the Kirov's artistic director, said the two called his wife Nov. 7 asking to rejoin the troupe. Mr. Vinogradov's wife, Yelena, sent a car to meet them in New York and brought them back to the Vinogradovs' home in northeast Washington. The home is near the studios of the Universal Ballet Academy, a school founded by the Unification Church of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon. Mrs. Vinogradov supervises Soviet teachers there.
 
A Strange Confrontation
 The dancers' apparent request for asylum came after a strange confrontation outside the house Tuesday afternoon. As Mr. Vinogradov and his wife, accompanied by the two dancers and a Bolshoi ballet star, Vladimir Vassilyev, pulled out of his driveway in a van, a car driven by Alexei Avrin, an emigre who had apparently befriended the two before and during their time in New York, pulled over and blocked the driveway.
The argument was loud enough to prompt a call to the police, who responded to find "the subjects had various reasons for being there," according to a sergeant from the Washington Police, who was at the scene.
The two women, speaking through a translator, made a request for political asylum, the sergeant said, so the police called in the immigration agency and the State Department.
Over the past few years, several dozen ballet artists have found temporary employment with American companies, who usually obtain special work visas for them under a category designated for those with "distinguished merit and ability."
It is unclear whether the two Kirov dancers believed they could follow this pattern when they went to New York at the end of the Kirov's guest engagement in Washington.

HEADLINE: Democrat Sees a Way to Unload Revenue Burdens on the G.O.P.

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST BRUNSWICK, N.J., Nov. 13

 BODY:
A leader in the lame-duck Democratic Legislature suggested today that the Democrats might devise a way to make their $2.8 billion tax increase survive until the end of the budget year in June, then expire, leaving it to the Republicans to come up with a way to pay the bills without that revenue next year.
The Assembly's top Republican countered that if the Democrats want to cut taxes, they should roll back Gov. Jim Florio's entire legislative package, particularly a $1.2 billion program to provide aid to poor and middle-income school districts, and reduce property taxes. 
 The escalation in partisan infighting came today at a post-election legislative forum here attended by John A. Lynch of Lyndhurst, a Democrat and the outgoing President of the Senate, and Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian of Independence, who will become Speaker of the Assembly when the Republicans take over the Legislature in January.
 
Talk of a 'Roll Back'
 Mr. Lynch suggested last week that the Democrats might "roll back" all of the $2.8 billion increase they pushed though the Legislature last year, thereby forcing the Republicans to make good on an implied election promise -- a promise they now deny they ever made -- to cut all the tax increases.
Voter anger over the increases led to a Republican rout of the Democrats last week and left the Republicans with majorities of 58-22 in the Assembly and 27-13 in the Senate.
Afterward, Republicans said that they would make good on their promise to rescind a one-cent increase in the sales tax that was pushed through by the Democrats. That would reduce taxes by about $550 million.
 
'Sunset Bill' Suggested
 But Mr. Lynch responded by saying that the Republicans, having invoked the $2.8 billion figure repeatedly in their legislative races, had an obligation to cut all of it.
Today, at the forum at the Ramada Renaissance Hotel here, Mr. Haytaian contended that Mr. Lynch had suggested cutting the money after the Democrats had spent it.
Mr. Lynch responded by saying that he was not suggesting "a rollback" of the $2.8 billion but rather a "sunset bill" that would let the increases expire at the end of the budget year, in June 1992. "That's what the people wanted, that's what they voted for, and that is what they should get," Mr. Lynch said.
That approach would leave the Republicans with enormous budget problems. They would have to replace not only the $2.8 billion provided by the lapsed taxes but also perhaps an additional billion dollars or more to make up for inflation and about $550 million in one-time revenues in this year's budget.
Mr. Haytaian denied that the Republicans had promised such a huge rollback and said that if the Democrats wanted to let the taxes to lapse, "they should roll back the whole program, the Quality Education Act, the insurance program, all of it."
Mr. Lynch said it was up to the Republicans to start with "a clean slate" in January.

HEADLINE: As Recession Tightens Its Grip, Hopes of Jobless Dwindle and Fears Mount

BYLINE: By CHARLES STRUM

 BODY:
Grandparents have stepped in to buy the children winter coats. Car payments and other loans have been stretched out, if they can be. For many of the unemployed in the New York metropolitan region, an evening's entertainment is now the television.
For Gary Eppich of Long Island, and for thousands of others in the region, the savings are dwindling and the fear is mounting but still there are no jobs in sight. Some pore over the classified ads in the newspapers. Others take courses to improve their skills. 
 "Every day we say, Maybe this will be the phone call," said Mr. Eppich, a plumber who was laid off more than a year ago and who has worked at lesser-paying jobs since, when he could find them.
For Roger Holmes, a 25-year-old construction worker in Newark, the pain is similar.
"I hate not working," he said. "I'd rather be busy."
 
Few Job Categories Spared
 In New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, the recession has been tenacious and indiscriminate, an equal opportunity un-employer that has struck the work force in virtually every job category, tightening its grip over the last two and a half years. Fresh layoffs continue to thin out factories, stores and office suites; they have even reached the usually unreachable: civil servants.
Many who now find themselves jobless are not merely the marginal workers or the last hired. Many have been busy and successful for years. Now they share shock, frustration, bitterness and often something new -- self-doubt. In many cases they have begun to shrink their expectations.
Across the metropolitan region, more than 440,000 jobs have been lost in the last two years out of a total of 8 million, according to state labor departments and the Federal Department of Labor. In the last recession, a 16-month period in 1981-82, fewer than 50,000 jobs were lost, the overwhelming share in manufacturing.
The individual stories from a cross-section of workers, from one in construction to one in design, highlight the pain of the thousands. They are the ones who keep track of want ads and letters in job-search notebooks. Mostly they wait and mostly they hope.

HEADLINE: And on the Ninth Day of Gridlock . . .

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
There are the twelve days of Christmas, with partridges in pear trees, turtledoves and gold rings. There are the eight days of Hanukkah, with menorahs and dreidels and chocolate coins wrapped in gold foil. And then there are the nine days of gridlock, with Peter A. Pennica and about a million cursing, teeth-gnashing New York drivers.
Like that jolly old guy who ho-ho-ho's his way across the sky -- no traffic tieups there -- the 44-year-old Mr. Pennica has a beard. But his is mostly black, he is a good deal thinner than Santa and he is no bearer of glad tidings. As chief of the traffic analysis bureau in the city Department of Transportation, he is the person who decides when to declare gridlock alerts. 
 That means this $57,000-a-year official has the power to strike terror among motorists. A word from him, and the streets will either be agonizingly crowded, if they don't listen, or deserted, if they do.
"I wouldn't say he's the Wizard of Oz," said his boss, Commissioner Lucius J. Riccio, "but he's certainly the wizard as far as I'm concerned. Pete's numbers make the difference between a pleasant day for millions of people or a miserable day if they haven't gotten the message to expect extra-long traffic delays."
To get the message out for the nine holiday gridlock alerts, the Transportation Department recruited the Rockettes. There they were yesterday, high-kicking their way across the Avenue of the Americas with Mr. Riccio only a step or two behind. Between kicks, the dancers were handing out free subway tokens.
The message to those who drive was not to. But in case they do, the department is assigning 37 traffic agents to the busiest intersections in midtown Manhattan. And to turn traffic lemons into fiscal lemonade, almost twice as many agents -- 60 -- will be out issuing what the department calls "spillback summonses" to motorists who block heavily traveled intersections with "don't-block-the-box" signs.
Figuring out which days to declare gridlock alerts seems only slightly less complicated than the quadratic equations that have bedeviled algebra students for generations. It involves numbers, history and a sense of restraint -- declaring too many alerts would lessen the sense of doom that makes them effective.
For numbers, Mr. Pennica looks at past vehicle counts for the tunnels into Manhattan -- the Holland, Lincoln, Brooklyn Battery and Queens-Midtown.
He cannot factor in a precise count for the East River bridges because no one counts the traffic there every day; the toll collections at the tunnels make counting easy. And although there are tolls at the George Washington Bridge, it is a special case -- the busiest of the Hudson River crossings, but also the one that carries cars bound not only for Manhattan but also for New England.
Is what he does art, or science? Mr. Pennica said it involved a bit of both. Motorists would say it is a dismal science, even more dismal than economics. And if it's art, the one it comes closest to is that of sawing a lady in half -- without the mirror.
"We look at volumes over the entire day," he said. "A lot of people get the perception that this only involves congestion from commuter traffic. But traffic hasn't gone down throughout the day. The latest report we have shows that volumes from 7 to 9 A.M. have reached a saturation point. Volume from 4 A.M. to 7 A.M. is up, which shows that the morning rush is expanding."
 
Predictably Awful
 And now, the envelope, please: the gridlock-alert days Mr. Pennica has nominated for 1991.
The gridlock season officially begins on Nov. 22, the Friday before Thanksgiving, with an expected traffic volume 8 percent higher than an average day. Mr. Pennica is betting that 955,000 vehicles will head into Manhattan that day. There is ample precedent for such a prediction: the Friday before Thanksgiving has been one of the 5 heaviest volume days for 5 of the last 10 years.
Between then and Christmas, he predicts, traffic volume will run between 9 and 13 percent above normal.
On Wednesday, Nov. 27, he is expecting 97,000 more vehicles than usual. Tuesday, Dec. 3, is on his list because that is the day the Christmas tree is to be lit in Rockefeller Center. Also on the list: Thursday, Dec. 12 (7 percent more traffic than usual), Wednesday, Dec. 18 (a street-clogging matinee day in midtown Manhattan) and Thursday, Dec. 19.
And Fridays? No easy rides: Dec. 6 and Dec. 13 are on the list, and he expects Friday, Dec. 20 to be the busiest day of all, with 106,000 additional vehicles in Manhattan.
Here is another prediction: unlike the motorists whose habits he knows only too well, Mr. Pennica will not be in stuck in holiday traffic. He takes the subway.

Add to Economic Disaster, a Bankrupt Love Affair

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Nov. 13

 BODY:
The most powerful woman in modern Brazilian history, Zelia Cardoso de Mello, broke all the rules by freezing $115 billion in bank accounts last year.
Out of power today, the 38-year-old former Economy Minister has again broken the rules, this time by agreeing to be the prime source of a book chronicling her seduction and abandonment by a fellow Cabinet member. 
 Breaking with a tradition of stale political memoirs, the book recalls one Cabinet meeting where Miss Cardoso's lover, Justice Minister Bernardo Cabral, passed her a note reading, "Your short skirt is delicious."
Peppered with such spice, "Zelia, a Passion" by Fernando Sabino, has rocketed to the top of Brazilian bestseller lists, selling 200,000 copies within 10 days of its release. A national sensation, the book has become a welcome distraction from the economic wreckage that Miss Cardoso is widely acknowledged to have left behind when she resigned her post in May.
 
'The Love of My Life'
 Indeed, the 6,500 cruzeiro cover price of "Zelia" is enough to refute Miss Cardoso's claim to economic wizardry. When the economist was named to the Cabinet in March 1990, 6,500 cruzeiros were worth $170. Today, prices are jumping 23 percent monthly, Brazil, Latin America's largest nation, is lagging further behind in Latin America's economic recovery, and 6,500 cruzeiros is worth $7.
Most of the 270-page book is devoted not to economics but to romance. But in contrast to dime-store dramas, the villain of "Zelia" is not the sleek Brazilian playboy of stereotypes, but a 59-year-old grandfather whom she described as "a gentleman a good deal older than I, fat and balding."
In New York, foreign bankers often complained that Miss Cardoso was brusque and arrogant when discussing repayment terms for Brazil's $115 billion foreign debt. But according to the book, Mr. Cabral expertly cultivated a hidden, softer side to Miss Cardoso. One day, he filled her suite in the Regency Hotel in New York with love notes.
"You are the love of my life," he wrote. "I am going to separate and marry you."
This authorized biography makes little mention of Mr. Cabral's wife of 30 years, Zuleide.
"His relationship with his wife was very old fashioned," Mr. Sabino wrote of Miss Cardoso's few encounters with Mrs. Cabral at the Cabral home in Brasilia. "She only appeared in the living room to serve coffee or food."
But Brazil's President, Fernando Collor de Mello, who is not related to Miss Cardoso, evidently did not take lightly the fact that a married Cabinet minister was having an affair with an unmarried minister.
"This is pure nitroglycerin!" the President reportedly exclaimed when his two ministers confronted him with the news in mid-1990. After the affair became public in October 1990, Mr. Collor accepted his Justice Minister's resignation, which was attributed not only to the affair but also to his perceived poor performance as the President's top legal adviser.
But according to "Zelia" the love affair continued full tilt. It says that the lovers picked names for children they hoped to conceive, and that during a debt negotiating trip to New York, Miss Cardoso met with Mr. Cabral at St. Patrick's Cathedral, where they play-acted their wedding.
But mired in the deepest recession of a decade, Brazil's economy was not faring as well as Miss Cardoso's romance. On May 9 she resigned. The next week, she flew to Paris for a secret rendezvous with Mr. Cabral.
"It was perhaps the happiest period of her life," Mr. Sabino wrote. But the book says that soon, Mr. Cabral alleged tooth trouble and flew back to Rio, promising to return after a day at the dentist. One day stretched into two and soon Miss Cardoso realized, as Mr. Sabino put it, that she had fallen victim to "a professor in the art of seducing, cheating, faking and taking advantage."
The book hit Brazil like a bomb. Many middle- and upper-class Brazilians were angered by the book's assertion that Miss Cardoso essentially drew a number out of a hat to decide the minimum size of checking and savings accounts subject to temporary confiscation. Less than a quarter of the money has so far been formally returned.
"While I was running a business, taking care of my children and working 14 hours a day, the minister was passing love notes," Eloy Farah fumed to a Sao Paulo newspaper.
 
Feminists Are Divided
 Mr. Cabral, an undeclared candidate for Senator from Amazonas State, told reporters, "The book has the gift of making the unity of my family more solid." But when pressed, he snapped that the book should have been titled "Zelia, the Revenge" and that he was working on his own memoirs.
Brazilian feminists are divided over the intimate confessions of a woman who only last year was a national role model.
Moema Toscano, a sociologist who is president of Rio's State Council of Women's Rights, pronounced the book "an ugly defeat for Brazilian women."
But some feminists have hailed Miss Cardoso's denunciation of abuse by a lover.
"For millennia, women have suffered silently in the recesses of their houses all kinds of violence and coercion," Rose Marie Muraro, a prominent Rio feminist wrote in the Rio newspaper Jornal do Brasil. "The women's liberation movement was made so that all women would be able to communicate to society the manipulations that victimize them."
While the debate continues, it is unlikely that Miss Cardoso will fade away quietly. The former minister, who has formed a new economic research group, hinted recently that she would run next year for the post of Mayor of Sao Paulo, South America's largest city.

Dinkins in South Africa: It's Not Quite Clockwork

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Nov. 13

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins may not be jinxed, but even half a world away from the problems that dog him daily in New York, he could be forgiven for wondering. First he had to postpone this trip to South Africa for lack of money. Then he failed to win an audience with the Pope in Rome on the way over.
Today, he could not manage to get an appointment -- already listed on his public schedule -- with the white-minority Government's acting President, Gerrit N. Viljoen, who is running the country while President F. W. de Klerk is traveling in Taiwan this week. 
 "From our side, there was never such a meeting on the cards," said Hannes de Wet, a spokesman for Mr. Viljoen, who is the Minister of Constitutional Development and a leading architect of the Government's moves toward dismantling apartheid. But it was understood from other Government officials that Mr. Dinkins's hosts, the African National Congress, had requested the meeting with too little advance notice to schedule an appointment.
"I accept at face value their explanation that they were unable to meet with us," said the Mayor, who stiffly criticized the Government for failing to quell factional violence as he toured the nearby black township of Alexandra today and later spoke to a committee of black groups seeking peace.
Mr. Dinkins said he did not believe the Government had refused to see him because of such comments, or because he is a guest of the African National Congress, or because he continued to press, in a meeting with business executives this morning, for economic sanctions until there is "tangible, fundamental political change, the cornerstone of which will be a democratic South Africa."
 
An Unhealthy Rumor
 If the Mayor's day did not go exactly as planned, it did not go as badly as suggested at one point. In late afternoon, a report briefly swept the Johannesburg press corps that Mr. Dinkins had suffered a heart attack.
Indeed he did -- about six years ago -- which is what the city's acting Health Commissioner, Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg, mentioned in passing to Michael Cottman of New York Newsday, explaining the elaborate first-aid kit brought along on the trip. But local reporters apparently overheard the exchange and it became garbled in the retelling, and the African National Congress began receiving queries about the Mayor's health. The rumor may also have been fed when Mr. Dinkins went to a hospital to visit Oliver Tambo, the ailing former A.N.C. leader.
But except for a nascent cold and plenty of jet lag, Mr. Dinkins is fit, and protected not only by Dr. Hamburg but also by more than a dozen police bodyguards from New York, their fares paid by the city. But only two of the bodyguards are being allowed to carry guns by arrangement with the South African Police.
That does not mean the bodyguards do not have their hands full. On Tuesday, Deputy Inspector Jules A. Martin carried a sack of Mets sweatbands to hand out to children, and today a detective unloaded boxes of used high school math and physics textbooks -- donated by the Hunter College campus schools -- at a black elementary school. For the bodyguards, this was not that unusual. They sometimes pitch in with similar tasks while accompanying the Mayor around New York City's boroughs.
 
Sharing the Spotlight
 Mr. Dinkins's picture made page one of the Sowetan, the main newspaper aimed at blacks, under the headline, "Welcome Home, Comrade," and the Mayor's visit prompted inside coverage in other papers, but he is not getting all the attention on the trip. H. Carl McCall, the lanky president of the New York City Board of Education, was mobbed by children at the Gordon Combined Primary School in Alexandra as he tried to pass out free pens.
Dr. Betty Shabazz, director of Institutional Advancement at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn, is given special treatment everywhere and invariably introduced by Mr. Dinkins as the widow of Malcom X. Also in the Mayor's party is Lee Dunham, owner of a string of McDonald's franchises in Harlem, who is hoping to plant some golden arches in this land of gold mines in a post-apartheid economy.
"A lot of possibilities," he said today. "The highways! That's where you make your money, on the highways. You can landscape it, and make it attractive, and people feel better there than going into the congestion of the cities. And most of those stores are given to favorite sons in every city."
But the person who may stick closest of all to the Mayor is the Rev. Herbert Daughtry, the fiery pastor of the House of the Lord Pentecostal Church in Brooklyn, who manages to place himself squarely in camera range whenever the Mayor is photographed. Today, Mr. Daughtry was spied shooting some suspiciously professional-looking pool in the taproom of the Lethabong Restaurant in Alexandra.
Asked what his congregation would think, he smiled sheepishly and said, "Oh, I learned this a long time ago."
 
A Two-Faced View
 If the Mayor's tour often seem a surreal tangle of contradictions, so does South Africa. This morning, his dozen-car motorcade of Mercedeses and Volkswagen vans left the Mayor's suite at the Carlton Hotel for a township where shack dwellers grow gardens on top of graves because there is so little land, and saw where A.N.C. supporters were slain in attacks by rival blacks. Tonight, city officials took snapshots of each other and their new friends at a reception in the American Ambassador's rambling villa on a lush hill overlooking Pretoria.
This two-faced view was summed up in the immigration airport-landing cards that members of the Mayor's party, like all other visitors, were required to fill out upon arriving on Tuesday.
A marketing survey inside the three-page form asks whether tourists have come more for the scenery or the wildlife, and "trusts you will have a most enjoyable visit."
But the first page is more stark: "Temporary residence permits are issued to visitors on arrival. The permit determines the purpose and period of stay in South Africa, and the conditions may not be changed without the permission of the Department of Home Affairs."

About the Lifelong Love Of a Lubber for Boats

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT

 BODY:

Small Craft Advisory
A Book About the Building of a Boat
By Louis D. Rubin Jr.
394 pages. Atlantic Monthly Press. $21.95
Despite what its title implies, Louis D. Rubin Jr.'s "Small Craft Advisory: A Book About the Building of a Boat" is not an instruction manual. Rather, it is the author's entertaining, if slightly quixotic, attempt to understand a lifelong obsession with boats that has hummed like a pedal note beneath his many other interests. 
 As Mr. Rubin presents it, this obsession seems to have had three faces. One was a preference for power over sail. He has nothing much against sailboats, having even owned a few of them. But in an amusing early chapter he explains why sailboats take too much energy while power boats allow you to go places and do things.
More important, the category of power boats includes what Mr. Rubin calls workboats, and workboats served to reconcile the two worlds of his childhood in Charleston, S.C. One was Downtown Charleston, "patrician and cultured and historical and scenic and romantic and literary."The other was Uptown Charleston, "middle-class and democratic and everyday and practical, and very, very Real."
Mr. Rubin lived Uptown, but his dreams were of Downtown, and would be fulfilled when he grew up to become a teacher of literature and creative writing, the author of more than 40 books and the founding publisher of Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, N.C., which would launch a number of Southern writers to prominence.
For Mr. Rubin as a child, the one concrete thing about Downtown Charleston was the workboats at Adger's Wharf. So: "To be associated with a workboat was to unite those two realms of existence. They were almost the only part of my experience back then that I could identify as representing what I hoped someday to attain: a place for grounding my imagination in actuality."
The second face of his obsession was owning a new boat. As he recounts his maritime career, he was forever taking friends out on second-hand tubs, only to turn back to shore when the motor or the steering broke down. Once on a family outing his boat actually sank. On the drive home that night his wife broke down sobbing.
Of course, his income as a teacher dictated economy, but that was only a rationalization. Twenty-five years earlier, when he dared to order a new boat custom-built, his mother's health suddenly deteriorated, his boatwright came down with a bad back and he himself suffered a mild nervous breakdown. He was hesitant to try again.
Finally, his obsession with boats involved an aversion to traveling any place significant in them. He dreamed of setting off for the Caribbean, but his father's traumatic bankruptcy during the Depression had instilled in him a deep fear of risk. He believes this is why he could never learn to swim. Boats were as close as he could come to what he reminds us the character Stein, in Joseph Conrad's novel "Lord Jim," called the "destructive element" in which a man must "immerse" himself.
When Mr. Rubin reached his late 60's and found himself with more free time and money, he at last made up his mind to build the new boat of his dreams. It would be made of wood, with a hull configured like a workboat and a cabin roomy enough to live in for days. It would be built by an expert; the author was too clumsy and out of shape to do the work himself.
This decision to build is announced at the opening of "Small Craft Advisory." There follows the description of his obsession, interspersed with reports of the new boat's progress. The resulting narrative turns alternately inward and outward. In one chapter he will describe a cruise along the waters of North Carolina, where he now makes his home.
In the next he will observe, "We do not ever eradicate the early patterns of our experience; they remain with us all our lives. What we can hope is to be able to learn to identify such patterns when they occur, and to understand why they exist and what they mean, so that we will not be at the mercy of forces whose existence we do not recognize, and so be unable to prevent those forces from distorting our perception of reality."
This mixture of scenery and psyche gives the book a somewhat cluttered aspect, like one of those old shipyards that the author is so fond of puttering around. You wish at times that he had found a single journey to capture his complex ideas, like the trip down the Mississippi that he admires Mark Twain for having dramatized in a section of "Life on the Mississippi."
Still, one can't help warming to the portrait Mr. Rubin draws of himself. His hero is Rat in Kenneth Grahame's "Wind in the Willows," who made that famous remark about the joy of "messing about in boats," and then added: "In or out of 'em, it doesn't matter. Nothing seems really to matter, that's the charm of it."
But Rat is too sleek and efficient to be a model for Mr. Rubin, who describes himself as overweight and sedentary and not very good with tools. In the middle of messing about on a winter day in the cabin of his brand new boat, which he ended up naming "The Algonquin," fatigue would sometimes overwhelm him and he would lie down on his comfortable bunk and take a nap.
In doing so he reminds one of another likable character in "The Wind in the Willows," wise old Badger, whose habit it was after lunch to announce that he had important work to do and retire to his study. There, he could be spied on a little later leaning back in a chair with a handkerchief over his face.
This is really Badger's book, not Rat's. If Badger wrote a book about boating, it would be "Small Craft Advisory."

HEADLINE: Behind the Numbers: Voices of the Unemployed

 BODY:
 The numbers climbed in the tough economic times of the last two years.
 Although some areas like the health-care and social-service industries have shows gains, 160,000 jobs were lost in manufacturing. In department stores, food shops, automobile dealers, lumber, furniture, office equipment - wholesale and retail trades - 150,000 jobs were lost. In finance, insurance and real estate, 50,000 were lost, and in construction and other industries, 92,000.
 Behind the numbers are personal stories of the unemployed - people who wait and people who hope. A look at their struggles appears on page B8.

GRAPHIC: Photo: "It used to be that you could talk yourself into a job," says Karen L. Johansen, an unemployed commodities trader from Chappaqua, N.Y. "Now, even if they need someone who has sold lightbulbs for 3.5 years, there are hundreds of people out there who have done that."
 Out of work for almost a year now, Mrs. Johansen is one of the thousands of unemployed in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut who have seen weeks turn into months with still no job on the horizon. With savings dwindling, $7.50 movies are a luxury. Many have rewritten resumes, gone back to school, leaned on parents. Mostly they wait.

A Familiar Pattern For a Brick Mason

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES

 BODY:
The lines at the New Jersey Department of Labor's branch in Newark tend to snake out the doors and around the squat building on Broad Street. Roger Holmes, a 25-year-old construction worker, has learned to get there early.
In two years as a brick mason Mr. Holmes has been laid off "lots of times," perhaps half a dozen or more, he said. Three months ago it happened again. In each instance Mr. Holmes has waited six weeks or more before applying for unemployment insurance, partly because he has expected work to come along, mostly because he dreads the process. 
 "You get here after 9, you might get out at 3:30," he said one morning as he waited to complete his application.
 
Disdain for 'Idle Money'
 By the time he arrived at 8:25, the office, as dreary as a dingy bus terminal, was already crowded and the faces of the waiting men and women already looked weary. It was his second trip to the office for the latest round of unemployment benefits. He was scheduled to see a film, as required of all applicants, on the rules of filing for benefits.
Mr. Holmes said he does not want to sit around and wait for unemployment checks -- and not just because the checks amount to only a fraction of what he would make in his $16.50-an-hour union job. A strapping, energetic man, he finds the tedium of joblessness intolerable. Some people he knows have told him that he has it made -- good work when he can get it and money even when he can't. But he calls the unemployment checks "idle money."
"I hate not working," he said. "I'd rather be busy."
 
A Different Line of Work
 He calls his union delegate almost every day to see if he is needed at a construction site. Sometimes he is, and then he finds bricklaying rewarding, he said; he likes what he does.
Mr. Holmes is single and lives rent-free with his mother. But even with his relatively few obligations, he finds it hard to abide the insecurity of the construction field. He would like to get his own apartment, he said, but is wary of signing a lease in financially uncertain times.
So Mr. Holmes plans to do what many have done to ride out the recession: go back to school. In January he plans to enroll part-time in Essex County Community College and major in criminal justice. Then he can pursue a job for which there is always a need, he said. His brother is a state trooper in Virginia and has never been laid off.
But Mr. Holmes is also thinking about law.
"I figure," he said, "people will always need a lawyer."

Trader Still Waits After 400 Letters

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
Karen L. Johansen, a commodities trader, found herself jobless four times during the 1980's. Each time she found a new job within weeks or, at most, a couple of months.
This time is different. 
 A metals and grains specialist who was making $38,000 a year when she was laid off last December, Mrs. Johansen has sent out some 400 letters, expanded her search to more than an hour's commute and attended networking seminars and church support groups. She is even taking a course at New York University on environmental management in the hope of broadening her professional appeal. But commodities firms are still cutting, not hiring, and there have been no offers.
"It used to be that you could talk yourself into a job," said Mrs. Johansen, a 44-year-old native of Buffalo who moved here with her husband in 1981 when his job was transferred. "Now, even if they need someone who has sold light bulbs for 3.5 years, there are hundreds of people out there who have done that."
 
From Two Incomes to One
 Mrs. Johansen's husband, Dick, has a secure job as an environmental engineer, and their 11-year-old daughter, Erin, they say, is still too young for the one-upmanship that underlies so much teen-age consumerism in Chappaqua, a wealthy Westchester County suburb. But while Mrs. Johansen's work is undeniably her passion, it is also a necessity. "We're a two-income family," she said. "I don't have the luxury of saying I can or cannot work if I want."
With her unemployment checks about to stop in two months, the Johansens are taking steps, big and small, to ward off financial injury. They have all but stopped going to concerts, a particular love of hers, and have cut back on dining out. They stretched out their payments on one loan from three years to five and met with their mortgage lender to discuss options. Mr. Johansen has begun to work weekends to make extra money. And Erin did not go to camp this summer, saving the family $2,200.
 
Tales of Selling Shoes
 Yet Mrs. Johansen has remained upbeat, exercising each day and trying to think positively. "If I get 10 rejections, I'm that much closer to getting an offer," she said.
Besides, she said, from having attended support groups she knows her situation could be much worse. She has listened to the pain of high-paid executives who are now "selling shoes at Lord & Taylor and driving limousines."
Ideally, she said, she would like to parlay her experience as a trader into a job in recycling. But if not, she'll survive, she said.
"I could probably get a job at $25,000 if I downgrade my resume, but I've decided to keep going until I'm up against a wall," Mrs. Johansen said. "I can go out and do two jobs if I have to."

Back to School, To Learn Software

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
With 15 years of experience as an administrative assistant, Phyllis Goldberg has enough confidence to describe herself as a "good worker." She spent 12 of those years at the same electronics exporting company and earned a bachelor's degree from Baruch College in Manhattan at night while working full-time.
But those qualifications have been of little help to her since April, when her most recent employer, a catering company in Manhattan, laid her off after only two months on the job. She has been unemployed ever since, though not for lack of trying. 
 "The competition was tremendous," said Ms. Goldberg, who is single, in her 30's and lives in Forest Hills, Queens. "There just weren't any jobs out there."
 
'You Get Down on Yourself'
 So Ms. Goldberg signed up for unemployment insurance, which she said pays her less than $200 a week. Her catering job paid an annual salary in the "high 20's," she said.
She also decided to enhance her skills. At the suggestion of a counselor at the state Department of Labor, Ms. Goldberg enrolled in July in a 20-week computer-training program, financed by the Federal Government, at La Guardia Community College in Long Island City.
Ms. Goldberg can now use Word Perfect, a word-processing software, and Lotus, a business spread-sheet program.
"When you get laid off, you get down on yourself; you forget you're a good worker," Ms. Goldberg said in a recent interview at the Labor Department's Long Island City branch, where she met with her counselor, Fred Roth. "I feel much better about myself now. I know I've done very well in the program."
Ms. Goldberg, who prides herself on being independent, said she had not asked her friends for financial support, though her savings account has shrunk. Instead she has cut costs, like passing up off-Broadway shows and movies.
"I just don't want to pay that kind of money," she said of movie ticket prices. "Seven dollars and 50 cents is too big a chunk when you're unemployed."
 
Drinking Carrot Juice
 Though she continues to "eat right," Ms. Goldberg said, her meals are far from extravagant. "I've been eating a lot of tofu," she said, "and drinking a lot of carrot juice."
Her only release, she said, comes in the aerobics classes that she attends on the weekends at a health club.
But Ms. Goldberg conceded that as the winter approaches she is getting edgy: Both her class and her unemployment benefits end at the end of November.
But she hopes her newfound skills have made her more marketable. "I'm trying to remember to think positive," Ms. Goldberg said. "Sometimes it's very hard to do."

A Fashion Designer Is 'Overqualified'

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR

 BODY:
Barbara Kerin owns an elegant one-bedroom apartment in the Murray Hill section of Manhattan. Her savings account alone could support her for at least a year. And her resume details her more than 20 years' experience as a fashion designer, working with companies like Macy's.
But those assets are of little comfort these days. Like many other high-level professionals -- from corporate vice presidents to academic deans -- she is out of work. 
 In June, Ms. Kerin, 47 years old, lost her job in an extensive round of cutbacks at the Wool Bureau Inc., the American marketing organization for wool growers in the Southern Hemisphere. She had taken a marketing position with the organization a year and a half ago.
 
Diligent Job Search
 Since being laid off she has sent dozens of letters to potential employers in the fashion industry. She has clipped want ads, taping them in a special job-search notebook. And she has begun reading about other industries, hoping to find one less damaged by the drop in consumer spending.
But so far there have been only dead ends.
"I've heard the word 'overqualified' so many times, I don't ever want to hear it again," Ms. Kerin said. "There are so many people like me who just want to work again, who just want to be productive."
Frustration has not been the only byproduct of unemployment for Ms. Kerin. As days of joblessness have turned into weeks, then months, she has had to cut back. Though she is still financially secure, her co-op maintenance payment of $1,100 a month looms ever larger, and her list of "no more's" has grown.
No more clothes-shopping ("only stockings and shoes for interviews"); no more movies ("I rent videos or watch TV"); no more restaurant meals two or three times each week ("I eat in. If I eat with a friend, we eat in and split the cost"); no more cab rides around New York City. ("I walk.")
 
Joining a Support Group
 Ms. Kerin has looked for ways to lift her morale. Though a regular churchgoer before, "church is more valuable than ever when you are going through a crisis," she said. "Now I don't miss. I need to get my spiritual energies recharged." When she calls her parents in Arlington, Va., she said, she hopes to hear encouragement and support and not just family news.
This summer she joined a support group at her church, Marble Collegiate Church on Fifth Avenue at 29th Street, for people who have lost jobs or are changing careers. She has stepped up her volunteer work for the New York Pops orchestra at Carnegie Hall. "And," she said with the delight of rediscovery, "I've begun baking again."
But like her savings account, Ms. Kerin's hopes have a limit.
"You can only be optimistic so long," she said. "When seasoned professionals in this field describe what is happening as 'scary,' you have to struggle to remain positive. Not everyone who has been out of work is going back to jobs in the fashion industry. So where do I go?"

HEADLINE: Bush Should Have Visited Japan

BYLINE: By Mario Cuomo; Mario Cuomo, the Governor of New York, visited Japan on a trade mission in October.

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
Of all of President Bush's countless foreign journeys, few were more important to America than the one he recently canceled, with damaging effects: his trip to Japan, the world's No. 2 economic power.
The visit would have provided a rare opportunity to make headway in closing the huge U.S.-Japan trade imbalance, which makes our limping economy even weaker. Japan's new Prime Minister is even more hard line on trade than his predecessor. Mr. Bush should have understood his ascent as a signal that we must pursue trade issues more vigorously with Japan. Instead, it inspired a retreat. 
 Perhaps it is no coincidence that when the trip suddenly loomed as more challenging than a photo opportunity, Mr. Bush declared he needed to spend more time at home. His timing was off, as are his priorities.
Leadership is urgently needed to mend this relationship: our own economic future may depend on it. We can take the easy path and embrace self-destructive tariff restrictions likely to worsen trade relations. Or we can undertake a major effort abroad and at home to make our own economy more competitive and our relations with Japan more equitable.
Until Americans make a clear national commitment to domestic economic renewal, the Japanese will not take us seriously when we insist that they correct the trade disparity, but we must continue to insist on quick good-faith steps to open markets to American goods.
Soon we should jointly develop a timetable to eliminate the trade imbalance, particularly in the auto and auto parts sectors, which account for a staggering 75 percent of the imbalance. In addition, Japan's distribution and Government procurement systems need far more liberalization to open up markets to U.S. competition.
Exports and investment, not trade restraints, can best rectify the imbalance. But if both countries do not find ways to adjust this imbalance, political pressure will mount to make "blame Japan" slogans part of the U.S. Presidential campaign.
In Japan, I found corporate and Government leaders as worried as we are about America's weakening economy, not to mention the trend toward scapegoating Japan for our own domestic failures. Still, as unemployment and underemployment here soar, understandably frightened, frustrated Americans are searching for answers and scapegoats.
Much of the fear gripping Americans results not from Japan's success but from our failed economic policies of the past decade. Through fiscal irresponsibility, chronic neglect and absence of political will, we have allowed America to descend from the world's largest creditor to the largest debtor. Our workforce is undereducated, our infrastructure is deteriorating, industry invests inadequately in research and development, and, perhaps worst of all, Washington seems unwilling to address the crisis.
While we were falling into debt, the Japanese created the world's most efficient economy by building a national consensus on investing in people, production and technologies. We must do the same. Such unilateral action, along with concurrent action by Japan, could accelerate mutual cooperation in technology, the environment, telecommunications, health care and promoting economic growth in less-developed nations.
Dec. 7 marks the 50th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor. By Dec. 8, we should be focusing on 1991, not 1941, committing ourselves to a new timetable to eliminate the trade imbalance and open a new era of mutual economic prosperity.

HEADLINE: Rails Move People Better Than Highways

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Peter Passell's Economic Scene column for Oct. 30, "Transit Green, Gridlock Blues," leaves the impression that investment in rail projects is a waste of taxpayer money. 
 The column quotes the views on mass transit of Peter Gordon, an associate dean of urban planning at the University of Southern California, in a position paper for the libertarian Reason Foundation. Perhaps Mr. Gordon's immediate environment of urban sprawl and asphalt has insulated his views concerning mass transit.
It is very easy to arrive at dollar figures for "cost per ride" or point to an underused system such as Miami's to cast a negative light on all new investment. This mind-set is the main reason most Americans are physically and financially tethered to their automobiles, while once-thriving downtowns have empty store windows as suburban shopping malls sap their business.
Here on the South Shore of Boston, ground will be broken next spring for the revitalized Old Colony commuter rail system, which was discontinued in 1959 at the opening of the Southeast Expressway connecting Boston with Cape Cod. The abandonment of these lines is universally recognized as a blunder by Massachusetts, with traffic jams of 10 miles to 15 miles commonplace and worsening.
Mr. Gordon may arrive at a dollar figure for the cost of every Old Colony rider while claiming that "most roads cost nothing to use." Who built these roads? Who pays for their maintenance? Over the long term, mass transit moves people more efficiently and cheaply than highways.
The efficient use of mass-transit dollars will provide benefits for all Americans through cleaner air and energy independence. The difficult part will be to get our elected representatives thinking independently of the powerful highway lobby as pressure grows for alternatives to the automobile.

HEADLINE: At Last, Aid for the Jobless

 BODY:
Congressional Democrats were slow to spot the need for additional aid to the long-term jobless this year, but President Bush was even slower. For four months, since July, he resisted extra unemployment insurance as unnecessary and too costly. The economy's weak recovery and his own weakness in recent polls have finally driven him to accept what he rejected only a few weeks ago. It's high time.
The unemployment insurance bill that he now seems likely to accept will provide essentially the same benefits the Democrats proposed and the President opposed from the start. The big difference is that this bill nominally includes revenue to pay for the extra benefits, which the others did not. The estimates of anticipated revenue include some typical Washington bookkeeping artistry. 
 Basic unemployment benefits cover an insured worker for a maximum of 26 weeks. The Government already has a program to provide additional benefits beyond the 26 weeks, but its terms are so strict that no one currently qualifies. The new program, less strict but temporary, would add 6 to 20 weeks more, depending on the level of unemployment in each state. Workers who exhaust their basic benefits and are still unemployed would be eligible for extra payments until the new program expires next July 1; so would more than a million workers who have exhausted their basic benefits since March 1.
These supplementary benefits will cost an estimated $5.2 billion. That's roughly $1 billion less than the earlier Democratic bills but far more than Mr. Bush wanted. The "new" revenue to pay for it comes mostly from old sources.
Some upper-income taxpayers will have to pay their taxes a few months earlier than now required. Businesses will keep on paying an unemployment insurance surcharge scheduled to expire in 1996. And the Government will continue to collect on defaulted student loans by tapping the tax refunds of defaulters -- which it would have done anyway.
All this could have been negotiated months ago. While politicians have been posturing, the long-term jobless have suffered.

HEADLINE: Stocks Mixed, With Dow Ahead by 11.19

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
After trading lower most of the day on a worrisome inflation report, stock prices made a strong comeback yesterday to finish mixed. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 11.19 points to finish at 3,065.30.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was moderately heavy at 184.5 million shares, down from 199.5 million on Tuesday. The Big Board composite was up 0.37, to 219.37, with losing issues narrowly outpacing gainers by 833 to 778. 
 The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 0.67 to finish at 397.41, a new high for the second consecutive day, while the American Stock Exchange composite slipped 0.56, to 391.81.
A late surge of buying narrowly helped the Nasdaq index to its fifth record high in five days, to 556.17, up 0.49. Similarly, the Russell 2,000 was up 0.2, to 188.04.
 
Stocks Off Most of Day
 Stocks were down for most of the day after the Bureau of Labor Statistics released October producer prices that showed the highest monthly increase in a year. The news immediately touched off investor concern about rising inflation and put investors on the defensive ahead of today's consumer price numbers.
A sharply lower bond market weighed heavily on stocks early, but they recouped some of their losses after the Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner, Janet Norwood, said the core Producer Price Index may have been overstated by one-tenth to two-tenths of 1 percent.
Peter Labe, chief investment strategist for Josephthal Lyon & Ross, said the market's initial reaction to the producer prices data, and then the turnaround, was a typical reaction.
He noted the across-the-board activity where just about every issue was hit, and was mildly impressed with the day's volume that showed there was widespread participation. "There is probably no case yet for an up market, or down market, in the near term," he said. "But staying in a narrow range does afford investors the opportunity to wade into the market to pick some good stocks."
In trading yesterday, Immune Response said the clinical trials of its HIV therapeutic vaccine seemed to show the drug safe, but had not yet shown whether it was effective. The stock fell 15 3/4, to 46, after a Food and Drug Administration panel meeting reduced hopes of a quick approval of the vaccine, as a number of analysts lowered their ratings.
Nike shares fell 1 1/8, to 62 1/4 yesterday, as Josie Esquivel, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, lowered her rating on the athletic shoe maker after the stock reached her 1992 price target. She noted that no further adjustments were made on the stock, like earnings estimates, and expects the stock to appreciate from 10 to 25 percent over the next 12 months.
According to an Oppenheimer analyst, George Krug, Tuesday's Department of Agriculture crop report of low grain inventories looks good for increased plantings next year, with an increased demand for fertilizer. IMC Fertilizer stock rose 3/8 to close at 51 3/4.
After telling analysts on Tuesday that it would probably not meet 1992 earnings projections, Kimberly-Clark shares fell 6 3/8 yesterday, to 94, as several analysts reduced their earnings estimates and a few, their ratings. The company held a two-day meeting with analysts, which started on Tuesday, and said analysts' 1991 forecasts were in the ballpark, and their 1992 estimates were possible, but highly doubtful unless market conditions changed fast.
Nordstrom, the shoe and apparel retailer, was down 1 5/8, to 37 1/2, as analysts lowered year-end earnings estimates, after the retailer reported disappointing third-quarter results.
On the other side of the coin, Campbell Soup reported a 25 percent increase in first-quarter earnings, to $1.02 a share, compared to 82 cents a share, and the stock responded by rising 1 7/8, to 81 3/8.
Analysts said that United Technologies is likely to take a fourth-quarter pretax charge of at least $500 million to pay for its efforts to reduce annual costs by $1 billion, as the stock rose 1/2 to close at 50 1/8.
Except for concern about dilution, analysts who follow Goodyear could not find a specific reason for the price decline in the stock, as the tire maker's secondary offering of 12 million shares, priced at $50 a share, began trading. The stock was off 1 1/8, to 49 3/8.
Traders said after Scimed Life Systems told analysts at a meeting in California that it was not on the verge of pulling its Express Catheters from the United States because of patent challenges, the stock rose 6 1/4, to 58 1/2.

An Opportunity, But
With theater attendance falling and the weak economy forcing many studios to scale back their film making, video distributors are looking for alternative programming, from old television series to cable movies, to fill any future shortage of big films flowing into video stores. 
 In theory, this situation could be an opportunity for directors and screenwriters to get involved in more video-related projects. One such film maker is James Toback, who wrote "The Gambler" and the coming "Bugsy," starring Warren Beatty, and directed "Fingers," "Love and Money," "Exposed" and "The Big Bang," just released on tape by Fox Lorber.
Mr. Toback has a high regard for video. "The Big Bang," a documentary-style feature in which people talk about the meaning of life, did not do well in theaters this year, but a subsequent broadcast of the film on PBS drew attention, and the director hopes for a good run on cassette. "Video helps get the gospel out," he said.
Yet Mr. Toback still prefers film and movie theaters. "On a practical level there will be a proliferation of films and film makers who will work on video much more cheaply, so the idea of who is a film maker has expanded radically," he said. On the technical side there are new tools, like the high-definition video camera, that may cut costs, but, in Mr. Toback's view they fall short in esthetic value. "There's something in the luminosity of film that projects the unconscious," he said. "Tape is flatter, more straightforward, less appealing."
Mr. Toback acknowledges the advantages of distribution by television and video. "It's cheaper and more open and there's more of a fair game atmosphere," he said. But he leans to tradition. "With films, everything starts in the theaters," he said. "Theaters have that event quality."
 
Yiddish Exhibition
 "Yiddish Film Between Two Worlds," which opens today at the Museum of Modern Art, is a two-month exhibition of films, most of which were made in the 1920's and 30's. Eleven of the more than 60 films are also available on video from the National Center for Jewish Film at Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass., which provided many of the films for the museum's program. The video titles, which range in price from $54 to $90, include "Tevye" (1939), the Maurice Schwartz film that is the basis for "Fiddler on the Roof"; "The Dybbuk" (1937), a Polish occult classic; "Uncle Moses" (1932), Schwartz's portrait of tenement and sweatshop life on the Lower East Side. Information: (617) 899-7044. Another source for some of the films and more than 100 Yiddish and Israeli films is Ergo Home Video of Teaneck, N.J. Information: (800) 695-3746.
 
NEW VIDEO RELEASES
 A movie director with a string of credits, David Merrill (Robert De Niro) finds himself blacklisted when, more for private reasons than political conviction, he refuses to answer questions before the House Committee on Un-American Activities. Suddenly gone are the private screenings with Darryl F. Zanuck, the house in the hills and, worst for a stunned but resolute Merrill, the chance to make movies. Avoiding self-righteousness, Irwin Winkler's film is a "stirring and tragic evocation of terrible times" (Janet Maslin).
 
The Boat Is Full
1981. First Run Features. $59.95. 1:44. German and French with English subtitles. No rating.
In World War II, a desperate group of refugees, all previously unacquainted with one another, cross the German border into a Swiss town in which they must pose as a family to qualify for sanctuary. Clandestine strategies evolve to evade detection by the Swiss townspeople, who seem more interested in catching rule breakers than in saving people from the Nazis. Depicting the situation with a spare, gentle force, Mark Imhoof's film is "fresh, purposeful and surprising at every turn" (Maslin).
 
Impromptu
1990. Hemdale. $92.95. LD, $39.95. 1:48. CC. PG-13.
It's the 19th century and the celebrities -- George Sand, Liszt, Chopin, Delacroix -- are getting into all the rifts and intrigues celebrities usually do. James Lapine's film, which stars Judy Davis as George Sand, is "so merrily and unapologetically contemporary that all of these events might easily be taking place in the present day, most likely on 'Dallas' " (Maslin).
 
20,000 Leagues Under the Sea
1916. Kino. $29.95. 1:45. No rating.
Stuart Paton's silent takes the Jules Verne story into strange seas. No brooding James Mason of the 1954 film, the exotic Captain Nemo (Allan Holubar) resembles a gaunt Santa Claus as he races around his submarine rescuing a steady stream of unfortunates, victims of myriad boating disasters, who wash ashore on Mysterious Island. Underwater scenes are diverting, as are plot manipulations that at one point transport the whole yarn to an Arabian desert.
 
Scary Stories

1991. Atlas Video. Two tapes, $14.95 each. 35 minutes each. No rating.
With all the animated children's features these days, it's refreshing to come across stories told the very old-fashioned way: on one's feet with no props or graphics whatever. Four storytellers tell tales from various traditions, including Hispanic and Afro-American. There's the story of the nasty uncle who sleeps all day to prepare for his duties as a skeleton at night. Then there's the one about the mosquito as big as an airplane, as well as six other stories suitable for young children. Information: (800) 999-0212.
 
FONDA'S SAGAS
 Among the better films Darryl F. Zanuck produced in his decades with 20th Century-Fox are several robust sagas made in the 1930's starring Henry Fonda. Here are some of these and a few other Zanuck productions available on tape. All are from Fox, and all are in black and white.

Caterpillar Sees a Loss Exceeding $86 Million

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PEORIA, Ill., Nov. 14

 BODY:
Caterpillar Inc., the maker of construction equipment that has been losing more than $2 million a week, warned investors today that it would report a large fourth-quarter loss.
The company said the amount would likely exceed the $86 million that Caterpillar lost during the first nine months of the year. It could not make a precise estimate of the expected shortfall. 
 The announcement sent Caterpillar's stock plunging on the New York Stock Exchange today, to $44.875, down $3.125.
Caterpillar, based in Peoria, attributed the the loss to deteriorating business conditions and a strike and lockout involving the United Automobile Workers union that has idled 8,000 workers.
The company also said it would have to take a charge of $1.7 billion to $2.4 billion when it put into effect a new accounting rule related to projected health-care costs for retirees.
Caterpillar can write off the costs in one lump, which would wipe out half the company's $4.5 billion in equity, or it can spread the cost over 20 years, reducing earnings by $100 million to $300 million a year, said a spokesman, Dick Stober.
He said the accounting change would not affect fourth-quarter results. Caterpillar has until 1993 to decide how to put the new rule into effect.
Caterpillar has struggled all year as demand plummeted because of a worldwide recession.
"While leading economic indicators are signaling the beginning of a recovery in the United States, improvements in the markets Caterpillar serves are expected to lag any upturn in the economy," Caterpillar said.
The company said its prospects for 1992 were clouded by the labor strife. The strike at Caterpillar's plants in East Peoria and Decatur started on Nov. 3, and the company locked employees out of its plants in Aurora and East Peoria on Nov. 7.

Old Issue Back With a Bang

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
"GET our economy moving again," President Bush said this week, echoing the theme of John F. Kennedy's successful campaign against Richard M. Nixon in 1960. Mr. Nixon blamed the Eisenhower Administration's failure to take strong enough action to wipe out the recession for his defeat.
A myth exists that Mr. Kennedy, soon after he took over the White House, swiftly delivered on his pledge to get the country moving again by a big tax cut. Actually, Mr. Kennedy was slow. Although the economy began to recover a month after he took office, the unemployment rate, which had been 5.6 percent in 1960, rose to 6.7 percent in 1961 and held at 5.6 percent in 1962 and 5.7 percent in 1963. 
 President Kennedy finally accepted the advice of his economic advisers, headed by Walter W. Heller, and began to campaign for a big tax cut in 1963. He was assassinated before Congress acted on the proposal. President Lyndon B. Johnson pushed the $14 billion tax cut through in 1964, and the economy surged. But the Vietnam buildup thrust it into inflation, which the tax increase of 1967 was too late to prevent.
When Mr. Nixon gained the Presidency in 1968, defeating Hubert H. Humphrey, he sought to stop the inflation with a policy of "gradualism," relying on the Federal Reserve to keep the money supply -- and the economy -- growing slowly. But recession struck in 1971, and Mr. Nixon, worried about the 1972 election, pressed the Fed to jazz up the money supply; he also threw in tax cuts, spending increases and a devalued dollar to drive the economy up and price and wage controls to hold the inflation down. In 1972, Mr. Nixon was re-elected in a landslide over George McGovern. But after the election, with price controls lifted, inflation broke out. The political business cycle rolls on and on. With last week's elections demonstrating voters' anger over the stagnating economy, the old issue is back with a bang for 1992: How to stimulate economic growth without germinating inflation or other economic ills?
Here are the main policy options now:
* Monetary policy. With chronic budget deficits having swollen the national debt by over $2.5 trillion during the Reagan and Bush years, and fiscal policy tightly constrained, monetary policy has looked like the only wheel in town. The Bush Administration has been leaning on the Fed for easier money and credit. Short-term interest rates are down a lot, long-term rates much less. The money supply has grown sluggishly, and so has the economy.
Some economists think that thanks to the enormous hangover of public and private debt, and business and consumer confidence impaired, monetary policy is not working. The air is full of gloomy metaphors: monetary policy is "pushing on a string," "driving into a 50-mile-an-hour headwind," "caught in a liquidity trap." But most economists -- including those around Mr. Bush -- still insist easier money will work, in time for the election.
* Fiscal policy. Supply-siders are still calling for tax cuts. Anti-supply-siders say the big Reagan tax cut of 1981, which was turned into a Christmas tree with the help of Democrats, is the root of the economy's ills, undermining savings, investment and productivity growth.
President Bush has taken a hesitant line on tax cuts, because of the huge budget deficit and the budget agreement -- to the loud annoyance of the supply-siders. But he has urged Congress to enact "I.R.A.'s that are tailored to boost home ownership," "enterprise zones to spawn a new generation of urban entrepreneurs" -- and a capital gains tax cut."I believe if it could be done without getting a lot of baggage on it coming out of the Congress," he said, it "would unleash investment and get our economy moving again."
* Cheerleading and jawboning. Some critics of Mr. Bush say he should be restoring business and consumer confidence -- by acting more like Mr. Reagan. Mr. Bush has, in fact, been jawboning the banks to cut interest rates on credit cards, urging regulators to take it easy on the banks, coaxing business and consumers to cheer up.
* Benefits for the hard-hit. Mr. Bush has decided to work with the Democrats for an extension of unemployment benefits without breaking the budget agreement.
* Restructuring national priorities. The end of the cold war and virtual disappearance of the Soviet military threat open up the possibility of a bigger "peace dividend" -- either a bigger cut in the deficit that would reduce capital costs and spur investment or new civilian programs to improve "human capital," increase investment in technology, raise productivity and clean up the environment. Cutting wasteful "entitlements" or inefficient and costly health-care policies could make funds available to augment economic growth and raise living standards. But such shifts in national priorities would take years to carry out, and would be opposed by strong interest groups.
Yet a serious effort to tackle the nation's long-term social and economic problems could have a short-run electoral payoff for the candidate who could articulate it.

Weak Data on Economy Bring Losses for the Dollar

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell against other currencies yesterday amid new evidence of economic weakness. Gold prices also dropped.
The dollar slipped after two Government reports indicated the economy continued to waver. 
 The Labor Department said the number of Americans filing new unemployment claims reached the highest level in six months. The Commerce Department said retail sales fell one-tenth of 1 percent in October as nervous consumers continued to be reluctant to spend.
A further depressant was the Labor Department's report that consumer prices edged up just one-tenth of 1 percent in October. The report, coming one day after word that wholesale prices surged seven-tenths of 1 percent last month, eased concerns about inflation.
Analysts said foreign exchange traders read all the reports as signs pointing to another decline in interest rates. That would send the dollar lower because it, like all currencies, is supported by higher rates.
Kevin Logan, the chief economist with the Swiss Bank Corporation, said the dollar remained in a tight range despite the negative economic news.
"We're not getting new information; we're getting confirmation in a sense of what we already know," he said of the latest data.
But he said the dollar was winning some support from traders who thought that with the current level so low, now was a good time to buy.
The dollar fell against the German mark, dropping to 1.62975 marks in New York from 1.6350 late Wednesday. In earlier European trading, the dollar slipped to 1.6305 marks from 1.6380.
The dollar fell to 129.62 Japanese yen in New York from late Wednesday's 130.10. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar fell 0.33 yen, to 129.65 yen, and in London, it was quoted at 129.85 yen.
The British pound gained against the dollar, climbing to $1.7765 in New York, from $1.7745 on Tuesday. In London, the pound rose to $1.7755 from $1.7715.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.4460 Swiss francs, down from 1.4515; 5.5685 French francs, down from 5.5900; 1,227.75 Italian lire, down from 1,231.00, and 1.12995 Canadian dollars, down from 1.13145.

HEADLINE: Stocks Move Lower in Heavy Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks closed lower in heavy trading yesterday after receiving mixed signals about the economy in the October consumer price and retail sales data. The Dow Jones industrial average was off 1.79 points to finish at 3,063.51.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 200 million, up from 184.5 million on Wednesday, as losing issues narrowly outpaced gainers by 853 to 804. 
 The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks was off 0.26, to 397.15 and the Big Board composite was off 0.15, to 219.22. Trading on the American Stock Exchange caused the composite to slip 0.12, to 391.69.
And after setting records on five consecutive days, the Nasdaq composite fell 1.33, to 554.84, as the Russell 2,000 similarly saw its streak snapped, declining by 0.22 to close at 187.82.
Hugh A. Johnson, a senior vice president with First Albany, said: "If there is a word to describe yesterday's market it is 'disappointment.' It looked as though it would be a good day and started with good news. The October Consumer Price Index was below expectations and suggested that inflation may not be the problem as we thought Wednesday when the producer prices shocked the market with an unexpected surge."
A good consumer price report implies that the Fed still has room to lower short-term interest rates, without compromising its credibility as an inflation fighter, he said.
The impact on stocks and bonds was positive, but it did not last in the stock market because the principal focus right now is the economy and earnings, he noted.
 
Concern About the Recovery
 "When you see a divergence of the bond market from the stock market, which we saw, it signals a deepening concern about the strength of the recovery," he said. "And you see noncyclical stocks like drugs, insurance, savings and loans and holding companies do well. Cyclical stocks like aluminums, chemicals and paper do poorly." Right now the message is very clear and hard to miss: Investors are concerned that the payoff of interest rate cuts, for the recovery, economy and corporate earnings is still a ways off, he said.
In the stock market yesterday, Caterpillar, the well-known manufacturer of earth-moving equipment and a Dow component, forecast a loss in the fourth quarter that would be larger than the first nine months combined. The stock fell 3 1/8, to 44 7/8.
Michael Lauer, a Kidder, Peabody analyst, said he had cut his rating on Perkin-Elmer, which fell by 1 1/4, to 32 5/8, and raised his rating on Varian Associates, which rose 2 1/8, to 38 7/8, based partly on the stock valuation. Both companies make electronic devices. Mr. Lauer noted that Perkin-Elmer's stock has been up sharply since September on takeover speculation, which may not happen, while Varian, whose stock is down 30 percent since the summer, may announce a share buyback since it has drastically reduced its debt.
The Senate vote to cap interest rates on credit cards weighed on a number of stock issues yesterday. Advanta, fell 8, to 30 1/2, while MBNA, another credit card company, fell 5, to 31 3/4. Analysts said bank stocks were also down as a result, with First Chicago, off 1 1/8, to 25 7/8; Chase Manhattan, off 1/4, to 17 7/8, and Citicorp, off 1/2, to 11.
A below analysts' estimate of first-quarter earnings was all it took to send Humana stock down 4, to 23 3/8 yesterday. The hospital and health maintenance company said profits would likely be about 48 cents a share, while the mean estimate by analysts was 55 cents a share.

HEADLINE: FRESH DATA OFFER MORE INDICATIONS OF AILING ECONOMY

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14

 BODY:
Signs of economic woe mounted today, as Government agencies reported that retail sales edged down in October while average earnings slumped and the ranks of people applying for state unemployment benefits rose to the highest weekly level since May.
Still another batch of figures showed surprisingly little consumer-level inflation last month, in sharp contrast to yesterday's report of a large rise in prices at the producer level. But the favorable news on consumer prices was tempered by the realization that they, too, pointed toward an economic recovery that has all but come to a halt.
 
No Signs of Strength
 "The economy seems to have lost steam no matter where you turn," said Neal M. Soss, chief economist for the First Boston Corporation. He called retail sales, which declined one-tenth of 1 percent last month after a sizable rise in September, "decidedly punk." 
 The first signs from this month have also been discouraging. The auto industry reported Wednesday that sales of American-made vehicles were down 13.4 percent in the first 10 days of November, compared with the corresponding period last year.
Since retail spending accounts for one-third of economic activity, sales must rebound during the holiday season if the recovery is to regain momentum anytime soon, analysts said. Many merchants earn 50 percent of their annual profits during this period, and poor results would further limit the restocking of shelves that economists are counting upon to spur overall economic recovery.
But consumers' purchases of clothing and other nondurable goods eased two-tenths of 1 percent last month, while purchases of durables like mobile homes were unchanged. These figures are adjusted for seasonal and holiday differences but not for inflation. So, taking higher prices into account, retailers whose cash registers show the same revenues this year as last are actually moving fewer goods.
During the last 12 months, retail sales rose six-tenths of 1 percent, slightly less than the increase of nine-tenths of 1 percent in commodity prices during this period.
 
Prices Held in Check
 The Labor Department's report today that the Consumer Price Index rose just one-tenth of 1 percent in October -- the best performance since a decline of one-tenth of 1 percent in March -- was accompanied by more evidence of consumers' inability to buy.
Real average weekly earnings fell seven-tenths of 1 percent in October, reflecting declines in hours worked and hourly earnings and a rise in prices.
Pinched incomes have combined with job insecurity to drain confidence and thereby erode the recovery, economists say.
"Very few people out there are spending money on anything," said Gilbert Benz, an economist at the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York.
The figures on initial claims for jobless benefits tend to gyrate from week to week. But today's report showing an increase of 33,000, to 454,000, for the week ended Nov. 2 was reason for concern. It was the second straight rise after a plunge in the week that included the Columbus Day holiday, and it carried the pace of new claims back to the recession levels of late winter.
Store sales last month totaled $152.9 billion, with nondurables accounting for $98.3 billion, or just under two-thirds, and durables for $54.6 billion.
Compared with September, sales fell seven-tenths of 1 percent in general merchandise stores, eight-tenths of 1 percent in apparel and accessory stores and 1 percent at gasoline service stations. Sales were higher by two-tenths of 1 percent at food stores and 1 percent each at restaurants and bars and at drugstores.
In durable goods, which are intended to last at least three years, a hefty nine-tenths of 1 percent advance for dealers in building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes was nullified by declines of three-tenths of 1 percent for both automotive dealers and those handling furniture, home furnishings and equipment.
When the entire automotive group is disregarded, retail sales were unchanged last month, the report showed.
Figures on retail sales, which are compiled by the Commerce Department, were revised today to show slightly weaker results for the two preceding months than first estimated. September's advance is now put at six-tenths of 1 percent instead of seven-tenths, while August's decline was seven-tenths of 1 percent instead of six-tenths.
"There's this flatness, this sense of stagnation," said Mr. Soss of First Boston, noting that sales had been going nowhere since July. He said that even though the Federal Reserve had been easing monetary policy for the better part of two years, it had been guilty of excessive "gradualism." He said shock treatment was now required to revive growth. "Inflation has stabilized," he added.
Analysts generally considered today's good report on consumer prices -- though perhaps somewhat overstated itself -- as confirming suspicions of an anomaly in yesterday's report that producer prices jumped seven-tenths of 1 percent in October, the biggest rise in a year. Consumer prices rose just one-tenth of 1 percent in October, and for the year, they have been rising at an annual rate of just 2.7 percent.
The discrepancy between the consumer and producer indexes is mainly attributed to difficulties with adjusting the figures for seasonal factors. For example, the consumer index phases in the effects of new automobile models over several months, whereas the producer index captures this development all at once.
Another partial explanation involves the difference between posted prices and the prices at which business is transacted, analysts said.

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Up 0.1% in October

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14

 BODY:
Consumer prices rose a modest one-tenth of 1 percent in October, the Labor Department said today, the smallest increase in the last seven months. The slight gain put the annual rate of inflation at 2.7 percent.
The report was in contrast to a surprising jump of seven-tenths of 1 percent in producer prices for the month, reported Wednesday. That figure had distressed Wall Street analysts and traders. 
 "The October C.P.I. should allay the fears of those who thought that yesterday's P.P.I. figures signaled the start of a new round of inflation," said John Albertine of Albertine Enterprises in Washington.
 
Bond Prices Gain
 The slight rise in the Consumer Price Index, along with a decline of one-tenth of 1 percent in retail sales reported by the Commerce Department, sent bond prices sharply higher. Traders said low inflation and the fall in consumer spending rekindled the possibility of further cuts in interest rates by the Federal Reserve.
"It's clear that the recovery has lost all of its momentum," said Russell Sheldon, an economist at the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.
The Bush Administration, however, put a more positive interpretation on the reports. "The figures tend to suggest that we are coming out of recession; today's figures on inflation are very good," Marlin Fitzwater, the Administration spokesman, said at a news conference.
The consumer price report also lifted stock prices in early trading, although the Dow Jones industrial average later closed 1.79 points lower, at 3,063.51.
 
Core Rate Barely Rises
 Today's report said the so-called core rate of inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, also rose one-tenth of 1 percent after a gain of four-tenths in September.
Many on Wall Street had expected the overall index to rise by two-tenths of 1 percent and the core rate to rise three-tenths.
The overall October increase of one-tenth of 1 percent was the weakest showing for prices since March, when they declined one-tenth of 1 percent.
The department said the contrast in the consumer and wholesale price reports reflected, in part, different methods of calculating auto prices, which were largely responsible for the rise in the Producer Price Index.
Producer prices rose seven-tenths of 1 percent in October, while the core rate climbed five-tenths.
Although the producer price figures seemed to catch Wall Street off guard, analysts have generally concluded that the numbers did not necessarily mean a new period of higher inflation. Today's report that retail sales declined one-tenth of 1 percent last month after a sizable rise in September should bolster that belief.
October's slim gain in consumer prices followed an increase of four-tenths of 1 percent in September. The Government said the slowdown was broad based, reflecting declines in food prices and a moderation in energy costs.
Food prices, which rose one-tenth of 1 percent in September after falling in the two preceding months, turned down again, falling one-tenth of 1 percent in October.
Medical costs continued to move up briskly, rising six-tenths of 1 percent after increasing seven-tenths in the prior month. Energy prices rose two-tenths of 1 percent after a jump of 1 percent the previous month. The department said a drop in gasoline prices partly offset an increase in the costs of household fuels.
New-car prices fell three-tenths of 1 percent after rising the same amount in September, while services, which account for more than half the Consumer Price Index, increased three-tenths of 1 percent. Services rose by five-tenths in September.
Over all, the Consumer Price Index stood at 137.4 in October, meaning that a basket of goods and services that cost an average of $100 in 1982-84 cost $137.40 last month.

HEADLINE: The War of the Christmas Catalogues

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
The next six weeks of Christmas shopping will be critical to the sales of many retailers, but none more so than mail-order catalogue merchants.
While department stores generate up to 50 percent of their profits in the final two months of the year, many cataloguers count on the same period for 60 percent to 75 percent of their earnings. 
 "The holiday season is going to mean the difference between profit and loss for most of the cataloguers this year," said Robert F. DeLay, an expert on the mail-order business. "This year is terribly important because things have been so flat."
Hoping to put shoppers in the buying mood, Spiegel and some other mail-order companies sent out their Christmas catalogue weeks earlier than usual. Experts say some companies are also likely to re-send their catalogues, with new covers, after Thanksgiving.
Cataloguers are also emphasizing their discounted merchandise and promising to deliver products in time for Christmas, even if orders are placed in late December.
For much of the 1980's, mail-order sales grew by about 15 percent a year. That was triple the growth rate of most department stores and other retailers that depend on face-to-face sales.
But the bleak economy and rising costs have caught up with many catalogue companies. The good news, at least for consumers, is lower prices from a few companies and a reduction in the 12 billion or so catalogues stuffed annually into the nation's mailboxes.
Mail-order experts say that weaker companies are starting to be weeded out -- some merging with larger ones, others folding altogether. Most survivors will have to cope with permanently lower profit margins, analysts and industry executives say.
As if the tough retailing climate were not enough, the catalogue companies have also been hit by a confluence of cost increases imposed by the United States Postal Service, which delivers the catalogues, and by shippers like United Parcel Service that deliver the goods.
Even harder blows may yet land. The industry is feeling pressure from courts and state legislatures on issues that range from sales taxes to proposed privacy laws that would make it hard to send catalogues to people who did not request them. Most catalogue companies do not charge sales tax to customers who live outside the state or states where the company has offices. But revenue-hungry states are trying to change that.
The various rising costs "could have some impact on the basic economics of the industry," said Richard C. Anderson, chief executive of Lands' End Inc., a mail-order retailer based in Dodgeville, Wis. "With these fierce price increases, it becomes rather difficult to survive if you are a smaller company."
 
'A Question of Size'
 The recent casualties include Royal Silk Ltd., which had offered popular moderately priced silk apparel through its catalogue. The company went out of business this summer after a costly expansion into retail stores.
Sensing opportunity in the industry's plight, Montgomery Ward & Company said last month that it planned to re-enter the mail-order business with a line of speciality catalogues. Company executives said the pressures on weaker players made it "perfect timing" to start the new business.
"In this business, it's very much a question of size," said Sharon E. Rappaport, an analyst with Morgan Stanley & Company. "It's all dependent on volume," she said. "The larger you are, the better you are able to take advantage of discounts," in postal rates and buying merchandise.
 
Mining the Niches
 But size is not everything. Two of the nation's largest cataloguers, Sears, Roebuck & Company and the J. C. Penney Company are struggling to breathe life into their "big book" catalogues, which try to be many things to many people.
Several companies, however, are doing a brisk business in more narrowly focused areas. A fresh-flower catalogue, Calyx & Corolla, for example, is attracting a lot of attention and customers with its offerings of orchids, anthuriams and birds of paradise.
Children's clothing is another hot area. Hanna Andersson, a Portland, Ore., cataloguer that specializes in cotton clothing made in Sweden, is attracting legions of parents.
Not all successful catalogues are aimed at the affluent. Fingerhut Companies, based in Minnetonka, Minn., is growing quickly by selling a wide range of goods on credit, primarily to lower-income families.
Analysts said there is no true catalogue equivalent of the discount stores, which have revolutionized retailing by offering name-brand merchandise at lower prices than are found in department stores. But the new Ward venture, analysts said, may be taking aim at that market. And other mail-order merchants, including Lands' End, have been placing added emphasis on their lower-priced offerings and beefing up sections that feature discounted goods.
The current cost pressures are forcing companies to alter their basic approach to the business.
In April, after much agonizing, L. L. Bean Inc. reversed a 79-year tradition of free shipping and began charging its catalogue customers a $3.50 fee for each order.
"It was something we were very reluctant to do," said Catharine Hartnett, a spokeswoman for the Freeport, Me., company, which mails 100 million catalogues a year. "We waited as long as possible before making the decision."
Companies are also revising their blanket approach to mailing. Infrequent buyers are quickly dropped from mailing lists because they do not support the cost of paper and postage. Producing and mailing each catalogue costs about a dollar, according to industry estimates.
And while it may not be apparent yet, mailers are also sending out fewer catalogues.
 
Smaller Books, Shorter Lists
 Some merchants are even shrinking their offerings to save money.
"The next catalogue will be smaller," said Kevin Sweeney, a spokesman for Patagonia Inc., a Ventura, Calif., retailer of outdoor clothing. Patagonia recently laid off 120 people, or about one-fifth of its work force, because of a slowing sales. This year's holiday catalogue pages will be the size of an 8 1/2-by-11-inch business letter, in contrast to the Patagonia's previous oversized offerings. "Cost is the primary reason," Mr. Sweeney said.
Responding to the same pressures, the Lillian Vernon Corporation decided to cut its catalogue circulation by 10 percent. The company also took steps to more carefully direct its mailing to proven catalogue shoppers, a move that paid off with higher revenue per catalogue mailed.
Despite such measures, the Mount Vernon, N.Y., company recently reported reduced revenues and a loss for the first six months of its fiscal year.
 
Impact of Rate Increases
 It was in February that the United States Postal Service increased the third-class rates used by mailers by 40 percent. In the case of Lands' End, the increase will translate to $7 million more in expenses this year.
Yet, even after the United Parcel Service added its own rate increase, many catalogue companies have been reluctant to pass along the price increases to already skittish consumers.
The tax issue continues to hang over the industry. State governments are currently barred from charging taxes on sales by out-of-state companies that have no stores in a state. But last month, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case that could overturn the prohibition on sales taxes for most catalogue purchases.
 
Two Views on Taxes
 Catalogue companies express concern that having to charge and administer state taxes will hurt sales and increase operating costs.
But Ms. Rappaport of Morgan Stanley noted that several large cataloguers already charge sales tax, because they have retail stores as well. "I don't think that it threatens the viability of the mail order business," she said.
Privacy laws, though, could be more damaging than either taxes or postal increases, said Mr. DeLay, publisher of The DeLay Letter, an industry publication in New York. He said that a California proposal would effectively require companies to obtain permission from consumers before sending them catalogues. Even if the proposal does not become law, he said, "down the road, there are going to be some restrictions."
Which is why many cataloguers are afraid that the years of easy growth may be over. "When we got started," said Mr. Anderson of Lands' End, "we didn't have these problems."

HEADLINE: Credit Card Rate Caps Draw Fire

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Bankers warned yesterday that a measure approved by the Senate to limit credit card interest rates to 14 percent would bring a sharp reduction in the availability of credit cards that would disrupt the economy.
Although the credit card business has been highly lucrative for several years, the bankers said the profit margin was not so great that they could afford to cut interest rates to 14 percent from the current average of 18 percent or 19 percent and still earn a profit. 
 "Our average member makes $1.90 for every $100 of card loans," said Alex W. Hart, president of Mastercard International. "If the interest rate is reduced to 14 percent, you take $5 from that profit, and the business becomes uneconomical" or a loss. Mastercard, like Visa, helps banks advertise credit cards and arranges for payments to merchants who accept the cards, but the cards themselves are issued by banks and savings institutions.
 
Accused of Gouging
 Proponents of the rate ceiling, including Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, who introduced the measure as an amendment to a broader banking bill that is pending in the Senate, say banks are gouging consumers by keeping credit card rates high even while rates on consumer deposits have fallen. A companion banking bill was defeated in the House yesterday.
Robert R. Douglas, vice chairman at Chase Manhattan Bank, which has more than $9.3 billion of credit card loans outstanding, warned yesterday that an interest rate ceiling "would undoubtedly result in a cutback of billions of dollars in consumer credit, especially to lower- and middle-income consumers."
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said that while the Administration favored lower credit card rates, "we should let the marketplace determine the rates." He said the Administration would oppose legislation calling for an interest rate ceiling, and he repeated a warning from the American Bankers Association that a rate limit could lead banks to eliminate one-third to two-thirds of all outstanding credit cards.
Several members of the House Banking Committee's Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs are expected to introduce a 14 percent ceiling on card rates in a bill on Monday.
Edward L. Yingling, executive director of government relations at the American Bankers Association, said that similar legislation was defeated in the House by a wide margin in 1987. But he added that the environment was now different as legislators were looking for scapegoats for the weak economy and were unhappy over the need to appropriate money to support the bank deposit insurance fund. "If the House voted on a credit card limit today, it would pass," he said.
The possibility of a rate ceiling was worrisome enough yesterday to depress the stock prices of several companies in the card business.
Citicorp fell 50 cents, to $11, on the Big Board. It has relied heavily on estimated profits of $600 million or more from its 21 million credit card customers while it copes with heavy losses from real estate loans.
Mark Lynch, banking analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company, estimated that with a 14 percent interest rate, Citicorp's revenues would fall by as much as $1.9 billion, and the company could post a big loss next year rather than the modest profit analysts now expect.
"They would not actually lose that much," Mr. Lynch added, "because they would compensate for a lower rate by raising fees, kick out people who pose a credit risk and eliminate the grace period," the interest-free period between the time of the purchase and when the first payment is due.
Shares of the MBNA Corporation, a Baltimore company that specalizes in the credit card business, fell $5 yesterday, to $31.75, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Although many banks have been introducing cards with interest rates below 14 percent, they are alarmed by the legislative moves because the low-rate cards have been offered only to their least risky customers. With losses on delinquent cards rising to 5 percent of total credit card balances this year from 3.5 percent last year, bankers say they cannot afford to offer lower rates to all their customers.

HEADLINE: Trump's Bank Talks May Trim Plaza Stake

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
Donald J. Trump is negotiating a deal with bankers that could result in his giving up part-ownership of the jewel of his empire, the Plaza Hotel, people involved in the talks said yesterday.
The negotiations, aimed at changing the terms on about $430 million in bank debt, were forced by Mr. Trump after he refused to pay $1.6 million in interest due on the $300 million first mortgage he used to purchase the hotel. 
 His decision not to pay did not result from lack of money: The Plaza has almost $6 million in its bank account. Rather, Mr. Trump is trying to force the banks to give him more lenient terms on the $300 million first mortgage and an additional $125 million loan that he used to acquire the hotel. (With accrued interest, the debt now tops $430 million.)
Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that he will not sell the Plaza, and by forcing a renegotiation now he increases his chances of keeping the hotel under his control. The banks cannot simply foreclose because that would certainly hurt the hotel's business, impairing the value of one of Mr. Trump's better-performing assets.
The Plaza negotiations are separate from the broader restructuring of Mr. Trump's debt-laden empire. The general overhaul of the financing on most of his assets was played out over the last 18 months in a series of high-stakes negotiations with about 100 banks and thousands of bondholders.
The broader bank agreements are nearly complete and include all of the developer's assets, except for the Plaza, Trump Tower, his Atlantic City casinos and the railyards on the West Side of Manhattan. For each of those assets, Mr. Trump and several banks have cobbled together separate agreements.
"The overall Trump restructuring is 90 percent done," said one banker, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Mr. Trump had planned earlier this year to convert most of the Plaza's rooms to condominiums, but a conversion plan has yet to be filed with regulators, and the idea is widely thought to be unworkable. Last year, the cash from operations on the Plaza fell short of interest expenses by about $20 million, even though the hotel had positive cash flow of about $21 million before expenses.
But last year in an effort to help the property meet its obligations, the annual interest payments of nearly $8 million on the $125 million loan were deferred and will accrue for several years. So Mr. Trump is now obligated to pay only about $19.5 million a year on the first mortgage.
The Plaza, which is doing a brisk business and has occupancy rates of about 80 percent, can afford to pay the $19.5 million in remaining yearly interest. But Mr. Trump is hoping to get an extension on the maturity of both loans on the Plaza and lower interest rates. If the 26 banks that hold the first mortgage grant him those concessions, it is likely that Mr. Trump will have to give up some of his ownership stake.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Rexene, Awash in Debts, Turns Up as Golf Sponsor

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
William J. Gilliam, chairman of the Rexene Corporation, has walked tall as a deal maker on Wall Street, especially after he and some employees of Drexel Burnham Lambert led a buyout of the Dallas-based petrochemical company in 1988, then took it public four months later at a huge profit.
But last month, Rexene, which Mr. Gilliam has headed since the buyout, crash-landed in a Delaware bankruptcy court in a way that made it more than just another victim of too much debt piled atop an inefficient, cyclical business. 
 For more than a year, Mr. Gilliam knew that Rexene would have trouble repaying $403 million in debt due in July 1992. So he leaned on his creditors for months to make concessions. The agreement in principle they finally reached allowed Rexene to outline a reorganization plan that it filed in court on Oct. 18 and gave the company some financial relief.
Yet, just 19 days before the expected court filing, and without the bondholders' knowledge, Rexene turned up as a sponsor of the prestigious Ryder Cup golf tournament.
That put highly indebted Rexene in the company of the International Business Machines Corporation, the Coca-Cola Company and 14 other well-heeled sponsors. The companies reached into their deep pockets to spend at least $125,000 apiece -- $100,000 for the private tent and at least $25,000 for food and drink -- for the privilege of showing their guests some Southern hospitality apart from the throngs of spectators.
The guests began arriving on Kiawah Island, S.C., in late September, a few days before the final round. As a resident of both Kiawah and nearby Charleston, Mr. Gilliam should not have had far to come, but his company did pick up his guests' hotel bills and air fare.
By day, Mr. Gilliam and his guests enjoyed free food and drinks in a homey, air-conditioned place, while watching the competition on three television sets. By night, the group did the town, including a stop at the four-star Restaurante Million in Charleston, which Mr. Gilliam owns.
Rexene's spokesman, Neil J. Devroy, declined to say how much the entire affair cost, and accused a reporter of "trying to undermine the company" by asking.
 
Estimate of Cost
 Mr. Gilliam, through Mr. Devroy, declined several times in the last week to be interviewed.
Tournament officials estimate the event cost each sponsor $200,000 to $300,000, though Rexene, they say, may have spent less. Mr. Gilliam's New York-based investment firm, Gilliam & Company, promised to pick up half the tab in exchange for half the spots on the guest list.
Corporations often use such sponsorships to woo clients, reward employees and burnish their image. Still, some bondholders, corporate governance specialists and others who follow troubled businesses are asking, what was a financially pressed and little-known chemical company doing as a sponsor of a major golf tournament?
"Probably what was spent on the golf tournament wouldn't really move up anybody's share in the bondholders' settlement," said Kevin Foley, who, as deputy insurance superintendent for New York State, controls the $40 million of Rexene bonds owned by Executive Life of New York, a troubled insurance company. "On the other hand, if it's 50 cents, it's 50 cents that should go to the bondholders, and I don't see how sponsoring a golf tournament substantially helps a chemical company."
Gregg Jarrell, a former chief economist of the Securities and Exchange Commission who now teaches finance at the University of Rochester, went further.
"Not only is it not appropriate, it's shameful," he said. "There's a mentality unfortunately at some firms to take what you can get and run."
Many bondholders said they, too, were dismayed by Mr. Gilliam's business-as-usual attitude. They said they never thought they had to ask him explicitly not to spend the company's money in dubious ways.
"We're not forensic accountants," said one person involved in the negotiations, who like many declined to be quoted out of fear of upsetting the tentative agreement. "You don't go in and say, 'No Ryder Cup,' and the other side says, 'O.K., I'll do the U.S. Open.' "
 
Rexene's Views
 The Rexene spokesman, Mr. Devroy, said the commitment to be a sponsor was made last year, and the money paid in advance. He explained that the company decided it would reduce costs, say, by not inviting spouses, rather than withdraw and forfeit the money. And Mr. Devroy said that Rexene has canceled all sponsorships for 1992.
"There certainly was an opportunity to control the expenditures," Mr. Devroy said. "But there was not an opportunity to walk away."
But Kathy Boles, the 1991 tournament manager, said Rexene put down just 10 percent of the $100,000 rental fee a year ago, 40 percent in January, and the rest in June.
Moreover, the signing of the contract was held up until February. The hitch: Mr. Gilliam, who enjoys the sport of negotiating deals, haggled with the event's organizers to allow his Restaurante Million to cater his tent. He was rebuffed.
The Ryder Cup was not the first time that Mr. Gilliam's perquisities have stood out from the background of Rexene's modest business:
*Mr. Gilliam has taken out $23.2 million in profits from the company since the buyout and has $4 million more of paper profits on his 12.6 percent stake.
*Up until the day before the formal bankruptcy filing, he was charging Rexene $1 million a year in management fees.
*Also before the filing, he was charging Rexene more than $4,000 an hour -- the full charter market rate -- for use of his private Falcon jet for company business.
Outside investors have less to show for their forbearance. The proposed restructuring gives bondholders 55 to 65 percent of the company's equity. But they will have to wait 7 to 10 years beyond 1992 for their money, and they are taking an interest-rate cut.
As for shareholders, stock they paid as much as $24.875 a share for in 1988 traded yesterday at $1, unchanged.

Midway Set To Sell Off Its Property

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Midway Airlines, the troubled Chicago-based airline that symbolized the successful upstart carrier of the 1980's, stopped flying yesterday -- for good.
"There's no choice -- we don't have any money," said David Hinson, chairman of the airline. A credit line of $40 million that had been available under an agreement in which Northwest Airlines would take over the carrier dried up after Northwest backed out of the deal on Wednesday. 
 The end of Midway, the nation's 12th-largest carrier at the beginning of the year, cost 4,300 workers their jobs and disrupted the flight plans of thousands of travelers on its almost 200 daily flights. Several airlines, including United, American, Continental, Southwest and Northwest itself, said they would honor Midway tickets, with various restrictions applied.
 
Frequent Flier
 Mr. Hinson said the 670,000 members of Midway's frequent-flier club would be unable to redeem their mileage because no other carrier would honor them.
Mr. Hinson said in an interview that the only issue left was whether the Bankruptcy Court would let the airline's management sell off its planes, airport gates and other assets under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code or put the case under Chapter 7, under which a court-appointed trustee would take over the liquidation.
Mr. Hinson said that after the airline sold its assets some money might be left for the unsecured creditors.
The unsecured creditors said they would work with Midway to pursue legal options against Northwest. While Northwest contended that Midway had given it misleading information and thus the deal to take over the carrier for $153 million could not be completed, Midway denied the accusation and said Northwest had accurate information. Its executives were puzzled yesterday by Northwest's action and felt that the carrier had pulled back for some other reason.
Midway was founded in 1979 just after the industry was deregulated. Operating out of a hub at Midway Airport in Chicago, Midway flew to 40 cities, including New York, Boston and Washington. In 1989 it added a second hub in Philadelphia, but it sold it a year later to USAir. And last March it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The immediate reasons were the decline in traffic during the Persian Gulf war and the recession, and higher fuel prices.
The airline was also being humbled by larger competitors that offered more frequent flights to more destinations, had their own computer reservation systems and greater incentives for travel agents to book their flights, and offered more attractive frequent-flier plans.
Midway's last flight, from Las Vegas, Nev., arrived yesterday at Midway Airport, where the carrier accounted for 75 percent of the daily flights. The fate of the airport, which is closer to downtown than O'Hare International, is uncertain.
Mr. Hinson said that other carriers, including Southwest Airlines, had expressed an interest in expanding their flights there. Northwest Airlines has 23 gates there, including 21 acquired from Midway for $20 million, and is in a good position to increase the number of flights there.
Some of the airline's passengers were bused from the airport to O'Hare yesterday to get flights.
The way that Midway was suddenly left out in the cold raised the ire of Midway executives and its creditors.
Thomas A. Schick, the president and chief executive of Midway, in a letter to Northwest's general counsel, Richard B. Hirst, said Northwest "has obviously decided that it does not want to do this deal and instead of acknowledging that in an honest and forthright manner, Northwest has adopted classic damage control and litigation tactics in an effort to divert attention and cover up its actions and motivations."

HEADLINE: Disney's Net Down by 25.2%

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 14

 BODY:
The Walt Disney Company reported today that its earnings fell 25.2 percent in the three months ended Sept. 30, largely because of a sharp downturn in its theme park business.
The results for the quarter, the fourth of Disney's fiscal year, reflected the effects of the recession on vacation travel to Walt Disney World in Florida and Disneyland in California, Disney executives and analysts said. The company's earnings, which were in line with analysts' expectations, were also depressed by a downturn in profitability in Disney's film and television business. 
 Net income for the quarter was $174.05 million, or $1.31 a share, compared with $232.66 million, or $1.72 a share, in the corresponding period last year. Revenues increased 2 percent, to $1.74 billion.
The fourth-quarter results capped one of the worst years for Disney since it was revived by a management team headed by Michael D. Eisner in 1984. For Disney's fiscal year, net income fell to $636.6 million, or $4.78 a share, from $824 million, or $6 a share, a decline of 22.7 percent. It was the first full-year decline in earnings under Mr. Eisner's team.
Disney said that the downturn reflected "lower levels of domestic travel and tourism caused by the current economic recession and the gulf war in the spring."
Disney stock gained $1.50 a share today on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $111.875.

HEADLINE: On Eve of Louisiana Vote, Nothing Is Certain

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Nov. 14

 BODY:
The polls say Edwin Edwards, but the voices in the air say don't count out David Duke.
After coming from behind and building an unusual coalition of blacks and business interests, Mr. Edwards now appears within reach of victory, perhaps by a comfortable margin, political experts say. The question is whose voters will get to the polls, and there are more questions about Mr. Edwards's supporters than about Mr. Duke's. 
 "The Duke vote is impenetrable," said Stanley R. Tiner, a longtime newspaper editor and political analyst in Shreveport who is now public affairs director for a gas company there. "It's going to be there even if a tidal wave rolls across the state. Edwards is dependent on the Roemer voters who despised him four years ago -- he was the dragon Buddy Roemer promised to slay. That's a pretty scary prospect if you're sitting in Edwards's seat."
Still, questions about the sincerity of Mr. Duke's recently professed Christianity and whether he has shed the racist views he espoused when he was a grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan are dogging his campaign in the election's final days.
How the issues play out will not be known until Saturday, when a record turnout is expected in the last act of a searing political drama that has at turns entranced, mesmerized and sickened voters here and around the nation.
In its final week, the campaigns are as different as the candidates, one, Mr. Edwards, a three-time Democratic Governor twice tried and acquitted on racketeering charges, the other, Mr. Duke, a lifelong racial extremist now running as a mainstream conservative Republican.
Mr. Edwards, Louisiana's only three-term Governor, is concentrating his energy in New Orleans, spending heavily on television commercials and coordinating a well-oiled old-style political machine and get-out-the vote operation. He exudes confidence, perhaps too much confidence.
Some supporters and analysts say Mr. Edwards is sending a questionable message when he tells voters that his polls and three public polls released this week indicate he has the race won. "It's a very dangerous thing for him to do," said Joe Walker, a New Orleans poll taker. "He's used to politics as they've always been: if you're winning you're on the bandwagon. But that doesn't apply in this kind of election where you've got two candidates that more than half the people don't want."
 
Large Rallies for Both
 Mr. Duke, whose racially charged history has dominated the campaign, is racing across the state, from Lafayette in Cajun south Louisiana to Bossier City in conservative north Louisiana to his base in Metairie in suburban New Orleans. Outspent at least 3 to 1 on television, he is rallying his voters with a message that is more personal crusade than campaign. After a rally before 2,500 supporters near Lafayette Wednesday night, he lingered, signing autographs and hoisting babies for more than an hour like a ballplayer basking in the glow of adoring fans.
"I know why you're here," Mr. Duke told the crowd, which was waving blue and white Duke signs and wearing Duke baseball caps and T-shirts. "This is a much more than a political rally. This is a celebration of a new day coming in Louisiana."
Mr. Edwards drew the largest crowd of his runoff campaign, about 3,000 people, at a rally tonight at The Rivergate, a convention center in New Orleans. "Forty-eight hours from now we are going to send a message to the rest of America that we are too smart, too compassionate and too progressive to elect a David Duke to be governor of Louisiana," he said.
By all indications Mr. Edwards, once a giant of Louisiana politics who left office in near disgrace in 1987 despite escaping conviction in two racketeering trials, has built an unprecedented coalition that has put him within reach of an improbable political comeback.
 
'A Brilliant Campaign'
 Few doubt that Mr. Duke was in the lead after the October primary that eliminated Governor Roemer, the expected front-runner. Since then Mr. Edwards has joined his longtime allies among blacks and his longtime enemies in the business community into a coalition united by a common fear of Mr. Duke's extremist history.
"Edwards is running a brilliant campaign," said Lawrence Powell, a history professor at Tulane University. "He's gone after the Roemer voters and has found a way to appeal to the better angels of their nature. They're afraid they might wake up after a Duke victory and see an economic Jonestown, and they realize the divisiveness out there now is just frightening."
If Mr. Edwards wins it will be because of people like Clay Farnet, a New Orleans restaurateur, and Peg Murison, a New Orleans artist. Like many Roemer voters, both first vowed to sit out the runoff. Now both feel they have no choice but to vote for Mr. Edwards. Mrs. Murison is campaigning door to door. Mr. Farnet still has strong reservations about Mr. Edwards but thinks a Duke victory would be a moral and financial disaster. "I don't like pulling the switch for Edwards, but I'm going to do it because I'm convinced Duke is going to mean a lot of negative things for the state," he said.
After reaching a high just after the primary, Mr. Duke's campaign has come under fire from numerous directions over the past week.
Last night and tonight, WVUE-TV in New Orleans broadcast an interview with a woman whose name was not revealed but who was identified by the station as a former worker for Mr. Duke after his election to the State Legislature in 1989. She said Mr. Duke still voiced the racist and anti-Semitic views he has publicly renounced and still kept in touch with racial extremists.
She said his hatred for blacks and Jews was still apparent. "He would exterminate every one of them if he could," she said, adding, "It's Hitler's mind in David Duke's body."
In a front-page article Wednesday The New Orleans Times-Picayune quoted a Scottish journalist as saying Mr. Duke made blatant anti-Semitic statements to him in an interview last year. Mr. Duke later denied making those statements.
More damaging could be criticism from some Christian conservatives that Mr. Duke's professed born-again Christianity, a staple of his campaign, is also suspect.
Neil Curran, one of five conservative Christian leaders who interviewed Mr. Duke about his spiritual beliefs last week, said he believed Mr. Duke was not sincere about his religious views and was using them as a political ploy -- the same assertion made by the former state coordinator for the Duke campaign, Bob Hawks, when he quit Mr. Duke's campaign this week.
Mr. Curran said: "I think there's a backlash. I think when he used the name of Christ initially, he had some success because people wanted to believe it, but the investigation of the pastors and the denouncement by his own campaign aide who walked out on him have exposed him to evangelical Christians. It's proof."
Mr. Edwards's top priority now is making sure his voters, particularly black voters, turn out. Blacks are expected to make up about 28 percent of the electorate with virtually all of them supporting Mr. Edwards.
 
Fighting Complacency
 In Shreveport today a coalition of black ministers, representing all the major denominations among blacks, endorsed Mr. Edwards and urged a maximum turnout. Leaders said 200 churches in and around Shreveport will be helping to get out the vote. "Everything we have back there in the parking lot that will run is avaailable," said the group's spokesman, the Rev. Dr. E. Edward Jones of Galilee Baptist Church. "We don't want to lose ground we have already gained."
Despite the fear and anger engendered by Mr. Duke's candidacy, some prominent blacks are still worried about getting high turnout. "The problem is many felt Edwards was clearly going to win, because there is such unanimity in the black community, and they're all talking to each other," said Kenneth Carter, tax assessor for the central business district of New Orleans. "That's why I'm concerned about Edwin Edwards mentioning this landslide."
For the Duke campaign, organizing to increase turnout is not a worry.
"This race, it's a waste of time," said David Touchstone, a Shreveport lawyer and active Duke backer. "It's going to be a tremendous effort" by Duke voters, he said, regardless.
The reason is the evangelical fervor of the Duke supporters. At a rally near Lafayette on Wednesday they listened with approval as Mr. Duke blasted the news media, saying all the negative allegations against him were part of a biased media effort against him.
 
'We're Not Dumb'
 For many, the appeal worked.
"All the commentators are telling us we're dumb for voting for Duke," said Lee Castille of Breaux Bridge. "We're not dumb. We just want a change."
For many, the visceral appeal of Mr. Duke's issues was paramount.
" 'Tax, tax, tax, tax, tax,' that's all we ever hear from politicians," said Wendell Martin of Crowley. "And affirmative action? I was working offshore. I applied for a job with Union Pacific Resources. Who got the job? A bunch of Mexicans got it. I didn't get it because I was white. Affirmative action is racism big time."
Although the national and state Republican leaders have disavowed Mr. Duke, he has won the support of a handful of prominent Republicans here. Among them is the chairman of George Bush's 1988 campaign in northwest Louisiana, David Broussard.
"My primary motivation is an anti-Edwin Edwards vote," he said. "I don't see how anybody, even if David Duke is as bad as he may be, could be as bad a Governor as Edwin Edwards will be."

HEADLINE: Salvador Rebels to Halt Attacks; Government Sees an End to War

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN SALVADOR, Nov. 14

 BODY:
With the Salvadoran peace talks approaching their expected successful conclusion, the guerrilla front announced today that it was unilaterally suspending "offensive actions" after nearly a dozen years of civil war.
President Alfredo F. Cristiani immediately responded to what he termed a "signal of good will" and said that the Government and army would take "corresponding unilateral measures" when the rebel measure goes into effect Saturday. 
 "We expect that peace will begin in El Salvador on the 16th with the cessation of armed activities," the President said at a news conference minutes after the leaders of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front made their announcement in Mexico.
"The fighting is over," one of the guerrilla leaders, Shafik Handal, said, "although the end of the war is more complicated."
As Mr. Handal indicated, some important points to negotiate remain on the agenda of the peace talks under way in Mexico City. They include the organization of a new national police force with guerrilla participation and the changes in the army, including a reduction of its size.
Nevertheless, both sides as well as diplomats close to the negotiations continued to predict the signing of a formal, monitored cease-fire before the end of the year, probably at the United Nations in New York.
By their separate actions today, the two sides got around a longstanding roadblock to a temporary cease-fire, which was the guerrillas' demand that the army agree to stay out of predominantly rebel zones until formal peace takes hold.
That question was left unaddressed today. Mr. Cristiani did not specifically declare a cease-fire or an end to actions by the army, but his reference to corresponding measures and the end to armed activities in general implied that.
A senior Mexican official who has followed the talks closely said Mr. Cristiani's declaration was "not very clear, but our understanding is that the Government will observe the truce."
The communique by the five guerrilla commanders said they had decided to suspend "offensive actions, urban operations and economic sabotage" in the war, which has claimed an estimated 75,000 lives. They promised to make the efforts necessary to prolong the suspension until a cease-fire is signed.
"Not one more Salvadoran should die in this war that has already touched bottom and which only lacks the signing of a final, global accord," the guerrilla radio station declared in this morning's regular broadcast.
Mr. Cristiani avoided directly answering questions about whether the army would withdraw elite battalions from guerrilla strongholds like the upper parts of the departments of Chalatenango and Morazan.
"We would be disposed to order what is necessary in accord with how things are advancing," Mr. Cristiani said.
The guerrillas, long claiming that some zones are virtually their liberated territory, say the particularly intense assaults they have made in recent months on electric power plants, bridges and other economic infrastucture has been in response to the army's increased incursions into their areas.
Mr. Cristiani's rightist Government and the leftist guerrillas are nearing the end of a peace process that began early last year under the direction of Alvaro de Soto, a Peruvian diplomat and aide to Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar of the United Nations.
Although a member of the strongly anti-Communist Nationalist Republican Alliance that is led by Roberto d'Aubuisson, Mr. Cristiani made clear after his election in 1989 that he intended to seek peace and to concentrate on the country's economic development.
Guerrilla leaders also decided in 1989 that the war could not be won and opted for negotiations. They say the major offensive they began in November 1989 was intended to convince the army of that as well.
The negotiations have been particularly complicated and detailed because they entail not only a cease-fire and the question of security for former combatants but also an effort by the guerrillas to bring about political and military reforms that will permit them an active role in a country.
Over the last year and a half a series of partial accords have emerged that cover matters like human rights verification, changes in the electoral system to permit more pluralism, judicial reform and general agreement on military reform.
When the talks seemed deadlocked over the military reform question and the related question of how to guarantee the guerrillas' security after they lay down their arms, the discussions talks were moved to New York in September for eight days of almost around-the-clock negotiations in which Mr. Cristiani himself took part.
That broke the stalemate and produced a general agreement that the guerrillas would be incorporated into a new national police but would give up their demand to put some members into the army.
The accord reached in New York called for a reduction of the size of the army, although the numbers and details remained to be negotiated.
The two sides also agreed that the army would be "purified" on the basis of an evaluation of its members by an ad hoc commission. The guerrillas agreed to a Government request that two army officers take part in the deliberations, without a vote.
The pact also allows guerrillas' family members and sympathizers to hold onto lands they have occupied in rebel-dominated areas since early in the war.
Under the terms of the agreement, a peace commission consisting of two members each from the Government and guerrilla front, plus representatives of the political parties, the church and the United Nations, is to supervise the carrying out of the accords.

HEADLINE: Real-Life Courtroom Drama May Play on Broadway Stage

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

 BODY:
Nearly 80 years after it premiered on Broadway with an ill-fated show called "Are You a Crook?," a darkened Times Square theater is auditioning for a new role -- as a real-life criminal courtroom.
Under an unusual plan being advanced by top judges and other New York State and City officials and business executives, a section of the New York City Criminal Court now centralized in downtown Manhattan would be moved into the donated West 48th Street theater, the Longacre, for a three-year trial of a "community based" court, the city's first. 
 The aim, say proponents like Matthew T. Crosson, the state's chief court administrator, is to speed the handling of so-called quality of life offenses that victimize a community but that are often played down in the welter of violent felonies.
By some estimates the court, sitting five or six days a week from 2 P.M. to 10 P.M., would hear about 55 such cases a day, some 15,000 a year out of the nearly 70,000 misdemeanor and 40,000 felony cases a year in Manhattan.
The plan appears to have caught the imagination of some important players. Standing yesterday in the cloth-draped theater, Milton Mollen, deputy mayor for public safety, and a judge, strode to the footlights and intoned, "Life is a stage."
Some, however, including M. L. Henry, of the Committee for Modern Courts, a watchdog group, questioned the plan's usefulness and its fairness to poor communities that cannot afford to sponsor such an innovation. "Will simply moving the court from one location to another make it operate better?" he asked.
The court, to be set up on stage, with the orchestra rows of red plush seats open to spectators, would arraign only misdemeanor offenders arrested or given summonses in the midtown area -- no violent felons. A dozen or so Legal Aid lawyers and social-service counselors would be on hand, literally in the wings and in the balcony, to expedite pleas and sentences of vandals, petty thieves, low-level drug possessors, prostitutes, subway fare-beaters, three-card-monte cheats and other convicted offenders.
Some would be remanded to treatment programs, others ordered to make restitution or work on community improvement projects. A relative few might be sent to jail. But in all cases the aim would be immediate dispositions, a rarity now in the overburdened court system. Accused felons, including violent criminals, would continue to be processed at 100 Centre Street. Pleas of not guilty would also continue to be adjudicated downtown and trials, too, would be held downtown.
With a Times Square court, offenders would be booked, not at Central Booking downtown, but at a midtown precinct where a complaint would be drawn and fingerprints checked. They would then be taken to the theater to plead, cutting hours off a process that now can consume a full day. Minor offenders pleading guilty would also not have to wait for complex felony cases to be heard, and felony cases themselves may be speeded.
The plan, which faces some financial and other hurdles but appears likely to be adopted, has won many plaudits along with some mixed notices. The theater would be loaned, rent free, by its owner, the Shubert Organization, which would also renovate upstairs office space. The redesign would be drawn up by an architect, pro bono. Start-up costs not financed by the city are estimated at close to $1 million the first year, perhaps half that for following years. Some grants have already been given.
"We're enthusiastic; there are great possibilities," said Justice Milton L. Williams, deputy chief administrative judge for New York City Courts. He said he envisioned the Times Square court as a place where law schools might stage moot courts for the public's education, where judges might drop in for community forums. But he added: "The whole thing is money."
Judge Mollen, who has advocated a broader system of community courts staffed by lay judges, said the experiment could demonstrate the effectiveness of such decentralization. But he cautioned that it would have to be done without extra cost to the city, that District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau was still studying the plan and that Mayor David N. Dinkins "is not yet fully committed to it."
Judge Robert G. M. Keating, administrative judge of the Criminal Court, lauded the plan as likely to restore a community component to the court system that, he said, would "mesh" with the Police Department's community policing strategy of attacking quality of life problems as precursors to violent crime.
Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown, who has made community policing his signature program, called the court plan "a natural extension of what we're doing.
Thomas A. Reppetto, president of the Citizens Crime Commission, a business-sponsored watchdog group that last year called for a system of community courts throughout the city.
The plan has been strongly pushed by Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert Organization, and one of its early advocates. Crime, he said, has had a "devastating" impact on the theater district. It was time, he said, that the courts recognized the rights of the community, particularly now that a multibillion-dollar Times Square redevelopment plan has been stalled by a bad real-estate market.
Speaking for the Times Square Business Improvement District, a self-taxing association of commercial interests in the area, Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., the group's chairman and deputy publisher of The New York Times, also applauded the plan. "It could be the longest running show on Broadway," he said.
 
Enough Cases?
 Mr. Morgenthau, whose support for the plan is widely considered important if not crucial, said he was still examining it. His figures, he said, suggested that there may not be enough cases in just the midtown area to justify moving one of the two day parts -- there are five parts, or sections, altogether -- of the Manhattan Criminal Court to Times Square. The court would handle cases roughly from 30th to 60th Streets, Fifth Avenue to the Hudson River.
Still, he said, he was not "a key player," was not out to block the experiment and would staff the court with a prosecutor as required.
But even advocates like Judge Mollen said he was concerned that the plan might be seen as "elitist," favoring a vocal business lobby or powerful Manhattan constituency. "On the other hand," he said, referring to crime in Times Square, "we have a problem. Shall we not be concerned?"
As for Mr. Morgenthau's reservations about the allocation of resources, Judge Keating and Judge Williams said their figures showed that the court part that would be moved uptown would handle the same 55 or so daily cases it was now handling downtown. There would be no shortage of work, they insisted.
The court plan grew out of a breakfast meeting at the Pierre Hotel last spring between Mr. Schoenfeld, Carl Weisbrod of the city's Economic Development Commission and Herbert Sturz, a real-estate executive who is a former chairman of the City Planning Commission and former Deputy Mayor for Criminal Justice. Mr. Schoenfeld at that occasion offered to donate the Longacre.
The theater had been dark since May 1990 when its last show, "Truly Blessed," closed after a month of regular performances. Built in 1913, the Longacre, named for the square that pre-dated Times Square, opened with "Are You a Crook?" a farce about a woman crime buff who plots a stickup only to find she has robbed one of her own friends. The play closed after 12 performances.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Offers to Jump-Start Long Island

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HUNTINGTON, L.I., Nov. 14

 BODY:
Saying that Long Island had been severely damaged by local and national economic forces, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo today unveiled an economic revitalization package that he said should breathe some life into its distressed economy.
Among the initiatives in the program are a $35 million fund for Long Island's parks and a proposal to accelerate hundreds of millions of dollars worth of road projects to jump-start the economy by putting people to work as early as next year. 
 But at a time when the state's own finances are so shaky that Mr. Cuomo said its budget deficit would probably rise past the current projection of $700 million, the Governor had to acknowledge that he had no new money to spend here and that the plan does not include new appropriations.
In a region beset by economic bad times, Long Island is hurting even more than most places. Today, while some Long Island business people grumbled that the Governor's program represented little more than a new packaging of old ideas -- some of the road projects, for example, have been on the back burner for years -- they added that it was at the very least symbolically important that the Governor had ventured here to show his support.
 
Sooner Is Better
 "I think it's a package constrained by limits on government now to do more spending," said James L. Larocca, president of the Long Island Association, the business group that sponsored Mr. Cuomo's address at a breakfast meeting today. "But many of the public works elements, by being moved up in time, become genuine economic development boosts. If you have something moved up by a year or two, it's a real initiative."
Long Island's package was similar to a proposal presented by the Governor for New York City in September. Mr. Cuomo said he planned to present similar plans in Syracuse, the Hudson Valley and the Albany area as pieces of a statewide program called "New, New York."
On Long Island, where property taxes continue to climb, unemployment has reached a 20-year high of 6.8 percent and businesses are failing at record rates, the Governor's visit was seen as a fairly successful effort to mend fences with the business community, which has been miffed at what it perceives as a lack of attention from the state.
The Governor said the plan would represent more than $900 million in new investment that would create more than 25,000 permanent and construction jobs.
"It is a plan to help to diversify and spur the region's economy, to improve its transit system, to create more affordable housing and to insure safe, reliable energy supplies; to preserve the island's natural resources," Mr. Cuomo said.
 
How Many Planes?
 Among other projects mentioned by the Governor are a high-speed ferry to carry cargo and people between New Haven and the Shoreham power plant, the establishment of a Long Island Global Assistance Unit to help encourage foreign trade and new strategies to help move away from a reliance on defense and to encourage a fledgling biotechnology industry.
Mr. Cuomo also mentioned, as he has before, that he is pushing the Legislature to help relieve local governments of some state mandates, and for the state to assume Medicaid costs. And he renewed his commitment to reforming school aid formulas to make them more equitable from district to district.
"Long Island, like the rest of our state and the rest of this country, has problems," Mr. Cuomo said. "Some of them are homegrown, the result of past growth, overlapping government jurisdictions, proliferations of school districts and taxing entities. Those are problems we can handle and the state can assist with."
The money for all this is to come from a variety of sources, including leftover money from the 1988 transportation bond act and money from the state's dedicated highway fund, which is expected to begin generating more than $93 million a year in 1993. Money for the new park fund will be provided by using park fees as leverage for borrowing.
Mr. Cuomo emphasized that he wanted to revitalize the economy while preserving Long Island's environment. But one major part of his proposal -- a plan to study development at Calverton Airport in Brookhaven, a property that Mr. Cuomo said "holds out the greatest promise for creating new jobs on the Island, with the least threat to the surrounding environment" -- provoked dismay from the Island's vocal environmentalists. The development possibilities include turning Calverton into a major hub for freight or passenger air traffic.
"This is a retread of everything that has failed economically and environmentally on Long Island for the last 40 years," said Richard Amper, executive director of the Long Island Pine Barrens Society. "You would be hard-pressed to find a more environmentally sensitive place on Long Island to site a jetport."
Mr. Cuomo pointed out, however, that the 7,000-acre site includes 3,500 acres of open space. Of the 1,000 acres on the property that are zoned for commercial use, only a small portion would be needed for any development scheme, he said.

HEADLINE: China Undercuts U.S. Anti-Atom Effort on Korea

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Nov. 14

 BODY:
American efforts to mount an international campaign to persuade North Korea to halt its nuclear-weapons program were dealt a setback today when North Korea's main backer, China, declared that "dialogue," not pressure, was the way to deal with Pyongyang.
The Chinese pronouncement was made at a news conference by Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, at the close of a two-day meeting of the 15-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. It was certainly not the kind of public position that Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, who was also attending the Asian-Pacific meeting, was hoping to hear from Beijing -- especially coming on the eve of his first official visit to China. 
 Asked for China's view on the Korean nuclear question, Mr. Qian told reporters at his own news conference, "We do not want to see the existence of nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula."
But he quickly continued, "We hope to see the parties concerned engaged in effective consultation to find a solution to this problem, but we do not wish to see any international pressure."
 
Fear of United Korea
 A senior American official based in Seoul, trying to explain the Chinese position, said Beijing had consistently taken the view that the North Koreans should not be pushed into a corner and that their leader, Kim Il Sung, always needed to save face. The Chinese believe the Americans are too impatient in wanting to deal with the matter, the official said, even though estimates are that North Korea could have a crude nuclear bomb within two years.
The official said the Chinese continue to feel protective of North Korea, particularly since they prefer that the division of the North and South be maintained, as they do not want to have to compete with a "vigorous united Korea, with some 60 or 70 million people."
The Bush Administration actually has gone out of its way in recent weeks to give North Korea a face-saving opening to abandon its nuclear-weapons program. President Bush's decision to withdraw the United States' tactical nuclear weapons from South Korea, coupled with last week's announcement by Seoul that it was ready to forgo development of any weapons of mass destruction, were specifically intended to provide Pyongyang with a justification for scrapping its nuclear project.
But North Korea dismissed those moves as empty gestures. That response was one of the reasons that Washington believed only a serious multilateral campaign might have any effect in swaying the economically strapped Pyongyang Government. The fact that North Korea's biggest benefactor, China, appears to want to water down such an effort does not bode well for its success, and again raises questions about what exactly the Bush Administration is getting out of its policy of constructive engagement with the hard-line Beijing leadership.
 
Baker's News Conference
 North Korea has consistantly refused to open its nuclear complex 60 miles north of Pyongyang to international inspection, even though it signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and in September agreed with the International Atomic Energy Agency on a program of safeguards, which it refused to begin at the last minute. That is apparently because the installation contains a suspected reprocessing plant that could produce hundreds of pounds of weapons-grade plutonium.
A few hours after Mr. Qian's morning news conference, Mr. Baker held a joint news conference with other Asian-Pacific ministers, including Mr. Qian, and began by repeating his call for international diplomatic and political efforts to press North Korea until it halts its nuclear-weapons program. From the start of his Asian tour in Tokyo, Mr. Baker has been speaking out about the need for American, Soviet, Japanese and Chinese cooperation toward that end.
"We think the greatest threat to regional security and stability in this area is the threat of nuclear-arms development by North Korea," said Mr. Baker, striking a markedly different tone from his Chinese counterpart. "It is a threat that we think needs to be addressed. We see it as a major regional issue, but also see it as a global issue. I think the United States is joined by some other countries in wanting this matter to be dealt with politically and diplomatically."

HEADLINE: 7 Soviet Republics Agree to Seek New Union

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 14

 BODY:
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the leaders of seven republics agreed today to work toward a new confederated "Union of Sovereign States," with the central authorities exercising powers delegated by sovereign republics.
There was no immediate indication exactly what powers would be delegated to the center, and participants said the agreement was still subject to approval by the parliaments of all the republics. 
 The absence of several republics -- most notably the Ukraine, which is abstaining from any such discussions until after the republic holds a referendum on Dec. 1 on its future -- raised further questions about the prospects of the agreement.
But all participants at the meeting, including President Boris N. Yeltsin of the Russian republic, seemed heartened at least by the fact that agreement had been reached to pursue some form of political union.
The very site of the meeting, a Government retreat in the suburb of Novo-Ogaryovo, was the one at which republic leaders first met in April to shape a new association. The agreement they reached then collapsed with the coup attempt in August, and officials said the new project was totally different from the federation envisioned then.
The key difference is the wariness of most republic leaders of creating any central structures that could eventually reanimate the dictatorial center of the past.
Speaking briefly to reporters after their eight-hour meeting, Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Yeltsin and leaders of Byelorussia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Kirghizia, Tadzhikistan and Turkmenistan indicated that more than half the discussion had been dedicated to the basic shape of the new association.
Mr. Yeltsin said the participants finally had agreed that the future union should be a "Union of Sovereign States -- Confederated State, fulfilling functions delegated by states participating in the agreement."
The formula seemed to accept both Mr. Gorbachev's call for a state that could be a genuine subject of international law, and insistence of the republicans on a confederation in which they would determine and limit the powers of the central Government. A confederation is a league of independent states joined by negotiated bonds.
Mr. Yeltsin said after the meeting that it was still difficult to say how many republics would join the union, but added, "After today's discussions, I am firmly convinced there will be a union."
Declining to take part in the meeting, besides the Ukraine, were Georgia and Moldavia. The Armenian leader is now in the United States and did not send a deputy, and the leader of Uzbekistan reportedly missed the session because of transportation problems. The three Baltic republics, their independence now internationally recognized, no longer take part in such discussions.
 
10 Signed Economic Pact
 The move toward a political association follows the signing of a draft economic pact by 10 republics to create a free-market zone in place of the former command economy. That agreement was intended to prevent the chaotic disintegration of complex economic ties among the republics, but a final agreement has not yet been reached.
Leaders of the Ukraine at first balked, but finally also joined in the economic agreement. But the republic's Prime Minister, Vitold Fokin, today threatened to resign unless the Ukrainian Parliament lifted its resistance to ratifying the agreement.
Nursultan Nazarbayev, the President of Kazakhstan, who has been among the strongest advocates of negotiating a new political union, said after today's meeting that the economic treaty "was constantly balking in the absence of a political union."
The heads of the republics gathered as the State Council, the collective federal executive formed after the August coup. They also named Ivan Silayev as the new national Prime Minister. The appointment formalized a function that Mr. Silayev, formerly Prime Minister of the Russian republic, had been filling as head of the interim Inter-State Economic Committee.

HEADLINE: Argentine Proclaims His Country Stable

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14

 BODY:
President Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina swept through Washington today, boasting that his country had finally put its economic and political house in order and was set to claim a high-visibility role in the new international order.
"We have credibility," he told reporters this afternoon as the first hectic day of his state visit began to wind down. "We have stability." 
 One of his first tasks, he said, will be to find a way to bring democracy to Cuba, working beside his "sisters and brothers of America." He intends to meet Cuban exiles in the United States.
"Without exaggeration," he told a joint meeting of Congress triumphantly, "I can say that I come here at the best moment in our relations."
 
Pleasant Message for U.S.
 As if to underline his point, Congressional staff members said his appearance before both houses, usually an honor reserved for very high-profile foreign dignitaries, had been arranged almost at the last minute, to the delight of Buenos Aires. Until early this week, a few members of Congress had been expecting him for coffee with a committee.
From a welcoming ceremony on the White House lawns, to Congress and all around town, the 61-year-old Mr. Menem brought a message the Bush Administration was pleased to hear. Argentina, he said, had put its irresponsible, anti-American nationalist past behind it. It was now committed to free enterprise at home and the dream of a Western Hemisphere trading community stretching "from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego."
The visit was well timed to follow good news in the Argentine economy. When Mr. Menem took office in 1989, he inherited four-digit inflation, a bloated state enterprise system and the remnants of a protectionist policy that scared away investors. Inflation is now down to about 2 percent a month, and the erratic local currency is stabilizing.
The Argentine President -- who is remaking the Peronist movement he heads nearly half a century after it was given its nationalistic stamp by its founder, Juan Domingo Peron -- today became the first leader of a major Latin American country to sign an investment-protection treaty with the United States.
The treaty provides guarantees against arbitrary confiscation of assets and assurances that there will be no limits on repatriation of profits. Where expropriations occur, legally enforceable compensation standards would be expected to be met. The treaty also includes provisions for international arbitration of investment disputes.
 
16th Country to Sign
 Argentina is the 16th country to sign a treaty with the United States since the Bilateral Investment Program was begun in 1981, though only eight of the treaties have been put into force: in Bangladesh, Cameroon, Grenada, Morocco, Panama, Senegal, Turkey and Zaire. Treaties awaiting ratification or aother action in Washington or abroad have been signed with Congo, Czechosllovakia, Egypt, Haiti, Poland, Sri Lanka and Tunisia. The Argentine treaty is also subject to ratification.
President Menem told the heads of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund that he was confident Argentina could resolve its foreign debt problem sometime in 1992. He told Congress that his sweeping privatization plan, which is turning over to private enterprise everything from airlines to road maintenance, would be completed by 1993.

HEADLINE: Sockeye Salmon Listed as Endangered Species

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Nov. 14

 BODY:
The Federal Government listed the Snake River sockeye salmon an endangered species today, making it likely that some Columbia River water will be diverted from generating electricity, farming and shipping.
Just four of the fish returned to their ancestral spawning ground in Idaho this year. 
 "What this means now is that the region is going to be held accountable for protection of the sockeye salmon, and that is a legal accountability," said Bill Bakke of Oregon Trout, which has petitioned for listing other salmon species as well.
The National Marine Fisheries Service listed the Snake River sockeye as endangered under the Endangered Species Act, forcing the Government to act to save the fish from extinction.
"At one time, these fish were so abundant that Native Americans and early miners depended on them for food in several locations within the Snake River basin," the agency said in a statement in Washington, D.C.
 
Long Trek Blocked by Dams
 The designation of the salmon was not unexpected.
"The good news is that the region has been preparing itself for this listing for nearly a year and a half, and we are way ahead of the game," said Senator Mark Hatfield, Republican of Oregon.
Historically, more than 11 million salmon and steelhead swam the Columbia system each year, but the runs have dwindled to about 2.5 million fish. Many of them are now from hatcheries, and wild fish are at only 2 percent of their former levels.
Thousands of sockeye used to complete the 900-mile trek up the Columbia from the Pacific Ocean to spawn in Redfish Lake Creek in Idaho's Sawtooth Mountains, but now eight Federally operated dams stand in their way.
The dams create hurdles for salmon migrating upstream. They also slow the water flows that once carried young salmon downstream to the Pacific Ocean in about two weeks. Now the trip takes much longer and the smolts' gills prematurely begin their adaptation from fresh to salt water before they reach the ocean.
Roddy Moscoso, a spokesman for the fisheries service, said only three females and one male returned to Redfish Lake Creek this year. None completed the trip last year, although others may still be living as the migration occurs in four- to five-year cycles.
Protection costs will remain unknown until the Government adopts a formal recovery plan, but efforts to save the sockeye will probably require increasing river flows by diverting water from current uses.
The Northwest Power Planning Council, which plans the power needs for Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana, is considering its salmon-recovery plan this week during a meeting in Helena, Mont., and is expected to produce a final plan by mid-December.
Ed Mosey of the Columbia River Alliance, which represents dam operators, shippers, irrigators and industrial water users, said the salmon runs could be protected "without dramatic and widespread economic impacts." He said the recovery plan should be spread across all parties having an effect on the wild salmon, including commercial fisheries as well as water users.
Industry officials have recently said altering operation of the hydroelectric dams could mean electricity rates at the household level would rise 10 percent.
However, the power council estimates that $70 million worth of water flow would be dedicated to fish annually, meaning rate increases would be limited to about 2 percent.

HEADLINE: House Approves Extended Benefits For Those Out of Work Six Months

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14

 BODY:
A $5.3 billion measure to provide up to 20 weeks of extended unemployment benefits to about 3 million people out of work at least half a year stalled in the Senate tonight after overwhelming approval in the House earlier in the day.
Some senators contended that workers in their states were getting short-changed by the complex formulas determining the number of weeks people would get unemployment benefits. Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, spoke for many when he called it "the most cockamamie formula I've ever seen." 
 Except for Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, whose state did well in the formula, senators had taken a back seat in negotiations over the bill in the last two weeks. The Administration had dealt largely with members of the House. Democratic senators had pressed to pay for the bill by cutting foreign aid, and neither House leaders nor the Administration wanted to discuss that approach.
 
Struggle in Senate
 President Bush, who killed two earlier versions of the legislation, has said he will sign this one. Unlike its predecessors, which would have been financed by increasing the Federal deficit, this measure would raise as much money, through a variety of provisions, as it would spend.
The vote in the House was 396 to 30. But the Senate wrangled into the night, and it was not clear when the Senate adjourned tonight whether the measure would come to a vote before the weekend.
Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader and the author of the proposal to pay for benefits by cutting foreign aid, pleaded with angry Senators not to propose amendments that would delay sending the bill to the President. He said any delay risked "a Thanksgiving with nobody getting any benefits."
But he was challenged, among others, by his own party's whip, Senator Wendell H. Ford of Kentucky, who contended that his state would get less in benefits than under the bill Mr. Bush vetoed in October, and that no Senate Democrat had been involved in working out the compromise before them.
The breadth of support in the Housereflected an overwhelming sense of Congressional relief that nearly four months of political battles over the issue were giving way to action on a plan to get checks to the jobless.
Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the House Republican leader who pushed President Bush toward compromise last month, said, "Unemployed Americans need help, not more rhetoric, not posturing, not partisan sniping from both sides."
Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democratic who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said: "We have waited far too long to pass this essential bill. Now is the time for the politics to stop and for us to act."
Representative Thomas J. Downey, Democrat of Suffolk, said, "People from Bayport, L.I., to Burbank, Calif., today are breathing a sigh of relief." He said they were relieved "because we have finally, here in the House, gotten our act together."
But politics was only submerged, not eliminated. Representative Les AuCoin, Democrat of Oregon, renewed a familiar Democratic theme when he said, "While Oregonians have been to the unemployment office, the President has been on an all-expense-paid world tour."
David Bonior of Michigan, the House Democratic whip, attacked Mr. Bush for refusing to help jobless Americans while declaring emergencies to allow deficit spending to aid Turks, Kurds and Bangladeshis.
 
More Disputes Expected
 And lawmakers in both Houses expected continuing problems in the economy and the fact that unemployment remains severe, even when the economy begins to improve, to bring the issue back before them again next year, closer to the election. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, predicted more disputes "the next time we bring this up, in June."
This bill would take effect this month and expire next July 4, making the approximately 300,000 workers who exhaust the normal state limit of 26 weeks of benefits each month eligible for additional benefits.
Workers in 34 states who exhausted their benefits since March 1 and were still out of work would also be eligible for additional benefits. Isaac Shapiro, a senior research analyst at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities and an expert on unemployment, said that about one million workers would be covered by that provision.
Under several complicated formulas involving the unemployment rate among workers covered by unemployment insurance, the unemployment rate among all workers, and the rate at which benefits have been exhausted, workers in different states are eligible for either 6, 13 or 20 weeks of additional benefits.
The 10 states in which workers could get 20 weeks of benefits include Connecticut and New Jersey. The 19 states where workers could get 13 weeks of benefits include New York and California, the two largest states in the nation. Workers in all other states would get six weeks. People who live in one state and worked in another would apply for benefits in the employer's state.
A major and permanent change that the bill would make in existing law would make people who leave the armed services eligible for 26 weeks of regular benefits, instead of 13 weeks, and to be able to claim them after one week, instead of four. Both changes would put them on an equal footing with people who leave civilian jobs.
Until tonight, when the Senate began arguing over the fairness of the formulas for weeks of coverage and the "reachback" for people who had exhausted their benefits earlier this year, the main controversy over the bill had been over its financing.
Democrats have insisted that costs for this sort of "emergency" should be paid for by increasing the deficit.
President Bush has said that approach will "bust the budget."
This bill is supposed to be paid for by a variety of measures in five years' time. It would not, as Mr. Dole had insisted earlier, have paid for itself in each year.
That was one complaint from Representative Bill Archer, the senior Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee today. He said the bill would cost $910 million more in the current year than it would take in.
Mr. Archer also objected sharply to a provision to make taxpayers with incomes of $75,000 or more and whose incomes soared by at least $40,000, pay higher estimated taxes. That provision is expected to bring in $2.6 billion.
Another $878 million would come from extending for one year the surtax, of two-tenths of 1 percent that employers pay on the first $7,000 of wages of a covered employee. That tax is now expected to expire at the end of 1995.
The rest of the costs of the program would be paid by provisions to continue procedures under which the Internal Revenue Service withholds unpaid student loans from tax refunds.

Chart: "EXTENDING UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS: THREE BILLS"
Under current law, jobless workers who file for unemployment compensation get it for 26 weeks in most states. Benefits can be extended for 13 weeks in states where unemployment among covered workers. Taxes on employers pay for the benefits. In no state are extended benefits now being paid.
 
AUGUST BILL
 
STATUS: Signed but prevented from going into effect
 
BENCHMARK: Total unemployment, instead of the insured unemployment figures used under current law.
 
EXTENSION OF BENEFITS: Additional 20 weeks in states with average of 8 percent unemployment over the last six months; 13 weeks in states with 7 percent; 7 weeks in states with 6 weeks percent; 4 weeks in all other states.
 
5-YEAR COST: $5.8 billion
 
FINANCING: No budget cuts or revenue increases were included in the bill. For it to take effect, a separate declaration of a budget emergency by the President was needed to exempt the bill from the pay-as-you-go provisions of the 1990 Budget Agreement. The President refused to sign such a declaration.
 
OCTOBER BILL
 
STATUS: President Bush's veto was sustained.
 
BENCHMARK: Same as the August bill.
 
EXTENTION OF BENEFITS: Same as the August bill, except that eligibility would be retroactive to March 1 in certain states.
 
5-YEAR COST: $6.4 billion.
 
FINANCING: Same as the August bill, except that the declaration of a budget emergency would have been automatic when the bill was signed by the President. No separate declaration would have been needed.
 
NOVEMBER BILL
 
STATUS: Presdient Bush has said he will sign it.
 
BENCHMARK: Insured unemployment rate plus workers who have exhausted their regular benefits.
 
EXTENSION OF BENEFITS: All states get at least 6 weeks; 19 states get at least 13 weeks; 10 states get 20 weeks. Retroactivity provision similar to the October bill.
 
5-YEAR COST: $5.3 billion.
 
FINANCING: Includes various provision to pay for new benefits, so it does not require an emergency exemption from the Budget Agreement. Funding provisions include increasing estimated tax payments by some high income taxpayers, extending an unemployment tax surcharge on employers and improving collection of non-tax debts owed to Federal agencies, like student loans.

HEADLINE: BUCHANAN WEIGHS PRESIDENTIAL RACE

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14

 BODY:
Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative columnist and commentator, is edging closer toward a challenge to President Bush for the 1992 Republican nomination, friends and associates said today.
Mr. Buchanan, who served in the Nixon and Reagan Administrations, is "very excited about it," said Angela Bay Buchanan, the commentator's sister, who is a former United States Treasurer and the organizer of his exploratory campaign. "But he wants to make that final determination over Thanksgiving." 
 Mr. Buchanan, who did not return a reporter's telephone calls today, would focus his efforts on New Hampshire, the scene of the first Presidential primary and an area wracked by the recession, Ms. Buchanan said. Top Republicans brushed aside his chances of seriously challenging Mr. Bush, but some in the party said Mr. Buchanan could be a troublesome distraction for the President and a rallying point for disaffected conservatives.
Clayton K. Yeutter, chairman of the Republican National Committee, told reporters in Albany today: "We live in a democratic society where anybody has the prerogative of filing on either the Democratic or Republican side. As a practical matter, I don't see that having a significant electoral impact."
Kendall Lane, the assistant chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Committee, said, "For those people on the right wing of the party who feel they need a voice, Pat Buchanan will give them that voice." But Mr. Lane predicted that Mr. Buchanan would get, at most, 15 to 20 percent of the Republican primary vote there.
Mr. Buchanan, a speech writer for President Richard M. Nixon and the director of White House communications under President Ronald Reagan, considered a Presidential campaign in 1987 but ultimately backed off. The Washington Times reported today that Mr. Buchanan had decided to run in 1992, but a top Republican strategist, who spoke on condition that he not be identified, predicted that Mr. Buchanan would pull back once again.
"I think this is born of frustration," the strategist said. "This is an effort to put rightward pressure on Bush, and it could very well have that effect." There was similar talk of a conservative challenge to Mr. Bush in 1990, after he reneged on his "no new taxes" pledge, but it dissolved when the crisis erupted in the Persian Gulf.
Several conservatives today were cheering for Mr. Buchanan. "Conservatives right now feel leaderless," said Richard Viguerie, a conservative organizer and fund-raiser, ticking off the issues that have rankled many on the right. The economic issue has gained power in recent weeks, as dismayed conservatives watched Democrats cast themselves as the champions of tax cuts for the middle class.
 
Hostile Climate
 Adding to the nervousness in the White House is the climate in New Hampshire, where the economy is at the top of the agenda. Moreover, some analysts detect a general anti-incumbent mood around the country.
Craig Shirley, a Republican consultant who supports Mr. Bush, added, "Given the economic climate out there, I think anybody would have to take any credible conservative challenger seriously."
Ms. Buchanan said her brother's message would be: "America first -- let's focus on America's problems now, and not the world's problems. Let's bring our attention home to our nation and reduce taxes and give people an opportunity once again to make a living out there."
Ms. Buchanan said she had begun the logistical work on a campaign so that if the commentator gives the nod, "We'll be ready to go."

HEADLINE: At the Bar;
In Tribute to a Dedicated Scholar and Ambassador of New York's Highest Court.

BYLINE: By David Margolick

 BODY:
Walter Mordaunt never sat on the New York Court of Appeals, or argued before it or parsed its decisions for a law school class. But no one ever cared for it more, or studied it more lovingly, or knew so well its every alcove or imparted his erudition about it so enthusiastically. When he died last week, at the age of 72, New York's highest court lost one of its most authentic scholars as well as its most effective ambassador.
Benjamin N. Cardozo, who served as Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals from 1926 to 1932, when he was named to the United States Supreme Court, once defined the mission of New York's highest court to be "translating into law the social and economic forces that throb and clamor for expression." Too often, however, the expressions emanating from it or any other court are unintelligible to the naked eye, and the process by which they are reached incomprehensible. Sometimes, it seems, lawyers and judges prefer it that way. 
 It was to combat that tendency that, in 1973, Charles D. Breitel, one of Cardozo's most distinguished successors, overcame his instinctive aversion to hype and, for the first time, hired a spokesman for the court: Mr. Mordaunt, who had been a reporter for The Albany Times-Union and served as deputy press secretary to Gov. Averill Harriman. From that moment on, Mr. Mordaunt proved that to demystify need not mean to degrade or debunk.
From 7:30 or so five mornings a week for the next 17 years, until his retirement in September 1990, Mr. Mordaunt toiled away in his small office in the court's southwest corner. He took phone calls from anxious reporters, explaining a convoluted court system like New York's, in which an appeals court is supreme and a Supreme Court is inferior.
It was Mr. Mordaunt who parceled out the court's decisions, placing them on Greyhound buses for some downstate newspapers. He kept reporters apprised of the court's caseload, a task that required him to comprehend the legalese of lawyers from Tonawanda to Montauk, as well as the judges' own often impenetrable prose. Mr. Mordaunt never got a law degree -- World War II precluded that -- but his grasp of legal issues would have shamed many who had.
A tall and elegant man with a mellifluousness inherited from his thespian parents, he went about his work with modesty and gentlemanliness, no mean feat in the cloistered, egocentric world of the judiciary. Some spokesmen for important courts take on the coloration of the institutions they serve -- the higher and more prestigious the tribunal, the more begrudgingly these people help, the more self-importantly they say no.
Mr. Mordaunt took it upon himself to explain the court's past as well as its present. A history buff who spent his spare time touring Civil War battlefields, he schooled himself in the court's law and lore, then imparted what he learned about it to thousands of schoolchildren and ordinary citizens who took his court tours.
He could tell you how the portrait of John Jay, New York's first Chief Judge, hung directly behind the seat reserved for his most recent successor, and how, from that position, Jay stares in perpetuity at Robert Livingston, New York's first chancellor, whose statue stands on the other side of the room. He would explain how the hand-carved courtroom had been designed by Henry Hobson Richardson, and been moved over piece by piece from the old state capital in 1916, and would point out the seven brass spittoons that still sit under the bench.
Shortly before he retired he gave one last tour to a peculiarly attentive audience: the seven judges themselves, none of whom knew nearly as much about the place as he. It was, said one of the judges, Joseph W. Bellacosa, "a showstopping finale."
So great was Mr. Mordaunt's love for the institution that even the milestones of others working there gave him personal pleasure. Sept. 12, for instance, marked the date that Judith S. Kaye, the court's first woman, had been named to the bench. Mr. Mordaunt observed the anniversary each year by bringing Judge Kaye a sprig from a florabunda rose bush in his front yard, containing the appropriate number of blossoms. Sure enough, when Judge Kaye arrived in her chambers shortly before 7 A.M. last Sept. 12, she discovered that Walter Mordaunt had preceded her. "Now, Judge!" the accompanying note scolded her, "I hope you did not think I'd forget."
All seven members of the court attended a memorial service for Mr. Mordaunt on Wednesday night in East Greenbush, across the river from Albany. "He could deal with governors or schoolchildren and show them the same concern and grace and dignity," said Chief Judge Sol Wachtler, who spoke at the service. "He opened up the court, and our process lost a lot of its mysteries. He showed them that this was not simply a sterile courthouse, but a part of history."

HEADLINE: In Louisiana, Both Edwards and Duke Are Sending Voters a Message of Fear

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Nov. 14

 BODY:
Instead of engaging in the usual mudslinging, the candidates in the Louisiana's governor's race have used their televison commercials to turn up the emotional volume among voters who are making their choices on the basis of fear and resentment.
The contest between State Representative David Duke and former Gov. Edwin W. Edwards is unusual in many respects, not the least of which is the fact that both candidates started the race as very familiar figures here. 
 Neither man has had to use television the way most politicians do, improving their name recognition and framing an identity. Nor did they have to highlight their opponent's weaknesses -- Mr. Duke's activities in the Ku Klux Klan and as a neo-Nazi are well known, as are the accusations of corruption that have dogged the 64-year-old former Governor for years.
Rather than a back and forth exchange between candidates, the television campaign here has been like the final act of a minor operetta, with one character after another appearing on the screen to bellow, laugh or shriek.
 
A Political Cacophony
 More than anything else, the cacophony has broadcast a message of fear -- fear of liberals, blacks and big government on one side, and fear of Mr. Duke on the other.
Mr. Duke has been plying the alienations of his white middle-class voters while projecting himself as the cool voice of conservatism.
All of his advertisements show him standing alone and talking into the camera. In a new ad that was being broadcast today the message from Mr. Duke is: "I say what must be said. I don't promise jobs to get endorsement. I owe no special interests. My entire campaign is funded by little gifts from lots of people."
Douglas Rose, a professor of political science at Tulane University, said: "Duke acts out on screen what his supporters are feeling. He's up there alone and embattled, expressing all their resentments toward the powers that be."
Larry Sabato, a professor of government at the University of Virginia, said: "He's been compared to George Wallace, but Wallace was hot on the tube and Duke is cool. He's mastered the medium. He smiles and his anger is implicit."
Mr. Edwards has used his commercials to reassure the state that he is now a model of propriety and a paragon of economic leadership.
Today his campaign announced that on Friday night it will broadcast a 30-minute program, called "The Decision of Our Lives," in all seven of the state's media markets. It will be broadcast a total of 16 times.
Emphasizing the economic issue, the show moves through each major city in the state, listing businesses that Mr. Edwards is said to have recruited to Louisiana in his previous terms as Governor.
Ordinary people identified by their first names are interviewed on how they have decided to vote for Mr. Edwards. Terry in Baton Rouge says that after "tossing and turning" she decided that even though she likes some of Mr. Duke's message, "Edwin Edwards will make the difference in me keeping my job." A portly man in overalls identified as Stanley in Shreveport concurs and says, "That Duke, he ain't too swift."
At the end Mr. Edwards offers a grandfatherly lecture on good government and reviews his proposals for economic recovery and tax reform.
 
Third-Party Commercials
 William Morgan, media consultant to the Edwards campaign, said the goal of the half-hour show was "to add some momentum to the final day of the campaign with a major event that explores Edwards's positive message in contrast to the danger Duke poses."
Besides Mr. Edwards, the Democratic Party and a number of ad hoc groups and individual citizens have also been buying advertising time to attack Mr. Duke, most of them warning that his election would spell economic disaster.
"Anybody with three red cents has been buying air time in this campaign," said Kathy Vick, secretary of the Democratic National Committee and a leader of the state party. "No one has ever seen anything like it, and no one is sure how it's going to play out."
For example, a group called the Republican Challengers Election Committee, which Ms. Vick and officials of the Edwards campaign said is unknown to them, has paid for the campaign commercial most often cited in dinner party chatter. A man in a cowboy hat and string tie identifies himself as a Texan and offers a gleeful "hot damn" to news that Mr. Duke might be elected and cause an economic exodus. In an exagerated drawl the "Texan" says, "Good luck to you David Duke, and all those jobs in Louisiana, come on down."
 
A Lopsided Ad Contest
 With at least a 2-to-1 advantage in fund raising, the Edwards campaign has been able to outgun Mr. Duke on the airwaves. And the contest has been even more lopsided because of all the third parties putting out their own anti-Duke commercials.
The Edwards campaign alone has spent $585,000 on television and $105,00 on radio advertising, according to Mr. Morgan, and has broadcast seven different 30-second commercials in the last 12 days.
Interviews with television station executives across the state show that the Edwards campaign has bought at least twice as many advertisements in most major cities and that it has spent heavily in New Orleans and Baton Rouge. Nonetheless, Mr. Duke has made himself heard in every major media market. He appears to have concentrated his efforts in southwestern Louisiana, where he showed growing strength in the Oct. 19 primary.
For example, one station in Lake Charles had booked 60 advertisements for Mr. Edwards compared to 45 for Mr. Duke, but more typical was a station in Alexandria, in central Louisiana, where 85 Edwards ads were scheduled, but only 35 Duke ads.
 
Some Fear a Backlash
 Rusty Cantelli, a television producer who has occasionally served as a consultant to Mr. Duke, said the overwhelming number of ads attacking Mr. Duke could rebound to his advantage. A similar view has been expressed by some in the Edwards camp.
"When there's this kind of overkill it can turn people off," Mr. Cantelli said. "It seems so hysterical at times that it might even be causing a backlash."
While Mr. Edwards has relied heavily on his advertisments and those of his allies to get his message across, Mr. Duke has found other means to use television. He has appeared extensively on local and national talk shows, and has been interviewed this week on three network news shows.
"By just appearing on these broadcasts Duke gains credibility no matter how he's questioned or how even-handed the report may be," said Ms. Vick, the state Democratic leader. "The media have made him a legitimate candidate."


GRAPHIC: Advertisements from David Duke, running as a Republican without his party's endorsement, and the Democrat, Edwin W. Edwards. The state Democratic Party is one of several groups also running ads.
 
DAVID DUKE
 
BACKGROUND: State Representative David Duke has campaigned in the Louisiana governor's race as an outsider and a conservative who is waging a lonely battle against powerful liberal forces.
 
TEXT: "Have you ever heard such weeping and gnashing of teeth. The news media have given up any pretense of fair play. The liberals have gone ballistic. The special interests have gone mad. The politicians who play up to them are lining up on cue. Principles lie abandoned and hypocrisy rules the day. I raise issues that must be discussed and get back venom instead. Try a little experiment. Next time you hear them accuse me of intolerance and hatred, notice who is doing the shouting."
 
PRODUCER: David Duke
 
ANALYSIS: Virtually all the newspapers in Louisiana have endorsed Mr. Duke's opponent, former Gov. Edwin W. Edwards, and Mr. Edwards has received vigorous backing from the Democratic Party as well as a variety of business groups and women's organizations. In this ad Mr. Duke stares into the camera and issues a highly emotional appeal to voters who feel alienated from politics as usual. He portrays himself as an underdog and a victim. Finally, he tries to turn criticism of his own controversial past into attack on his critics.
 
EDWIN W. EDWARDS
 
BACKGROUND: Edwin W. Edwards served three terms as governor of Louisiana between 1971 and 1987. He claims his records proves he can help pull the state out of its long recession while Mr. Duke's election would be an economic disaster.
 
TEXT: "The way to bring jobs to Louisiana today is the way that Edwin Edwards created jobs for us before. Edwin Edwards built the vocational and technical school system, and he'll build it again, by opening closed institutes and upgrading all the others. That means we can get the job skills that new and growing industries want and need. And Edwin Edwards will create a $32 million loan fund to help the children of middle income families to go to college. Education, to get the skills. Edwin Edwards to get the jobs."
 
PRODUCER: William Morgan & Co.
 
ANALYSIS: Against pictures of workers and schools the announcer promotes Mr. Edwards' record in office and highlights a campaign promise to boost funding of a school loan program. Mr. Duke has repeatedly complained that racial preferences in scholarships discriminate against middle class whites. In this ad Mr. Edwards makes a positive statement on that point, and appeals to voters both on economic and education issues.
 
DEMOCRATIC PARTY
 
BACKGROUND: While the Edwards campaign has explicitly attacked David Duke in its advertisements, the Democratic Party has produced commercials reminding voters of Mr. Duke's neo-Nazi views.
 
TEXT: "In 1969 David Duke said, 'I am a National Socialist, you can call me a Nazi.' In 1976 he organized a meeting of Nazi groups which called for the release of all Nazi war criminals. In 1988 he hired a former American Nazi Party captain to manage his presidential campaign and in 1989 David Duke was caught selling Nazi books and tapes from his legislative office."
 
PRODUCER: Politics Incorporated
 
ANALYSIS: All the episodes mentioned have been extensively reported before, but they are given added punch in the ad with newsreel footage of from Nazi Germany, martial music and shouts of "Sieg Hiel." The commercial ends with a picture of Adolph Hitler.
Chart: "The 1991 Campaign: On Television Outsider vs. a Former Governor of Louisiana"
 In this campaign Mr. Duke's foes have dwelled on his neo-Nazi activities much more than his leadership of the Ku Klux Klan. This ad seeks to hit voters who may be attracted to Mr. Duke politically but have moral reservations about supporting him.

HEADLINE: Milton Farber, 81, Retired Head Of Farberware Company, Is Dead

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Milton H. Farber, the retired president of the Bronx company that manufactures Farberware pots, pans and appliances, died on Tuesday at his home in Atlantis, Fla.
He was 81 years old and died of heart failure, his family said. 
 Mr. Farber joined the family business as a teen-ager. The company, S. W. Farber Inc., which manufactured gift trays and racks, was founded in 1897 by his father, Simon, a Russian emigrant who started as a match peddler on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. The family opened a plant in Brooklyn next to the Williamsburg Bridge. A clamp-on light invented so Mr. Farber could sleep while his wife read in bed propelled the company's success.
The second generation took the reins of the enterprise during the 1940's, with Milton becoming vice president for production while his brother, Isadore, became president and head of sales. Two brothers-in-law were also executives.
The company moved to the Bronx in 1944 and expanded into a new line of stainless steel pots and pans with bonded aluminum bottoms for better heat conduction. Dubbed Farberware, it became a leading brand of cookware. Next came a line of electrical appliances.
 
Small Arms During the War
 During World War II, the company made small arms, and the Federal Government honored Milton Farber for serving as chairman of production engineering and of the Small Business Mobilization Committee.
When Isadore retired as president, Milton succeeded him. The company was sold to Hanson Industries, but he remained with the operation until he retired in 1973. He also designed and supervised the building of a factory in Israel to produce Farberware.
Mr. Farber was born in Brooklyn and was captain of the football team at Erasmus Hall High School. He graduated with honors in industrial engineering at the University of Pennsylvania and in economics from the Wharton School.
He lived for 25 years in New Rochelle and 18 years in Bronxville. He served as a board member of the Merchants Bank of New York for 17 years and of Shopwell Inc. for 11 years. He was president of Vernon Hills Country Club in Eastchester and class A club champion in golf there in 1947. He was also a partner of Sherbrooke Country Club in Lake Worth, Fla., where he designed and oversaw the building of its clubhouse. He was on the board of Curry College in Milton, Mass.
He is survived by his wife, the former Sylvia Gold; a daughter, Marilyn Jacobs of New Rochelle; a son, Alan, of Mount Vernon; a sister, Dorothy Shanok of New Rochelle; a brother, Isadore, of Woodlands, Fla., and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Pop/Jazz;
3 Women Singing The Blues

BYLINE: By KAREN SCHOEMER

 BODY:
Truly wild women are a scarce commodity in pop music. One can only imagine the day when a diva like Whitney Houston struts onto a video screen, opens her mouth and belts out an ode to the pleasures of being sloppy drunk or when a songstress like Debbie Gibson sits down at a piano and, gripped by the sudden fever of inspiration, kicks over her stool and lays into a hellacious Jerry Lee Lewis-style boogie riff. Unspoken laws of behavior abound. Most women choose to stay respectable.
Outside the mainstream, though, women are more willing to bend the rules. The members of Saffire, the Uppity Blues Women, a trio from Fredericksburg, Va., who are to perform tomorrow night at the Lone Star Roadhouse in Manhattan, have made it their career agenda to put across an alternative perspective. 
 Saffire's raunchy blues extol the virtues of gratifying sex, nights on the town and the benefits of nonmonogamous relationships; the group's songs are laced with double-entendres and bawdy language. "Hot Flash" (Alligator Records), the group's third album, includes numbers like "One Good Man": "I got a macho man who puts my pleasure last/I got a nervous man who moves much too fast. . . . They call me a tramp, they don't understand/I just want one good man."
Underneath the humor, Saffire is really preaching independence and the right to satisfaction, and the group's ideology becomes even more potent in the context of traditional down-home blues. The music is lively but low-key: Gaye Adegbalola, 47 years old, plays acoustic guitar; Ann Rabson, 46, plays rollicking boogie-blues piano, and Earlene Lewis, also 46, provides rhythm on an upright bass. All three women trade off lead vocals, and they mix classic numbers like Bessie Smith's "Do Your Duty" with straight blues originals.
"We play traditional blues, but it has current content," Ms. Adegbalola said in a recent phone interview from Fredericksburg. "I don't know other women our age singing and playing the blues who are also writers. These things haven't been said because maybe this perspective hasn't been there."
As unusual as the group's sentiments seem in today's pop context, Saffire is actually working within a long tradition of outspoken women, including urban blues singers like Smith, Ma Rainey and Memphis Minnie in the 1920's and 30's, the jazz legend Billie Holiday in the 1940's and 50's, soul and rhythm-and-blues performers like Aretha Franklin and Etta James in the 1960's.
"I feel very much like a griot of sorts, like I'm on a mission to carry on a legacy," Ms. Adegbalola said. "Vocalists tend to be two types: they're either musical vocalists like Billie Holiday, or storytelling vocalists like Bessie Smith. I see myself as a storyteller. Consequently I've studied storytelling techniques and the meaning of the double-entendre. When I do 'Do Your Duty,' Bessie did it, Billie Holiday did it, and now I take the two pieces of each one that I like and I put them into a new format."
Ms. Adegbalola, Ms. Rabson and Ms. Lewis started performing as a trio in 1984. The fact that they started their musical career together at relatively late ages has to do with social and economic constraints, they said. Although each grew up loving music, only Ms. Lewis managed to pursue it full time.
Ms. Adegbalola said: "All of our fathers played music, and they introduced it to us in one way or another. When I was in high school, I made all-state band three years and I loved music, but it wasn't something that a black woman did at that point. Ann did a solo act in her late teens and 20's, but then she had to raise a child by herself."
By the time the three came together, each had a day job. Ms. Adegbalola, who was a single mother, was a schoolteacher; Ms. Rabson was a computer programmer who also taught at a local community college. Ms. Lewis was a data programmer who happened to enroll in one of Ms. Rabson's classes, and the three decided to start playing as a trio.
"All we were doing was getting together and playing music," Ms. Adegbalola said. "The fact is that we had our dreams deferred. We bounced back as women who've raised children and had families to pursue our dream."
 
A Gimmick or for Real?
 In 1987, the women recorded a demo record and released it on their own label, Saffire; in 1988, they quit their day jobs. Soon after, they got the attention of the Chicago-based blues label Alligator Records. While the album "Saffire, the Uppity Blues Women," released in 1990, earned the group instant recognition on the contemporary blues scene, some people saw the trio as a novelty act.
"A lot of times people focus on our gimmick -- our ages, our sex -- and they don't focus on our music," Ms. Adegbalola said. "They'll say it's folk, not blues. But Bessie Smith recorded 59 times with no drums. Our instrumentation isn't that unusual when you listen to traditional blues.
"When I first heard this music, I fell in love it. It speaks to me. The drums are not there pumping over every nuance; every syllable is audible. And I just want to carry on that tradition."
Saffire, the Uppity Blues Women, are to perform tomorrow night at the Lone Star Roadhouse, 240 West 52d Street, Manhattan. Show times are 9:30 and 11:30 P.M.; tickets cost $12. Information: (212) 245-2950.

HEADLINE: Cable TV Customers, Gouged Again

 BODY:
The Senate majority leader, George Mitchell, and Hollywood's Jack Valenti have just buried a bill to prevent monopolistic cable companies from gouging their customers. The sponsors expected a Senate vote this week, but Mr. Mitchell scheduled no floor time and has excluded the proposal from the list of bills to be considered before the Senate adjourns for the year.
Unless the bill is promptly disinterred, cable customers around the country will know who's to blame for the next outrageous cable price hike. 
 A 1984 bill freed cable television companies from local regulation. Since then cable costs have soared, rising three times faster than inflation. Some of the increases made up for punitively low fees set by local regulators. But studies suggest that by now, cable companies are earning exorbitant monopoly profits.
The Senate bill offers responsible re-regulation, with a light touch. It is directed at bad actors -- empowering the Federal Communications Commission to set rates only where prices are outrageous and competition is lacking.
What makes the bill's sudden burial especially galling is Mr. Mitchell's excuse: the crush of end-of-session business. The cable bill was introduced on the earliest possible day and was one of the first bills this session to clear committee -- in May. Putting off a vote until next year won't help consumers but it would guarantee a continued flow of campaign contributions to committee members from lobbyists for the studios, broadcasters and cable companies.
Mr. Valenti, who represents film and television producers, attacks a provision that would require cable companies to pay fees to retransmit the programs of over-the-air television stations. He cries foul, contending that that arrangement would jeopardize royalties of the Hollywood producers who make programs.
Mr. Valenti has a point, but it's a belated one. The cable companies have stalled negotiations for months and are using confusion over this provision as a pretext to scuttle the bill.
The best way to break the impasse and serve the public is for the Senate to pass the bill soon. The House, which overwhelmingly passed a similar bill last year, would quickly follow. Once Congress even comes close to action, watch how quickly Mr. Valenti and the cable companies figure out a way to resolve retransmission rights to everyone's satisfaction.

Hate Against Hate

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
Two years ago, we celebrated the fall of the Berlin wall and then of totalitarian rule in Czechoslovakia. As recently as this past summer, we gloried in the overthrow of Communism in the Soviet Union.
Those victories for freedom remain. But the joy we felt in them has been overtaken by renewed realization that there is a human instinct as deep as the desire for freedom -- and that it may have terrible consequences. That is racial and national feeling. 
 In Czechoslovakia today, some Slovaks are demanding the division of the country and the establishment of a separate Slovak state. There was a Slovak Republic once: a Nazi puppet state during World War II. And today there is some vicious anti-Semitism. The man who led the Slovak end of the movement that overthrew Communism in Czechoslovakia, Fedor Gal, has left Slovakia after being attacked because he is Jewish. His parents were murdered by the Nazis.
In Vienna this week, a far-right party headed by a man who praises Hitler's economic policies won 23 percent of the vote in city elections. A Gallup poll in Austria found that nearly a third of those polled disliked Jews and a fifth thought Jews should be dismissed from their jobs.
In France, Jean-Marie Le Pen and his National Front Party are gaining significant support. Mr. Le Pen campaigns against Arab immigration and Jewish influence. In a poll by Le Monde, 32 percent said they broadly agreed with his ideas.
Then there is the situation in Yugoslavia: not some gloomy portent of a poll or political campaign but the present reality of human disaster produced by ethnic conflict. Serbia, undeterred by threatened European and American economic sanctions, intensified its military assaults on Croatia.
Americans like to think of themselves as having left behind the bloody conflicts of the old country. But ethnic consciousness is the hot new phenomenon in this country, and with it comes conflict. In any event, we have our own special wound of race.
Anyone naive enough to think that racism was history in this country has had to think again. The possibility that Louisiana may elect as governor this weekend a man who has spent most of his adult life denouncing Jews and blacks says enough about where we are.
David Duke says he is a Christian who repents his record as a Nazi and a leader of the Ku Klux Klan. His campaign plays on Louisiana's economic distress, says it is time to "get government off the back of business" and attacks welfare. Those are familiar right-wing themes, used successfully by Ronald Reagan among others. But the voters are hearing something else: race.
"Without his racial past," a political observer in Shreveport says, "Duke wouldn't be playing. Down deep, most whites like the message: finally, after 30 years, somebody's going to put the niggers down."
Economic and social distress always have been the seedbeds for demagogy. They were in Weimar Germany. They were in Huey Long's Louisiana in the 1930's. They are today in Austria and France and Germany, countries that are dealing with large numbers of refugees.
That is what makes the rise of David Duke so worrisome for us. People are feeling economic pain right across America. Social disorder is a central fact of life in all our major cities and suburbs, and even small towns. In such circumstances, people are ready to listen to someone who blames the troubles on some scapegoat.
George Wallace won a lot of votes, North and South, when times were not so bad as now. And he was far less smooth an article than David Duke.
Win or lose, David Duke is going to be on the national political stage. He may well run for President next year, opposing President Bush in Republican primaries or running as a third-party candidate.
What solace can we find in all this, what hope for some solution to the racial and ethnic conflicts in the world? Sir Isaiah Berlin, the great English philosopher, discusses the question in an interview in the fall issue of New Perspectives Quarterly, and he offers no solace.
"Nationalism is not resurgent," Sir Isaiah says. "It never died. Neither did racism. They are the most powerful movements in the world today."

HEADLINE: Culture Is a Very Big Deal ($6 Billion)

BYLINE: By David N. Dinkins

 BODY:
The following article is adapted from remarks made recently by the Mayor of New York to leaders of the city's major cultural institutions.
This week, the City Council Finance Committee held hearings on legislation to dismantle the Department of Cultural Affairs. What a foolish idea in a city that is a beacon to all artists and home to the premier cultural institutions in the nation!
Last year, some members of our budget staff, thinking that they were helping me, made such a proposal. I thought it was a terrible idea and immediately buried it. I wish the City Council had let it rest in peace. 
 New York is the cultural capital of the world, and the arts make an incalculable social and economic contribution to our city. Culture in New York City is a $6 billion industry -- larger in this region than the advertising business, hotel-motel business and the computer industry.
It is labor intensive, providing jobs not only for artists but also for carpenters, painters, ushers, guards, seamstresses and other skilled and less-skilled workers. Thirty-five thousand jobs are estimated to be directly attributable to New York's cultural activity, and an additional 117,000 jobs are generated indirectly.
Approximately 60 percent of the tourists coming to New York City list some type of art or culture as the prime reason for their visit. New York's nonprofit arts industry alone is responsible for more than $1.4 billion in economic activity.
The creation of the Department of Cultural Affairs in 1977 gave this huge industry a platform and standing in municipal affairs. Since then, through the department we have steadily built up our funding and investment in this vital industry. And as the dividends poured into our local economy, the department saw to it that a fair share was reinvested in the arts. This simple formula worked -- until the national recession of 1990-1991 made money scarce again.
The recession has hit our city budget deeply. But we need the department even more when resources are limited and the competition for funds is more intense. And when our city bounces back, as we know it must, who will look after our investment in the arts, if not this department?
Very little would be saved by eliminating it. The costs of running the department are about $3 million per year. I find it hard to believe that you could cut that amount and still have the capacity to process $68 million worth of contracts each year with the arts organizations of our city.
Let us remember that the Federal contribution to our city's budget has been cut in half over the last 10 years. Those funds would have covered almost our entire budget gap this year.
To break up the Department of Cultural Affairs and to scatter the pieces among other agencies would cripple our ability to fulfill our cultural dreams when our city is flush again.
The long-range interests of the city -- and the arts community -- are best served with a strong, energized and unthreatened Department of Cultural Affairs.

HEADLINE: Tappan Zee Traffic Enrages Commuters, Worries Planners

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, Nov. 14

 BODY:
With more than three miles of pavement soaring across the Hudson River at one of the waterway's widest junctures, the Tappan Zee Bridge offers the motorist a majestic drive. But lately that drive has brought more misery than majesty.
Traffic congestion has grown so severe on the bridge and on the connecting Cross Westchester Expressway (Interstate 287) that some business leaders fear it might thwart economic growth in Westchester County. Many commuters, especially Rockland County residents traveling to work in Westchester, have started to lambaste politicians and transportation officials in public forums and on the telephone. 
 "The big problem is the unpredictability of the commute," said Richard A. Peters, a civil engineer with the New York State Department of Transportation. "One day it may take 20 minutes to get to work, the next day it may take an hour and the next day 40 minutes."
 
The Crucial Corridor
 The unabashed construction of office space in recent years in Westchester, Rockland and Orange Counties has made the Hudson Valley the fastest growing region in the state. The valley takes in Westchester, Putnam and Dutchess Counties on the east side of the river, and Rockland, Sullivan, Orange and Ulster Counties on the west. Mindful that the Tappan Zee Bridge and the Cross Westchester Expressway serve as the valley's crucial corridor, transportation officials are devoting themselves to relieving traffic congestion.
For financial and environmental reasons, simply building a new bridge or highway is not a serious option at the moment. Rather, the state's Department of Transportation and the New York State Thruway Authority are struggling to make do with what they have. Creative solutions include the installation, next year, of a movable barrier across the bridge to improve traffic flow and a program to encourage companies to offer flexible hours to help ease the rush hours.
Throughout the country, planners are dealing with similar problems. The building of beltways, the rise of suburban office parks and the emergence of the two-career couple have all conspired to put booming areas on the fringe of cities in a traffic vice.
"We had a baby boom that was born and raised in the suburbs that now wants to live and work in the suburbs," said James W. Hughes, a professor of urban planning at Rutgers University. "And suburban gridlock and traffic jams that were once the province of the city have been dispersed to remote locations."
 
A Spur to Growth
 Built in 1955, the Tappan Zee Bridge was a heroic public works project, becoming one of the last legs of the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway, linking Rockland and Westchester Counties and creating the opportunity for commercial development in the Hudson Valley. Annual traffic on the bridge rose from 10.5 million vehicles in 1960 to 39.5 million last year.
A few years after the completion of the bridge, the Cross Westchester Expressway opened, connecting the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway (Interstate 87) with the New England Thruway (Interstate 95). Cutting through Westchester just north of White Plains, the Cross Westchester, together with the Tappan Zee, sparked enormous development in the county.
The Cross Westchester Expressway became known as the Platinum Mile with its curves punctuated by polished-glass office complexes. But in the 1980's, as office development continued at a furious pace, so did traffic. On an average weekday in 1980, 77,000 vehicles used the expressway. Ten years later, the number jumped to 129,000.
 
A 68-Minute Trip
 While Rockland County saw substantial economic growth in the 1980's, it still has only a quarter of Westchester's 406,000 jobs, according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Almost twice as many cars head toward Westchester County in the morning rush hour as head toward Rockland.
R. Clinton Roswell, an analyst for the New York City School Construction Authority, lives in the hamlet of Nanuet in Rockland County and works in the Bronx. On one occasion, he said, it took him 68 minutes to traverse the bridge.
"It's monstrous," he said. "Coming home at night, I know that as soon as I pass the toll barrier and head toward the center of the bridge, the traffic just stops."
Westchester County continues to attract new companies, but transportation is a key ingredient in decisions about corporate relocation. "We don't want economic growth to be stifled by traffic congestion," said David Murray, a spokesman for the State Transportation Department. "It's a definite threat."
The Metro-North Commuter Railroad recently studied the possibility of running a new railroad track across the Hudson River, near the Tappan Zee, up to Stewart International Airport in Orange County. But the price tag was about $1 billion, and the project would take 20 years.
 
A Movable Barrier
 In the short term, the Thruway Authority holds out hope that traffic congestion on the Tappan Zee Bridge will be eased. The movable barrier, for example, will make it possible to respond to the changing volume of traffic. And in a few years the Thruway Authority plans to resurface the bridge's deck and possibly add an eighth lane. The State Department of Transportation, responsible for any major changes on the Cross Westchester Expressway, is studying the possibility of creating a reversible or two-way "high-occupancy vehicle" lane in the highway's median to encourage car pooling. A similar lane may be created on the bridge.
The Thruway Authority is also adding electronic toll collection so that cars can breeze through the bridge's single toll barrier on the eastern leg. Commuters would buy stickers, embedded with computer chips, for their windshields; an electronic device at the toll barrier would let the car pass after reading the sticker.
"The Tappan Zee Bridge is our highest priority," Peter Tufo, the Thruway Authority chairman, said, "and we're going to spend $120 million over the next four or five years to deal with it."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Traders Reassured by Weak Data

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
A raft of Government statistics yesterday showing soft economic conditions and no problem from inflation reassured credit market participants and helped lift prices of Treasury notes and bonds.
The data showed retail sales lackluster in October. Weekly claims for unemployment insurance moved back to their highest level in six months. And inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index rose by a modest tenth of a percent last month. 
 The fresh statistics, particularly on inflation, soothed fears that developed on Wednesday, when the Government shocked traders and analysts with a report that producer prices had risen by a whopping seven-tenths of 1 percent in October.
Even though analysts called the producer price rise an aberration, the report ignited fears of inflation and prompted a sharp selloff in the market.
Those fears were assuaged yesterday.
"The market is breathing a sigh of relief that these numbers turned out the way they did," one government bond trader said. "These numbers tell you the Fed is going to be back," easing monetary policy, the trader said.
 
Decline in 4th Quarter?
 Analysts said the poor showing for retail sales, which declined one-tenth of 1 percent last month following a sizable rise in September, not only cast doubt on how healthy the coming Christmas season would be for retailers, but also raised the possibility that the economy might contract in the fourth quarter.
"We are still working with the projection of positive growth in the fourth quarter, but we are nervous," said Michael J. Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc. "If we don't see an improvement in the numbers soon, we could see a decline in the fourth quarter."
A resolution approved by the Senate late Wednesday night to require lower interest rates on credit cards, a move that might stimulate consumer spending, sent shock waves through the $65 billion market in securities that are backed by credit-card receivables.
Market participants said the Senate resolution raised the possibility that such a sharp reduction in the borrowing rate could lead to early prepayment of the securities.
News of the vote pushed prices of credit-card issues outstanding down by as much as a full point early in the day. But by late in the session some of those losses had been recouped. Traders said that prices of most issues ended 1/4 point to 1/2 point lower.
By late in the day, the new benchmark 30-year bonds, the 8 percent issue of 2021, were offered at a price of 102 1/8, up 1/2 point, to yield 7.81 percent, down from 8.87 percent Wednesday in when-issued trading. On Wednesday the 8 1/8 percent bonds of 2021, the old benchmark issue, were offered at a price to yield 7.90 percent.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7.50 percent 10-year notes were offered at 101 1/8, up 3/8, to yield 7.33 percent. And the 6 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 21/32, up 2/ 32, to yield 5.58 percent.
Demand at an auction of new one-year Treasury bills was strong.
The new securities were sold at an average discount rate of 4.72 percent, down from an average rate of 5.12 percent at the last one-year note auction on Oct. 17.
Rates on outstanding Treasury bills were unchanged to down slightly.
Three-month bills were offered at an average discount rate of 4.61 percent, down two basis points, or two one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates were unchanged, at a late offered rate of 4.67 percent.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported that two of the three measures of the nation's money supply rose during the week ended Nov. 4. The broadest measure, M-3, fell by $3.7 billion.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of new one-year Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Fed Official's Inflation View

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, S.C. Nov. 15

 BODY:
Wayne D. Angell, a Federal Reserve Board governor, said today that he was "pretty optimistic about the inflation outlook" for the United States.
Speaking to reporters after giving a private speech to executives here, Mr. Angell said the report earlier this week that producer prices surged seven-tenths of 1 percent in October should not be taken out of context. 
 "Clearly, there is a stickiness in certain prices that make up the wholesale index," he said. But the Federal Reserve, he said, should concentrate on long-run targets, rather than monthly statistics. He said he preferred to look at 3-month and 12-month rates of change.
Mr. Angell said he saw continued improvement in the Consumer Price Index, which is now rising at a 2.7 percent annual rate, down from a rate of 6.4 percent at the end of 1990. Mr. Angell said the 6.4 percent rate was abnormal.

HEADLINE: Your Taxes;
Snags in System On Withholding

BYLINE: By Robert D. Hershey Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A new Internal Revenue Service procedure is subjecting thousands of investors to backup income-tax withholding, many of them improperly, because of difficulties in verifying identification.
Anyone opening a brokerage, bank, mutual fund or other investment account must supply a Social Security number, which the I.R.S. checks to be sure it will get its own record of the interest, dividends and proceeds paid to that person. If the number is deemed incorrect, the I.R.S. notifies, say, Merrill Lynch of this discrepancy, and the broker in turn sends its customer a letter explaining what has happened. A second notification by the I.R.S. within three years requires backupwithholding of 20 percent, meaning that Merrill Lynch pays its customer only 80 percent of the amount due. 
 Under the new I.R.S. procedure, the withholding may be stopped only when the broker receives Form SSA-7028, which the customer asks the Social Security Administration to send directly to the broker or bank. The problem is that many Social Security offices seem neither to be aware of their role in this process nor to have the forms in stock.
"Several of our member firms report that they are deluged with calls from customers who are unnecessarily being subjected to backup withholding as a result of a bureaucratic snafu by the Social Security Administration," complained Edward I. O'Brien, head of the Securities Industry Association. He urged the Treasury to postpone the new procedure until next year.
In Baltimore, a Social Security spokesman acknowledged a "small problem," but said it had been brought under control. The agency sent reminder notices to 1,300 field offices this week.
An I.R.S. official, meanwhile, told an industry gathering in Los Angeles yesterday that the agency was inclined to accept taxpayer verification on documents other than Form 7028. But Keith Lawson, associate tax counsel for the Investment Company Institute, a mutual-fund group, said he was not certain this approach would be sufficiently far-reaching or prompt.
 
New Dose of Complexity
 In deciding to pay for extended jobless benefits by speeding up collections from people with rapidly rising incomes, Congress will have again added to tax code complexity despite months of so-far fruitless debate about how to make it simpler.
The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants charged that compliance would be particularly difficult for proprietors of small businesses, partnerships and small corporations. Losing the ability to base quarterly estimated payments on the preceding year's liability, many taxpayers will need to calculate their estimated payments "four times a year -- often with incomplete or inadequate information," said Donald H. Skadden, the group's vice president for taxation.
Another A.I.C.P.A. official said contractors, small truck lines and professionals would have "immense" problems calculating their annual income by Jan. 15 of the following year, "let alone their income by the required dates each quarter." About 400,000 taxpayers will be directly affected by the change, and multiples of that figure will face uncertainty and cumbersome calculations.
 
Footnotes
 With a concession on the highway bill by Senate conferees this week, the odds rose for a four-year extension of half of the 5-cent rise in gasoline taxes imposed under the 1990 Federal budget agreement. This means the 14-cent levy would fall to 11 1/2 cents in 1995. The other 2 1/2 cents being applied to reduce the deficit would expire.
Supporters of the dozen tax breaks due to expire at year-end -- including the low-income housing, research and development, and targeted jobs incentives -- invoked the weak economy in mounting a last-ditch effort this week to have them renewed. But with time running out, passage this year is increasingly unlikely. "If I could get 50-50 odds on this, I'd take it," acknowledged Representative Frank J. Guarini, a New Jersey Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee.
States have enacted tax increases of $16.2 billion for the fiscal year 1992, the biggest dollar amount on record. At 5.4 percent of 1990 collections, the increases were the biggest by this gauge since 1971, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

HEADLINE: Home Builders Throw In the Extras

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FISHKILL, N.Y.

 BODY:
A survivor like David Stenger, with 20-odd years of watching the starts and stops of the home-building industry, knows that selling a house in a near-comatose market can require flexibility. This time, his notion of flexibility is being stretched.
"We're bending over backward all right," said Mr. Stenger, a 39-year-old builder with a can-do smile. "Way over." 
 One previously unthinkable method of securing a sale, about which Mr. Stenger and others like him will now readily resort, goes like this: If someone wants to buy a house but is holding back because he or she cannot sell an existing home, Mr. Stenger will buy the customer's home himself to make the deal. He's done so twice this year.
This year, for the first time since 1945, the number of housing starts nationwide is expected to fall below one million. The National Association of Home Builders projects the total at 990,000, down from 1.2 million last year and 1.38 million in 1989, as falling confidence in the economy leads the housing industry into a deeper contraction.
While no part of the country has escaped the drop-off in number of houses built and sold, cities like Denver, Dallas and Phoenix have seen minor rebounds, and the previously breakneck speed of urban construction in Southern cities like Atlanta has been blunted. The Northeast housing market continues to limp along at a pace among the nation's slowest.
The main obstacle to greater home sales, several builders agreed, is the lack of consumer confidence. Mr. Stenger said it seemed to be uncertainty about their jobs that caused buyers to waver before signing on the dotted line. He has gotten nearly as many inquiries about houses this year as ever, he said, but few of those translate into sales.
"Time and again, people come and look," he said. "But then they get cold feet."
In New York State, "It's still a very bleak situation," said Robert Wieboldt, executive vice president of the New York State Home Builders Association. Beyond the sluggish rate of building single-family houses, there is now little construction of condominums in the state.
Ever optimistic, Mr. Wieboldt said he thought the slow pace of construction would eventually lead to a pent-up demand that would spur the housing market by the middle of 1992. But for this year, monthly home sales figures in New York have risen and fallen, dropping 17.5 percent in September compared with August.
 
Making Concessions
 Surviving home builders know that the essential ingredients of a house sale -- quality, price and location -- are each scrutinized carefully by any potential customer. But it is additional creativity -- with price, extras, or financing -- that is now essential.
"We're all making concessions to get sales," said Craig O'Donnell, a builder in Wappingers Falls, N.Y., who will throw in extras like a black-top driveway or an enlarged fireplace without hesitation. "Problem is, there aren't many of us left."
In the Hudson Valley, the broad stretch of land north of Westchester County, the attractions of scenic beauty and proximity to New York City have kept the home-building industry from stalling completely. Yet the decline seems more painful because of the giddy, intoxicating nature of the 1980's boom that preceded it.
Mr. O'Donnell estimates that as many as 80 percent of the home builders in the valley have either gone out of business or into hibernation until the market revives. Many who started building during the boom included doctors and lawyers, who invested in the industry with little if any experience in construction. Many of them were among the first to be forced out of the market when the crunch came.
Mr. O'Donnell said that because New York State does not require any registration for a builder, it is difficult to gauge the number of active builders, and the level of their activity.
"Everybody has scaled down their operation," said Jean Rowe, executive director of the Building Association of Hudson Valley. Remodeling and small-scale construction have become common for builders who built only single-family houses in the past, she said.
Mr. Stenger, the builder who offered to buy the houses of his customers, recently took this buy-to-sell arrangement to another level. A buyer, Kevin Carswell, wanted Mr. Stenger to build him a $284,000 home, but only after he had sold his own $181,500 home. Mr. Carswell had a buyer on the hook but he was having trouble selling his $123,000 condominium. The solution: Mr. Stenger offered to buy the condo and make it a three-way transaction. He plans to sell the condo as quickly as possible, at a loss if necessary but at a profit if possible.
"In a good market, I'd never have gotten near one of these," said Mr. Stenger, who is navigating the complexities of closing all three deals on the same day, scheduled for January. It will actually be a four-way deal, he added, if he can unload the condominium on the same day. A loss of several thousand dollars on one sale, he said, will be acceptable if he can make it up on the other.
Thomas Carroll, who sold the condominium to Mr. Stenger as part of the three-way deal, said he had not expected to be approached by a builder as a buyer.
"I was surprised, to say the least," said Mr. Carroll, who works for the International Business Machines Corporation. He received less than his asking price from Mr. Stenger, but felt lucky that he had found a buyer at all.
"I've heard horror stories about people unable to sell their houses for the longest time," he said. "This situation helped me out."
Few builders see any end soon to the ever-lengthening slump.
"I don't see any upturn coming soon," said Raymond Croniser Jr., another builder who has survived, despite watching his sales drop from 72 homes in 1987 to 26 last year. He has built and sold 23 houses so far this year.
 
Tries Personal Touch
 For Mr. Croniser, a personal touch with a customer -- taking extra time to go over floor-plan details, making an unexpected appearance at an open house -- can sometimes nudge buyers past doubts and into purchases.
"We've had to improve our bedside manner," he said.
Peter Elenius, who bought a house built by Croniser Construction, said he found his builder refreshingly flexible about modifications. For a fireplace expansion that would ordinarily cost up to $1,000, he said, Croniser only charged him $50.
"They listened to what I wanted, and they did it," he said.
In the last housing slump, a decade ago, high interest rates discouraged many ordinary home buyers from a long-term obligation. These days, an ordinary home buyer can obtain a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage at less than 9 percent.
"You haven't seen rates like that since 1977, 1978," said Jay Shackford, vice president of the National Association of Home Builders. "You have a lot of people afraid of job loss, a lot of uncertainty."
Banks, suffering their own crises, have all but halted loans for acquisition, development and construction projects, builders said.
For builders without the financial resources to pull off a buy-to-sell arrangement like Mr. Stenger's, an essential like the price of the home can be the difference between the success and failure of a project.
Dan Amatuzzo has been able to sell 90 of 116 town houses he and two partners built in Cedar Woods, a project in Highland Mills, N.Y., because the base price remained at $99,000 for a two-bedroom home.
 
Prices Lowered Again

"We tried raising the price about $5,000 last June," Mr. Amatuzzo said, "and the sales stopped, boom, just like that." After a few weeks, prices were lowered to $99,000 again, and the sales resumed.
Mr. Amatuzzo said his project had been possible only because of a partnership he formed. Armed with land he bought more than 10 years ago, but lacking the cash to build, he teamed with two other well-financed builders, Bob Hankin and Ruby Shafran.
Over all, prices in the area are down 15 to 20 percent from their peak in 1987-88, his partner, Mr. Hankin, said.
But as a survivor, he has not given up looking for affordable land for future projects.
"We tell people: 'If it's a good deal, we're not interested. Only if it's a steal are we interested,' " Mr. Hankin said.

HEADLINE: American Airlines Details Its Plans to Cut Spending

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
American Airlines, which for the last five years has been a leader in expansion, is cutting its capital expenditures by $8 billion.
The company has already announced plans to reduce its five-year, $22 billion capital spending program but until now has given no details. On Thursday, Robert L. Crandall, chairman, president and chief executive of American's parent, the AMR Corporation, said the airline's fleet of 602 planes would increase to 682 by 1995 instead of the 775 planned originally. 
 Addressing a group of airline analysts at a New York transportation conference sponsored by Salomon Brothers, Mr. Crandall said that American would postpone or pass on almost all its options to buy new airplanes, which have a total value of $5.2 billion. He also said that deliveries of some aircraft already ordered would be slowed down for a saving of $3 billion from 1991 to 1995.
"The outlook is very uncertain," he said, "and although I am optimistic that over time, left to its own devices, the industry will make the needed course corrections, neither my colleagues nor I are willing to bet American's balance sheet that it will do so soon."
American said that for now it had decided not to buy 11 MD-ll's from McDonnell Douglas, 12 Boeing 767's and 33 Boeing 757's and 37 smaller jets from Fokker.
Julius Maldutis, an airline analyst at Salomon Brothers, said the cutback by American, while large, did not necessarily mean that American would fall behind such rivals as United and Delta in growth.
He said that the cut by American brought it closer to the level of United's airplane orders, which total about $15.6 billion over the next five years.
"American is reducing its explosive growth rate to the more modest levels of United," he added. "What we have is a leveling of the playing field."
Mr. Crandall began to worry about the rate of expansion last fall when the Persian Gulf war doubled aviation fuel prices and brought a sudden drop in traffic that did not recover until last summer. American and most major carriers suffered major losses.
 
Others Haven't Cut Back

Both United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, American's biggest rivals, have not cut back on the pace of new plane deliveries.
Mr. Crandall said that if conditions changed the airline could decide to exercise some of its options on planes.
"We have never sought to be the largest airline in either the United States, the world or even Texas," he said. "We have sought and still seek to be solidly profitable."
Mr. Crandall set the stage for rapid expansion in 1983 when he persuaded unions to agree to a two-tier wage structure under which new employees were hired at lower wages.
As Mr. Crandall expanded the airline's staff from 42,500 workers in 1983 to 92,800 today, most of them were hired at much lower wages, greatly reducing labor costs.
American has a lot to digest, having acquired the London routes of Trans World Airlines. It began operating them in July.
American has also acquired Latin American routes from Eastern Airlines.

GTE's partners include the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, Telefonica Internationale de Espana and C.A. la Electricidad de Caracas. A representative of GTE said the Stamford, Conn., company would finance at least 51 percent of the purchase price itself. 
 James L. Johnson, chairman and chief executive officer of GTE, said the Venezuelan venture supported the company's "strategy to seek international opportunities" in telecommunications.
The Bell Atlantic Corporation, the losing finalist in a bidding process that began earlier this year with offers by 12 international consortiums, had offered $1.4 billion.
Mike Haughton, a spokesman for Bell Atlantic, said the Venezuelan experience was "not the end of our international efforts."
As part of the Government's privatization for the telephone company, employees will be offered an 11 percent stake, with the remaining shares to be sold in the near future on the domestic stock exchange.
GTE will have broad managerial control over the telephone company, which has for years been criticized for inadequate service and outdated equipment.
Dorea Akers, a spokeswoman for GTE, said the company would install two new digital switchers in Caracas that would improve service.
The telephone company now has a backlog of 500,000 orders for new telephone lines and has long been considered a drag on the economy.
GTE's shares lost $1.625 cents each today, closing at $32.25 on the New York Stock Exchange; Bell Atlantic lost $1.50, to $45.125, on the Big Board.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Heavy Losses: Big Drop in Stocks a Factor

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar tumbled yesterday against most currencies in trading in the United States in reaction to strength in the German mark, worries about the economy and a sharp decline in stock prices. The dollar had risen in Europe.
Gold prices rose in New York after falling overseas. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a bid for gold of $359 an ounce late yesterday, up $4 from Thursday's late bid. 
 "The dollar took a fair pounding this afternoon," said Jerry Egan, chief foreign exchange dealer for the Bank of Boston.
Michael Guarino, vice president and senior manager of foreign exchange trading at A.B.N.-Amro Bank in New York, said the dollar was hurt by deepening gloom over the American economy and the relative strength of the German mark.
"Most assuredly, the United States dollar is weak on its own accord," he said. "As the gloom and doom continues to persist, with interest rates low and the bleak economic picture, the dollar should take it further on the chin."
The dollar suffered in part because of comments by the president of Germany's central bank, Helmut Schlesinger, who said current inflation rates in western Germany were unacceptable. The remarks helped strengthen the mark.
The dollar dropped to 1.6190 marks in New York from 1.62975 marks late Thursday. Earlier in Europe, the dollar had risen to 1.6375 marks, from 1.6305 marks late Thursday.
Mr. Egan of the Bank of Boston said traders were also alarmed by the sharp decline in the stock market that saw the Dow Jones industrial average tumble by more than 120 points.
The dollar dropped to 129.40 Japanese yen in New York, from 129.62 yen late Thursday. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar had risen 0.12 yen to finish at 129.77 yen. It was quoted later in London at 130.00 yen.
The decline in stock prices helped lift prices of gold, which could offer an alternative to stock investors looking for havens for their money. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery rose $4.50 an ounce, to $359.50.

HEADLINE: Industrial Production Was Flat in October

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Industrial production, which appeared to be pointing toward recovery through midsummer, showed no growth in October, the Federal Reserve Board said today. It was the third straight month of virtual stagnation.
Production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities was unchanged last month after edging up two-tenths of 1 percent in September and slipping one-tenth of 1 percent in August. 
 In an accompanying report on capacity utilization, the Federal Reserve said American industry operated at 79.6 percent of capacity in October, down from 79.8 percent in each of the two previous months.
The weak performance suggests more factory layoffs could be coming amid a faltering economic recovery, analysts said.
"It's hard to find any real pocket of strength," said Gilbert Benz, an economist with the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said business inventories rose six-tenths of 1 percent in September. It was the first gain since January and the largest since August 1990.
Today's reports, after Thursday's negative reports on retail sales and unemployment, offer "further evidence that the recovery is in tatters," said John M. Albertine, who heads a forecasting firm in Washington.
While industrial production accounts for only about one-third of the economy, this is the sector that is traditionally most subject to swings in the business cycle and is thus a good indicator of current economic conditions. Economists were especially disappointed that manufacturing, which had led the faltering recovery, had flattened.
President Bush, speaking by telephone to a meeting in Charleston, S.C., of executives representing the nation's 500 largest industrial companies, acknowledged that "we've got some short-term problems here." He added that "they're significant," but he insisted that the fundamental conditions exist "for the best growth we've seen in years," starting in 1992.
Hints that the manufacturing data would be discouraging came earlier this month when the Labor Department reported that 32,000 factory jobs had been lost in October on top of September's loss of 31,000.
 
Operating Rates Fall
 The Federal Reserve report today showed that all sectors -- factories, utilities and mines -- posted declines in their operating rates.
The rate at factories was 78.6 percent, down two-tenths of a percentage point from August. The rate at plants making durable goods fell to 76.0 percent from 76.4 percent.
An exception was automobile production, where utilization rose one percentage point, to 73.5 percent. Still, auto sales have been falling, suggesting the increase might not last.
And at plants making nondurable goods, the rate slipped to 82.0 percent, from 82.1 percent. It was off two-tenths of a percentage point, to 87.7 percent, at mines, and down one-tenth, to 84.1 percent, at utilities.
In the industrial production section of the report, the Federal Reserve said output at manufacturing plants remained unchanged in October, after posting a gain of five-tenths of 1 percent a month earlier.
 
Widespread Declines
 Output of durable goods -- relatively expensive items expected to last more than three years -- fell two-tenths of 1 percent after a rise of six-tenths in September. The report cited a decline in the output of both automobiles and consumer appliances.
Production of nondurable goods, like chemicals and clothing, increased two-tenths of 1 percent after rising three-tenths in September.
Mining output fell for the third straight month, down two-tenths of 1 percent after drops of 1.5 percent in September and seven-tenths in August. Utility production edged up one-tenth of 1 percent after plunging 1.5 percent in September.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Russian Republic Imposes Ban on Some Oil Exports

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The Russian republic sent a shudder through the oil market yesterday, announcing that it was suspending permission to export some cargoes of oil. But outside experts were not certain whether this was a symptom of the continuing decline in production in the Soviet Union, which is the world's largest producer, or part of an internal power struggle or the restructuring of the Soviet economy.
The announcement, the kind of news that the market has been more or less anticipating for two years, pushed crude prices up 60 cents a barrel early in the day on the New York Mercantile Exchange, but prices declined later, with oil for December delivery closing at $22.79, up 27 cents on the day. 
 "Clearly it is a major source of concern going into the winter," said Nauman Barakat, an oil expert at Merrill Lynch. But he said that while exports might fall, "they won't entirely suspend them, because of their desperate need for foreign exchange."
While the price move yesterday was not large, it was a reverse in direction, pointed out Vahan Zanoyan of the Petroleum Finance Corporation, a consulting firm in Washington. Oil prices are down $1.50 from recent highs, and the price would have gone down yesterday but for the Soviet announcement, he said. "The market is terribly oversupplied," he said. "There's far too much crude; we're swimming in it."
Several analysts said that while the announcement could be a symptom of declining production, it might also reflect a general loss of control in the Soviet economy. Thane Gustafson of Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Cambridge, Mass., said Soviet refineries were making private deals with foreign companies, and so were some production units, so that crude oil and refined products were flowing out of the country in an unaccustomed way.
In addition, he pointed out, control over export licenses is now being transferred from the central Government to the republics. The Russian republic may have decided to block some exports until it can figure out what is going on, he said.
Mr. Zanoyan said that oil was trading within the Soviet Union at about 70 rubles a ton, but that with rubles selling on the street for 110 to the dollar, the world price is about 9,000 rubles a ton, creating great inducement for producers and refiners to export.
George Friesen of Deutsche Bank Group in New York said it would take a severe drop in Soviet production to create problems on world markets.

HEADLINE: Credit Card Rate Cap In Doubt

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
With a politically popular move to cap the interest rates on credit cards spreading through Congress like a shipboard fire, the White House and banking lobbyists began damage control today, and the prevailing view by nightfall was that the measure probably would not be enacted.
Democrats see the issue as an embarrassing one for President Bush and want to keep it alive as long as possible. But many lawmakers, insisting on anonymity, said they would vote against it if they thought it stood a chance of becoming law. 
 Lobbyists for Citibank and other big banks were in offices all across Capitol Hill today arguing that if the caps were enacted, shaky banks might go under and millions of Americans whose credit ratings are less than ideal would have their credit cards recalled.
 
Opposition From the Fed

The White House denounced the measure with a vigor meant to suggest that President Bush would veto it if Congress approved it, but no veto threat was made outright.
Tonight, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, threw his weight against the legislation. If the bill passes, he wrote Congress, "The negative effect on banks' earnings will put further pressure on their ability to generate or raise capital at a time when concerns about capital positions are already contributing to restraint on bank lending."
Some legislators said the stock market's plunge today might give them pause about voting for a bill that could hurt already weak bank stocks.
The notion of the interest-rate cap began to spread this week after President Bush gave a speech on Tuesday urging banks to lower their credit card rates, now usually 18 to 20 percent, as a way to lift consumer spending and give the economy a jolt.
 
Amendment to Banking Bill
 The next day, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a New York Republican who has long favored a ceiling, without warning offered an amendment to banking legislation under consideration on the Senate floor. The amendment would have the effect of putting a 14 percent limit on credit card interest. Without much debate, it was passed by a vote of 74 to 19.
By Thursday, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady was saying that the Administration did not think such a law was a good idea. And today, Marlin Fitzwater, the President's spokesman, said, "When you do it by legislation, you impose artificial constraints that could be quite disastrous to the banking industry."
Mr. D'Amato's quick strike took the banking industry by surprise, but by today, their message was dominating Congressional telephones and fax machines.
Senator Jim Sasser of Tennessee, a senior Democrat on the Banking Committee, expressed sympathy with the view that banks were vastly overcharging their credit card customers. But in the end, he said, the measure probably would not pass.
 
Marvelous Issue for Democrats

"The thought around here," Mr. Sasser said in an interview, "is that Citicorp might go under, and that millions of folks would lose their credit cards, and that is causing a lot of wringing of hands and gnashing of teeth."
Still, it was a marvelous issue for Democrats, who are striving to position themselves as the party of the middle class. Thomas S. Foley, the Speaker of the House, said he hoped a vote on the matter could come in the House next week.
The House Banking Committee's Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs plans to try on Monday to draft a companion measure to Senator D'Amato's amendment. The subcommittee is closely divided between those who normally support and those who usually oppose the banking industry.
At a House Banking Committee staff meeting this morning, according to one account, several Republican aides seemed worried about the credit card legislation. The Democrats laughed that they were just backing the President and would begin next week's bill-drafting session with a video of Mr. Bush's speech.
 
No Apology From D'Amato

Senator D'Amato, who is up for re-election next year, said he had no apology for handing the Democrats a good political issue. He said he would never have acted if banks really competed on credit card rates. But he noted that Citibank, Chase Manhattan, Manufacturers Hanover, First Chicago and many other large banks charged exactly 19.8 percent, "the same rate right down to the decimal point."
Unlike the Senate, the House does not intend to tie its credit card bill to the overall banking legislation, and that could give the lawmakers a way out of a ticklish situation.
Senator Sasser suggested that perhaps "the two bills will just miss in the night."
But Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat, said in an interview that such a tightwire approach could prove risky. The political attractiveness of such a measure and the irritation at banks for not competing on credit card rates could prove irresistible, Mr. Schumer said.
 
Further Action Next Week

Further action on the overall banking legislation was put off until next week. On Thursday night, for the second time in 10 days, the House rejected a measure that would have modernized the Depression-era laws that govern the banking system. A new and narrower approach will be tried next week.
In a closed-circuit television address to business leaders in South Carolina, President Bush said he would continue to press for "fundamental reforms."

HEADLINE: Mortgage Rates Dip to 8.69%

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
The average interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages dropped to 8.69 percent this week, the lowest level in nearly 15 years, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation said today.
The last time rates stood so low was in the winter of 1977, when they were 8.65 percent. A year ago, the 30-year fixed rate charged by lenders stood at 10.02 percent. Last week it was 8.76 percent. 
 The new low levels reflect moves by the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to get the faltering economy and the housing market moving.
But analysts said the low rates had attracted few buyers so far. They did note a surge in the number of homeowners seeking to refinance their houses, purchased when rates were much higher.
Dick Peach, an economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association, said there had been some increase in applications for mortages, although refinancing accounted for about 50 percent of those applications, far above the traditional 15 percent.
"We are seeing things moving very gradually," he said.
Other analysts say the low interests rates will help ease problems in the housing market, but will not cure them.
Mark Obrinksy, an analyst at the Federal National Mortgage Association, said that home buyers were worried about their jobs, and were holding back from making the kind of financial commitment a home represented.
"Rates are not the main problem confronting home buyers," he said.

HEADLINE: Stocks Plunge, With the Dow Falling 120.31

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
The stock market, which has scored sharp gains for more than a year, came unraveled yesterday, with the market's most closely watched barometer, the Dow Jones industrial average, taking its largest plunge in more than two years.
When the dust settled, the Dow, which tracks 30 of the nation's leading companies, was down nearly 4 percent, closing at 2,943.20, off 120.31 points. It was the fifth-largest point loss ever. The largest drop was in 1987, when the Dow index fell 508 points. The second largest was in October 1989, when the it fell 190.58 points. 
 The losses were not limited to blue chips. Other measures of the markets were also sharply lower.
Investors looked nervously toward Monday, fearful of how the market might respond, although Wall Street professionals said that they had seenlittle sign of widespread investor panic yesterday, either among big money managers or individuals who buy mutual funds.
While many analysts had been predicting for several weeks that the market was vulnerable to a setback, they offered various explanations as to why the precipitous decline occurred yesterday. These were the reasons most commonly cited:
*An abrupt downturn in biotechnology stocks, which had reached levels that seemed overpriced to many professionals.
*The sudden reports of real estate problems at several leading insurers, including Aetna Life.
*Widespread alarm over the possible effects of moves in Washington to restrict interest rates on consumer credit cards.
Yesterday's steep drop cracked a market that had widely been perceived as fragile, as investors worried about the continued weakness in the economy and the impact that would have on corporate profits.
Even as evidence has mounted that the nation was struggling to recover from recession, the Dow since Oct. 11, 1990, has gained 698.41 points, nearly 30 percent.
But while traders agreed that the market was vulnerable, there was less agreement on exactly what pushed it into a tailspin.
One clear source of distress was the high-flying biotechnology sector. Pushed in part by the reaction last week to the news that Magic Johnson, the Los Angeles Lakers basketball star, was infected with the AIDS virus, some of these stocks had made double- and triple-digit gains, in the expectations of additional funds for AIDS research. All of the 10 largest losers in the over-the-counter market were biotechnology research and health-related companies.
 
Some Gave Warnings
 James McCamant, editor of the widely followed California Medical Technology Stock Letter, has been advising investors for weeks that overly optimistic buyers were bidding the biotechnology stocks up to unrealistic levels.
"I've been gradually getting more concerned," Mr. McCamant said. "We expected a decline, but we didn't expect it to be quite so much in one day." Despite the heavy selling and sharp declines yesterday, Mr. McCamant said he still found few attractive bargains. "But still I think this will be a short decline," he said. "Typically, panics like this tend to not last very long. Often a bubble will end in a panic, and recover before beginning a slower decline."
Another source of concern was the moves in Washington, led by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican, to curtail consumer credit card interest rates. The threat this poses to the financial system is twofold, economists said. First, it threatens to impair profits at already troubled large banks; second, it could force banks to be more stringent in issuing cards, leaving some consumers less able to buy goods on credit. That, in turn, could curtail consumer spending, adding to the nation's weak retail sales.
David Shulman, managing director and head of the economics unit at Salomon Brothers, said: "People are very nervous about the whole credit card thing. If the banks pull back on consumer credit, it would impact disastrously on the consumer sector."
 
Watch on Washington
 Traders, too, cited the credit card developments, and warned that Wall Street would be watching Washington over the weekend to see whether the issue could be resolved.
The last volley to hit the market was the news that the Aetna Life and Casualty Company expected an increase of up to $1.3 billion in problem loans in its mortgage portfolio. Although reports of real estate weakness is nothing new, even in the insurance sector, Aetna was hit hard by heavy selling at yesterday's opening bell. That indicated to Mr. Shulman, the Salomon Brothers executive, that the stock market had not yet fully absorbed the potential ramifications of those developments.
Traders said Aetna Life fell sharply in London trading because of investor concern there that the insurance group might have more than a billion dollars in nonperforming mortgage loans. In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the stock was down $3, to $38.50.
These shocks hit the market at a time when most investors have been increasingly concerned about the economy, and what an aborted recovery might portend for corporate earnings and employment.
Peter G. Grennan, senior vice president at Lehman Brothers, said: "Investors and the market are showing impatience with the Government in bringing about an economic recovery. The market has been patient for months, on the assumption that lower interest rates will do the job, and investors are now starting to doubt that."
Those doubts culminated yesterday in a broad-based selloff that began gently, continued through lunchtime, and then sharply gathered speed in the afternoon. By the end of the day, virtually the only set of stocks that had managed to gain in the downdraft were the gold-mining companies, the classic haven for agitated investors. Gold itself closed at $360.10 an ounce, up $4.40.

The Dow recorded its largest drop in more than two years. The average fell 120.31, to 2,943.20. The losses were not limited to blue chips as other measures of the market were also sharply lower. An abrupt downturn in biotechnology stocks was among the explanations for the decline as was the sudden reports of real estate problems at several leading insurers, including Aetna Life. [Page 1.] 
 Investors fleeing the stock market piled money into Treasury bills and notes, and short-term interest rates fell sharply. [33.]

Industrial production showed no growth in October, the Fed said. It was the third straight month of virtual stagnation. [34.]
Business inventories rose 0.6 percent in September, the first increase in eight months and the largest in more than a year, the Commerce Department said. Sales lagged behind, rising four-tenths of 1 percent. [34.]

HEADLINE: Louisiana Politics Dances to Music of Rage

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Nov. 15

 BODY:
The Cajun music still rockets through the night in clubs from Bourbon Street to Breaux Bridge, but there's no big fun on the bayou these days in Louisiana.
One day before Saturday's runoff for governor between former Gov. Edwin W. Edwards and State Representative David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader and neo-Nazi, this is a state full of rage, fear and frustration. Instead of politics as loopy theater, it's politics as primal scream. 
 The race has not been fun for Margot Garon of New Orleans, who says she cannot help but hear recurring, insistent reminders of her childhood when her family fled Nazi Germany. It is not fun for Danny Braud of Gonzales, who wonders if the good times will ever roll again and blames government for everything from welfare cheaters to his bad luck in fishing.
It was not fun for Duke supporters at a rally in Lafayette on Wednesday night, bitter that what they see as their scream of rage against a decade of corruption and economic decay is interpreted by outsiders as racism. It is not fun for business people throughout the state who fear that by electing Mr. Duke, Louisiana could be committing economic suicide.
And after Mr. Duke's emphasis on racial issues in this campaign and two other campaigns in the last two years, for the State Legislature and the United States Senate, voters here -- black and white, Jew and Christian -- are looking at each other in a way they have not for years.
"When the civil rights movement started they said, 'We just want to go to school with whites,' " said Louis Otto, a 76-year-old New Orleans landlord, who is white. "Now there's no stopping the demands. There's no end to it all. The morning paper said there's no black owners of baseball teams. What do they want? To give them a baseball team? That's why I tend to Duke."
Ted Quant, the director of the Institute for Human Relations at Loyola University, who is black, said he was still stunned by Mr. Duke's strength and the fact he could get two-thirds of the white vote. "Every time I shake hands with three white people," he said, "I shake hands with two Nazis."
As his critics and admirers are quick to point out, Mr. Duke's issues attract a national following. But he is also a product of the state's politics and its economic morass over the past decade.
From the Depression-era days of Huey P. Long, whose "every man a king" populism created one-man rule, Louisiana's politics has always inhabited its own distinctive universe. That universe reflected the state's poverty, its dependence on oil to pay the bills and its Balkanized politics, divided geographically by north and south and culturally by blacks, whites and Cajuns, descendants of the French settlers expelled from Nova Scotia by the British in 1755.
In the past, these divisions have pitted Protestant and conservative northern Louisiana against Roman Catholic and free-wheeling southern Louisiana in a Byzantine political grid that the writer A. J. Liebling once described as America's answer to Lebanon.
But the old alliances and divisions are now utterly scrambled, broken down by race and exacerbated by an economic slide that began when oil prices dropped in the early 1980's.
Tim Ryan, director of the Division of Business and Economic Research at the University of New Orleans, said Louisiana's economy peaked in 1981, when employment reached 1.63 million. The economy then stalled, and went into a free fall in 1985 and 1986, when the state lost 72,000 jobs. In 1987 it lost 40,000 more, a cumulative loss of more than 8 percent of the state's jobs.
 
'That Recession Psychology'
 Since then the economy has inched its way back, finally nearing the peak employment of 1981. But that gradual recovery, coming under Gov. Buddy Roemer, who finished third behind Mr. Edwards and Mr. Duke in last month's primary, failed to register with voters, Mr. Ryan said, adding, "It obviously wasn't fast enough to do away with or change that recession psychology that seemed to plague the voters."
It certainly did not change the psychology of Mr. Braud, a 46-year-old electrician who was drinking a Budweiser and fishing in a roadside bayou on Tuesday afternoon near Sorrento, between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, and began talking about the campaign with a flurry of racial slurs.
"We have gone through depression, suppression, repression and everything else, and it's time for a change like David Duke," he said as he watched the murky bayou waters from a folding chair.
"Back in Earl Long's day, the politicians could take their cut because they put a chicken in every pot," he continued, referring to Huey Long's brother, who also served as Governor. "Those days are gone. Now to get something to eat, I've got to catch a fish, and I can't do it because Buddy Roemer has got the channel going the wrong way."
The channel, off Blind River, was flowing the way it always has. But Mr. Braud's comment may have epitomized the special sense of political betrayal here.
In the past, voters winked at much of the political corruption in Louisiana, largely because the oil companies were footing most of the bill. But with the depression of the 1980's, the winking has ended. In Mr. Edwards, the three-term Governor who was twice tried but not convicted of racketeering, many voters here see a symbol of the old order that is now despised. Thus, Mr. Duke's support includes both hard-core followers and those who cannot bring themselves to vote for Mr. Edwards.
"They feel like Edwards burned them," said John Maginnis, editor of the Louisiana Political Review and author of "The Last Hayride" (Gris Gris Press, 1984). "They take it personally, that he did something to them, and they don't feel the same way about Duke unless they're Jews or blacks."
To many, Mr. Edwards represents everything that is wrong with the old political order, and Mr. Duke represents the radical change they want.
Ronnie Daigle and Roy Torres, who were hanging out at a gas station in Napoleonville, down the road from giant refineries that sit in the middle of endless fields of sugar cane, have no doubt about who they support. For them, Mr. Duke has become a lightning rod for resentments on race, on the economy and even on the environment in a state with some of the nation's worst pollution problems.
The stories come out in animated profusion: of the state environmental officials who turn a deaf ear to reports of chemical spills, of the shady deals in local politics, of the black woman who cursed and yelled when an elderly white woman tried to quiet her child at a local social services office. They all point in one direction.
"Duke -- I'd vote for him 150 times if I could," said Mr. Torres, who is 23 years old. "He's the only one willing to stand up and tell the truth."
 
Some Raw Emotions
 For Mr. Duke's critics, the emotions are at least as raw.
Katherine Davis, a 67-year-old black woman who was fishing a few miles downstream from Mr. Braud, saw something very different in the murky waters. "I know these people," she said. "I know about the Ku Klux Klan, how they'd burn down your house, burn down everything you have to get what they want."
Mrs. Garon, project director for a retirement village in New Orleans, fled Nazi Germany with her parents in 1937 when she was 10 years old.
"I see the Duke people holding up those banners and see them mesmerized," she said. "And if that doesn't remind me of the mesmerization that went on in those early days of Hitler, I don't know what does."
 
Taking Cues From Duke
 If race pervades this election, religion has also been ever present, with Mr. Duke playing up his professions of Christianity and accusing Mr. Edwards of mocking Christianity.
In ways both subtle and not, voters have taken their cues from Mr. Duke.
"I don't know why this one little man has frightened them so," Priscilla Bolyard, a retired social worker in New Orleans, said of Mr. Duke. "The blacks have the votes but they don't have the money. The Jews have the money, and the politicians and the business people need both the votes and the money, so they're getting the Jews and the blacks on their side and making a lot of noise."
There is also fear on the part of Duke supporters. Some say they are afraid to put up Duke signs in their yard or express their support publicly. Many say they fear reprisals from blacks.
"No one has to worry about putting up an Edwards sign," said Bill Lee, a 64-year-old Duke supporter from Westwego. "But if you put up a Duke sign in your yard, you're asking for it."
One night last week things seemed normal at Mulate's Restaurant in Breaux Bridge, billed as the "The World's Most Famous Cajun Restaurant," with its flamboyant bayou posters, thousands of business cards tacked to the ceiling and couples shimmying across the dance floor to the Cajun music of the Breaux Bridge Playboys.
But when the music stopped and the musicians were asked to name the candidate they would vote for, their smiles froze and they mumbled disclaimers that made their choice clear.
"He's the one saying what people want to hear," said one musician without mentioning Mr. Duke's name.
At one table were Tricia Siebert and John Anderson, newlyweds from Minnesota who had a Cajun band at their wedding and spoke fondly about the Cajun culture and hospitality they had found in their visit here. But after talking about Mr. Duke's support they found themselves confused.
They said they enjoyed their trip but probably would not return if Mr. Duke was elected. "It's not acceptable to vote for a Nazi," Ms. Siebert said.
At another table, when the subject turned to the race for governor, a young woman started telling a story of driving through the backroads between Lafayette and St. Martinville recently. The woman, who would speak only if she were not identified, said she saw in the distance what she took to be the lights of a gas well being tested, but as she got closer she realized it was not a well, but a Klan rally illuminated by burning crosses.
"What does that have to do with David Duke?" her companion, Polly Enloe of Lafayette, asked angrily.
"It has everything to do with David Duke," the first woman replied.
"We have no choice," Mrs. Enloe said. "We have two bad choices in Louisiana. We know what Edwards would do. All I say is give Duke a chance."

HEADLINE: Accord on Ending Haiti Crisis Reported

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
The Haitian Parliament and a delegation from the Organization of American States have agreed on a process to restore constitutional government to Haiti that officials say could pave the way for a return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was deposed in a military coup on Sept. 30.
Diplomats and officials cautioned, however, that restoring the Aristide Government would not be easy to accomplish in the present, volatile atmosphere in Haiti. 
 The accord, which stops short of calling directly for the return of President Aristide, who still has many opponents in Haiti, was signed in Port-au-Prince on Wednesday and made public there by the leaders of the Haitian Parliament and members of the O.A.S. delegation. The agreement has not yet been formally announced by the O.A.S. headquarters here, where the organization's leadership and member nations are being briefed on the document and the discussions that led to it, and where efforts are being made to get talks started.
 
Accord Signed in Haiti
 The negotiators returned Thursday to present the document to the O.A.S. leadership and member nations for review. Copies of the document, in French from Haiti, are circulating here, despite the fact that it has not been officially released.
With tensions high and the effects of a hemispheric economic embargo beginning to be felt in Haiti, many Haitians are continuing to flee the island by boat. About 200 were picked up Thursday night, American officials said, bringing to nearly 1,000 the number in custody this afternoon. About 480 Haitians are at the American base in Guantanamo, Cuba, and 500 more are being held on Coast Guard vessels at sea.
American officials and representatives of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees have been making urgent efforts to resettle Haitians in other Caribbean Basin nations. Belize has agreed to accept about 200 of the exiles, and there have been reports that Honduras and Venezuela are about to make similar offers. Reuters reported from Port of Spain, Trinidad, tonight that Trinidad and Tobago had agreed to accept an unspecified number of refugees held aboard the Coast Guard ships.
With Haiti in crisis, the United States has refrained from returning people picked up at sea. But it continues to advise Haitians not to set sail on uncertain seas where many have perished over the years.
The seven-member O.A.S. delegation that negotiated the agreement with Haiti's de facto government under an interim Prime Minister, Jean-Jacques Honorat, was an unusual group of prominent citizens of the hemisphere, led by a former Colombian Foreign Minister, Augusto Ramirez Ocampo. His team came from Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Trinidad and Tobago, the United States and Venezuela. The American delegate was Lawrence Harrison, a writer and former official of the United States Agency for International Development.
The accord, reached after meetings with many prominent Haitians, in and out of government and the armed forces -- including labor leaders, industrialists, merchants and members of the clergy -- calls for talks outside Haiti to find a way to restore civilian government in line with the 1987 Haitian constitution. The Haitian legislators apparently did not press for the exclusion of President Aristide from politics. He was elected last December in Haiti's first democratic vote in a generation.
When the O.A.S. delegation first arrived, they were met with accusations that Father Aristide, a Catholic priest with a populist appeal, had been moving toward authoritarian rule, neglecting Parliament and other government institutions. His supporters countered that the persistent danger of a military coup called for unusually tough measures. They say that hundreds of Haitians have been killed since the Sept. 30 coup.
As part of the agreement, the O.A.S. is to send an international mission to Haiti to monitor civil rights and a restoration of democracy. The accord also calls for a visit by the Inter-American Human Rights Commission to investigate conditions before and after the departure of President Aristide, now in exile in Venezuela.
John Kozyn, associate director of the Washington Office on Haiti, a private group monitoring human rights and the political situation there, said in an interview today that there are still obstacles to Father Aristide's return, especially among the rich. Officials here add that there is also apprehension in the military that if the deposed President were to return while the atmosphere is still volatile, his supporters might form lynch mobs to attack those they perceive as enemies of the President.

HEADLINE: Senate Passes Bill to Extend Jobless Aid and Bush Signs It

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
The Senate tonight passed and President Bush signed legislation to provide up to 20 weeks of additional unemployment benefits to people already out of work at least 26 weeks.
The 91-to-2 vote quieted four months of intense partisan debate over the effect of the recession. The action also ended a furious 24 hours of arguments from some senators that their states were treated unfairly by the bill, which the House passed 396 to 30 on Thursday. 
 The compromise that calmed the storm provided for passage of the House bill, which provides either 6, 13 or 20 weeks of additional benefits, first. Then the Senate passed and sent to the House another bill that would shift all 23 states in the 6-week category to the 13-week category.
 
'Happy Thanksgiving Indeed'

 The benefits program was based on states rather than individuals because, lawmakers said, it was the most even-handed way to dole out additional benefits. They said it was fair for workers in states with higher jobless rates to get a longer extension of benefits because they would probably have more difficulty finding jobs.
Expressing the relief that filled the chamber after tense hours of debate and back-room meetings, Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the Democratic chairman of the Finance Committee, said, "We can have the checks in the mail before Thanksgiving in many cases, and that will be a happy Thanksgiving indeed."
Both bills had White House approval, said Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader. He said that the additional benefits in the second bill would add only $95 million to the $5.3 billion price tag of the House bill.
This cost increase, which surprised some Congressional aides who worked on the bill, was based on analyses prepared by the Bush Administration, Senator Dole said. The Administration has worked actively to get this bill adopted after killing two earlier versions on the grounds that they would increase the deficit.
 
Bush Calls Bill Responsible
 Within an hour of passage, the House bill was signed here by Congressional officials. And after Mr. Bush signed the bill, he issued a statement calling the bill "responsible." He said it would help the unemployed while maintaining budget discipline.
Mr. Bush said he had been deeply concerned about the plight of the unemployed and "my only regret is that the Congress did not earlier send me a bill that I could sign." In September, his aides had said that extended benefits were unnecessary because the economy was improving and more benefits would only encourage the unemployed to stay unemployed.
If the second bill is enacted, probably next week, jobless workers in Puerto Rico and nine states, including Connecticut and New Jersey, would be eligible for up to 20 weeks of benefits after exhausting the 26 weeks most states allow. In the other 41 states, the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands, up to 13 weeks would be paid.
The second bill is also more generous than the House bill in paying benefits to people whose unemployment payments were exhausted some time ago, so-called "reachback benefits." Under the Senate bill, unemployed people in any state would be eligible for the reachback benefits if their regular benefits ran out any time between March 1 and now. Under a provision of the House bill, which stirred anger in the Senate, workers in 18 states would have been ineligible for the reachback benefits.
Under the legislation, if economic conditions in a state worsen it can move into the 20-week category. That would happen if a state's total unemployment rate, averaged over six months, reached 9 percent, or the unemployment rate among workers covered by unemployment insurance reached 5 percent.
A state could also move down from the 20-week to the 13-week category if conditions improved under a complicated formula, but individual workers who qualified for the 20 weeks would remain eligible.
The deal provides a higher level of benefits than any version of the measure previously considered in the House or Senate.
 
 
'Vote for American Workers'
 Earlier in the day a caustic debate was waged over the bill. Senator Robert C. Smith, Republican of New Hampshire, who wanted to tap foreign aid to provide more benefits, said, "You're either going to vote for aid for Somalia and Kenya, or you're going to vote for American workers."
Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, said, "This formula is a fraud," and threatened a filibuster.
Senators Conrad and Hank Brown, Republican of Colorado, cast the only votes against the bill; all of the Senators from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut voted for it.
The 71-to-24 defeat of the Smith proposal indicated the leadership could have forced the House bill through without change, but it might have taken several days, and Congress, which took the lead on the issue, would have faced criticism for its delays.
 
Bush Objected
 The two previous versions of the legislation would have paid the costs of extra benefits by tapping a trust fund established to pay extended benefits, but under a formula so strict that no worker in any state is now collecting them. That would have increased the Federal deficit and President Bush had objected.
The measure passed today provides for revenues by speeding up collection of estimated taxes on some wealthy taxpayers, and continues provisions for deducting unpaid student loans from tax refunds. It also extends for 1996 a two-tenths of 1 percent surcharge on the unemployment tax employers pay on the first $7,000 workers earn.
A big savings in the program was made by providing that the legislation expire June 13, instead of on July 4 as in the House bill. That was estimated to save $285 million. But most lawmakers expect new legislation next spring unless the economy suddenly improves.

HEADLINE: U.S. Aides Worry About Spread of Arms From Sales by the Soviets

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Pentagon and Western intelligence officials are expressing growing alarm that aggressive new efforts by the Soviet Union to sell weapons and advanced technology for badly needed cash are setting off a new wave of arms proliferation.
Advanced Soviet MIG-31 fighter jets were on the block at a weapons trade fair in Dubai this month, an American intelligence officer said. Syria is buying upgraded Soviet T-72 tanks, while Iran is acquiring advanced Soviet fighter planes, Western intelligence officials say. The Pentagon is investigating suspected sales of improved Soviet-made Scud missiles to third-world countries. 
 As the Soviet Union sinks deeper into economic turmoil, American officials also fear that thousands of Soviet scientists trained in building nuclear and chemical weapons are likely to lose their jobs soon, and then to try selling their talents to the highest bidder.
The Soviet Union has about 30,000 nuclear weapons, and American officials say Soviet weapons experts could be tempted by high salaries to join the nuclear programs of nations like North Korea and Iraq.
"I'm very much concerned about the sale of that technology," Deputy Defense Secretary Donald J. Atwood said in an interview with reporters today. "What we do want to stop is their selling arms to countries that have unstable governments or have a history of aggression or a history of terrorism."
"In particular we want to stop the flow of technology that could later give them the ability to make weapons of mass destruction," he said.
Mr. Atwood recently returned from an eight-day visit to Soviet military factories, where he and seven American industrialists studied the prospects of American assistance in converting Soviet military industries into commercial businesses.
The Soviet Union has been one of the world's largest arms merchants for years, largely building the Syrian and Iraqi armies, among others. The Bush Administration has made it clear to Moscow and the newly assertive republics that secret arms sales could jeopardize future Western economic aid.
That may curb official government-to-government sales, but senior Pentagon officials voice concern that thousands of newly unemployed Soviet officers and soldiers, discharged from the shrinking Soviet military, could try to sell weapons or technology in the world's black-market arms bazaar.
 
Some Superior Technology
 The Bush Administration is torn between wanting to buy a vast array of formerly secret Soviet weapons at bargain prices, and wanting to wean Soviet military industries off their missile and space businesses into peaceful ventures.
While most Soviet industries lag far behind their Western counterparts, a few others, including space and missile technologies, are equal to or surpass Western technology, American experts say. The Soviets, for instance, have put on sale rocket engines, space stations, nuclear reactors and other parts of their space program, in hopes of fetching badly needed hard currency.
Pentagon technical teams have visited the Soviet Union in recent weeks to evaluate the newly available weaponry and technology. In a sign those visits might inadvertently be encouraging Soviet policy makers to avoid conversion to peaceful industries, Mr. Atwood this week directed all Defense Department officials traveling to the Soviet Union to clear their visits with him or Mr. Cheney.
In addition to arms sales, American officials are worried about the migration of the thousands of experts who built the vast Soviet conventional and nuclear weapons arsenals.
"We could witness an equally threatening proliferation of scientific know-how, a bidding war, if you will, by third-world regimes for Soviet weapons experts that would dwarf the U.S.-Soviet competition to recruit German V-2 scientists after World War II," Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the Armed Services Committee, said in a Senate floor speech this week.
Mr. Atwood and American intelligence officials say that there is no hard evidence yet to suggest a "brain drain" from the Soviet Union, but that the disintegrating economy could set off an exodus.

HEADLINE: U.S. Will Try Diplomatic Action Before a Military Strike on Libya

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
The White House indicated today that it would pursue diplomatic means before considering military retaliation against Libya for its role in the 1988 bombing of a Pan American World Airways jet that killed 270 people, but officials stressed they have ruled out nothing in their efforts to obtain two Libyan intelligence agents indicted in the crime.
One option gaining early support, the White House officians said, is an embargo of Libya's oil exports, which account for about 2.5 percent of the world's 60 million barrel a day average production. 
 To be effective, such an action would require either the cooperation of America's European allies, some of whom are major consumers of Libyan oil, or United Nations support for naval action to prevent tankers from docking at Libya's five seaside pipeline terminals.
It would also probably trigger an increase in world oil prices, a consequence the White House almost certainly would hope to avoid in an election year already plagued by economic troubles.
The United States has barred imports of Libyan oil since 1982, but that embargo has had only a marginal effect. A wider embargo that included western Europe, the buyer of more than 90 percent of the oil Libya exports, would have a far greater impact.
Another opition is an international effort to shut down Libya's diplomatic missions and to revoke the landing rights for Libya's airline. Libya's embassies and its airlines have long been suspected key elements in the terrorist network of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader.
The Libyan Embassy in Washington has been closed since 1981 in reaction to an attempt by Colonel Qaddafi's agents to assassinate a Libyan dissident in the United States.
The United States will first deliver to Libya the indictments handed down Thursday accusing two Libyan intelligence agents with conspiring to plant the bomb that demolished Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland in December 1988, the State Department said today. The explosion killed 259 persons in the plane and 11 more on the ground.
 
Libya Denies Charge
 Libya said today that it "categorically denies" the American charges, and suggested in a prepared statement that they be submitted to the International Court of Justice or some other neutral body for adjudication. The State Department rejected that suggestion outright, saying the indictments were a matter for United States courts to settle.
The United States has no extradition treaty with Libya, but will probably ask Belgian authorities to relay the indictments and formally ask the two agents to be handed over for prosection, the State Department's spokesman, Richard Boucher, said.
It was not clear today whether America's allies could be counted on to take united action against Libya. The Administration was said today to be preparing to lay out the evidence of Libyan involvement in the Pan Am case to European and Arab states, and then to measure the response.
 
Quick Military Action Unlikely
 Both Administration officials and outside experts agreed that the United States is unlikely to make a quick military strike against Libya, despite a warning from the White House today that it reserves the right to take such an action.
Any military action akin to the 1986 bombing raid by American warplanes on Tripoli could provoke a strong reaction from Arab countries at a time when Middle East peace negotiations are just beginning, they said. Egypt said today that it had warned President Bush that any military action against Libya would endanger "security and stability" in the region.
But an Administration official who asked not to be identified said that President Bush had privately discussed the Libyan situation with President Francois Mitterrand of France, and possibly with other European leaders, at the recent NATO summit meeting in Rome.
The French have previously shied from punishing Libya for terrorist acts, but recent charges in another airline bombing have roused growing public anger there. In that case, a French magistrate accused four Libyan intelligence officers, including the brother-in-law of Colonel Qaddafi, of plotting the September 1989 bombing of a French DC-10 airliner over Chad, killing 170 persons.
 
Praise for Detective Work
 At a reception Thursday evening, the outgoing head of the F.B.I.'s criminal investigative division, William M. Baker, praised the Central Intelligence Agency and other espionage services for what he called their unheralded work in the Pan Am inquiry.
Others said today that Mr. Baker was referring in part to a previously undisclosed intelligence operation last fall that produced a key element of the case: the diary of a Libyan agent containing references to the Pan Am plot.
That agent, Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, had previously served as a station manager for Libyan Arab Airlines in Malta. He returned there from Libya on Dec. 21, 1989, the day the bomb that destroyed the Pan Am jet was first planted in suitcase aboard an Air Malta feeder flight from that island.
Mr. Lamin's indictment charges that he used his access to the airport to steal luggage tags for Air Malta flights, one of which was placed on the suitcase that held the bomb.
That evidence came from Mr. Lamin's private diary. In an entry dated Dec. 15, 1988, a week before the bombing, he wrote, "Abdel Basset is coming from Zurich with Salvu," and added, "bring the taggs (sic) from the Airport." Abdel Basset is one of the two Libyan agents indicted in the case.

HEADLINE: To Jobless on Gary's Streets, Sense of Too Little Too Late

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GARY, Ind., Nov. 15

 BODY:
This city, haunted by long-silent steel mills and boarded-up stores, is a deep pocket of unemployment in a state where the overall level of joblessness is below the national average of 6.4 percent.
In Gary, the unemployment rate is at least 15 percent, officials say. Knots of out-of-work men, young and old, while away the days on street corners or in unemployment offices, hurt and disgust etched on their faces like scars. 
 Today one of those men, Jerry Rowell, 36 years old, laughed bitterly at the Federal Government plan to extend unemployment benefits for those who have been out of work for more than six months. It would provide as much as 20 weeks of extra payments to people in states with the highest unemployment rates, but only six weeks to states like Indiana, where joblessness is generally less severe.
 
'It's a Joke'
 Mr. Rowell has been out of work since the summer. His unemployment benefits will run out in January, and then he can apply for the extra six weeks. He is afraid and angry.
"Six weeks, that's nothing," he said. "These benefits don't pay any bills as it is. It's a joke. Six more weeks isn't going to take care of nothing, especially with a man with a family."
Mr. Rowell said he has a wife and two children. He was laid off last summer from a fast-food restaurant, a job he took after he lost his job of 10 years at an auto dealership.
His first job was in a steel mill when he was 19 years old. He lost that job three years later when the mills that built this city began to close.
The Senate tonight passed a separate bill that would increase the extra benefits to 13 weeks from 6 weeks for states in Indiana's category. But the House still must consider that measure.
 
$171 a Week in Aid
State officials said that in Indiana, the maximum amount a qualified unemployed person with three dependents like Mr. Rowell could receive was $171 a week.
Luvenia Felders, 42, said she would take any kind of job. She said she had been looking for work for a year and was barely surviving on the kindness of her family and friends.
Chuck Oliver, 51, lost his job as an assistant manager at a food company in October. He said it was unfair that the unemployed in Indiana were only entitled to a six-week extension while workers in other states were entitled to up to 20 weeks.
"All Americans should be treated the same," he said.
In a few hours at the state unemployment office in Gary today, a cross-section of Indiana life walked in and out, illustrating how widespread the economic slump here is. There were police officers, maids, construction workers and word processors.
"I still believe in that flag over there in the corner," said Stanley Smith, a 35-year-old veteran of the Navy who was laid off from a Veterans Administration hospital a few days ago. "But I'm not going to let my kids starve."

HEADLINE: Battle for Votes, and Emotions, as Louisiana Governor's Race Is Concluded

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Nov. 15

 BODY:
The brawl between Edwin W. Edwards and David Duke for Louisiana Governor staggered to a close today, and voters go to the polls on Saturday to decide a racially charged contest that has attracted national attention like few other races for governor in history.
The final day of a campaign that has defied many of the normal laws of politics was dominated by Mr. Duke's airing of 20-year-old accusations that Mr. Edwards sold state jobs to campaign contributors in his first term in 1971. 
 Political analysts said last-minute salvos, particularly concerning old issues, usually have little effect. But the strong emotions stirred by the campaign led some analysts to say that in an extremely tight race actions on the final day could help Mr. Duke.
 
Few Laments for Day's End
 Few voters will rue the campaign's end. The race between Mr. Edwards, a three-time Governor twice tried but never convicted on racketeering charges, and Mr. Duke, a state representative who is a longtime white supremacist and former Ku Klux Klan leader, has left the state polarized, dispirited and exhausted.
"The dynamics of this campaign are unlike anything I've ever lived through or even studied about, just the raw emotion of it," said Lawrence Powell, a history professor at Tulane University. "It's clearly the politics of unreason we're witnessing here."
Public opinion polls, in which statisticians have tried to adjust for the reluctance of voters to state their preference for Mr. Duke, show Mr. Edwards in the lead. But almost no analysts are willing to make a prediction about the race because of the difficulty of gauging Mr. Duke's support and because of the mixed emotions expressed by many voters Mr. Edwards needs.
The two candidates began the day by appearing one after the other on a local television show, fielding calls and appealing for votes.
Mr. Duke tried to deflect fears that his victory could bring economic ruin to Louisiana. Opponents and others have widely asserted that Mr. Duke's election would result in canceled conventions and a business boycott.
"If you're going to vote for your Governor by what outside liberals will say or do, then you might as well forget about having a governor's race and let them decide who our governor is," Mr. Duke said.
 
Using the Publicity
 Mr. Edwards said his first priority would be to capitalize on the national reaction to what he predicted would be Mr. Duke's defeat. "The first thing we're going to do is capitalize on the good publicity we're going to get after tomorrow when the rest of the nation finds out we are not dumb enough, racist enough or divisive enough to elect David Duke governor," he said.
The day's campaign news was dominated by Mr. Duke's unveiling of a last-minute television advertisement using excerpts from a 1983 report on "60 Minutes" in which Mr. Edwards was interviewed about accusations that campaign contributors were given state jobs after his first election in 1971. "Edwin Edwards said he would quit this campaign if we could prove he'd ever sold a position in state government," said an agitated Mr. Duke.
Mr. Edwards said that the "60 Minutes" interview, taken out of context, was not about selling jobs but that back then it was not uncommon for campaign contributors to expect to be considered for positions. He said it was not illegal at the time, and that he had helped to change the law to make such practices illegal.
CBS said today that the footage had been improperly used in the Duke campaign commercial and that it was taken out of context.
Some analysts said the accusations were so well known they would have little effect. But the accusations were used prominently on local television news programs, often with little indication they were old and well-aired. Ed Renwick, a Loyola University poll taker, said that in an extremely tight race it is possible they could affect the outcome.
Both candidates concluded the day by restating now-familiar themes.
At an American Legion hall in Metairie, Mr. Duke drew cheers from about 700 supporters rhythmically repeating his name when he vehemently criticized news coverage. "We said we're not going to be dictated to by outside forces," he said. He asserted later in his final campaign appearance, 'We are the cutting edge of the new conservative politics in America."
Mr. Edwards, after riding on a float topped by a papier-mache crown at Mardi Gras World, where floats are built and displayed, told a gathering of about 1,000 people, "We're going to tell the nation Louisiana is better than David Duke."
Apart from last-minute maneuvering, the outcome of the race is likely to depend on turnout and the battle for the supporters of Gov. Buddy Roemer, who finished third in last month's runoff. Secretary of State Fox McKeithen has estimated that between 72 percent and 75 percent of the state's more than 2.2 million voters will go to the polls, rivalling the highest turnouts in recent decades.

HEADLINE: R. M. Paiewonsky, 84, Virgin Islands Leader

 BODY:
Ralph M. Paiewonsky, who served eight years as Governor of the Virgin Islands in the 1960's, died Nov. 9, on his 84th birthday, at St. Thomas Hospital in St. Thomas, V.I.
Mr. Paiewonsky died of congestive heart failure, said his daughter, Joyce Adolfsen. 
 Born into one of the territory's most prominent families, Mr. Paiewonsky became successful in his own right as a leading businessman and as a politician with strong ties to the Democratic Party. President John F. Kennedy appointed him Governor of the territory in 1961, inaugurating a period of substantial growth in tourism and economic development.
His ties to Washington in the admininstrations of Presidents Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson helped win the island a far greater measure of autonomy. Mr. Paiewonsky led the successful efforts to provide fresh water and electrical power to homes throughout the island and to build low- and moderate-income housing for island residents.
Mr. Paiewonsky, who earned a bachelor's degree from New York University in 1930, was proudest of his role in founding the University of the Virgin Islands in 1962. The university library now bears his name.
In addition to his daughter, who lives in New York City, Mr. Paiewonsky is survived by his wife, Ethel, of St. Thomas; a son, Dr. Bernard Paiewonsky, of Bethesda, Md.; a brother, Isidor, and a sister, Paulina Puritze, and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Panel Orders A Settlement In Police Pact

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
A three-member arbitration panel handed down a binding decision last night under which New York City's 18,000-member police union will have to accept contact concessions to help pay for wage increases, city officials said.
The officials said the decision grants the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association a 4.5 percent wage increase for the last 15 months. But they said that it calls for no more city funds than the city had already allocated, which amounts to a 3 percent raise. The union would be required to make up the difference by agreeing to changes in work rules and the pension plan and by accepting lower salaries for new officers, high-ranking city officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said. 
 The 70-page report of the panel is likely to set the tone for negotiations with corrections officers, sanitation workers, firefighters and other police unions, known collectively as the uniformed services. The unions representing these workers have been awaiting the outcome of the arbitration -- which comes after 18 months of talks -- before going back to the table.
A P.B.A. spokesman, Dennis Sheehan, said last night that he had not yet seen the ruling and would not comment on it.
"This is big-ticket stuff," a city labor negotiator said. "It says to the unions that anything you want over and above what's available you have to fund yourself through productivity or through hard dollars."
Few details of the decision were available last night because both sides had agreed not to release it until the union delegates are allowed to review it this morning. A meeting of the delegates was scheduled for today.
James F. Hanley, the City Labor Commissioner, said he could not comment on the details of the pact because of the agreement with the union to wait until after their membership had read it. "It certainly looks fine to me," he said. "We're not unhappy."
Paradoxically, the 15-month contract that was awarded by the arbitrators yesterday covers a period that expired on Nov. 1, which means a new round of bargaining must begin immediately. The wage increases will be paid retroactively, officials said, but it was unclear last night exactly how the financing of the raises would be accomplished. .
Throughout the process, the police sought a raise comparable to the 5.5 percent raise Mayor David N. Dinkins granted the teachers in 1990. But the city, rocked by the recession, argued it could not afford that. Much of the teachers' raise was financed by changing calculations for its union's pension fund, allowing the city to reduce its contribution to the fund and use the money for raises instead.
Like other uniformed services, the police have historically won wage settlements higher than other municipal employees, so the arbitrators' decision bodes ill for the other uniformed unions' attempts to match the teachers' raise.
The settlement also strengthens Mayor Dinkins's hand in his negotiations over a five-year finanical plan the administration released last week.
A major element of the plan to close $7 billion in budget gaps over the five years depends on a pledge by the Mayor not to grant any wage increases through mid-1994 except to unions that agree to compensate for those raises by making their workers more productive.
Negotiations with the P.B.A., one of the city's most powerful unions, were thrown into arbitration after the union and city could not agree on a new settlement.
The union had contended that it deserved bigger raises to stay competitive with officers in Nassau County, who can earn nearly $10,000 more a year than officers in New York City. Keeping teachers' salaries competitive with the surrounding region was one of the Mayor's chief reasons for granting them raises last year.
Before the talks went to arbitration, the city had relatively little leverage over the police union, because the Mayor's ambitious anti-crime plan means that the city is continuing to hire thousands of officers while laying off other employees. As a result, the police had little incentive to make concessions.
In an unusual move in September, the Mayor testified at the final day of arbitration hearings, arguing that the city could not afford a raise greater than it had offered unless the union agreed to save money in other ways.

HEADLINE: Sports Authority Nurtures a $416 Million Plan

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK Nov. 15

 BODY:
The New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority plans to ask the state for $416 million and permission to use it to restructure its debt, to build the proposed Atlantic City Convention Center and to upgrade Rutgers University's football stadium.
The Authority wants the state to float bonds to pay for all this, according to authority officials who worked on the plan and who agreed to be interviewed on the condition they not be identified. The proposal is being circulated among members of the Florio administration and the Legislature to try to elicit support. 
 The debt restructuring, the officials said, is intended to take advantage of falling interest rates and to offset declining revenues at the Meadowlands Racetrack. The racetrack is the authority's chief source for retiring the bonds that financed construction of Giants Stadium and the Brendan Byrne Arena, as well as the track.
 
To Retire Bonds
 The plan calls for using $223 million to retire authority bonds that are being paid off at interest rates above 10 percent, replacing them with bonds that carry interest rates of about 7 percent. The move could save the authority an estimated $170 million over the long term, the officials said.
All but $25 million of the $193 million of borrowed funds left after the debt is restructured would be used to build the long-awaited convention center for Atlantic City, which is intended to help the resort town to compete more successfully for national conventions. It also could be the catalyst to attract private investment off the boardwalk, including new, casino-less hotels for the anticipated influx of visitors brought in by the increased convention business, according to authority officials.
The authority is prepared to argue that the convention center project will create 6,000 jobs, $10 million in tax revenues related to construction and $48 million in other taxes and that it will add about $195 million a year to the local economy.
The remaining $25 million of borrowed funds would be earmarked for Rutgers. Most of it would go for rebuilding the stadium, supporting the university's entry into the Big East Football Conference. The rebuilt stadium would have a total of 45,000 seats as well as new lights, a press box and concession areas. The university's track and soccer fields would also be relocated.
The officials said the sports authority, which manages the new aquarium in Camden and Monmouth Park racetrack in Oceanport in addition to the operations at the Meadowlands, is hoping to convince the state that the expansion into Atlantic City and the assistance planned for Rutgers are natural extensions of the authority's role as a statewide agency whose scope is not limited to its projects in northern New Jersey.

HEADLINE: Resolved: Subway Fares Will Rise. Debate Question Is, By How Much?

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
The fight over the transit fare has begun again, but this year the traditional and all-too-familiar sparring has two special twists that guarantee at least one thing for bus and subway riders: The fare will go up. The only question is by how much.
One difference in this year's negotiations is that the politicians who usually ride to the fare's rescue, and revel in that role, find themselves strapped and thus less able to help. 
 But something subtler is also working against any "save the fare" effort. For the first time in 20 years the fate of commuter-rail fares, which transit officials have promised to preserve, is not linked to the immediate future of the bus and subway fare in New York City.
That leaves suburban legislators with little motive to raise regional taxes -- an alternative to raising the fare or cutting service in the city. And that has left legislators from New York City boxed into arguing for another alternative -- that the city get a bigger share of the current state taxes that support mass transit.
 
Starting on New Year's Day
 These competing interests form the backdrop of the decision that will be made before Jan. 1, when the Transit Authority wants to raise the fare to $1.40 to balance its budget.
Though some increase in the fare is inevitable, the precise amount will ultimately be determined by a complex process that will unfold over the next five weeks and involve the Legislature, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mayor David N. Dinkins, the Transit Authority and its parent agency, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
In part they will be arguing about how to divide up the pie, and in part they will be maneuvering around one another to avoid blame for the increase, or maybe to grab a bit of credit if it is whittled down from the $1.40 asked by the Transit Authority.
Though the players have wrangled like this in the past, state lawmakers, the governor and the mayor were usually in a better position to answer the authority's call, often in the form of revenues from new taxes.
This time, however, the legislators and the Governor are constrained by the state's projected $700 million budget gap for 1991. They are well aware that their recession-weary constituents would have little stomach for another tax.
"It's not a good time for anybody to be looking to Albany for a bailout," says James A. Yates, legislative counsel to the Assembly Speaker, Mel Miller, who has long been a supporter of the city's transit interests.
 
First Offer Rarely the Last
 If the fare increase is reduced, the politicians say, it is the Transit Authority itself that will have to retreat from its claim that it cannot trim any more fat out of its $3.4 billion budget.
Despite its emphatic claims on Tuesday that its projected $263 million deficit for 1992 was firm and could only be bridged with a fare increase, the Transit Authority has provided ample precedent over the last decade that its first offer is certainly not its last; fare requests that were at first perceived to be exorbitant have been repeatedly pared down by the agency.
Other than proposing a new tax, which is unlikely, the Legislature has only one viable option to offer the authority. That would be to reconfigure the way several transportation subsidies are allocated to upstate and suburban mass-transit agencies.
Tinkering with subsidy formulas may appeal to the Assembly, which is controlled by Democrats who represent the city. But such measures would also have to pass through the Republican-dominated Senate, where many Senators are firmly opposed to taking money from the suburban commuter lines -- like Metro-North and the Long Island Rail Road -- to pay for the city's subways.
In the past, the gap between the city Democrats and the suburban Republicans on this issue has been bridged by overlapping interests: The Transit Authority, Metro-North and the Long Island Rail Road have traditionally sought fare increases at the same time. But this year, for the first time since 1970, the Transit Authority stands alone.
 
Suburbs Are Off the Hook
 The suburban lines had been preparing for fare increases that would have averaged 8 percent, but M.T.A. officials, somewhat under pressure from Mr. Levy, announced last month that the increases would not be necessary because new ways had been found to close the railroad deficits projected for next year. The railroads' combined $36 million deficit for 1992, which pales in comparison to the Transit Authority's gap, will be plugged by refinancing bonds and making administrative cuts, the M.T.A. has said. (Connecticut officials, and not those at the M.T.A., set the fares on that state's portion of the New Haven line.)
Alan F. Kiepper, the Transit Authority president, said on Tuesday that he could not possibly reduce the agency's 1992 deficit below $263 million without sacrificing service or safety. But as recently as this summer, the agency had projected a 1992 deficit as high as $460 million.
Some politicians, including Mayor Dinkins and Governor Cuomo, have urged the agency to dig deeper; the Mayor opposes the fare increase, while the Governor has said through his aides that he will not support it. Neither has said much more.
What remains to be seen is how much a fare increase of any denomination will be blamed on Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Dinkins, who have named a majority of the M.T.A. board members. The board will vote on an increase on Dec. 20.
The Straphangers Campaign, a riders' advocacy group, intends to shower the subways with leaflets bearing the Mayor's and the Governor's phone numbers in order to link the two to the fare increase. The organization is also urging subway and bus riders to express their views at the five open hearings that the M.T.A. board will hold in the next four weeks.
"People, fairly or unfairly, will hold the Mayor or the Governor -- the big cheeses -- responsible for what they pay to go to and from work or school," said Gene Russianoff, the counsel to the Straphangers Campaign. "These are politicians. They're used to being in difficult places and getting out of them."
 
 
 
THE PLAYERS

 
Deciding the Fare Increrase
 
Who will determine how much the subway and bus fare will go up on Jan. 1
 
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo
 The Governor has said through a spokeswoman that he does not support raising the fare to $1.40. He has pressed the Transit Authority to further pare its budget deficit without sacrificing service. It seems unlikely, in light of the state's own $700 million budget gap, that he would propose legislation creating new revenues for the authority. The Governor nominated Peter Stangl, the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and 5 of the 16 other M.T.A. board members. They will ultimately have the final say on an increase.
 
State Senator Norman J. Levy
 Mr. Levy, a Republican from Merrick, L.I., is chairman of the powerful Senate Transportation Committee. A vigorous advocate for suburban interests, he is likely to be the main obstacle to any Democratic proposals to reduce the amount of a fare increase by shifting subsidies from the Long Island Rail Roard and Metro-North to the Transit Authority.
 
Assemblyman Jerrold Nadler
 A Democrat from Manhattan, Mr. Nadler is considered Mr. Levy's counterpart in the Assembly. He is the chairman of the Committee on Corporations, Authorities and Commissions and is adamantly opposed to a fare increase. A vocal supporter of New York City's transit interests, Mr. Nadler has urged the Legislature to shift the allocation of some transportation subsidies from the upstate communities and the suburbs to New York City. Such plans might fly in the Assembly, which is controlled by the Democrats, but would likely run into heavy opposition in the Senate, which is controlled by the Republicans.
 
State Senator Ralph J. Marino
 Mr. Marino, a Republican from Oyster Bay, L.I., is the majority leader of the Senate. Like Mr. Levy, with whom he will no doubt work closely on this issue, Mr. Marino is a champion of suburban interests.
 
Assemblyman Mel Miller
 Along with the Governor and Mr. Marino, Mr. Miller, the speaker of the Assembly, completes the triad of power in Albany. A Democrat from Brooklyn, Mr. Miller has traditionally supported New York City's transit interests. He has been somewhat distracted by the fraud trial in which he is a defendant in Federal District Court in Brooklyn.
 
Mayor David N. Dinkins
 The Mayor has said through his aides that he opposes the $1.40 fare. He has instructed his appointees to the M.T.A. board to lean on the authority to find alternatives to the increase, either by cutting costs or pressing the Legislature for additional revenue.
 
Peter Stangl
 The chairman of the M.T.A. has supported the Transit Authority's contention that the fare must be raised to $1.40 unless help arrives from Albany. He has also threatened that the fare could go even higher unless Albany acts soon on the M.T.A.'s five-year, $10.6 billion construction and improvement plan.
 
Alan F. Kiepper
 The Transit Authority president first proposed the $1.40 fare on Tuesday, when he submitted the authority's budget to the M.T.A. Though he has whittled the Transit Authority's estimate of its 1992 deficit from $460 million to $263 million in recent weeks, he has said the agency can cut nothing more from the budget without jeaopardizing safety or service. Only Albany, he has said, can avert the fare hike.
 
The M.T.A. board
 The 17 members of the board will vote on the fare hike at a meeting on Dec. 20. Because four of the upstate members share one vote, only 14 votes will be cast in all. Besides the six board members named by the Governor, four are named by the Mayor and seven are named by county executives.

HEADLINE: Rising Fraud Worrying Car Insurers . . .

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
Auto-insurance fraud is big business. The insurance industry estimates that at least 10 percent of the claims each year are fraudulent.
"Sixty billion dollars last year went for auto insurance claims," said Sean Mooney, chief economist of the Insurance Information Institute, which is supported by the property-casualty insurance industry. "So the total savings would be about $6 billion." 
 The losses from fraud, of course, can only be estimated because, as insurers point out, if they could identify all fraudulent claims, they simply would not pay them. But consumer advocates say the insurers bring some fraud on themselves. As Ralph Nader put it, "The more people think they're being ripped off, the more they try to fight back."
 
Count the Reasons
 Whatever the reasons -- greed, higher premiums, the recession or even perceptions of abuse by insurance companies -- there is little doubt that auto insurance fraud is a major problem in the United States. The schemes range from preplanned auto accidents to unnecessary medical treatment.
"It's a growing problem because of the increasing value of automobiles, and it impacts on each and every one of us," said Jim Long, insurance commissioner of North Carolina. Mr. Long is president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which wants insurance fraud made a Federal crime.
 
All Kinds of Suspects
 Deputy Inspector Ronald G. Thrash, commanding officer of the auto crime division of the New York Police Department, said: "We estimate that about 25 percent of all cars reported stolen in New York City are insurance fraud. We arrest grandmothers, we arrest schoolteachers."
Insurance experts say that although auto theft show no signs of decline, fraud is most apparent in the sharp increase in claims for bodily injuries received in car accidents. Insurers believe that an inordinately large percentage of these medical claims are fraudulent.
"The ratio of bodily injury claims to property damage claims has increased about 50 percent over the last 10 years," said James F. Perry, a vice president of the State Farm Insurance. "That has occurred at a time when automobiles have become safer, and there should be fewer bodily injury accidents."
To many in the insurance business, this increase is evidence of fraudulent intent. "It seems to be very clear that there is a change in claimant behavior," said Donald W. Segraves, executive director of the Insurance Research Council, a nonprofit organization established by insurance companies. "It's the difference between looking at an accident as an opportunity to get back some of the premiums you've paid versus the good of policyholders as a group."
 
Popular Acceptance of Fraud
 Just last week, the council released a survey of public attitudes showing that more than one in five adults thinks it is all right to pad an auto insurance claim to avoid paying a deductible. And 14 percent said it was acceptable to value a stolen car at more than its worth to get more money from an insurance company.
"We don't know how many accidents happen out there that are illegitimate," said Arnold Schlossberg Jr., director of the Insurance Crime Prevention Institute, an industry organization that investigages complex fraud cases. "But it's a growth industry, no question about it."
Auto-insurance fraud includes these major categories:
*Staged Claims: Parts of a car are removed, stored and reported stolen. After the insurance is paid, the parts are put back in the car.
*Owner Dumping: A car is reported stolen. The owner collects a claim payment from an insurance company, while the car's parts are sold to salvage yards and auto shops.
*Abandoned Vehicles: A car is abandoned on a road or in a parking lot in the hope that it will be stolen or destroyed. Then the owner reports it stolen to the police and the insurance company to collect under the policy.
*Salvage Switches: The vehicle identification number tag, on dashboards in newer cars, is taken from a junked car and switched to a similar make and model that an owner has fraudulently reported as stolen. With the false number, this car is then re-registered and sold, often in a different state or country.
*Staged Auto Accidents: So-called crashers stage an accident. A doctor and a lawyer working with the owner of the car falsify a claim.
How do insurers deal with all this? "We have a special investigative unit that looks for certain red flags," said Gary S. Turner, material damage claim manager for Kemper National Insurance Companies. These fraud indicators include: a close relation between the date coverage was provided and the date of claim; the insurance premium paid in cash; no theft report to the police, and the absence of any sales invoice.
Consumer groups look at this situation through a somewhat different lens. They accuse insurers of passively accepting some fraudulent behavior because the cost is eventually borne by their policyholders.
"The insurance companies really haven't fought insurance fraud too hard because there is a pass-through mechanism," said J. Robert Hunter, president of the National Insurance Consumer Organization.
Harvey Rosenfeld, chairman of Voter Revolt, a consumer group in California, said, "Anything the industry says is a severe problem ends up being the consumer's problem."
 
 
 
STAYING OUT OF FRAUD'S WAY
 What can the consumer do to avoid innocent involvement in insurance fraud? Here is what the experts advise.
Refuse to buy a vehicle or accessory, like a radio, from an unknown party.
If you are buying a used car, make certain the title is in the name of the seller.
Be wary of auto parts offered at prices that are too good to be true.
Inform the police, your state insurance department and your insurer if you suspect a fraudulent transaction.

HEADLINE: The Trail From Lockerbie

 BODY:
American and Scottish authorities have now provided a breathtaking account of their investigation of the destruction of Pan Am flight 103, which killed 270 people just before Christmas three years ago. Their work makes an exciting story. It's also a challenge to nations to complete the task of doing international justice.
From the village of Lockerbie, where 11 people were killed, detectives fanned out in a dogged search for evidence that was blown clear across Scotland to the North Sea. They ingeniously pieced it together and then followed microscopic leads to their two suspects, Libyan intelligence officers now accused by both countries of mass murder. 
 That remarkable achievement raises profound questions. The indictment portrays the suspects, Lamen Khalifa Fhimah and Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi, as merely the front-line agents of state-sponsored terrorism, which sets up another confrontation with Libya and its leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. How should the United States and the United Kingdom proceed?
The clear answer is: aggressively, but judiciously. Washington has accused Tripoli of sponsoring this terrorism and Tripoli has denied it. Each is talking not to the other but to the world, all well in advance of even a formal request to deliver the suspects for trial. American spokesmen talk of keeping "all options open" while the Scottish prosecutor observes that the suspects aren't likely to be arrested "in the normal way." President Bush's Attorney General-designate, William Barr, is best known for a memorandum defending the legality of trying suspects snatched from other nations without their governments' consent.
But Mr. Barr's memorandum deals with legal power, not the wisdom and statesmanship that must guide global law enforcement. There are various options. Diplomatic and economic pressure, including trade embargoes, are the obvious first choices to be exhausted long before considering venturesome sorties to kidnap fugitives.
Some relatives of Lockerbie's victims are puzzled that Syria and Iran, once prime suspects, are no longer implicated. They suspect that President Bush, seeking help in his quest for Mideast peace, finds it convenient to declare that Syria has suffered "a bad rap." But the incredibly detailed trail of evidence, and Scotland's full participation in the inquiry, are the best assurances that there has been no diplomatic fix.
Still, it would seem fitting to look to Syria and Iran, along with many other nations, for help in pressing Libya both to satisfy justice and renounce terrorism. If world leaders can match the determination and ingenuity of Scottish detectives and American F.B.I. agents, there's hope for a just and satisfying sequel to the tragedy at Lockerbie.

HEADLINE: Regulators' Lawyers: A Growth Industry/A special report.;
U.S. Said to Squander Millions For Legal Work on the Bailout

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Two studies commissioned by the Government say the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, now the world's largest employer of private lawyers, has been wasting a significant portion of its outside legal expenses, which are expected to reach $700 million this year.
The studies found, among other things, that the F.D.I.C. and its affiliated agency, the Resolution Trust Corporation, failed to use competitive bidding or to negotiate steep-enough discounts or fixed fees when hiring lawyers, even though many lawyers are eager for the work.
<
 
Question of Whom to Hire
 The lawyers were hired to help the Government clean up the problems caused by the failure of banks and savings and loan institutions. Once on the job, lawyers earning $100 an hour or more were allowed to perform routine work, like reviewing bills, that could have been done by clerks, the studies say. The reports did not name specific law firms in these instances. 
 At the same time, a survey of Government records and numerous interviews show that the two regulatory agencies quietly adopted a policy allowing them to hire legal, accounting and security firms that have been accused in lawsuits of contributing to the collapse of banks or savings and loan institutions. The Government inherited many of these suits from institutions it took over and is now opposing in court the very firms it is hiring.
Among those facing such suits and now benefiting from the new policy are top accounting firms, including Coopers & Lybrand; Ernst & Young; Laventhol & Horwath; Grant Thornton and Cherry, Bekaert & Holland, and also such securities firms as Kidder, Peabody & Company, Prudential Securities, the First Boston Corporation and Shearson Lehman.
Concerned about the extraordinary growth in legal services and how it is being handled, members of the House Subcommittee on Commerce, Consumer and Monetary Affairs are holding a hearing next week to examine the two private studies that showed wasteful spending on lawyers. The first was done by a Philadelphia management consulting firm in February; the other by the accounting firm Price Waterhouse late this summer. Both came to similar conclusions.
In a written response to the Price Waterhouse report, Alfred J. T. Byrne, the F.D.I.C.'s general counsel, said, "Much of the report is both instructive and constructive." But in the same document, which was sent to Robert D. Hoffman, the F.D.I.C. inspector general who commissioned the report, Mr. Byrne asserted that the study failed to give the legal division sufficient credit for recent reforms.
Mr. Byrne also said the firm's report had not noted how difficult it has been to make changes while trying to accommodate a rapidly increasing caseload.
In an interview, Mr. Byrne said he had placed limits on how much any single law firm could be paid, starting at $2.5 million a year and subject to some exceptions. In addition, he said the use of more than 1,675 law firms spread the wealth and helped set up elements of competition. He also said the collections and recoveries by private lawyers far exceeded their pay.
Even with that, the regulators are expected to pay another $700 million for outside legal services next year, not including hundreds of millions of dollars for in-house work and outside lawyers working for other divisions.
Before he retired as chairman last month, L. William Seidman acknowledged, "We've got a lot more work to do in managing our legal things."
 
The Problem
The F.D.I.C. Faces A Herculean Task
 The ground for this rush to hire lawyers was laid in the late 1980's, when scores of banks and savings and loans failed because they had taken on too many risky real estate loans.
As part of the huge Federal bailout of the savings industry, approved by Congress in 1989, the Government became the nation's largest owner of residential and commercial real estate. A new agency, the Resolution Trust Corporation, was formed to manage and dispose of the property.
The Trust Corporation, scheduled to go out of existence in 1996, is also selling hundreds of billions of dollars of other investments it inherited from failed institutions. These range from blue-chip stocks to high-yield, high-risk junk bonds.
To manage this giant liquidation, the Trust Corporation has borrowed thousands of employees from the deposit insurance agency, which itself is growing rapidly to deal with the large number of failed banks. Both agencies have contracted with tens of thousands of accountants, property managers, investment bankers and lawyers.
The more efficiently the Government handles the disposition of seized properties and loans inherited from the failed institutions -- by selling the assets and collecting the debts -- the less the bailout will cost taxpayers. As it is, the savings and loan rescue is expected to cost the Government $200 billion, not including interest expenses.
Investigations by Congress and the agencies themselves have already found contractor abuses, and there is widespread concern that inadequate monitoring could lead to significant additional waste or fraud.
Earlier this year, the Trust Corporation hired the Pentagon's top contract fraud investigator, Howard W. Cox, as assistant director for contractor oversight and surveillance. The budget of the inspector general of the F.D.I.C., the agency's internal watchdog, has more than tripled in the last five years.
 
The Legal Bill
Soaring Costs Attract Attention
 No division of the F.D.I.C. has grown faster or attracted more attention than the legal division.
"Given the magnitude of expenditures involved and the public demand for accountability, the legal division faces unprecedented public scrutiny into its use, selection and management of outside counsel," Mr. Hoffman wrote the F.D.I.C.'s directors on Sept. 30, in reaction to the Price Waterhouse report.
The chairman of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Consumer and Monetary Affairs, Representative Doug Barnard Jr., Democrat of Georgia, says much of its hearing next week will focus on Mr. Hoffman's work with Price Waterhouse, which he calls the "first comprehensive and thorough analysis of these issues."
The panel plans to address many of its questions to the head of the F.D.I.C. general counsel, Mr. Byrne, who until June 1990 was a partner in the Philadelphia law firm of Dechert Price & Rhoads.
Public records show the agency's outside legal expenses soared to $615 million in 1990 from $92 million in 1989.
Mr. Hoffman said in an interview that he had ordered more audits of office legal expenses, and he has recommended tighter billing procedures, including requiring written approval before outside firms undertake significant tasks.
In one case Mr. Hoffman says his auditors questioned the payment of $200,000 in research costs to a law firm, Hopkins & Sutter -- a Chicago firm that was the agency's largest contractor last year, with billings of $17.5 million. The criticism, he added, was not of the firm's work but rather that the agency had permitted the firm to take on the research without written authorization.
 
Money Wasted
Lawyers Doing Clerical Work
 Mr. Hoffman's summary of the Price Waterhouse report does not identify any individual law firms or give estimates of the amount of money wasted. But according to Mr. Hoffman's Sept. 30 memo, the findings include these:
*"A large proportion of the work involves relatively straightforward transactional work," but because of managerial weaknesses, "attorneys spend significant amounts of time performing tasks that do not require a lawyer's skills, an arrangement which is expensive, inefficient, and can undermine morale."
*"Outside counsel are generally not selected on a competitive basis," placing the division "at risk of potential and perceived abuses in their contracting activities."
*The F.D.I.C. "generally pays hourly rates," instead of fixed-price bills, "which could result in excessive fees."
*The legal division has no policies to insure that the firm selected is best able to perform the tasks, so "work is not cost-effectively assigned to outside counsel."
In his reply, Mr. Byrne noted that there had been an occasional "mismatch of staff to workload," meaning that lawyers were used for jobs that could have been done by clerks. He said he hoped to correct this imbalance. His memo to Mr. Hoffman also cites recent cost-cutting efforts and concludes, "Our actual outside counsel costs for the first nine months of this year are running 20 percent below budget."
Several of Price Waterhouse's recommendations and criticism were also offered by a Philadelphia management consulting firm, Altman & Weil, that was hired by the F.D.I.C to conduct a similar study early this year.
This report said the agency was doing as well as could be expected but needed to take advantage of the buyer's market where "firms are screaming for the F.D.I.C.'s legal work." It also recommended greater use of discounts, fixed fees, and in-house counsel and suggested that Government lawyers rather than private lawyers be asked to prepare the budgets for legal work.
"Outside lawyers will sometimes low ball the original fee budget," the report said, "insuring that they receive the work, and then they will seek to exceed the original estimate.'
 
Hiring Standards
Potential Profit From Mistakes
<
When it set the hiring standards for the contractors, the Resolution Trust Corporation wrote in a regulation that "persons whose activities contributed to the decline of the thrift industry" would "play no role in contracting with the R.T.C." This was in response to a clear concern that Congress had raised when it passed the savings and loan rescue.
The F.D.I.C. and the Resolution Trust Corporation hope to recover billions of dollars from hundreds of lawyers, accountants and investment bankers by suing them for negligence. Many experts believe that lapses in professional responsibility by these people were a principal cause of the savings and loan disaster.
Before the hiring rules were formally issued last year, many professionals told the Trust Corporation they were too strict.
The final rules said anyone who caused a loss of more than $50,000 to a Federal insurance fund would be barred from doing business with the Trust Corporation. In addition, no contractor sued by the Federal agencies could get Government contracts, unless a special contractors' committee granted a waiver.
Then in March 1990, one month after their adoption, the regulations were modified with little public announcement. According to an internal memo to both the F.D.I.C. and Trust Corporation boards by the head of the special contractors' committee, both approved what "appears to be a blanket waiver."
With the change, firms accused of negligence could establish certain screening procedures so that people who were involved in the firm's work that is now the subject of Federal litigation could not work on agency business. Meanwhile, the firm as a whole would be eligible to win Federal contracts.
With that, accountants and lawyers accused of helping to draw the nation into the banking crisis stand to profit from the rescue. Even if these people do not work on the Trust Corporation cases directly, in many cases they can share in their firm's profits from this work.
This policy change was intended to increase competition, but the public documents describing it were not released to the Trust Corporation reading room until 15 months after it took effect. By then dozens of firms had applied for and been granted waivers, but for seven months the Trust Corporation refused to release the names of these firms.
One of the first waivers, to Coopers & Lybrand, precludes professional employees previously involved in advising the Silverado Savings Association in Denver from working on any new contract. This savings and loan collapsed in 1988, and the recovery will cost the Government $1 billion.
Coopers & Lybrand was the institution's auditor and has agreed to pay $20 million to settle any Government claims over its accounting work for Silverado. Critics of the waiver policy note that by simply limiting the ability of a few individuals to work for the Government, these people can still share in the firm's profits derived from cleaning up a problem they may have helped to create.
Abraham J. Briloff, a professor emeritus of accounting at the City Univerity of New York who has often testified before Congress, is one of the critics. In an interview he said accountants were eager to take on Trust Corporation work, so the agency had no need to hire those who are being sued. The agency, he added, should make "the firms as a whole responsible" for past mistakes by limiting an entire firm's work for the Government, not just the work of a few individuals.
But James Barth, a professor of finance at Auburn University and the former chief economist of the Government's savings and loan regulatory agency, contended that allowing what he called rehabilitated firms to compete for Trust Corporation work produced lower costs. That, he said, outweighed what he called the moral outrage of letting firms that helped cause the problem benefit from its cleanup.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about regulators' legal expenses linked to bank and savings-and-loan failures listed one firm erroneously among those still facing Government lawsuits. A suit against the First Boston Corporation was settled in July, in the firm's favor.

HEADLINE: Investors Rush to Buy Treasury Securities

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Investors fleeing the stock market piled money into Treasury bills and notes yesterday, and short-term interest rates fell sharply.
 In addition to the stunning 120.31-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average -- a plunge that analysts said was at least partly a reaction to attempts in Congress to cap credit card interest rates -- credit market participants received another batch of economic reports that did nothing to dispel the notion that the economy, after a summer upturn, is sliding again. 
The reports included data from the Federal Reserve showing that industrial production was flat in October, continuing a trend in place since July, and from the Commerce Department showing that business inventories rose in September for the first time since January. The report on factory output had been expected, but the inventory buildup was a worrisome surprise. [Page 34.]
 Given recent poor retail sales numbers, analysts said the inventory buildup was probably involuntary. If it continues, further job layoffs could be coming, they said.
 Preliminary results of the University of Michigan's monthly survey of consumer attitudes, released to subscribers yesterday, reinforced the sense that conditions are worsening.
 Through the first two weeks of November, the survey showed that both confidence and expectations about the future had slipped sharply from their October levels.
 Bond traders, who normally dote on bad economic reports, did not respond to the day's developments by buying long-term securities.
 "Bond yields can't seem to get through the 7.80 level," said Robert Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bank.
 Concern about how much inflation might be generated by the steady decline in short-term interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve is one reason that bond yields remain sickly, Mr. Chandross said. Another is that bond traders remain fearful that policy makers will at some point concoct a package to rescue the economy that will further inflate the Federal budget deficit.
 By late yesterday, the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 102 1/8, down 1/32, to yield 7.81 percent, unchanged from late Thursday, but down from 7.87 percent last Friday.
 The plunge in equity prices sent investors scurrying into the secondary market for Treasury notes and bills.
 In late trading, the 6 7/8 percent five-year notes were offered at 101 14/32, up 10/32, to yield 6.52 percent. And prices for the 6 percent two-year notes rose by 6/32, to a late offered price of 100 30/32, to yield 5.48 percent.
 Short-term Treasury bill rates fell sharply.
 Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 4.55 percent late yesterday, down 6 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by 9 basis points, to a late offered rate of 4.58 percent. And one-year bills were offered at a discount rate of 4.59 percent, down 11 basis points.

HEADLINE: New Hampshire Heeds Stern Tsongas Message

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NASHUA, N.H., Nov. 15

 BODY:
Paul E. Tsongas has a vision of America's future. It looks a lot like a snake wrapped around a pole.
 In fact, it is a sine curve tilted on its side, which, Mr. Tsongas explains, represents the economy and its periodic business cycles. A line sloping downward shows what will happen to the American standard of living as the recessions grow deeper and the recoveries less lofty. 
The vision is not exactly the stuff that rousing campaign speeches are made of. But then, the former Senator, who back in April became the first Democrat to enter the Presidential race, is not a rousing campaign speaker. And he would be the first one to admit it.
 "Stop me," he told a group of voters peering at his picture of the future the other night, "if you're getting too depressed."
 
Fodder for Comedians
 Four years after the Democratic Party watched its last Presidential candidate, Michael S. Dukakis, sink under the weight of his own solemnity, Mr. Tsongas and his serious style seem to many to have been sent over from the Republican National Committee. Add to his gravity the fact that he, like Mr. Dukakis, is of Greek descent and from Massachusetts, and his candidacy becomes obvious fodder for comedy routines.
 "It does lend itself to Jay Leno," Mr. Tsongas acknowledges.
 But at least here in New Hampshire, Mr. Tsongas's campaign is regarded as no joke. Two recent polls show him to be leading the five other declared candidates in the New Hampshire Democratic primary, a crucial early testing ground. While Mr. Tsongas's lead tends to be discounted because he lives right across the border in Lowell, Mass., and because he was already well-known here from his Senate days, he is now regarded as the candidate to beat on Feb. 18.
 If anything sets Mr. Tsongas apart from his rivals in New Hampshire, all of whom are desperately trying to distinguish themselves from the pack, it is his unconventional political style, which seems more suited to the lecture circuit than to the stump. There is no soaring oratory, no catchy phrase, no impassioned plea for support. Instead, there are graphs and charts full of statistics aboutfalling American wages and productivity. There are long disquisitions on the dangers of not investing enough in research and development.
 
Wit to the Rescue
 And then there are jokes, delivered with a dry wit that helps Mr. Tsongas overcome some of the inevitable comparisons to Mr. Dukakis. "I think we ought to win this election and see what it feels like," he says of the Democrats. "Then if we don't like it, we can go back to what we were doing before."
 To solve the country's ills, he advocates a national economic plan that emphasizes manufacturing. But he does not want voters to take his word on the plan. He wants them to read the 85-page booklet he has written on the topic, "Call to Economic Arms."
 "George Bush said 'Read my lips,' " said William Lipchitz, a longtime friend of Mr. Tsongas who has been working in the campaign. "Paul says, 'Read my book.' "
 New Hampshire voters who take the time to listen to the 50-year-old Mr. Tsongas and to examine his booklet generally seem impressed by his carefully thought-out approach and detailed views. How many other Presidential candidates, after all, have already taken a position on demand-side management for utilities? (See page 49 of his book.)
 But even those who admire Mr. Tsongas's comprehensive positions can't help wondering, it seems, how he can make it in Presidential politics, where the base line of bravado is so high. "You've got a lot of great ideas," Steve Gordon, a student from Nashua, said to Mr. Tsongas at a forum here the other day. "But there's not a whole lot of charisma. How do you plan to get your issues across and really excite people?"
 Mr. Tsongas's answer is simple. After years of recession, he says, Americans are finally ready to listen to the sober message that he is preaching. And he points to the very fact that his campaign has lasted this long as evidence that he must be right.
 "There's no other explanation for the fact that we've survived," he said.
 By now, surviving against all reasonable expectations has become a rather familiar trick for Mr. Tsongas. In 1974, he ran for Congress from his hometown of Lowell, in a district that had never elected a Democrat Representative. He won handily. In 1978, he decided to challenge one of Massachusetts incumbent Senators, Edward Brooke. Dismissed as a sure loser, he won once again.
 Then, in 1984, Mr. Tsongas announced that he was leaving politics. His doctors had told him that he had cancer of the lymph system, and they said he would not live out the decade. He returned to a private law practice to spend his remaining years with his wife, Niki, and their three daughters.
Two years later, with the cancer spreading aggressively, Mr. Tsongas decided to undergo an experimental bone marrow transplant. His doctors now say there isno reason to believe he will not live a normal life span.
 Always something of an iconoclast -- he calls himself a "pro-business" liberal -- Mr. Tsongas has become even more heterodox since his illness, criticizing Democrats as well as Republicans for what he calls their "dogma."
 "It's almost like I have an obligation not to be just another politician," he said in an interview.
 When Mr. Tsongas entered the campaign seven months ago, President Bush, still basking in the afterglow of the war in the Persian Gulf, seemed unbeatable. Now the President seems more vulnerable, and the Democrats are at least registering on the charts. Mr. Tsongas says that anyone like him who has spent time outside the capital is not surprised by this development.
 "You go to any board of any technology company and you're talking about people who are terrified," he said.
 
Cuomo as Question Mark
 Of course, with Mr. Bush's increasing vulnerability has come increased competition for the Democratic nomination, including, perhaps, a late entry from New York. Polls suggest that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo would immediately become the front-runner in New Hampshire if he entered the race.
 Instead of resenting the competition, though, Mr. Tsongas says he welcomes it. "My view is that if you have the best possible field, then whoever comes out as the victor will have the best possible chance against George Bush," he said.
 In the competition for all-important campaign money, Mr. Tsongas has fared better than his rivals simply because he has been out there hustling longer. The latest election filing on Sept. 30 shows him leading the Democrats with $800,000 in receipts. But this edge is expected to vanish quickly as his better-known rivals devote themselves full-time to raising money.
 Unlike most candidates, who seem consumed by the anxieties of a Presidential race, Mr. Tsongas genuinely seems to be enjoying his laid back, long-shot campaign. Indeed, the only unpleasant surprise of the campaign, he said, was discovering just how traumatized Greek-Americans had been by 1988, and how reluctant they were to invest in another dispassionate Democrat from Massachusetts.
 "They're still at the funeral," he said, "and I'm trying to get them into jogging suits."

 BODY:
ONLY A FEW MONTHS AGO, Brooke Astor's cheerful expression would tighten when she was asked about her age. Now, she boasts, she knows just how she wants to mark her 90th birthday next spring. The nation's mayors have planned a demonstration in Washington, "and I'm planning to march to protest Federal budget cuts to New York," she says.
Mrs. Astor also knows what she does not want to do. City officials had proposed selling tickets to a birthday party at Grand Central Terminal. "Though the proceeds would be spent on renovating this magnificent structure," she says, "I just can't imagine celebrating my 90th birthday in a place that recently ejected the homeless." 
 Brooke Russell Astor is nothing if not a woman of firm ideas. Elegant but impish, boundlessly energetic, bursting with curiosity, she has been an anchor of New York society and philanthropy ever since Vincent Astor, her third and by far her wealthiest husband died in 1959, leaving her $2 million outright, about $65 million of investments, and most important, control of his personal foundation, whose $67 million in assets were to be used "for the alleviation of human misery."
Since then, the Vincent Astor Foundation has donated more than $170 million largely to New York-based institutions. Her determination to spend all of her fortune before she dies in the city where it was made has transformed her into New York's unofficial First Lady, a title she obviously relishes.
But as she approaches 90, Brooke Astor is deeply troubled about the city whose vitality she has nourished and reflects. "When I came to this city, men used to walk down Fifth Avenue in top hats," she reminisces in her youthful, melodic voice, while sharing iced tea and sandwiches at her foundation's modest headquarters on the Upper East Side. "Now when I go down the F.D.R. Drive along the East River, my heart just sinks. I see all these burned-out buildings and neighborhoods. I see the young men on drugs hanging around the streets without jobs and without hope. I see a city torn apart by racial hatred. And I think: there's not enough private money in all of New York to solve these problems."
IT IS A NEW YORK TRADITION TO bolster this unruly and demanding city with private money. Many of what Mrs. Astor calls the city's "crown jewels" -- the New York Public Library, to which her foundation has given almost $20 million and with which she has been most closely associated, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Metropolitan Opera and the other great cultural institutions -- were created by philanthropy and have largely been sustained by it.
But although giving and volunteerism are thriving -- last year, despite the recession, Americans donated a record $122.57 billion -- the city's needs are soaring. New York is reeling not only from the Reagan and Bush Administrations' severe cutbacks on social programs and subsidies, but also from social problems associated with the steady erosion of its economic base and the harsh impact of the recession.
Less than 50 years ago, when New York was the world's greatest manufacturing center and one of its busiest ports, immigrants and the needy could turn to a great range of support structures -- unions and political associations, community and church-sponsored settlement houses and youth clubs. But as manufacturing and commerce have left the city, this safety net has frayed, leaving enormous gaps that the city and state are in no position to patch.
This has generated intense debate within foundations over how their money should be spent, and specifically, whether giving should be redirected to the programs and services the government has abandoned. "On one hand, a consensus is emerging that private philanthropists cannot, and should not, be expected to substitute for the government," says Brian O'Connell, president of the Independent Sector, an umbrella group of philanthropic and volunteer organizations. "On the other hand, donors are shifting priorities and doing everything possible to meet the excruciating needs."
The new needs are also fueling an intergenerational tug-of-war. "Many younger philanthropists, in particular, favor redirecting funds to the environment, AIDS, feminist and minority programs, and neighborhood-based groups that benefit mainly the poor in their own communities, away from the middle-class constituents of the great cultural institutions and hospitals that their parents and predecessors favored," says William D. Zabel, a lawyer who specializes in structuring family foundations.
The Astor Foundation was never among the largest in the United States. Today it ranks 607 on the list of the nation's 1,000 largest foundations, according to the Foundation Center, a New York-based clearing house. It distributed about $12 million in 1983, its peak for giving. With only $23.8 million in assets left, it gives away just about $1 million a year. By comparison, the New York Community Trust, a collection of charitable funds created in 1924, gave away $56 million last year. And the Aaron Diamond Foundation, named for the real-estate developer, who died in 1984, gave away about $20 million, mostly to benefit the city's poor and minorities.
But in its philosophy, the Astor Foundation has become a model for contemporary urban philanthropy. From the outset, Mrs. Astor's foundation supported both the institutions that make New York a cultural mecca and the neighborhood and community-based development projects to which other charities are now turning their attention.
In 1961, for example, the Astor Foundation gave $1.25 million, its largest grant that year, to the United Neighborhood Houses to support pre-teen-age programs at settlement houses, which few charities then supported. Subsequently, the foundation has given $17 million to youth programs. In Harlem this year, the foundation is spending $500,000 to renovate the porches of once-elegant town houses on Astor Row.
And unlike the Community Trust, the Astor Foundation bears Mrs. Astor's personal imprimatur. Almost everyone cites Mrs. Astor's intense involvement in each grant she awards -- she insists, for example, on visiting every recipient before a grant is made -- as the major distinguishing characteristic of her philanthropy. Her "hands on" approach has not only enabled her to gauge the city's problems close-up, it has also inspired many younger New Yorkers to do more than merely write a check.
"Both in her personal involvement with the people and causes she helps and in her choice of causes, she has been an inspiration to us," says David Saltzman, the 29-year-old co-director of the Robin Hood Foundation, which was founded in 1988 by Paul Tudor Jones 2d, a young commodities trader on Wall Street, and which will give $3 million this fiscal year to grass-roots organizations and causes in the city.
IF THE ASTOR approach has turned out to fit New York, that is not surprising, for Brooke Astor is a distinctly New York phenomenon.
Perhaps because the Dutch ruled New York society until the early 19th century, the rigid, English-dominated class that led Philadelphia and Boston never created a comparable force in New York City. Indeed, as a great mercantile and financial power dependent on talented new people, New York has always offered relatively fluid access to the ranks of society.
"New York has always been a functional city," said E. Digby Baltzell, the Philadelphia-based historian and sociologist. "Those who do things lead."
Not until 1888 did Ward McAllister -- the John Fairchild of his day -- designate New York's "400," those who would be at ease, and not make others ill at ease, in the ballroom of Mrs. William B. Astor Jr., then the city's social doyenne.
Even the Astors were parvenus. The Astor fortune was made in a single generation by John Jacob, a German butcher's son who, according to Brooke Astor, "arrived in this country in 1783 with two suits of clothes, a pound in his pocket and seven flutes to sell." In 1848, he died the richest man in America, leaving the then-vast sum of $20 million. Like so many modern-day New Yorkers, John Jacob made his money in real estate.
The free and easy money-loving history of New York helps explain the 1980's, a decade that produced enormous fortunes on Wall Street and minted dozens of social movers and shakers, who put a gaudy stamp on the city's charity-ball circuit. The style was flashy, but the pet charities of the city had never had it so good.
Perhaps New York relished the 80's so because only in the previous decade, the city had come close to fiscal collapse. Only a collective effort by city and state officials and the leaders of labor, business and the arts had saved New York from bankruptcy. When the stock market began soaring in the late 1970's, New Yorkers were more than ready to celebrate.
Soon after the Reagans were inaugurated and greed began to seem not only defensible, but downright patriotic, fast money from Wall Street began to make the Astors seem like paupers. "I can remember when a million dollars was a lot of money," Mrs. Astor observed.
Just as earlier generations of nouvelles had done, many of the newly monied women and their husbands wanted to show that they had truly arrived by joining the boards of the city's great institutions. And in keeping with the city's time-honored tradition of letting money talk, Brooke Astor helped some of them do it. But, she says, she always tried to insure that the aspirant's interest was sincere. "Motives matter," she declares. "Those who seek access to boards only to enhance their social standing will not serve the institution's interests in the long term."
WHILE BROOKE ASTOR MAY HAVE participated in the whirl of the 80's, her personal style has been unwavering for decades. Her designer suits were not acquired for lunches at La Grenouille. She wears them, along with expensive hats and jewels, to visit the city's poorest residents. "People expect to see Mrs. Astor, not some dowdy old lady, and I don't intend to disappoint them," she says.
She has a staff of 42 in three homes, in Maine, Westchester County and on Park Avenue. While she has a driver in the city, she loves taking the wheel in the country. "Don't you hate slowpokes?" she mutters, gunning the engine of her Mercedes and leaving an elderly motorist in the dust. She prides herself on discipline, the 1,000 strokes a day she insists on swimming in summer, her determination to climb a mountain in Maine even in a fierce downpour, and above all, her refusal to let herself feel down.
In the best of New York traditions, she invented herself, coming neither from money nor from New York. Brooke Russell was born on Easter Sunday, March 30, 1902, in Portsmouth, N.H., the only child of a career Marine officer who assessed a man's character by asking: "What was he like under fire?"
Evidence of the flirt and romantic she says she remains emerged as early as 13, when she visited her family in Santiago de los Caballeros, Santo Domingo, in the summer of 1914. "I have been listening to Russian music," she wrote in her diary, "and I want to marry a Russian peasant; a great strong beautiful brute, who would beat me, and pull me around by the hair!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Only three years later, she got part of her wish. Her 10-year marriage to Dryden Kuser, a wealthy Princeton graduate who fell madly in love with her at a commencement prom, was a disaster from the start. A drunk and a womanizer, Kuser occasionally beat his young bride. She buried her sorrow in social and charitable activities and devoted herself to her only son, Tony.
Eventually Kuser fell in love with another woman and left his wife. She moved from Bernardsville, N.J., to New York and took up a career writing features and book reviews, and eventually became an editor at House & Garden. Though Mrs. Astor says the divorce hurt, she learned much from her first marriage -- among other things, the importance of good manners. According to "Footprints," one of four books she has written, she was appalled by the way in which Col. Anthony P. Kuser, her first father-in-law, abused and demeaned his staff. "The arrogance of big money is one of the most unappealing of characteristics, and it goes very deep," she wrote. "To see a grown man groveling in order to keep his job is a horrible sight."
Mrs. Astor describes her second marriage, to Charles Marshall, known as Buddie, as the happiest period of her life. The New York stockbroker, whom she calls "my greatest love," was comfortable, but not rich. In 1952, after almost 20 blissful years of shuttling between New York and Italy, Buddie suffered a heart attack and died in her arms. She was certain, she said, that she would never marry again. But within a year, she had become Mrs. Vincent Astor.
How that came about remains a source of speculation in New York society. Some say that the marriage to Astor, who was said to have a drinking problem, was virtually arranged by his family, desperate for someone to look after him. But that is not the way Brooke Astor describes it. In her books and interviews, she has said that Vincent, a businessman with interests in hotels and publishing, pursued her relentlessly, and finally persuaded her to marry him through humorous and ardent love letters, sometimes five a day.
Brooke Astor has never disparaged her former husband and benefactor. But her book and comments reflect the sharp difference in the feeling she had for Marshall and for the man who would eventually make her philanthropy possible. Soon after the marriage, she wrote, she discovered that "Vincent was extremely jealous," even of her son, Tony. Bowing to his request, she never telephoned friends when he was home. They rarely went out. "Sometimes I got depressed," Mrs. Astor allowed. "But I have a naturally happy and cheerful nature. I also knew that Vincent loved me deeply. It was his life that I had made up my mind to live, not my own." So she gave up her friends. She even saw little of her son. "I concentrated on Vincent."
In 1959, less than six years after the marriage, Vincent Astor died, leaving his wife his fortune. Though the will was bitterly contested by other members of the Astor clan, Brooke Astor won.
It was then and only then, she says, after years of "lying fallow," that Mrs. Astor came into her own. Her husband, she says, once told her: "Pookie, you're going to have a hell of a lot of fun running the foundation."
And so she has.
MRS. ASTOR MAINTAINS that she is still having fun, but less than she used to. "Ten years ago," she says, "we didn't even have names for the problems -- like AIDS and homelessness -- that are overwhelming the city today." Fifteen years ago, she would happily walk home from a dinner party. "Today I'm terrified to walk even a few blocks alone at night." And she lives on Park Avenue.
The New York of Brooke Astor's heyday is no longer. Demographic and economic changes have created heavy new burdens for the city, its philanthropists and its high society.
Since Mrs. Astor moved to New York full time in the early 1950's, the city's class structure has changed dramatically. Since 1950, New York has lost 7 percent of its population, from 7.9 million to 7.3 million in 1990, with middle-class New Yorkers accounting for most of the loss. During that same period, the city's minority population increased by three million.
"This has been one of the most dramatic exchanges of population in New York history," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner in New York of the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. "In 1950, New York was a white town. There were only a million blacks, Hispanics, Asians and others." Since 1950 the number of whites in New York has declined by more than 50 percent, whereas the nonwhite population has increased fourfold, he says.
The newcomers have faced a city less able to accommodate them economically than it was in past decades. For underlying the flight of middle-class New Yorkers has been not just high taxes and high crime, but the disappearance of the manufacturing base that enabled immigrants to climb out of poverty. Since 1950, New York has lost 700,000 manufacturing jobs, leaving it with only 330,000. It lost 150,000 of those jobs in the 1980's alone. While new jobs and vast wealth were created in the 80's on Wall Street, much of this employment has fallen victim to the recession.
In the short term, this new set of circumstances puts extreme strain on the city's social services and on private charity. Looking into the next century, however, the immigrants of today may well prove to be a philanthropic resource.
Kathleen McCarthy, director of the Center for the Study of Philanthropy at the Graduate School of the City University of New York, says more study needs to be done on philanthropy in the black, Asian and Hispanic communities, pointing out that the bulk of the giving in New York has always come from individuals who were not wealthy. "This giving from these people will become much more important in the next decade," McCarthy predicts.
WHAT TROUBLES MRS. Astor most about the city now is what she perceives as a "lack of political leadership." She recalls the fiscal catastrophe of the 1970's. "New Yorkers from all walks of life banded together to fight for the city. Governor Carey vowed he would not let the city die. So did Mayor Beame. So did the labor leaders and financiers, our artists and writers."
But today, she continues, when the city is even more deeply troubled, "one just doesn't see that kind of rallying together, I don't really know why."
The frustration over the city's problems is overwhelming the city's philanthropic sector, leading many, despite their resistance to the notion of replacing government, to question their priorities.
"The New York Philharmonic, the nation's oldest symphony orchestra, has launched a drive to raise a $75 million endowment," says Rita E. Hauser, a prominent international lawyer and Philharmonic board member. "And I'm proud to be helping out," she says. "But I also feel guilty when I look around at the city's problems and the terrible conditions in which so many of our fellow New Yorkers live."
The tension is also reflected in mainstream foundations. Colin G. Campbell, president of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, says that the foundation decided last year to abandon its longstanding strategy of giving about $1 million a year to what it calls New York City's vital institutions in favor of funding projects to reduce racial and ethnic polarization in the city. As a result, the foundation is now spending more on low-income and affordable housing and education programs in schools.
"We're responding to the need to address some extremely serious problems in New York," says Campbell. The foundation, he adds, would probably start giving an even larger share of its grants to New York.
Vincent T. McGee, executive director of the Aaron Diamond Foundation, says it is "a cruel joke to expect private philanthropy to service public obligations of society." Nevertheless, when the city wanted to distribute condoms in its schools to help prevent the spread of AIDS, it was the Diamond Foundation that picked up $450,000 of personnel costs for the plan.
Or consider Mrs. Astor's favorite charity, the New York Public Library, which, contrary to its name, is a private institution intended primarily for researchers. When Andrew Carnegie agreed to build 65 branch libraries for the city in 1901, a written contract specified that the city would pay for them from then on. In other words, private funds would support the now four, nonlending research libraries, and government money would largely finance the now 82 branch lending libraries.
But according to Vartan Gregorian, president of Brown University and the former head of the Public Library, the city's inability in the previous decade to adequately finance the branches prompted the library's trustees to earmark for the branches some 35 percent of the $300 million capital campaign of the 80's. "If the Public Library tries to replace the entire $9.4 million in city budget cuts for the branches," he says, "all the private fund-raising for the library's operations would be swallowed up. What the library fears is that giving more to the branches will enable the city to cut back even further on its own contributions."
Linda L. Gillies, director of the Astor Foundation, agrees. "While Mrs. Astor and the foundation have always been willing to help meet city needs in difficult times," she says, "we are in partnership with, not a substitute for, the government. New York has far too many needs and problems for that."
IN ADDITION TO ITS impact on philanthropy, New York's economic crisis has also triggered a shakeout on the social scene, which Mrs. Astor has dominated for so long. The early watchword of 90's society is understatement. While the charity circuit is still booming and "benefititis" persists, the functions are determinedly less extravagant.
The new austerity signals a dramatic turn from the New York of the 80's, when nouvelle society brought big money -- new, old and corporate -- and a flamboyant public style to the charity circuit. While the financial decade began to shut down with the stock market crash of October 1987, its social equivalent came two years earlier, when Felix G. Rohatyn, the investment banker whose financial legerdemain helped rescue New York in the 70's, attacked the lavishness of New York charity.
Presaging the debate that would take hold in the 90's, Rohatyn and his activist wife, Elizabeth, said wealthy New Yorkers were concentrating on prestigious institutions that benefit mainly the rich and upper middle class and that the extravagant dinners and balls had become virtually an end in themselves. Settlement houses, literacy programs and other unglamorous charities were being deprived, he argued.
The Rohatyns were denounced in the pages of John Fairchild's W. Seething rebuttals came from the sharp-tongued Pat Buckley and Annette Reed, now Mrs. Oscar de la Renta. Although Brooke Astor ran one of the leanest foundation offices in New York and had long supported unfashionable programs for the poor, she, too, took the Rohatyn critique personally. Though she refuses to discuss the incident in any detail, friends say that she was offended both by its public nature and by the pain it caused some of her dearest friends.
Today, she says, she holds no grudge, although Mr. Rohatyn no longer serves on her foundation's board. "He didn't come to meetings, and we have strict rules about that," she says. But the Rohatyns' continued support of the library -- which included a $200,000 donation after the "flap," as it now known, and Liz Rohatyn's active role on the Public Library board -- has restored calm. The Rohatyns are friends, says Mrs. Astor. "I like them both and love talking to them," she says, "but I think the remarks they made have troubled them to this day."
Rohatyn now calls the controversy "silly." His comments, he stressed, were never aimed at Mrs. Astor, whom he admires. "But I have no regrets about what I said," he added, "because I think I've been proven right."
The fall of John H. Gutfreund, who resigned in disgrace as head of Salomon Brothers in August for failing to report financial misdeeds at his firm, and the glee it inspired in certain quarters, reflects the full-blown backlash that has taken hold against the buccaneer spirit of the 1980's. His contribution to the Public Library board and the hard work of his wife, Susan, for the Citizens Committee for New York City are discounted; what is remembered is the chartered planeload of flowers she recently sent to a friend on her birthday, the Concorde flights to Paris for dress fittings and a $2.5 million marble staircase she installed in one of the most expensive apartment renovations in New York history. Since the scandal, she has been shunned in some social circles. "I feel terribly sorry for her," Mrs. Astor says.
Whatever personal sympathy Mrs. Astor harbors for the Gutfreunds, however, has not affected her views about the best interests of the library. At a board meeting in late September, Marshall Rose, chairman, announced that Gutfreund had just sent them a letter stating that although he intended to remain on the board on which he had served since 1974, he was resigning as head of the finance committee. An embarrassed silence followed, until Mrs. Astor rose to express her approval of his resignation, which had not been requested. He had done "the honorable thing," she said softly but firmly. "I'm very proud of him."
THE QUESTION OF WHO will succeed Mrs. Astor is no longer even raised. When Brooke Astor goes, an era of New York life will also go, say her fans. "You'll just have to turn another page," said Jerry Zipkin, a native New Yorker and fixture on the social scene.
New York society is even more muddled today than it was at the turn of the century, when several sometimes overlapping circles of social and financial power competed for prominence. Old New York society included such names as the Rockefellers, the Astors and the Morgans; another establishment was made up of the great Jewish names of "Our Crowd" -- the Lehmans, the Loebs, the Warburgs and the Schiffs. But both circles, as such, barely exist today, though individual members are very active. Many of those families had no heirs, or have children who are either unwilling or unable to play the role their predecessors did.
Many luminaries of the 80's Nouvelle Society -- the Kravises, the Steinbergs, the Perelmans, and the Gutfreunds -- have lowered their social profiles, sensitive to the new climate and after years of overexposure.
Moreover, the circumstances that permitted a Brooke Astor to emerge would be difficult to replicate today. Durable fortunes of the Astor size are more difficult to create and pass on, given tax laws that seize more of inherited money. A successor would hardly be able to maintain her own career, and women today, even the very wealthy, often have them.
"I think you'll see several women emerge, not just one," said Bill Blass, the dress designer and a friend.
And maybe it won't be a "her." "Society is changing and you're seeing a lot more younger men involved in philanthropy, the backbone of society," said Chappy Morris, the organizer of many junior committee events at the city's prestigious cultural institutions. The Robin Hood Foundation, for example, is headed by Paul Tudor Jones 2d, who made his money on Wall Street. Joshua Mailman, a wealthy young investor, has created a network of heirs of family foundations to share information about the environment and other new causes. Since its inception in 1982, their Threshold Foundation has given away $7 million in grants to what were once considered nontraditional causes. More than 20 of the younger Rockefellers, including the men, are socially active and big givers to ecological, feminist and other up-to-date causes.
Mrs. Astor is bemused by speculation about her successor. "I hope you're not burying me just yet," she says. "I have a lot more life in me."
In fact, she has decided to celebrate her 90th birthday at the Seventh Regiment Armory. The party in her honor will gather what she calls her "friends of the heart" -- Nin Ryan, daughter of the late Otto Kahn, John (Jackie) Pierrepont, Louis Auchincloss and Barbara Walters -- along with her favorite writers, artists, journalists, dress designers and decorators, members of New York's old society and what's left of its nouvelle establishment, and many of the unacclaimed people whom she has helped over the years.
The party will be vintage Astor, cutting across social lines as the entertaining in her own elegant homes has always done. And it will be a fund-raiser, of course, for the Citizens Committee for New York City, the public service group the foundation help found in 1971. "And there'll be dancing!" Mrs. Astor exclaims.

HEADLINE: WINTER IN THE SNOW;
Action On and Off the Slopes

BYLINE: By STANLEY CARR

 BODY:
SKI resorts around the country have become more enterprising than ever, improving their areas and services and offering deals in the face of recession and a dip in the number of skiers. According to a survey done for the United Ski Industries Association, there were 46.7 million skier visits last winter compared with more than 50 million in 1989-90 and 53.3 million in 1988-89.
Ski classes are becoming more scientific with a new crop of names. Sunday River, Me., for example, offers instruction called the Perfect Turn; Steamboat, Colo., has the Billy Kidd Center for Performance Skiing; and in Vermont, Mount Snow beckons with EXCL, standing for express customized learning, while Bolton Valley teaches the Effortless Turning Concept. 
 Deals that reduce the cost of the full-day lift ticket are spreading across the country. Stowe, Vt., sells a $99 book of 12 coupons each redeemable for a 50 percent reduction on the $39 any-day ticket. A pay-per-ride lift ticket book at Bromley, Vt., contains 40 coupons for use on lifts at the rate of one to five coupons, depending on the lift ridden. The book costs $50, and $32 for juniors aged 7 to 14, compared with daily ticket prices of $36 and $23 on weekends and holidays and $24 and $13 midweek. (At most ski centers, but not Bromley, junior means aged 6 to 12.) Another Bromley deal: juniors ski free midweek when accompanied by a ticket-buying adult.
At Steamboat, and Sierra Summit, Calif., children under 12 ski and stay free when a parent buys a five-day lift ticket and lodging. Most ski areas offer savings when skiers buy tickets for two or more consecutive days. Skiers should check with ski shops and ski areas for more information on cut-rate special days and programs for specific groups, including seniors and children. On "Forever Young Days" (every Tuesday) at Mount Cranmore, N.H., tickets are half price for anyone over 50.
Investment in snow-making equipment has become essential, even in areas known for high snowfalls. Bear Valley and Boreal in California credit their snow guns with saving their season during last winter's snow drought. Sun Valley, Idaho, says it spent $5.5 million this year boosting its man-made system on Baldy Mountain. Taos, N.M., has added top-to-bottom snow-making on the west side of the mountain.
But carrying out changes to ski resorts is no simple matter these days. Snow-making, which requires drawing on local water supplies, has become a critical issue, effecting fish and sewage disposal. Applications to draw on water sources often involve protracted negotiations. Ski areas are also confronting other environmental concerns. Keystone, Colo., says that the $32 million investment in the mountain's new Outback section being opened this winter includes $3 million spent on protecting and enhancing the quality of water, revegetation, wildlife, wetlands and utilities.
Bruce Watson, general manager of Whitetail, a new area opening next month in Pennsylvania, said that environmental negotiations, hearings, challenges and permit applications stretched over 11 years and cost the owners more than $1 million. The ski area at Loon, N.H., the United Ski Industries Association reports, has spent over $1 million on studies but to date has failed to receive final approval to expand onto the adjacent South Mountain. The association also says that permits to expand facilities were issued this past spring and summer to Okemo, Stowe and Sugarbush in Vermont and Mount Hood Meadows, Oregon, "after a decade of open and expensive discussions between resort owners and preservationists."
Meanwhile, the enhancement of ski resorts continues, attracting nonskiing recreation around them, from indoor tennis, pools, spas and hot tubs to hot-air ballooning. To these can be added some older staples like skating, ice fishing, museums, art galleries and, at Jackson Hole, Wyo., sleigh rides through elk herds.
The following survey offers a selection of ski areas that offer a lot for both skiers and nonskiers in the West, Northeast and Canada.
 
 
 
THE WEST
CALIFORNIA

 
BEAR VALLEY
Bear Valley Ski Company, Post Office Box 5038,
Bear Valley, Calif. 95223
Information, (209) 753-2301; lodging, (209) 753-6700; snow conditions, (209) 753-2308
On the Slopes Bear Valley, midway between Yosemite National Park and Lake Tahoe, provides excellent skiing conditions without the crowds encountered at Mammoth Mountain to the south or the Lake Tahoe-area resorts to the north. From a summit at 8,495 feet, skiers can choose from 82 runs that total 25 miles. Nine chairlifts take skiers up the mountain (vertical drop, 1,900 feet) and afford views of the Sierra Nevada, with its forest of pine and fir, surrounding the valley. Three surface lifts have been added this year. The runs, which cover more than 1,200 acres, are divided almost equally among beginner, intermediate and expert.
Lift ticket prices: $32 full day; $25 half-day; $25 for ages 13 to 23 with student ID; $16 for skiers 65 and over; $10 for disabled and children aged 7 to 12; $8 children 6 and under. Discounts packages, including lift tickets, equipment rental and lessons, are available for beginners and children.
Ski school begins at $20 for a two-hour group lesson. For racers, personalized coaching begins at $50 for two hours.
Bear Valley Cross Country, (209) 753-2834 and (800) 232-7123, offers cross-country skiing on 56 miles of trails. Basic rate: $12.50 full day; $9 half-day; discounts available for children, seniors and disabled. Lessons and rentals available. This company also holds occasional special events, including moonlight cross-country skiing and back-country tours, wine tastings and food festivals.
For Nonskiers Bear Valley provides ice skating ($3 rink fee for two hours; $4 skate rental) on a pond. On Saturday the pond is lighted for night skating accompanied by music and a bonfire.
Four miles away, in Bear Valley Village, the Bear Valley Lodge, (209) 753-2327 and (800) 794-3866, offers its guests restaurants, bars, hot tubs, a massage service and catering. Midweek discounts, with free lift tickets or cross-country trail passes, are available. Basic room rates: $79 to $169, double occupancy. Rooms at the Red Dog Lodge, (209) 753-2344, rent for $50, single or double. A shuttle van connects the hotels to the slopes.

HEAVENLY SKI RESORT
Wildwood and Saddle Road, South Lake Tahoe, Calif. 96156, and Post Office Box 2180, Stateline, Nev. 89449-9919
central reservations, (800) 243-2836; snow conditions, (916) 541-7544; general information, (916) 541-1330
On the Slopes Heavenly, which straddles the California-Nevada border just south of Lake Tahoe, offers not only some of the best skiing in California but also some of its most spectacular views. Most of the 71 trails, at altitudes ranging from 6,550 to 10,100 feet, look out onto Lake Tahoe and the heavily wooded Sierra Nevada that ring the Tahoe Basin.
Twenty-five lifts, including a 50-passenger aerial tram and a high-speed quad, carry skiers up the mountain. From top to bottom, beginner, intermediate and advanced trails intertwine across the slopes and bowls, giving skiers of all levels access to the entire mountain. Skiers can start from one base lodge on the California side, or two on the more out-of-the-way Nevada side.
Lessons with Heavenly's 175 instructors range from $10 for a 20-minute clinic on a specific skill to $264 for a private six-hour session. Full-day packages for children aged 3 1/2 to 12, including lift tickets, equipment rentals, supervised skiing and lunch, are $55.
The regular cost of lift tickets: $38 full day; $27 half-day; children and skiers 65 and over, $17 full day and $12 half-day. Discounts are available on passes for three days or more.
For Nonskiers At the top of Heavenly's aerial tram, a full-service restaurant offers a view of the entire Tahoe Basin. But the area's primary nonskiing attraction lies nearly 2,000 feet below, in the miniature version of Las Vegas in Stateline, Nev. Heavenly provides free shuttle service to and from the south shore's hotel casinos. Caesar's Tahoe, Harrah's Tahoe, Harvey's Resort Hotel and the Horizon Radisson Resort are a few minutes' drive from Heavenly's California base lodge in South Lake Tahoe. Caesar's has a nightly hypnotist show at $12, and Harrah's and the Radisson have cabaret shows for $11. For reservations and information: Caesar's, (800) 648-3353; Harrah's, (800) 648-3773; Harvey's, (800) 553-1022; the Radisson, (800) 333-3333 for accommodations, (702) 588-6211 for shows.
South Lake Tahoe and Stateline have more than 50 hotels, motels and condominiums. Heavenly's reservations service provides information and makes reservations at most of them, and arranges car rentals and airline flights.
Two paddle-wheelers offer sightseeing tours of the lake in the afternoon, and dinner-dance cruises in the evening. The glass-bottomed Tahoe Queen, (916) 541-3364, cruises daily, year round. Fares: $14 daytime, $18 evening; children under 12: $5 daytime, $9 evening. Dinner entrees start at $18. The Ms. Dixie, (702) 588-3508, tours daily February to November, Saturdays only December and January. $12 daytime, $31 evening, including dinner.
 
 
COLORADO

 
ASPEN
Post Office Box 1248, Aspen, Colo. 81612
central reservations, (800) 262-7736; daily snow reports and calendar of events, (900) 740-2773 ($1.50 a minute)
On the Slopes Many skiers visualize financiers and famous faces skiing down Ruthie's Run or dancing at the Caribou Club until the wee hours. They're here -- as well as thousands of other skiers determined to have a good time in this fabled playground. Aspen, spawned in a silver boom during the late 1800's, now relies on snow. The resort actually offers four ski areas, which together encompass 3,700 acres of skiable terrain filled with more than 260 trails and open bowls. There is shuttle bus service around town and between the ski areas.
Aspen Mountain, an expert's nirvana, towers 3,267 vertical feet above the town. The black diamond terrain like the curves on Bell Mountain, Walsh's and Elevator Shaft and the intermediate cruising through Copper Bowl and on Ruthie's Run are all accessible via the speedy Silver Queen gondola and seven chairs.
Snowmass is an intermediate skier's area sprawled over several peaks surrounding a pedestrian-oriented village in a valley 12 miles from Aspen. The half-mile-wide Big Burn and Elk Camp provide the ultimate terrain for wide-open turns. There's also plenty of beginner terrain, as well as some entertaining advanced runs and challenging off-piste stretches for experts. The vertical drop is 3,615 feet.
Tiehack-Buttermilk Mountain (2,030 vertical feet) is the site for five-day intensive learning programs. It's a compact, prime teaching mountain that may have shorter lift lines than the other two ski areas owned by Aspen Skiing Corporation (Aspen and Snowmass).
The resort's fourth ski mountain, the independently owned Aspen Highlands, has challenging terrain for intermediates and experts, from the open Thunderbowl section to the precipitous Steeplechase runs.
The Aspen Skiing Company multiday lift tickets (good at Aspen Mountain, Snowmass and Tiehack/Buttermilk) are cheaper if purchased with lodging. Buy the four-area ticket book and lunch is free (up to $10) when you use it at Aspen Highlands. This year Aspen Highlands lift tickets rates have been reduced 25 percent -- to $30 daily. The four-area book is $156 for four of five days; and $228 for six of seven days. The Aspen Skiing Company ticket (for three mountains) is $152 for four of five days, and $222 for six of seven days. Rates for children and people 64 and over are about 40 percent less.
For Nonskiers Many people go to Aspen and never ski. Aspen is a true "shop till you drop" town, where purchases range from $10 T-shirts to $10,000 furs. Curious George Collectibles, (303) 925-3315, has Western Americana; Junior Mountain Sports, (303) 925-7889, stylish children's skiwear; and Pitkin Country Dry Goods Leathers, (303) 925-6204, fine leather apparel. The culture connection remains strong during the wintertime. There are many art galleries to explore, as well as the Aspen Art Museum, (303) 925-8050; admission $2. Try the Squash Blossom, (303) 925-3214, for traditional and contemporary Native American Indian jewelry, pottery and artworks, and the Heather Gallery, (303) 925-6170, for contemporary American crafts. The restored Wheeler Opera House, (303) 925-2750, is the scene for entertainment ranging from Harry Connick Jr. to the Nutcracker. At the Crystal Palace dinner theater-cabaret, (303) 925-1455, the staff waits on tables, then acts in a satirical revue based on people in the news. Its season starts Dec. 12.
History buffs should stop by the Aspen Historical Society, (303) 925-3721, for information on walking tours. Other nonskier activities include fishing in the Roaring Fork River, hot-air ballooning over the ski slopes, dogsled rides into the wilderness, sleigh rides to the Pine Creek Cookhouse, (303) 925-1044, two-stepping classes at the Cowboy Bar in the Silvertree Hotel, and snowmobiling into the wilderness. For more information contact Aspen central reservations, (800) 262-7736, or Snowmass central reservations, (800) 332-3245.
 
BRECKENRIDGE
Post Office Box 1058, Breckenridge, Colo. 80424
Lodging, (800) 221-1091; snow conditions, (303) 453-6118
On the Slopes Peaks 8, 9 and 10 make up the interconnected Breckenridge ski area, with a total of 112 trails. Half the runs are designated most difficult, a third are for intermediates and the remaining 20 percent are for beginners. At 12,998 feet, Peak 8 is the highest of the three mountains and offers the longest run of 3.5 miles. The vertical rise is about 3,400 feet.
Six-day lift pass: $174 and $90 for children and seniors aged 60 to 69. Seniors over 70 and children under 5 ski free.
A wristwatch with its intricate works exposed, soaring eagles and 10-foot elves and other marvelous statuary hewn from ice accent this trim town's Main Street every winter, making a casual stroll an essential part of the visit.
For Nonskiers Breckenridge, 85 miles west of Denver, is host of the International Snow Sculpture Championships, and this winter up to 16 teams of artisans will carve ice models depicting both abstract and realistic themes. The competition is being held Jan. 8-12, and the sculptures stay up until Feb. 1, weather permitting.
Standing a good deal more permanently behind the frosty and temporal display are more than 300 Victorian buildings, preserved in what is Colorado's largest National Historic District. Breckenridge is the oldest continually occupied town on the state's Western Slope. As a town and gold mining center, it peaked in the 1860's, when its population reached about 8,000. Prospectors quickly moved on to more promising gold fields, and as was so often the case the town barely existed until its revival as a ski resort in the 1960's. The Summit Historical Society can give information on both walking and mining tours (303-453-9022).
Many restaurants and boutiques and T-shirt shops line the route of the ice statuary so an ice tour does not have to be without its ulterior motive. Or, walkers can try to find their way through A Maze 'n Breckenridge, a confounding configuration of wood walls that changes weekly. Skating on Maggie Pond, sleigh rides and dogsledding for novices and children are also available.
The full-service Breckenridge Spa, (303) 453-9300, opened this year, along with 15 guest rooms and its restaurant overlooking the Continental Divide. For those who prefer indoor athletics and outdoor exercise other than skiing, it offers racquetball, a gymnasium and indoor pool as well as facials, herbal wraps and hot tubs. More guest rooms and a conference center are planned. The Breckenridge Recreation Center, (303) 453-5579, is scheduled to open in January with a swimming pool, gymnasium and tennis courts.
The ski area pays its annual tribute to Ullr, the Norse God of Snow and Winter, with a torchlight ski parade and children's events during the Ullr Fest from Jan. 12 to 19.
A 20-minute bus ride to the Silverthorne factory outlets expands the shopping universe considerably; more than 50 name-brand retail stores sell clothes and housewares at discounts.
 
KEYSTONE
Keystone Resort, Box 38, Keystone, Colo. 80435
Lodging, (800)-222-0188; snow conditions, (303) 468-4111
On the Slopes Keystone's expansion is the largest in the ski industry this year, and it increases the resort's skiable acreage by almost 40 percent. The Outback's 17 new trails feature glade skiing (terrain dotted with trees) and are geared for the advanced-intermediate and expert skier. More than half of all runs cater to intermediates, about 30 percent are for beginners, including a three-mile cruising run. The largest night skiing operation in the country enables skiers to stay on the mountain until 10 every night.
The Keystone area embraces four mountains: Keystone, North Peak, the Outback and Arapahoe Basin. Arapahoe's summit elevation of 12,450 feet usually assures skiing into early June.
Six-day lift ticket: $174 and $84 for children under 12. Six-day Ski-the-Summit ticket for Keystone, Breckinridge and Copper Mountain is $198 and $102 for children.
For Nonskiers While most of the $32 million that Keystone is spending this year is designated for improving and expanding downhill skiing amenities, nonskiers will be able to enjoy a chunk of it as well. The $6 million stone Outpost, at 11,444 feet on North Peak, is billed as America's highest full-service restaurant, and can be reached by nonskiers the year round via two gondolas, one new this year. Winter hours are 9 A.M. to 10 P.M.
Keystone resort maintains the largest outdoor ice skating rink in the country, open from 10 A.M. to 10 P.M. daily. The fee is $5 for all day; skates can be rented, also for $5. There are two indoor tennis courts (court fee is $17 an hour), a weight room, and 11 swimming pool facilities with sauna and whirlpool at the various condonimiums. The pools are available free to guests staying at the resort. The Silverthorne shopping area is 10 minutes away by free shuttle bus.
At the 10-year-old Keystone Science School in the valley, visitors can attend the Mountain Speaker Series of nature talks every Friday evening from early January to mid-April. Admission is $4. Call (303) 468-5824 for more information, or write to the Keystone Science School Box 606, Keystone, Colo. 80435.
 
STEAMBOAT
Steamboat Ski Corporation, 2305 Mount Werner Circle, Steamboat Springs, Colo. 80487
Lodging, (800) 922-2722; snow report, (303) 879-7300
On the Slopes The area's 2,500 acres of trails cover a complete mountain range: Sunshine, Storm, Thunderhead and Christie Peaks. Its 3,600-foot vertical rise is second highest in Colorado (after Aspen Highlands). Steamboat says that it receives more snow than anywhere else along the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, with a seasonal average of 25 feet. Fifty-four percent of the resort's runs are rated for intermediate skiers, 31 percent are for advanced skiers, and 15 percent are for beginners.
Steamboat's latest offering for intermediate and advanced skiers is the Billy Kidd Center for Performance Skiing. The teaching methods are based on those developed by the Olympic gold medalist Billy Kidd and employ video and playback equipment on the slopes for instant critiques. A two-day instruction course is $280. For reservations or information call (303) 879-6111, extension 543.
Six-day lift tickets are $210. Children age 12 and under ski free when parents purchase a five-day or longer lift ticket and stay a minimum of five nights at a participating lodging.
 For Nonskiers The town of Steamboat Springs, named for the hot mineral waters chugging out of the earth, exudes a cowboy charm. The verdant Yampa Valley, where the resort is situated, contains some of the best grazing land in the state; the sprawling cattle ranches that remain may no longer thrive, but they do manage. Stetsons and cowboy boots, often paired with ski suits, are a part of the uniform in town.
The Steamboat Springs Health and Recreational Association, (303) 879-1828, puts the natural mineral water to use in an Olympic-size lap pool and three hot mineral pools. They are open daily from 7 A.M. to 10 P.M. and admission is $4.50. Weight room, saunas and massages are also available. For a more natural outdoor setting, and bathing, there are bus tours to the Strawberry Park Hot Springs, four miles away in the mountains above town.
At Inner Links, (303) 879-2916, nonskiers can play golf indoors from 10 A.M. to 2 A.M. daily. Several stables offer horseback riding all winter.
The exhilaration of the Continental Divide is available to nonskiers with Steamboat Snowmobile Tours, (303) 879-6500. The two-hour guided trips cruise through the Routt National Forest and cost $55 a person for two hours, $20 for children. A program that includes sleigh-ride dinners, afternoon elk feeding trips by sleigh and bungee jumping from a hot-air balloon is organized by Windwalker Tours, (800) 748-1642.
From 6 to 10 P.M., skiers can ride a chairlift up and a bobsled down Howelsen Hill for almost 5,000 feet of lighted track, weather permitting, (303) 879-2170. Rides are $7 a person, or a 10-ride card for $50.
Fully accredited medical, dental and legal courses and meetings are run throughout the ski season. The American Educational Institute, (800) 354-3507, and the Association for Continuing Education, (800) 525-3402, can supply more information.
 
TELLURIDE
Telluride Ski Resort, 562 Mountain Village Boulevard, Post Office Box 11155, Telluride, Colo. 81435
Lodging, (800) 525-3455; snow report, (303) 728-3614
On the Slopes Among skiers Telluride is famous for its fearsome vertical chutes and expert pitches, which comprise a quarter of the ski area. Fifty-one percent of the trails are designated intermediate, and 24 percent beginner. One of the three mountain faces, Sunshine Peak, is dedicated to beginners and is served by its own high-speed quad and a mountain restaurant. There are four runs each two and half miles long. As ski areas go, Telluride is comparatively small, with a ski terrain of 656 acres and an uphill capacity of 10,000 skiers an hour.
What sets this resort apart is the magnificent scenery. From anywhere on the mountain the skier gets a panorama of the 14,000-foot peaks of the San Juan range.
A lift ticket good for six out of seven days is $186; $120 for children.
For Nonskiers Today there are two Tellurides. The first is the silver-mining camp settled in the 1870's that is now a National Historic Landmark District. The Victorian architecture has been well preserved and is framed by mountains towering about 5,000 feet above the street on three sides. Just over the ridge is the Mountain Village, which reflects the latest in modern resort development: condominiums and the Doral Telluride Resort and Spa, scheduled to open in April 1992. Art galleries and upscale boutiques have been filtering in among the T-shirt emporiums and bars.
The locality was once an important hunting ground for Ute Indians. The best information about the diversity of Indian cultures in the region is available out of town. The Anasazi Heritage Center west of Dolores, (303) 882-4811, and the Cortez Center, (303) 565-1151, are open year round and, weather permitting, a visit to the Yellowjacket archeological site, about 15 miles northwest of Cortez, is possible. Either trip would take most of the day.
Telluride, a town of festivals, sponsors Winter Wine '92, which will feature a five-course dinner matched by wines, Jan. 29 and 30. Proceeds will be donated to the 11th Telluride Wine Festival to be held next summer.
Real estate is currently the town's booming industry, as vacant land and houses are selling at a brisk pace at the Mountain Village and in old Telluride. A nonskier can always spend the day touring dream homes.

VAIL
Vail, Post Office Box 7, Vail, Colo. 81658
Vail reservations, (800) 525-2257; Beaver Creek
reservations, (800) 622-3131; snow report,
(303) 476-4888 or 476-4889
On the Slopes When skiers visit this resort, they get two mountains for the price of one: Vail and Beaver Creek, 10 miles down the highway. Between the two, covered by the same lift ticket, skiers have a choice of 31 lifts to mountaintop beginner areas, long intermediate runs, relentless bump runs, children's fantasy mountains and extensive back bowls. There is shuttle bus service around town and between the ski areas.
Vail's skiable terrain spans seven miles, from the trails on Lionshead to the boundaries of China Bowl. (The view is spectacular from the new Two Elk Restaurant.) The network of 20 lifts, including 7 high-speed chairs, opens up more than 3,834 acres of terrain. The Back Bowls alone encompass 2,600 acres, a space within which one could fit many an Eastern ski area.
Grouse Mountain, a 1,808-vertical-foot peak, opens this winter, adding 110 acres of primarily advanced terrain to Beaver Creek. Those who previewed Grouse Mountain via Sno-Cat last winter say the new peak adds a needed diversity of terrain. Beginners have a mountaintop playground; the intermediate trails wind down the mountainside, often around large stands of trees, creating an illusion -- reinforced by panoramic views of the Gore and Sawatch mountain ranges -- of skiing in the wilderness. The intimidating Birds of Prey runs challenge advanced skiers.
In the children's ski areas, set within Vail and Beaver Creek, some of the skichool classes are led through "adventure zones" by costumed Western characters searching for treasure on Vail Mountain or hunting outlaws holed up at Beaver Creek.
Lift tickets are $40 a day, $27 for children; five-day tickets are $19, $200 Dec. 22 to Jan. 2; seven-day tickets are $259, $280 Dec. 22 to Jan. 2.
For Nonskiers You don't have to be a skier to enjoy Vail. The town exudes a cosmopolitan aura, from the accents of strolling shoppers to the window displays featuring souvenir mugs and chains dangling golden bears. Dining ranges from burgers at Bart and Yeti's to deep-fried spinach gnocchi or crabmeat ravioli in a carrot butter sauce at L'Ostello's. There are gallery walks during the winter, including stops at such diverse galleries as the Squash Blossom and the Cogswell. The night life beat throbs out on the sidewalks from clubs like Sheika's, (303) 476-1515, to Club Majiks, (303) 476-2626, a dinner theater presenting contemporary revues.
The wilderness is open to those who don't downhill ski. Some beautiful scenery can be admired while snowmobiling to Piney River Ranch, set alongside an alpine lake at the base of the 13,000-foot peaks of the Gore Range. There are morning ($60), afternoon ($60) and all-day tours ($110) and sunset dinner tours ($75). Information: the Adventure Company at (303) 476-9090 or Piney River Ranch, (303) 476-3941.
Visitors may also ride in a Sno-Cat-pulled sleigh through the snow-laden woods to Beano's Cabin for dinner ($69 and $46 for children). A spa day can be taken at Cordillera, (303) 926- 2200, or the Hyatt, 949-1234.
Hot-air ballooning over the slopes, ice fishing at Nottingham lake, ice skating at the Dobson Ice Arena and dogsledding are other outdoor options. Another is a ride on Vail's bobsled, $11 a ride; if the line is long, purchase a ticket, ask how long a wait, then return later. Riders reach speeds up to 50 miles an hour on the twisting 2,900-foot-long course. The Beaver Creek activities desk, (303) 949-9090, has more information and reservations for most of the activities.

TAOS SKI VALLEY

On the Slopes It doesn't make a difference what type of terrain the skier enjoys. It's all here, from a small never-ever's learning hill at the base to chutes off the uppermost ridges that experts willing to hike are eager to ski. In between, there's a mountain that has been opened up to skiing but not tamed. The excitement comes, in part, from cruising down intermediate trails that incorporate (instead of smoothing over) the interesting rolls, humps and natural contours of the mountain.
Most skiers visiting Taos for a week put themselves in ski school, even if they are experts or former ski instructors. It's a skill-level form of rat packing, especially for better skiers. Advanced skiers who wouldn't dream of taking classes elsewhere will follow a Taos instructor down super-steep Stauffenberg and moguled Inferno, through the wooded Walkyries and on other precipitous terrain they wouldn't consider tackling alone.
Last summer, top-to-bottom snowmaking was installed on the west side of the 2,612-vertical-foot mountain. A quad chair was added, replacing the Kachina lift (keeping the number of lifts at 10), which should ease lift lines in Kachina Bowl. These improvements complement overall upgrading in recent years, from the addition of the Seventh Heaven chair to new base area buildings.
Daily lift tickets are $34, childrens' tickets, $19; multiday lift tickets (three days or more), $31 a day and $17 per child.
For Nonskiers Staying slopeside on one of the lodging, meals and lifts packages is a "10" for skiers, but non skiers might be happier lodging in the town of Taos, a 20- minute ride down the mountainside. (There are shuttle services to the mountain for skiers staying in town.) Residing in a bed and breakfast inn, like the Casa de Las Chimeneas, insures leisurely mornings and a short stroll to downtown. The Taos Bed and Breakfast Association at (800) 876-7857, supplies information on choices, and puts together ski packages.
The first view of Taos Plaza, surrounded by parked cars and pickup trucks, makes one wonder if Taos hasn't been oversold. But the city's charm creeps into the psyche as you wander along side streets lined with sun-washed reddish adobe casas and explore galleries rich with Indian artifacts, Southwestern paintings, and leather and woven clothing. The small museums display Kit Carson memorabilia and Maria Martinez's lustrous black pots, and then there is the Taos Pueblo, where Native American residents sell handmade crafts, jewelry and bread baked in outdoor ovens, and the St. Francisco de Asis Church.
The shops and galleries are a treasure trove of art, crafts, jewelry, kachina dolls and hand-made clothing; it's also a junk shopper's heaven stocked with T-shirts, cheap souvenirs and assembly-line paintings.
Art lovers should visit the Millicent Rogers Museum, (505) 758-2462, for its exceptional collection of Southwestern Native American and Hispanic art, and the Ernest Blumenschein Home and Museum, (505) 758-0330, the adobe home of a co-founder of the Taos Society of Artists.
Information about the town, museum hours, a list of galleries and a calendar of winter events are available from the Taos Chamber of Commerce, (800) 732-8267.
Santa Fe, with its galleries and museums, is one and a half hours away by car.

Resort, (800) 424-3337
On the Slopes Remnants of Park City's silver-mining heyday, trimmed with the contemporary veneer of a modern resort town, are surrounded by three markedly different ski areas. But this season one of them, ParkWest, may not operate. The owner is considering an expansion program to make ParkWest more profitable. Local shuttle buses -- free -- move around town and between the slopes, the other two being Park City and Deer Valley.
A gondola and 12 chairlifts take skiers to the 80 designated trails and large bowls at Park City, which has a vertical drop of 3,100 feet. Runs for all skill levels flow off many lifts here, so friends can sit together on the way up but pursue their own excitement level on the way down. The runs off the Town lift offer high grade intermediate cruising and a view of the town's Victorian roof line. Precipitous Jupiter Bowl is a favorite haunt of experts.
When Deer Valley opened 11 years ago, it created a benchmark for service that other resorts are still scrambling to reach. From the elaborate lunchtime buffets in the base lodge to the careful grooming on the slopes, it projects a country club atmosphere. Thirteen lifts open up 83 trails and 650 acres of bowl skiing, including wide runs for beginners and intermediates, and steep slopes, glades and bumps cascading down the sides of Mayflower Bowl for the advanced. Last year's addition of Flagstaff Mountain added some intermediate runs.
Park City Ski Area daily lift tickets are $39 and $18 for children; five-of-six-days tickets are $180, $88 for children; six-of-seven-days tickets are $216 and $104 for children. Deer Valley daily: $41 and $26 for children, $18 for those aged 3 and younger. Three-of-seven-day tickets: $117, $72 for children; six-of-seven-days, $222 and $138.
For Nonskiers Nonskiers can walk down the same streets miners and gunslingers used to prowl, but today the Victorian buildings that housed saloons and brothels contain tourist-oriented businesses. There are more than 80 shops and galleries among the 45 restaurants.
Outside the town limits, visitors snowmobile through forested canyons, across open meadows and up to high ridges offering panoramic views of the Wasatch Range. Visitors can take a sleigh ride through the countryside and follow it with a five-course dinner at a country inn. Contact the Homestead Resort at (800) 327-7220 for information about snowmobiling and dinner sleigh rides. The Norwegian School of Nature Life, (801) 649-5322, arranges cross-country ski treks, cabin or snow cave overnights and other trips into the wilderness. More sedentary visitors might prefer a hot-air balloon ride with inflight champagne and a postflight brunch. For details, Balloon Affaire at (800) 658-8489.
Casino Caravans, (800) 876-5825, runs buses to the casinos in Wendover, Nev., on Wednesday and Thursday evenings. The two-and-a-half-hour ride passes quickly because there's bingo and roulette on board. The trip costs $14; riders receive $11 in coin as they step off the bus to enter the casinos.
To see the big city, visitors can hop on one of the frequent buses bringing Salt Lake City skiers to the slopes as it starts the return trip. They can stroll around Utah's No. 1 attraction: Temple Square, the symbolic heart of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The free tours, led by missionaries, include stops in most buildings and a verbal history of the Mormons' journey to Salt Lake City and the early years of struggle. For more information about what to see and do, contact the Salt Lake City Convention and Visitors Bureau, 180 South West Temple, Salt Lake City, Utah 84101; (801) 521-2868.
 
SNOWBIRD
Snowbird Ski and Summer Resort, Utah 84092-6019
801-742-2222; lodging, 800-453-3000
On the Slopes This self-contained resort is a concrete citadel guarding a narrow gap in Little Cottonwood Canyon. The 125-passenger tram ascends rapidly over steep slopes that lure experts, although there's an intermediate-rated "sightseer's" way down, wending across the mountain's front face. The network of open slopes for intermediates is nearby on the 3,100 vertical-foot mountain, and easily accessible from the resort's seven chairs. There is a separate beginners' learning area.
The ski school offers several programs in addition to the regular classes. Skiing Enhancement clinics are for adults who desire a blend of skiing and coaching. Intermediate Adventure days are for those who want to progress to parallel skiing and beyond. Super Clinics are for the advanced and experts eager to expand skiing versatility in special situations and conditions.
Some skiers take a shuttle bus to explore the slopes at Alta, three miles up the canyon road. Set at the end of the canyon, which traps extra feet of snow, Alta (2,050 vertical feet) is noted for powder skiing and scary steeps. But there are plenty of open runs and bowls for intermediates off the seven chairs.
Snowbird is celebrating its 20th anniversary this winter with a three-day party beginning Dec. 5.
Snowbird's all-area lift tickets including the tram are $36 a day, $21 for children; chairlifts only, $29 and $16 for children. Five-day tickets are $160; three days, $96. Children 12 and under ski free with an accompanying adult lift ticket purchase when lodging in their parents' room at Snowbird at a nightly rate. Alta's all-day tickets are $21.
For Nonskiers Snowbird is a choice spot for visitors who want to be pampered in a spa. The Cliff Spa, in the slopeside Cliff Hotel, offers as complete a list of amenities as one will find in any major United States facility. Massages, either plain or hydro, herbal and parafango wraps, and salt glows are offered, as well as salon services ranging from haircuts and coloring to Hawaiian pedicures. Aerobic classes are offered daily. The spa has a variety of full and half-day treatment packages but reservations are required for all services and visitors should call at least two weeks prior to arrival during peak weeks. (801) 742-2222, extension 5900 for spa, extension 5960 for salon.
Apart from the spa, on-site activities are limited at Snowbird. However, Salt Lake City is 25 minutes down the canyon, and people staying in Snowbird can step on one of the buses bringing Salt Lake City skiers to the slopes and join the return trip.

Information, (307) 733-2292; reservations, (800) 443-6931; snow conditions, (307) 733-2291
On the Slopes Jackson Hole ski area is draped across 2,500 acres of mountainside. Although long regarded as an advanaced skier's area, only one of the two peaks, Rendezvous, with a vertical drop of 4,139 feet, deserves that reputation. The other, Apres Vous (2,170 vertical feet), has been tamed and recontoured in recent years into choice intermediate terrain. The tram (63 passengers), seven chairs and two high-speed Poma lifts, open up the bowls and interconnecting trails, so few skiers realize they are moving between two mountains.
Advanced and expert skiers zoom uphill in the tram to challenge Rendezvous's many chutes, steep trails and relentless bump runs. Intermediates steer toward Easy Does It, lower Gros Ventre and St. John's for the training required to tackle steeper pitches. Beginners have a small network of trails on the lower part of Apres Vous Mountain.
Powderhounds know about heading for Grand Targhee Ski Resort, on the other side of the Grand Teton, a day or two after a big snowfall. It's a great place for an introductory powder lesson. Targhee also offers Sno-Catskiing on neighboring Peaked Peak. There's shuttle bus service from Jackson Hole to Grand Targhee.
Daily lift tickets at Jackson Hole are $38, $19 for children age 14 and under and for those age 65 and over; tram rides are $2 each and a valid chairlift ticket. Three-day lift tickets, $114, $57 for childen; seven-day tickets, $224 and $112.
For Nonskiers This naturally beautiful valley, ringed by jagged mountain peaks, anchors a host of outdoor entertainment. Thousands of elk spend winter in the National Elk Refuge managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, which offers horse-drawn sleigh rides through the herds. Rides are $7.50 and $3.50 for children ages 6 to -12. More information: (307) 733-9212.
One entrance to Yellowstone National Park is approximately one hour away. Visitors may ride through the park in a heated snow coach, or steer a rented snowmobile on park roads toward Old Faithful, arriving in time to watch the geyser blow its top.
Several companies offer snowmobiling tours (which include warm suits and boots) along wooded roads in Grand Teton and open powder meadows on Togwotee Pass with its fine views of the valley. Tucked in the back of a dog-driven sled is another way to admire the scenery. Trekking along some of the cross-country trails threading these national parks is another option. After dark, the visitor may step into a horse-drawn sleigh for dinner at a cozy log cabin or heated yurt. If you want to see the bighorn sheep, elk, deer and other wildlife up close, sign on for a wildlife safari with a biologist, (307) 733-2623. For an overview, on a par with the bald eagles who soar over this region, there are plane, helicopter and balloon flights.
Cowboys have been hanging around Jackson Hole much longer than skiers, so the town displays an intriguing mixture of Wild West ambiance and nouveau ski area chic. There are art and photography galleries, boutiques and shops on the streets around the park, with its archways of elk antlers, in the middle of the town of Jackson, 12 miles from the slopes. The resident dance and music companies offer wintertime performances. The Jackson Arts Center at (307) 733-5465 supplies information on arts and events.
After dinner or a concert, visitors can stop by the Million Dollar Cowboy Bar or the Rancher and start two-stepping on the dance floor, or belly up to the Wort Hotel's silver dollar-studded bar for a pick-me-up. Without a doubt, there will a blue-jeaned real-life wrangler within a bar stool or two.
A Jackson Hole winter planner, which lists activities, can be had from the Jackson Hole Visitors Council, Post Office Box 982, Jackson, Wyo. 83001; (800) 782-0011.

SHAWNEE PEAK
R.R. 1, Box 734, Bridgton, Me. 04009
General and snow conditions, (207) 647-8444; lodging
information available from three property managers: Bridgton Group, (207) 647-2591; Foster Property Management, (207) 647-8093; Chalmers Property Management, (207) 647-3311.
On the Slopes Shawnee Peak is Maine's oldest ski area, having noted its 50th anniversary under its previous name and ownership as Pleasant Mountain three years ago. With a vertical drop of 1,300 feet, Shawnee Peak offers 30 trails, rating them as 25 percent novice, 50 percent more difficult and 25 percent black diamond. This terrain is served by a triple and three double chairlifts and a T-bar. The area has 98 percent snowmaking and offers New England's largest night skiing facility daily.
The mountain offers group and private ski and snowboard lessons and packages. It does not offer cross-country skiing, although cross-country equipment rentals and trail information are available in local ski shops. The property agencies named above make reservations for condos and bed and breakfasts.
Lift prices are $25 midweek and $31 weekends and holidays, with special morning, afternoon, twilight, night and junior rates. Skiers 7 and younger ski free with parents, and skiers 70 and older ski free as well.
For Nonskiers Bridgton is a charming New England village, and it does have some attractions, although, like Shawnee Peak, it doesn't boast the full range of nonskiing activities of bigger destination resorts.
Bridgton abounds in antique shops. Although most are open for the summer only, many shops will open to satisfy a search for specific items; consult listing in Yellow Pages. Two big shops that are open are Wales & Hamblen, on Main Street, Bridgton, (207) 647-8344, open 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Wednesday through Saturday and noon to 4 Sunday; and Emphasis on Maine, also on Main street, (207) 647-2161, 9:30 to 5:30 seven days a week. Wales & Hamblen rents space to dealers with a range of items from postcards to oak rolltop desks. Emphasis on Maine, not really an antique shop, offers made-in-Maine crafts in staggering variety.
Bridgton has the normal complement of small-town stores; for a mega-outlet center you have to drive over to North Conway, N.H., 20 miles to the west. In addition to its hundred or so national and factory outlets, the North Conway area also boasts indoor tennis and swimming, exercise rooms and spas. The North Conway Chamber of Commerce, (603) 356-3171, will supply details.
 Skating is offered daily from 3 to 6 P.M. and 11 to 6 on weekends by the Bridgton Recreation Department at Town Hall rink. For information call (207) 647-8786.
Film -- the Magic Lantern, Main Street, (207) 647-5065, shows first-run movies daily, with an occasional old or classic film. The Bridgton Historical Society Museum, Gibbs Avenue, is open from Tuesday to Saturday, 1 to 4 P.M.; phone, (207) 647-2765.

lodging, (800) 468-2553 or (603) 236-8371
On the Slopes Although Waterville Valley has received lots of attention for the World Cup slalom and giant slalom races held there almost every spring for the last 11 years, the mountain is best known for delightful intermediate skiing. Of the 48 trails and 255 acres of skiing, only about 20 percent are expert and 20 percent for beginners. There are four double, three triple and one quad lift along with four surface lifts.
Off the 2,000-foot vertical rise, the wide slopes and groomed runs attract a large contingent of repeat visitors from Boston, about two-and-a-half hours away. One reason is the midweek frequent-skier card that gradually reduces the lift ticket prices from $30 a day, and $26 for people over age 55, to $14 after the sixth visit. Weekend and holiday rates are $37 a day, $24 for juniors 12 and under; juniors pay $20 a day during midweek periods. Children 5 and under and seniors 70 and over ski free.
A second ski center called Snow's Mountain has an additional five easy trails and one chairlift. Cross-country skiing is available on 70 kilometers of groomed and tracked trails. Daily fees are $11 and $8 for juniors on weekends, $8 and $5 in midweek.
Two on-mountain restaurants enable skiers to extend the ski experience through lunch. The Schwendi Hutte near the summit offers hearty meals and spectacular views, while the Sunnyside-Up Lodge has a cafeteria open for breakfast and lunch. At the base lodge there is a cafeteria and the World Cup Bar and Grill for lunch and apres ski. The Silver Streaks days for skiers 55 and over is one of the area's most popular programs, growing from 50 people three years ago to 500 last season. The "Streakers" have their own gathering spot in the base lodge and ski together at lower prices from Monday through Thursday. They also have instruction clinics, races and parties through the season.
For Nonskiers Just a shuttle-bus ride away from the mountain is the Waterville Valley Village and Town Square with six lodges, condominiums, eight restaurants and 10 shops and boutiques. Here also is the center of activities for nonskiers and tired skiers. The focal point is the Sports Center with indoor tennis courts, squash and racquetball, a running track, an indoor swimming pool, whirlpool, saunas, steam baths, aerobics classes and fitness training equipment. Massages are available and there is a Mexican restaurant on the premises.
Use of the Sports Center (full-weight room, bicycles, pool, aerobics room) is free for guests in the lodges; there is a $20-an-hour court fee for tennis, $15 for racquetball and squash. Call (603) 236-8303 for more information.
Snowshoeing was introduced at Waterville last year and this season there will be a triathlon on Jan. 11 in which competitors will do cross-country skiing and speed skating as well as snowshoeing. Rental shoes cost $6 a day. Snowshoe hikers use trails on the golf course. For information call the Cross-Country Center at (603) 236-4666.
The ice arena in the Town Square is open all day for skating at $3.50 a person. Weekly broomball tournaments on the ice -- with competitors wearing sturdy boots rather than skates -- are held in the evening and are open to all for $3.50. To obtain times and dates, call (603) 236-8311.
Horsedrawn sleigh rides around the valley depart hourly from the Town Square. The sleighs hold 20 passengers and seats may be reserved for families or groups as well as individuals seeking a quiet ride in the woods. Fees are $10, $6 for children. Information: (800) 468-2553 or (603) 236-8371. The Waterville Valley town recreation department offers an apres-ski program for children and families at the school gym near the resort's lodges. Among the activities are basketball, volleyball, crafts, bingo nights, dances and ice cream socials. Some activities are free, others cost $1 to $3. Information: (603) 236-4695.

On the Slopes Whiteface gained fame from two Olympics, 1932 and 1980, but for many skiers its true distinction lies in the mountain's contradictions. The 3,216-foot vertical rise holds some of the steepest trails in the East, as well as some of the easiest beginner terrain. Intermediates, however, may be disappointed with the size of the selection in between. In total there are 65 trails on 150 acres of terrain and more than 90 percent of the runs can be covered with machine-made snow. Few skiers will be disappointed with the space and uncrowded slopes or the usually short lines at Whiteface's two triple and seven double chairlifts.
Prices for lifts are $32, $20 for juniors 12 and under on weekends and holidays, and $28 and $17 during midweek periods. Until Dec. 22 and after March 16, lifts cost $20 and $14, while children 6 and under and seniors 70 and over ski free all season.
More than 100 miles of cross-country trails, both at Mount Van Hoevenberg, where trail fees are $7, and at other cross-country centers near Whiteface.
The ski area provides a selection of programs for children from 1 to 12. For the little ones there is a nursery offering an all-day supervised program for $3 an hour. When children are ready to ski, from ages 3 to 6, the Play and Ski program is a combination indoor nursery and outdoor ski lesson. Half-day is $20, full day is $38. In the same price category, the Bear's Den is a junior program for kids aged 7 to 12 who are grouped in classes according to ability.
 For Nonskiers Few places offer as wide a variety of winter activities as the combination of Whiteface, Mount Van Hoevenberg and the village of Lake Placid, all within about 10 miles of each other. High on the list of nonskiing activities are the bobsled and luge rides at Mount Van Hoevenberg. The half-mile bobsled ride with a driver and a brakeman is offered Tuesday through Sunday from 1 to 3 P.M. for $25 a person. The final five turns of the luge track can be piloted by riders during the same hours on Saturdays and Sundays at a cost of $10 a person. Information about both rides can be obtained at (800) 462-6236 or (518) 523-4436.
Skating is the second activity for which the region is known. In Lake Placid, the Olympic Arena, built in 1932, is open to the public from 1 to 3 P.M. on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday. Skate rentals are available and entry fees are $3 and $2 for children. The same prices prevail at the nearby Olympic Speed Skating Oval, open from 7 to 9 P.M. midweek and 1 to 3 and 7 to 9 P.M. on weekends. Information for both rinks: (800) 462-6236 or (518) 523-3325. Visitors can find dogsledding, curling, ice fishing, indoor tennis, sledding, sleigh riding, snowmobiling and tobogganing by calling the Lake Placid Visitor's Center at (518) 523-2445.
This winter, Lake Placid will be the site of Olympic trials to select competitors for many of the Olympic events in Albertville, France. Among the spectator events will be ski jumping, luge, biathlon and speed skating. At Whiteface, selections will be made for the freestyle ski team in mogul skiing, aerial maneuvers and ballet skiing. For information about these events: (800) 462-6236 or (518) 513-1655.

MOUNT SNOW
Mount Snow, Vt. 05356
(802) 464-3333; snow report, (802) 464-2151; reservations, (800) 245-7669 and, in Vermont, (802) 464-8501
On the Slopes The most surprising thing about Mount Snow is its size. Here, in Vermont's Deep South, is a major ski mountain wreathed with slopes and trails for skiers of all abilities. Besides Mount Snow's own four faces (including its recently enlarged south-facing Sunbrook area), ticket holders can now ski Haystack Mountain, three miles away. Mount Snow took over operation of the financially troubled Haystack this fall.
The addition of Haystack gives skiers access to 47 miles of trails and 24 lifts (including two quad and three triple chairlifts). Mount Snow has a 1,700-foot vertical drop. Most of the Haystack and Carinthia trails -- Mount Snow bought neighboring Carinthia Ski Area in 1986 -- are gentle enough for novices and low-intermediates to ski with comfort. But on the North Face, trails like Ripcord, Plummet and Jaws of Death live up to their names.
The most popular way down the mountain is on Exhibition, a wide and moderately pitched mile-and-a-half trail that runs beside the high-speed detachable quad lift, Yankee Clipper. Mount Snow has enough variety of terrain for a family of skiers with widely differing abilities to enjoy separate ski vacations at the same resort.
A one-day adult ticket costs $36 on weekdays, $40 on weekends. A five-day package costs $155. Haystack only, $32 on weekends, $24 midweek.
A tip: On crowded weekends, park the car at the Carinthia base lodge, where you can buy lift tickets and rent equipment. The lot is emptier and lines are shorter than at the main Mount Snow lodge.
 For Nonskiers Mount Snow was the first ski resort designed as a place for nonskiers to have fun. It was created in 1954 by a ski visionary, Walter Schoenknecht. He was much reviled for bringing nonathletes -- especially nonathletes with New York accents -- to the ski slopes. But he was determined to cater to all who wanted to come. To make sure they did, Mr. Schoenknecht created a ski theme park. He built an artificial lake, a gondola to carry visitors over the lake, a heated outdoor swimming pool, and an indoor ice rink. All except the lake (a water source for snowmaking) are gone now, but the spirit of off-slope pleasures remains. During reasonable snow years, the region offers cross-country skiing and snowmobile touring. Mount Snow provides sleigh rides four nights a week. Rides last 45 minutes and cost $12, $8 for children.
Both Snow Lake Lodge and Seasons Condominiums have fitness centers for their guests. The Hermitage, an inn and restaurant, has a game farm that welcomes visitors -- (802) 464-3511. In nearby Wilmington are a historic country store museum, the 1836 Country Store, (802) 464-5102, and a woodworking shop, John McLeod, (802) 464-3332, as well as antique, art, craft and specialty shops, horseback riding, a bowling alley and movie theater.
The Hermitage specializes in game dishes; the Inn at Sawmill Farm offers somewhat bland Continental food in an elegant, formal setting; Le Petit Chef has a largely French menu, and Two Tannery Road is popular with residents. Poncho's Wreck serves Mexican food in rooms filled with nautical paraphernalia, and the area's newest eating place is Panda North, a Chinese restaurant.
For dancing, the Snow Barn and Deacon's Den provide live music several nights a week. Mount Snow's children's programs accommodate skiing and pre-skiing children from 6 weeks to 12 years old.

 On the Slopes Sugarbush is a resort on the brink of rebirth. Founded as the American St. Moritz, it quickly established itself as the place to ski and be seen skiing in the East. Kennedys, Cassinis, Heinzes and Avons skied here, along with many of New York's leading fashion models. But fashions change, and the glitterati moved on. Despite its outstanding ski mountains, Sugarbush fell behind other resorts in snowmaking, lift capacity and amenities. It was particularly lacking in family activities. In the past two years, Sugarbush has made a major -- and expensive -- effort to regain its place in the snow. Last year the resort replaced its slowest lifts with three quad chairlifts including the Green Mountain Express, billed as "the fastest detachable quad in the world." Snow grooming has also improved and, by next season, a new snowmaking system should be in operation.
Skiers can choose from two major mountains, Sugarbush North (formerly Glen Ellen) and South. With a 4,135-foot summit and 2,600-foot vertical drop, Sugarbush North is the higher of the two and has the greater snowmaking capacity. North's toughest trails are Upper FIS, a broad, steep, and bump-ridden slope, and the aptly named Exterminator, a narrow and precipitous chute. For intermediates, Rim Run winds around the mountain before feeding into the long and gentle Northway. When natural snow is sparse, Which Way is the trail of choice.
While not quite as high or well covered with snowmaking, Sugarbush South has the more interesting trails. Organgrinder, a steep, straight run from the 3,975-foot summit (the vertical drop is 2,400 feet) to the base lodge, is the fastest way down. Jester is the most enjoyable. A classic high-intermediate trail, Jester wanders down from the peak, twisting, turning and reversing on itself as it makes its eccentric way toward the bottom.
A Sugarbush day ticket costs $35 midweek, $38 on weekends and holidays. A five-day midweek pass costs $145 and includes Sunday afternoon skiing and one day's use of the Sugarbush Sports Center.
A tip: Sugarbush South is a true bowl whose broad sides offer a range of terrain and conditions. Its edges may be awash in sunshine while the center is dark and cold. Before getting on a lift, check with the ski patrol for the day's best conditions.
 For Nonskiers While there is no shortage of things to do around Sugarbush, the chief attraction is the area's natural beauty. In a state famous for scenery, the Mad River Valley is outstanding -- massive mountains, narrow valleys, snaking streams. Within the valley, the towns of Waitsfield and Warren combine the look of old Vermont with the feel of new prosperity. Antique shops, art galleries and specialty food markets abound.
Without leaving the valley, the nonskier can try snowshoeing, ice skating, sleigh riding and snowmobiling. Within a half-hour's drive are tours of Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream factory, Cold Hollow Cider Mill, Champlain Chocolates and Vermont Distilleries.
Sugarbush maintains excellent swimming, tennis, squash, racquetball and workout facilities at the Sports Center within minutes of the base lodge. Use of the center costs $12 a day, plus court fees, $12 an hour for tennis, for example. Since last year, the resort has also established an activity program for children and teen-agers.

IN SEARCH OF EXCESS
The Overcompensation of American Executives.
By Graef S. Crystal.
272 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company. $19.95. 
 HOW much should a company's top executive be paid? In Plato's view, Graef S. Crystal tells us, no one should earn more than five times the pay of the lowest-paid workers in a community. J. P. Morgan, Mr. Crystal says, suggested a cap of 20 times the pay of the lowest-paid worker in an enterprise.
In this revealing study of executive compensation, Mr. Crystal shows that executive pay in the United States falls nowhere close to either of those guidelines. The typical chief executive of a major American company earns roughly 160 times what the average American worker earns, says Mr. Crystal, an adjunct professor of business at the University of California, Berkeley, and a longtime business consultant. One of his recent studies found that 86 percent of the chief executive officers of 200 big American companies made more than $1 million in base salary -- and that the average pay of these chief executives was $2.8 million if bonuses, stock options and other types of special compensation were included.
Even those numbers pale next to the earnings of some of this country's highest-paid executives. Take Steven J. Ross, chairman of Time Warner Inc., who Mr. Crystal, dubbing him "the Prince of Pay," says is probably the highest-paid chief executive ever of a publicly owned company. Mr. Ross has done well for his shareholders but far better for himself. By Mr. Crystal's calculations -- and he walks the reader through them, step by step -- Mr. Ross took home about $275 million between 1973 and 1989, not counting lavish perquisites or company-financed insurance policies or pension.
Then there's Michael Eisner, chief executive of the Walt Disney Company. He, too, has done quite well for shareholders and for himself. Last year he earned $750,000 in salary plus a bonus of $10.5 million. But his real payoff, Mr. Crystal says, has come from stock options: as Disney's shares have soared under Mr. Eisner's fine touch, so have his generous options grants. He realized a profit of $32.6 million in 1989, when he cashed in some of them, but still has many more left.
That is not to say Mr. Crystal disapproves of all big pay. He says some high-earning executives, such as Mr. Eisner and Anthony O'Reilly of H. J. Heinz, are "good guys"; although they have earned fabulous sums, they would have done less well if their companies' performance had faltered.
What Mr. Crystal does not like is pay plans that rise when a company's earnings do not. Such arrangements include grants of "restricted shares," which the author describes as outright gifts of stock. Among the recipients he cites are Lee Iacocca of Chrysler and Louis V. Gerstner of RJR Nabisco.
He reports on other tricks, too. He points to Coca-Cola, for example, which eased the burden on its chief executive, Roberto Goizueta, by paying not only his salary and bonus but also the taxes on the bonus shares it gave him. Georgia-Pacific went one step farther for its chairman, T. Marshall Hahn, paying not only the taxes on the bonus shares but also the taxes on the taxes, the taxes on that and so forth. At least, Mr. Crystal says, the company set a high standard before the chief executive could take title to all of the shares. It allowed the executive to collect all of the restricted shares granted him only if the stock price had doubled within five years. The stock had to rise by at least 20 percent over five years for the executive to be allowed to claim any of these shares.
Nonetheless, Mr. Crystal concludes that the system is "rotten to the core," though he is quick to confess that as a corporate pay consultant he helped create the problem. Now he is trying to right the wrong by working for shareholder groups and by writing articles -- and "In Search of Excess." The result is a highly informative, very readable indictment of executive pay in the United States, larded with instructive examples.
ABOUT the only quibble I have is the strings of numbers Mr. Crystal presents to show how companies and their executives' pay have grown. Charts or tables might have made the numbers more accessible.
But the figures are there, and so is the message: that the United States cannot afford such extravagance and greed -- particularly when foreign competitors are holding costs down by paying executives considerably less. In Japan, for example, the typical chief executive earns less than 20 times the pay of the average worker. In Germany, the figure is 21 times.
Is there a way out? Mr. Crystal offers some hope and some ideas. He recommends that directors who set executive pay hire their own outside advisers. He suggests that they include foreign competitors among the companies they use as bench marks in deciding what to pay their executives. He would like to see executive pay packages fall more sharply when corporate performance falls, and he would like the Government to aim tax breaks only at pay plans that really serve as incentives to better performance.
As a first step, directors -- and shareholders and consumers -- would be well served to read "In Search of Excess." It is a thoughtful and generally entertaining look at an important subject. Readers may not all be willing to join Mr. Crystal's crusade "to put greed to work in the service of the U.S. economy," but they will have a better appreciation of why it is not working now.

HEADLINE: Perspectives: The Benenson Approach;
A Sometime Builder at Work in 2 Cities

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
THE word that Charles B. Benenson gives to current conditions in the real-estate business is "peculiar." By that he means it is difficult to get financing. He finds it peculiar that development projects he considers sound should have that problem.
"How can we get out of a recession if builders can't build?" he asks. 
 Since Mr. Benenson has two major residential buildings under construction, one in Manhattan and one in Cincinnati, the lament itself might seem peculiar. Mr. Benenson doesn't even consider himself principally a builder. "We build maybe once every 10 years," he says.
But it took a year to get institutional financing for the Cincinnati project, even though it was for only 50 percent of the development cost, he said. He has not forgotten that experience, or the ongoing need that owners of commercial property have for new mortgage money to refinance existing buildings. Nowadays some banks are seeking to reduce their positions in investment real estate even when properties are fully rented with seemingly secure tenants, owners say.
The financing issue is constantly on the mind of investors like Mr. Benenson, who at 78 years of age is very much in charge at Benenson Capital Company. That is the name he gave in 1972 to a business founded by his father, Benjamin, who started building about 1905. The son joined his father in 1937, four years out of Yale. Now his own three children are partners. He presides over a small but busy warren of offices at 708 Third Avenue, at 45th Street.
Benjamin Benenson built in the Bronx. "He built five-story buildings -- today we call them tenements -- and he sold them," Mr. Benenson says. "His best customers were the butchers in the neighborhood."
In the lingo of the business, Benjamin Benenson was also an operator, which is to say a buyer and seller of investment properties. That led him to larger properties in Manhattan. Now Benenson Capital primarily holds commercial property, usually housing only one large tenant with a very long lease. The tenants in New York City include Sotheby's, Potamkin Cadillac and Avis Rent-a-Car.
"OUR philosophy is to hold and keep, if possible free and clear," Mr. Benenson says. The approach makes him more a long-term investor than a manager of property or a creator of it through new construction.
It also provides him with land that over time is suitable for redevelopment. Then he puts on his developer's hat. In 1976 he built the Connaught, a 360-unit rental apartment house on the southeast corner of Second Avenue and 54th Street. He kept it for five years and then sold it as a co-op under an eviction plan. All but 20 tenants bought.
The hat went on again in the mid-80's, when he began to vacate the apartment house he owned across Second Avenue from the Connaught, on the southwest corner of 54th Street. There were 49 tenants and it took five years to get them all to leave.
Mr. Benenson admits to impatience to start construction once that costly process ended, which may explain how he comes to be offering apartments at $600 a square foot in a far less than exuberant sales market. "I had hopes and still do that we'll be successful," he said. "The market wasn't that bad when we started."
THE building is Le Grand Palais, with 180 well-appointed units, at 250 East 54th Street. There are 40 floors to the building, and 6,000 square feet of stores on the ground level. Below that there is a "selling basement" of 10,000 square feet. And below that there is still another basement with a pool and a health club.
A two-bedroom, two-bath apartment with 1,200 square feet on the 20th floor has an asking price of $698,000. A one-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath unit on the fifth floor is listed at $330,000 and the three-bedroom, three-bath units at the 27th to 38th floors go for around $1 million. The five penthouse apartments, each with a floor to itself, are listed at $2.5 million to $3 million. None of the apartments is yet under contract to be sold.
The architect, the firm of Fox & Fowle, has designed a distinctive glass-enclosed tower with colorful wraparound bands of blue or red every fifth floor. One unusual aspect is that the tower has two contrasting shapes -- rectangular facing Second Avenue and curvilinear on the 54th Street side. They seem to fold into each other above the squarish base.
Just west of the building lies another 10,000-square-foot parcel that Mr. Benenson owns. Sitting on it is a garage building leased to Avis Rent-a-Car. The Avis parcel contributed developments rights to the corner plot.
In Cincinnati, Benenson Capital stepped in last year as a 50 percent partner in a development on the Ohio River called Adams Landing. It was struggling for lack of financing. His participation led to a construction start on the first building in an ambitious long-term development.
Ultimately, Adams Landing is supposed to have 1,250 housing units. Under construction so far is limited to a luxury condominium with 77 apartments on 13 floors. The search for institutional financing led finally to a $28.5 million loan from Yasudo Trust and Banking Company of Tokyo.
Adams Landing was started by Cincinnati real-estate figures -- George Stewart, an investor, and two builders, Alan Zaring and David Tipton. The site is on Pete Rose Boulevard a mile east of downtown.
When possible, Mr. Benenson does not go it alone. He picks up a phone and calls old friends, like Frederick P. Rose, the chairman of Rose Associates; or Jack D. Weiler, a founding partner of Swig Weiler & Arnow, the real-estate development and management firm; or Preston Robert Tisch and Lawrence A. Tisch, the co-chief executive officers of the Loews Corporation (and in Lawrence's case, chairman of CBS Inc. as well). They are real-estate investors all; the Tisches are partners on 54th Street.
"I know what they like," says Mr. Benenson. "If we find it, we go in together. Sometimes they like it better than I do so I let them have it. They don't like Cincinnati. None of my friends do. But I happen to love it."
Adams Landing is an unusual project for Cincinnati, where people are not used to paying $300,000 and more for high-rise living. As construction continues, it will begin to show Benenson touches, including a steel sculpture 40 feet high by Alex Lieberman, whose work the developer has used before.
THE Benenson activities extend beyond New York City and Cincinnati. In 1959, Mr. Benenson and Mr. Weiler bought an office building at 18th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington. In 1983, the World Bank leased the land, demolished the building and used it as part of an assemblage for a new headquarters. The Benenson-Weiler interests took back a lease on the land that lasts almost a century.
In another Washington deal, they bought the elegant Willard Hotel on 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue in 1960 and later set off a furor when they proposed to tear it down. That episode gave impetus to the efforts of the Pennsylvania Avenue Commission to gain Government financing for what has become a Pennsylvania Avenue renaissance. It also gave rise to a $9 million condemnation payment (the award plus interest) at the conclusion of a lawsuit 12 years later.
Mr. Benenson owns the land under 400 Park Avenue, an office building on 54th Street leased to Fisher Brothers. In partnership with the Tisches, he owns the automobile and industrial building at 787 11th Avenue, also on 54th Street, which was built in 1930 for Packard cars and is now occupied by Potamkin Cadillac and an Oriental rug dealer. With his two brothers he owns the Sotheby's building, at 1334 York Avenue, at 72d Street.
And in Miami, a mile west of the airport, he owns industrial property with the Tisches called Beacon Center. It was vacant land when they bought it in 1969. Now it has 400,000 square feet of buildings, mostly in the 60,000- to 100,000-square-foot range. More buildings are planned.
As for Le Grand Palais, where Crossland Savings Bank is a participating investor, Mr. Benenson began a sales campaign only a few weeks ago, having held off in hopes of a market improvement. He says it is too soon to say whether he has found that improvement.
If he doesn't, what will he do? Rent apartments out?
"Sure, of course," he said. "It's a strong rental market."

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Ready for Next Act in the Tax Drama

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
STATE legislators convene in special session this week to amend, or even repeal, the state's three-month-old income tax law, and most lawmakers expect a resumption of last summer's budget turmoil. But the political calendar is adding a powerful new twist.
Budget experts and legislators on both sides of the tax issue said the timing of the session -- in the middle of the fiscal year, just before the political campaign cycle that begins in January and leads to next fall's midterm elections -- has loaded the process with weighty political and fiscal considerations. 
"It's much harder to do things mid-way," said Michael B. Levin, a vice president of the Connecticut Policy and Economic Council, a nonprofit budget research group. "I just see a kind of chaotic situation there."
 With less than seven months left before the next budget year starts, and only three months before the next regular legislative session is supposed to open, to pass that budget, an important question about the special session is when changes that are passed would take effect. Jan. 1? Retroactive to Aug. 22, when the budget and income tax were passed? July 1, when the next fiscal year begins? Or immediately upon passage? Compounding such decisions is that every day makes a change in the current budget year harder to impose. And time erodes the impact of the spending cuts that are certain to be offered by both Republicans and moderate Democrats. Eliminating a $100 million program, for instance, would only save perhaps $50 million by July 1, because months of higher spending commitments have already passed. If a tax is cut, is the change calculated into this year's budget or next?
But politics alone could spin the special session into an eccentric orbit. Last month lawmakers saw more than 40,000 angry residents converge on the State Capitol to rally against the income tax in one of the biggest protest demonstrations ever held in the state. Two weeks ago they saw the New Jersey Legislature turned inside out by tax-angry voters, who evicted a long-running Democratic majority and installed enough Republicans to override any veto from Gov. Jim Florio. And if Connecticut's lawmakers look ahead instead of back, they see more budget difficulties next spring, when all 187 members of the General Assembly have to face the voters.
There is also a structural stumbling block. In the long summer session the lawmakers passed three budgets without income taxes only to see them vetoed by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. The General Assembly now has a majority willing to vote for repeal of the income tax, but there does not seem to be a two-thirds majority needed to override Mr. Weicker's promised veto.
For many Republicans, who have led the repeal drive but simultaneously pledged to make the income tax the issue of the 1992 campaign if repeal fails, the special session presents a painful choice of strategies. If they win now and repeal the tax, will they reduce the chances for a New Jersey-style rout of the Democrats next year, because the battle will be over? If repeal fails, do Republicans support a Democrat-led effort to amend the tax law and reduce the burden on middle- and upper-middle-income families -- or keep the law, as bad as they think it is, the better to bash Democrats with next year?
"It's a very serious tug-of-war in one's head," said Senator Philip S. Robertson, a Republican from Cheshire. Mr. Robertson said that he would vote for repeal, but that if repeal failed, he might also support a repaired income tax, even if it meant lessening the chances of a big Republican victory next year.
 
Prospect of Paralysis
 "The political argument would be to vote against repair, so the thing stays as bad as it is," Mr. Robertson said. "But I don't think I could do that. If they're trying to make the income tax better than the atrocity that they passed, then certainly I have an obligation to support those things that in a negative environment will at least somehow remove some of the negativism."
Many lawmakers say, however, that their greatest fear is not that the special session will go headlong into changing tax laws, but rather that the General Assembly will simply be paralyzed and find itself unable to do anything at all.
"The greatest risk that the state faces is more indecision," said Senator Kevin B. Sullivan, a Democrat from West Hartford. Mr. Sullivan said he favors the income tax, but he has vowed to try to replace it with a more progressive system that would allow tax cuts for middle-class families. He said that if a deadlock emerges by mid-December, he will advocate jumping ahead of the regular February session and beginning work on next year's budget immediately, with the goal of forging an 18-month budget through June of 1993.
The Republican leader in the House, Edward C. Krawiecki Jr. of Bristol, also said that new rules were being considered for the session, in an effort to avoid a replay of last summer's stalemate. He said, for example, that a system of time blocks, similar to the format used in the United States Senate, was being considered to limit floor debate on the various tax bills. That would give each party a block of time, say four hours, that could be divided among members. Mr. Krawiecki said the chamber has not imposed formal debate limits in at least 15 years.
 
Schedule Is Proposed
 Under the preliminary draft of the rules that circulated at the Capitol last week, lawmakers would be prevented from single-handedly starting a filibuster, by proposing dozens of amendments for example. The rules would require any amendment to have multiple sponsors.
The draft document said that all bills for the session would have to be filed by Tuesday, with statewide public hearings tentatively scheduled for Nov. 22-25, with a vote on repealing the tax to be held between Dec. 6 and 9. The rest of the month, through the thicket of holidays, could see the attempted override of the veto, and probably only then would an attempt be made to amend the tax law. Also on the early agenda is a proposal to discuss the possibility of holding a statewide referendum on the income tax sometime next year.
"Will the troops be home for Christmas?" asked Mr. Sullivan. "It's doable. It's possible. But I am not altogether sure. A lot of people are a little more frightened and gun-shy than they were a few months ago."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: B. Altman's;
A Metamorphosis For 880,000 Sq. Ft.

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
TWO years ago, as B. Altman held its final sale, the crush was so great that management turned off the escalators to control traffic. Today, on the rare occasions when the escalators are turned on, their gentle rumbling is the loudest sound to be heard through the vast selling floors, each a two-acre forest of 22-foot-high columns.
What can be done with such an expanse, with floors that fill the block from Fifth to Madison Avenue, 34th to 35th Street? 
 A department store is obvious enough -- that was the purpose for which the 880,000-square-foot building at 361 Fifth Avenue was constructed, beginning in 1905. But the grand emporium is a vanishing species. The need of financial-service concerns for ample trading floors also is evaporating.
So the owners, KMO-361 Realty Associates of Manhattan, had to improvise. (The K is for Earle W. Kazis, the M for Peter L. Malkin, the O for Morton L. Olshan.)
Their solution is as unorthodox as their property is unusual: 650,000 square feet to be the New York Resource Center -- a mart for office and home furniture, fabrics, flooring, wall coverings, kitchen and bathroom fixtures, lighting and accessories. The center is to include a theater, conference center, meeting rooms and concierge. The architects are Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates and Emery Roth & Sons, both of Manhattan.
Most of the rest of the building, some 200,000 square feet, is to be the Science, Industry and Business Library, a division of the New York Public Library.
The owners expect that the library lease will be signed early next year, said Richard P. Steinberg, president of the Resource Center. "Once we start with the library," he added, "we've committed the building."
There are 12 deals in "active negotiation" for 90,000 square feet, said Daniel P. Weinreb, senior vice president of the center. The net rent ranges in the $20's, he said.
KMO-361 bought both the real estate and retail operations of B. Altman & Company in 1985 but soon sold the stores to Anthony R. Conti and Philip C. Semprevivo, who resold them in 1987 to L. J. Hooker, the American arm of the Hooker Corporation of Australia, headed by George Herscu.
In 1987, when B. Altman was still a going concern, the owners envisioned transforming the building into a complex called the Altman Business Center. Under this plan, the store would have been shrunk, to occupy only the lower five stories of the full-block building.
On the Fifth Avenue side, which has eight stories, the top three floors would have been leased out as office space. On the Madison Avenue side, which has 13 stories, an additional six floors would have been constructed, creating a 19-story tower. Meanwhile, Hooker planned a $25 million to $30 million renovation of the store itself.
Because B. Altman's is a landmark, the proposal to add extra floors was subject to approval by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. Also, as a zoning matter, it was subject to approval from the City Planning Commission and the Board of Estimate.
By the time all these approvals were won, however, the matter was moot.
B. Altman and L. J. Hooker filed for protection under the Federal bankruptcy law in August 1989. Within three months, B. Altman's was having the last sale in its 124-year history. (Mr. Herscu is now serving a prison sentence in Australia for bribery.)
Today, the owners of the building see some cause for gratitude that they were prevented from starting construction in 1988 or 1989. "Thank God, we didn't," Mr. Steinberg said. "If Altman's had gone under while we were under way, it would have been very painful."
In 1990, the landlords got back five suburban stores and the Fifth Avenue flagship -- "vacant and broom clean," in Mr. Steinberg's words. "In 1985 and 1986, we had all kinds of interest from Wall Street," he said. "By the time the building was vacant that market had disappeared." So, too, has the idea of a tower on Madison Avenue. "There is no way we can build new space and get it onto the market economically," he said.
Mr. Steinberg credits the market consultant Judson H. Spencer with the idea of turning the B. Altman store into a mart. At the same time as the Resource Center concept was being developed, however, another seed was planted that proved to be decisive.
The Public Library was looking to gather its Science, Industry and Business Library under one roof. Edwin S. Holmgren, the head of the branch library system, happened to be walking past the empty store when it dawned on him what a "wonderful location" it would be, recalled John Masten, the executive vice president of the library.
"ALTMAN'S was absolutely the best candidate of all the space we looked at," Mr. Masten said. It was only six blocks south of the Central Research Library and five blocks south of the Mid-Manhattan Library (the former Arnold Constable store). It had high ceilings and large, open floors.
It also had owners who were eager to get tenants. "The market, of course is soft now," Mr. Masten said. "The weakness in the real estate market is an important reason why it's possible for us to go ahead." Mr. Masten would not disclose the proposed terms.
The library will occupy six floors and the basement of the Madison Avenue side of the building. "It gives us our own front door and our own identity," Mr. Masten said.
"The library was the first to come forward," Mr. Steinberg said. "We looked at it as an anchor tenant, a bellwether to attract another tenant. The library was important to us in terms of getting the building started."
"There are a number of reasons why it is attractive to the industry," Mr. Weinreb said. "No. 1 is the location. No. 2 is the physical characteristics: floor size, ceiling heights, escalators, freight elevators, loading docks. No. 3 is the architectural significance of the building -- this is a grand dame of New York. No. 4 is the critical mass. With 650,000 square feet, we felt it was large enough to make an impact."
But aren't there enough homes for the industry -- the International Design Center, New York (I.D.C.N.Y.) in Long Island City, Queens; the Architects & Designers Building, 150 East 58th Street, at Third Avenue; the Decoration & Design Building, 979 Third Avenue, at 58th Street, and the Furniture Mart, 200 Lexington Avenue, at 32d Street?
"A significant number of the people we're talking to are not in any of the major buildings," Mr. Steinberg said. "Notwithstanding all the negatives in the furnishing business and the economy in general, it appeared there was an opportunity here. We felt, in the long run, this is needed."
Thomrock Realty of Queens, which owns the International Design Center, believes the market is saturated, having reached that conclusion in the 1980's when a mart was part of the 42d Street Development Project.
"We didn't feel the market was sufficient to support another location," said Harvey Schulweis, a general partner in Thomrock.
Center One and Center Two at the Long Island City complex have about 950,000 square feet between them, with 600,000 currently occupied by showrooms and 150,000 by offices of the School Construction Authority.
"Among the contract furniture industry," Mr. Schulweis said, "certainly the dominant companies are located at I.D.C.N.Y. The commitment to I.D.C.N.Y. as far as this industry is concerned has been total."
"Everyone of these major tenants has been approached by Altman's," said Arthur Katz, executive vice president of I.D.C. Inc., "and everyone has turned them down."
The Architects & Designers Building is the 160,000-square-foot base of a 500,000-square-foot office tower, owned by a Netherlands Antilles corporation called 150 Realty N.V.
Robert L. Billingsley, a partner in Abrams Benisch Riker, which manages and leases the building, seemed rather unconcerned about competition.
"We're never going to be a candidate for tenants looking for 30,000 square feet," he said. "We're going to be looking for smaller tenants who want visibility. We like to think of this as the Seagram Building of contract furnishings."

HEADLINE: In the Region: Connecticut and Westchester;
Slump Hits Connecticut Marinas Hard

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
EACH summer, thousands of sailboats, stately yachts and zigzagging speedboats create a postcard picture on Connecticut's rivers and Long Island Sound.
But now the recession has virtually beached the recreational boating industry, and in Connecticut some 25,000 marinas and dockominiums representing one of the state's most popular diversions are locked into the Northeastern slump, declining as much as 50 percent in value. 
 "Boating is a discretionary activity," said Ray Bovich, president of the Connecticut Marine Trades Association in Essex. "When the economy weakens, it's the first expenditure to go and the last to recover." His organization serves about 325 marine business members, down from 400 three years ago.
Lending institutions, already overwhelmed with bankrupt commercial and residential real estate, are having difficulty absorbing this new wave of insolvency. The properties are especially troublesome because they must continue to operate to minimize losses, and banks do not have the skills to oversee maintenance, environmental procedures and administration.
"We are evaluating a portfolio of 5,000 properties, a few of which are marinas, and we are expecting more," said George W. Burton, chief lending officer for the Chase Manhattan Bank of Connecticut. No estimates are available for the total number of marinas in trouble in Connecticut.
"They are very similar to other real estate of the go-go 80's," Mr. Burton said of marinas. "There was a levering up of the sales price as they turned over, and now that there is less demand they are suffering from a loss of cash flow. They are not selling as much fuel, or making repairs, and a surplus of space is bringing rental charges down."
The industry has been further depressed by an array of state taxes on boat sales, brokers' commissions, slip rentals and winter storage and the 10 percent Federal luxury sales tax. A limited survey by the Connecticut Department of Revenue Services disclosed that 1,382 boat owners last year owed more than $30.2 million in taxes.
"A marina is not on the same economic level as an office building or apartment house," said Michael Sachs, president of Westrec Marina Management in North Hollywood, Calif., owners and operators of two dozen large marinas around the country. "In an office building, you know what you get. It was a mistake to look at marinas as a form of real estate that would appreciate ad infinitum. It's a business that must have active, expert management."
CONVERSIONS to dockside condominiums were another major mistake, he said. "Predominantly located in the Northeast, they were for owner-users who spend more time partying at the dock than on the water, or for overleveraged speculators," he said.
Fifty 25-foot slips renting at $60 a foot will bring in $1,500 a slip, or $75,000 a season with no vacancies. But Mr. Sachs said that that amount "will not cover property taxes, insurance, utilities, office expenses, telephone, advertising, maintenance, parking, security and personnel, not to mention the problems of getting several owners to cooperate in management decisions."
A serious problem peculiar to marina property is getting the local, state and Federal permits controlling public access to waterways, pollution, dredging, salt marshes, breeding grounds for fish, marine plant life and other environmental concerns. Compliance can cost millions of dollars.
Gurdon Buck, a partner with Dwight Merriam in the Hartford law firm of Robinson & Cole, represents lenders who have taken over coastal projects. "An alarming pattern of flipping from developer to developer," he said, "frequently reveals that new owners, down to the foreclosure owner, failed to transfer or keep in force the necessary permits. When the lender takes back the project, he has no permits with which to complete it, and therefore no value."
Mansfield Landing on the Farm River in East Haven, now the property of Den Norske Bank, a Norwegian investor with offices in Manhattan, is typical. Opened in 1966 as a small family business, the 47-acre property was sold in 1986 after work had begun on 182 condominium units and 207 new slips. "Since then it has been resold four times, with each owner profiting by $500,000 to $1 million," Mr. Merriam said. In the process the permits expired and the project is not only incomplete with only 44 condominium units built, but is also in violation of many new government regulations.
"In some cases," Mr. Buck said, "the lender starts dragging his feet, finding himself on a phantasmagorical journey through a maze of permitting requirements." In a situation where the project is too complex and expensive, the bank can refuse to take title and thereby avoid becoming entangled in penalties and legal problems. It can abandon the property in foreclosure, even though it may mean walking away from a tremendous amount of money, according to the lawyers.
"What drove marina fever in the 80's was a perception that Connecticut was running out of shoreline and no new marinas would be built," said John Scott, president of Scott, Fitton & Company, a real estate research and consulting firm in Milford. "There was also a misperceived demand for residential development in conjunction with marinas, where slips were reserved for residents. But only 7 percent of those who bought residential units bought slips. Today, the condos are worth no more with a slip than without."
BECAUSE of state and Federal coastal regulations there are indeed few locations where new marinas can be built along Connecticut's 583 linear miles of shorefront (100 miles as the crow flies). And areas currently zoned for water-related purposes cannot be rezoned for other uses.
One solution is expected to lie in mergers of small side-by-side marinas. "In Greenwich, New London and elsewhere there are three and four marinas in a row and in trouble," said Arthur Collins, president of Collins Enterprises, a Stamford-based developer. "Put them together and you may have 500 viable slips. Separately, there is not enough cash flow to support them."
Mr. Collins, Mr. Sachs and Mr. Merriam are among the experts who will address a public seminar on positioning marinas for sale, Wednesday from 8:30 A.M. to 4 P.M. at the Seamen's Institute, South Street Seaport in Manhattan. For information call Coulter & Delaney, marina consultants, (203) 440-3380.

HEADLINE: At County Restaurants, Empty Tables and Smaller Checks

BYLINE: By TESSA MELVIN

 BODY:
WANT to know how the economy is doing in Westchester? Go out for dinner. But wait for the weekend if you don't want to eat amid a sea of empty tables. Despite specially priced entrees, early-bird specials, discount coupons, low-cost wines and eager waiters, most consumers are staying home.
"You don't hear anyone bragging about their raises and promotions anymore," said Neil Novich, one of the owners of John Richards, a popular restaurant and pub in Dobbs Ferry, where business has declined for the first time in six years. 
 "You hear how '10 in my office just got laid off,' or '30 in my department just got their notices,' " said Mr. Novich, who doubles as the bartender. "People are worried, and they are not spending."
 
More Sharing and No Dessert
 A random survey of county restaurants, from those serving haute cuisine to those offering ethnic specialities, shows the same downward trend. Empty tables have increased, and the tabs have decreased. Customers are sharing entrees, drinking cheaper wine and skipping dessert. Worst of all for the owners, customers are coming less often.
Business in restaurants, hotels and taverns in the New York City area is off 20 to 30 percent compared with last year, industry analysts say, adding that a number of restaurants have closed. "The turnover is not so pronounced, because typically another restaurant springs up on the same spot," said Fred Sampson, executive director of the New York State Restaurant Association.
Restaurants are reacting to the situation in a variety of ways.
 
A Challenge to Creativity
 Although he has substituted domestic mushrooms for the more expensive shiitakes, Kevin Patrick Sullivan, the chef at Dudley's Restaurant, said the tough economy is more a challenge to his creativity than a signal for cutbacks in the kitchen.
For six weeks, the big seller at this tiny neighborhood restaurant in the heart of Ossining's historic district has been hanger steak, pan-seared with smoked bacon, green peppercorns, Cognac and cream.
"It's the part of the beef the butcher normally keeps for himself," Mr. Sullivan said, adding that although the cut tastes better and costs less than sirloin, it is more difficult to prepare. "It's a creative idea in response to the economy," said Mr. Sullivan, a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America of Hyde Park. "Anyone can use expensive cuts of meat. The key is to know how to make something out of the less-expensive parts."
The same principle was behind Mr. Sullivan's introduction of a second popular entree, Broken Arrow Ranch antelope, barbecued and served with port wine, shallots and pink peppercorns.
Despite Mr. Sullivan's creative ministrations and a loyal following that extends beyond Ossining, business at Dudley's has fallen off this year for the first time since Ralph and Joan Rink and their son Mark of Chappaqua bought the restaurant eight years ago.
Because of its small size -- 30 tables -- the restaurant has not had to lay off staff, but Mark Rink said, "Waiters are not making as much money as before."
The economic situation has dealt a harsh blow to one of the county's top-rated Indian restaurants, Abhilash India Cuisine in New Rochelle. Knowledgeable customers still flock in on weekends to sample Jose Kurian's chicken tikka, marinated in herbs and cooked in the tandoor oven, or his shrimp bhuna with spiced tomato gravy. But in the last few months, 40 percent of the staff has been laid off; part of the main dining room has been closed, and the sitar musician is gone.
 
Fewer Customers and Lower Checks
 Both the average check amount and the head count is down, said Mr. Kurian, the owner, adding that the restaurant offers many special discounts, including two-for-one coupons at the door.
"I'm afraid to spend additional dollars in the media because I'm afraid it won't be recouped," Mr. Kurian said. "I've been here 11 years, and I've never seen anything like this."
He added: "I've paid the mortgage, so I'll be able to stay on. Meanwhile, I'm sitting tight and waiting for good news."
At the Arch in Brewster, reservations are still preferred for the $45 fixed-price dinner, George Seitz, the owner, said, but he added that customers are purusing the menu for less-expensive wines.
His customers are often avoiding such extras as fresh caviar and pate de foie gras, but the restaurant is doing a better business than during the same period last year, Mr. Seitz said.
 
Offering Inexpensive Wines
 "The economy is so bad that maybe people are saying to hell with it," Mr. Seitz said. "They seem to be saying, 'Maybe we can't buy a car or go on vacation so let's go have a good dinner and some wine.' "
Like Mr. Sullivan at Dudley's, Mr. Seitz said he was enjoying the opportunity to find creative solutions to help customers through the economic slump. "I'm trying hard to offer some great wine selections at the lower-priced end," he said. "It takes a lot of sorting out and tasting, but I've found a wonderful '86 Rully that I can offer as a $15 house wine. I tell my customers, 'Why not stick to that?' "
Liquor distributors appreciate all the help wine connoisseurs like Mr. Seitz can give them. Business, they say, has never been worse, and the poor economy is only one of the reasons.
"Clearly, if the economy was robust, we'd still be in trouble," said Scott Wexler, executive director of the United Restaurant, Hotel and Tavern Association of New York State. Higher Federal and state taxes have added 10 percent to the cost of a bottle of liquor and doubled the tax on beer, he said.
 
Weekends a Bright Spot
 Mr. Wexler added that new restrictions on drinking were affecting what he called responsible social drinkers.
"People are afraid to go out to dinner and have two drinks," he said. "If people aren't going out to dinner, they aren't going to the movies, and they aren't going to the mall to buy shoes either."
At Dudley's, reservations are still mandatory on Friday and Saturday nights, and, Mr. Rink said, weekend reservations are actually filling up faster.
"A lot of people who used to go out during the week and can't afford it," he said, "are making more of an effort to make sure the weekend counts."

HEADLINE: 'Unserviced Zones'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A new concept called "unserviced zone" must be created to accommodate the justifiable demands of condominium unit owners who are victims of discrimination in being deprived of customary municipal services. "Unserviced zones" delineates those areas that do not receive such accepted municipal services as street maintenance, street lighting, snow removal and trash removal. "Unserviced zones" are comparable to "free-trade zones" where desirable businesses are accommodated with lowered assessments and taxes and other municipal benefits. 
 Condominium unit owners not receiving such municipal services and residing in such "unserviced zones" are entitled to a reduction by the municipality in the assessed valuations of their residences. Such lessened assessments are directly related to the fact that the municipality is not expending funds to furnish such municipal services to the condominium unit owner. There are at present only 10 Connecticut municipalities furnishing the same services to all.

HEADLINE: Trapped in the Impoverished Middle Class

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

DATELINE: PEORIA, Ill.

 BODY:
Michael Storm, who earns $18.01 an hour making transmission housings at Caterpillar Inc., talks with disillusionment about his purchase last year of a new Chevrolet Cavalier, the family's first new car in years. His wife, Joanne, had totaled their 1985 Cavalier in an accident, and Mr. Storm, who likes new things, thought a new car would please her as well. But the new car has ended up angering them both.
The $237 monthly payment was almost as much as the family's mortgage and property taxes combined. And the Storms couldn't build equity in the Cavalier because its first-year drop in value was so steep it more than offset each monthly payment. "My wife is saying that my time away from home working extra hours to support the car payments isn't worth it," Mr. Storm said. 
 By Peoria standards, indeed by national standards, the Storms have not fallen on hard times. Mr. Storm's annual wages of $45,000, including overtime, puts the family well into the middle class here and in most of the United States. But, as is true of 80 percent of the nation's households, the Storms' earnings have not gained ground on inflation since the early 1970's. Mr. Storm's annual raises have been overtaken by bigger gains in the Consumer Price Index, eroding his purchasing power.
Millions of Americans are in the same position. The optimism of ever-rising prosperity they had come to expect since the 1940's, whether they were janitors, sales clerks, factory workers or managers, has faded. Median household income in 1990, adjusted for inflation, was $29,943, or $1,000 less than it was in 1973, the Census Bureau reports. For all but the 20 percent of the population with incomes above $80,000 annually, income has stagnated.
This prolonged stagnation in American incomes, widely acknowledged by politicians, economists and sociologists, grew out of corporate efforts to cut labor costs to become globally competitive -- an endeavor aided both by Reagan Administration policies and a decline in union militancy. It is debatable how much these wage sacrifices have helped America's competitiveness -- one reason why the issue is expected to be central to the coming Presidential elections.
 
A Generational Shift
 The debate will be fed by a new recognition that income stagnation is altering attitudes and behaviors in profound ways just now being understood. It is not only influencing buying patterns, explaining the growing popularity of used cars and the relentless search for discounts; it is also changing the social and economic underpinnings of cities and towns, even the tenor of family life. Above all, for the first time since World War II, a generation of children is leaving college without a sense of a prosperous future.
"These are kids who are coming of age in an era of instability that is scarring them, even in families with steady incomes," said Katherine Newman, a Columbia University anthropologist. "We don't know how it will affect their consumer behavior, their marriages and their children."
Today, the adventurous search for opportunity is no longer rewarding. For generations, Americans migrated -- going West, so to speak -- when jobs in their communities became scarce or failed to pay well. But income stagnation is a nationwide phenomenon. Migration has become futile. Peorians, for example, uprooted themselves by the thousands in the early 1980's, when recession and then massive layoffs at Caterpillar and the numerous local companies that supply Caterpillar pushed the unemployment rate here above 16 percent. By the late 1980's, they were trickling home again.
"When they got to Oklahoma and Texas, they found that the promise of good wages was a lot of talk; they worked hard and had little to show for it," said David Koehler, executive director of the Peoria Area Labor Management Council. "Now, many have come home to jobs that pay less than they once earned, but they have returned because this is where their families are to help them."
Peoria is often thought of as the quintessential, middle-American town. Once the center of the nation's prosperous liquor industry, with 26 huge distilleries, since World War II it has been the headquarters for Caterpillar Inc., whose yellow tractors and earth movers are sold worldwide.
Like the distillery workers before them, most of Caterpillar's 10,000 blue-collar employees in the Peoria area are among the nation's best-paid wage earners, receiving nearly $17 an hour on average. Indeed, of greater Peoria's 340,000 residents, roughly one-third are Caterpillar families, or families supported by workers at the handful of other manufacturers that pay assembly-line wages of $14 an hour or more: the Keystone Steel & Wire Company, the Komatsu-Dresser Company (a Caterpillar competitor) and, 40 miles away, Mitsubishi's new Diamond-Star auto plant in Bloomington.
That has helped keep Peoria's median household income, now about $32,500, slightly higher than the nation's as a whole; only 8 percent above the 1970 level, adjusted for inflation. Yet these privileged workers increasingly moonlight to make ends meet, or depend on a working spouse for essential income, or do both. Mr. Storm, for one, earned an extra $8,000 this year moonlighting as a carpenter remodeling homes. "I think my wage at Caterpillar is a fair one," he said. "But it does not put me in a position that I can flaunt my money."
Quite the contrary. When he joined Caterpillar in 1973, Mr. Storm, who is 38, earned $7 an hour. His wages since then have gone up 157 percent, but the Consumer Price Index has risen 203 percent. That helps explain why, with the eldest of the Storms' four children approaching college age, Mrs. Storm, who is 34, entered a junior college last fall to study nursing. It is one of the few nonfactory jobs in Peoria that pays nearly factory wages: $12 an hour.
Some economists had argued that income would once again rise faster than inflation by the 1990's, because there would be fewer workers in the post-baby boom generation. But anticipated labor shortages have not materialized. In fact, many companies, including Caterpillar, are still shrinking their work forces, citing hard times and heavy competition in world markets.
Donald V. Fites, chairman of Caterpillar, which is locked in a dispute with the United Auto Workers over a new labor contract, made the latter point in an interview. His view is that American incomes should tread water while those of other nations catch up. "There is a narrowing of the gap between the average American's income and that of the Mexicans,," he said. "As a human being, I think what is going on is positive. I don't think it is realistic for 250 million Americans to control so much of the world's G.N.P."
 
The Income Scramble
 In such circumstances, the income scramble becomes an almost full-time family chore. In more than two dozen recent interviews here with Caterpillar families, tradespeople, teachers, lawyers, office workers and managers, only two or three said their families now exist on a single paycheck.
Stephen and Margaret Collier were one; he earns $16.24 an hour assembling tractor treads at Caterpillar and she runs the home. But Mrs. Collier clearly sees herself as an earner. "It takes me working full-time at home to keep the bills down to the point that we can live on his income," she said. "I split the wood [for the Franklin stove], plant and work a vegetable garden [covering an acre of their three-acre plot], can vegetables, buy meat when it is on sale, help my husband fix our cars [their newest is a 1982 Ford]."
The two-earner strategy is, of course, the most obvious adjustment to stagnant wages here and elsewhere. The preference for second-hand cars is a newer, but growing phenomenon. Bruce Saurus, the local Ford dealer, said that cars repurchased by Ford from Hertz, Avis and other rental companies and then auctioned to dealers like himself now account for half his sales. "We never bought these cars at all five years ago," he said.
Peoria is also a big center for discount stores, among them Wal-Mart, Best Buy and Kohl's. A year ago, Sam's Wholesale Club, a Wal-Mart-owned nationwide chain, had its biggest first-day sales ever in Peoria: $160,000. What's more, centers funded by United Way where families can pick up a week's supply of groceries free have multiplied. There are 150 today, covering every neighborhood, compared with only 30 eight years ago, concentrated in poor neighborhoods. "I get calls from people who are working and who, if they get one extra expense, are in trouble," said Nancy Gardener, a United Way official.
A similar dynamic is herding Peorians in rising numbers to hospital emergency rooms for free treatment, even though their ailments are minor. Peoria has three major medical centers, thriving mostly on the $40 million a year that Caterpillar pays out in health insurance for its 20,000 Peoria-area employees, both white and blue collar. The Methodist Medical Center, the largest, opened a new emergency room in the late 1980's designed to handle 30,000 people a year; 50,000 came through last year. "There were people with colds," said Robert Wierman, president of the center. "Many have jobs and even health insurance, but they come here rather than pay a doctor for the deductible portion."
The housing market in Peoria reflects a more subtle impact from stagnant wages. People who once purchased two or three homes in a lifetime, trading up as families and incomes grew, now stay in one, often a small frame house in an older neighborhood.
Several neighborhoods declined in the early 1980's as home prices fell and Caterpillar workers migrated, leaving dwellings unoccupied. Other families sold, at a loss. Without enough income to buy again, they made Peoria a town of thousands of renters.
The Colliers were one family that became renters. They had married in 1971 and three years later had bought a two-bedroom frame home in East Peoria for $12,000. "It was a lower-income neighborhood and we had hopes that it would improve," Mrs. Collier said. It did not. In the 1982 recession, with property values falling throughout the Rust Belt, the Colliers said, they found themselves living next to drug dealers.
"We folded; we sold out," Mrs. Collier said. They lost $10,000 on the sale, including the money invested in an extension on the home and a beauty salon that Mr. Collier had built for his wife in the garage.
For the next five years, the Colliers rented, moving further out into semirural suburbs. Finally, with savings that Mrs. Collier had helped to accumulate with a clothing-store job, the family purchased, for $78,000, a three-bedroom prefabricated home, taking on a $600-a-month mortgage.
"We have moved to the country and isolated ourselves from undesirable people," Mrs. Collier said. "That way we have more control over our kids [two teen-aged boys]. But there is so much work that I must do here, there is not much time for social life."
 
Declining Neighborhoods
 Families that stayed behind in the declining neighborhoods formed neighborhood associations to pressure landlords to make repairs or to try to oust families considered undesirable, often because of drug involvement. "We were fighting abandoned homes as Caterpillar workers left town in search of work," said Patricia Goitein, who became president of her association after the 1982 recession reduced to $45,000 the value of the home she and her husband, an economics professor at Bradley University, had purchased in 1979 for $56,000. "And as the Bradley student population declined, landlords in the neighborhood who could no longer rent to students turned to low-income families."
Such problems helped to kill off construction of lower-priced homes; for nearly a decade, virtually no home for less than $100,000 has been built. "When people had incomes, I used to build 100 lower-priced homes and sell them and build 25 more and sell them and that lasted until the early 1980's," said G. Raymond Becker, president of Peoria's largest construction company.
New home construction instead is concentrated today on five-and-six bedroom luxury houses that sell for $250,000 and more -- the equivalent of $600,000 homes in the East. These mansions are going up in outlying suburbs, the best-known being Thousand Oaks, with its private streets on a wooded rise in the Illinois prairie. The owners are a cross-section of wealthy families, many of them doctors, but also lawyers, entrepreneurs and corporate executives.
Nevertheless, in the Peoria public mind, Thousand Oaks is the home of "the doctors." That phrase comes up repeatedly in conversations, even with people like Thomas E. Leiter, a prosperous lawyer from one of the city's old families who is president of the Peoria Historical Society.
"The doctor phenomenon reflects in part the efforts of Caterpillar to pass along to its rank and file some of the cost of medical care," he said. "The doctors are contributing to a rising expense that must be paid from limited incomes, and the strain focuses attention on the doctors and their grand homes. It has not elevated to public resentment, but there is an awareness of class distinction."
For Ms. Newman, the Columbia anthro pologist, the unusual focus on doctors in Peoria, or wealthy Asians in the New Jersey community that she has studied, is inevitable. "When times get hard," she said, "you get a much sharper sense of class identity, directed in part against those perceived as doing better than they deserve."
In hindsight, income stagnation showed up in national statistics in 1973, with the onset of the Arab oil embargo and a rising inflation rate. But for millions of Americans, the most memorable dates are those when the stagnation really took hold in their communities.
The 1981-1982 recession represented that crisis for the Midwest, and in Peoria it was compounded by two other events: a 206-day strike at Caterpillar, the longest major strike in U.A.W. history, and Caterpillar's decision to shed 24,000 employees, including 12,000 in Peoria. With Caterpillar suppliers following suit, the work force fell 12 percent.
The city fathers have tried to offset the job loss through diversification. Mayor James A. Maloof, a relentless promoter, trumpets the arrival of numerous new enterprises, among them research labs, biotechnology companies, advertising firms, telephone marketing and mail order operations, an insurance firm -- even a riverboat gambling casino.
But the diversification effort reinforced the income stagnation. The new jobs remained scarce, and wages were lower. Eighteen years ago, Caterpillar was hiring 100 people a day; in the last three years, it has added only 300.
 
False Hope in Diversity>
 "People confuse diversification and new service companies with growth," said Mr. Leiter of the historical society. "But in reality it is just re-employment of a few."
Mr. Wierman at Methodist Medical Center confirms that impression. In Caterpillar's heyday, hospital workers moved on, at the first opportunity, to the higher-paying factory jobs. Now, the work force "has become a very stable one," Mr. Wierman said.
Michael Storm knows the feeling. After the strike, Caterpillar laid him off and recalled him three times. He took several lesser-paying jobs, as machinist, mechanic, carpenter. And now, he says, he faces another layoff as Caterpillar continues to automate the transmission plant where he works. While jobs are available -- greater Peoria's unemployment rate is about 6.7 percent, lower than the national level -- good pay isn't.
Understandbly, that makes the Storms cautious. Like many other Caterpillar workers in better days, he bought a two-bedroom starter home soon after his marriage 16 years ago, in nearby Lacon. He still lives there -- having turned the bedrooms over to his two sons and two daughters, and sleeping with his wife on the living room couch.
"Our large purchases can be liquidated, with the exception of our home," he said, referring to the new Chevy Cavalier. "But if I do lose my job, my mortgage and property tax payments [$266 a month] are affordable working on minimum wage at McDonald's."
Whatever the hardships, many Peorians who entered the work force in the 1960's, before the stagnation set in, are becoming increasingly convinced that they are the last generation able to expect $40,000-and-up jobs.
Such wages, they say, won't be available to their children, except for the small percentage who can escape to careers as doctors, lawyers, engineers or highly skilled specialists. The rest are adapting through what Ms. Newman, the Columbia University anthropologist, calls "the elongation of adolescence" -- living at home longer; enrolling in hometown, state-supported junior colleges, and taking odd jobs.
Barbara Drake, the 46-year-old editor of the editorial page at the Peoria Journal Star, shares the view that she and her friends escaped the income problem, but "our kids won't." She and her husband Bernard, a marketing executive at Dresser-Komatsu, earn a healthy $110,000 a year between them. Two of their three children are in college, and dinner party conversation, she says, frequently centers on the difficulties recent graduates have earning more than $8 or $10 an hour.
Donald Barker, who earns $17.41 an hour as a machinist at Caterpillar, has steered his 19-year-old son Jayme into Illinois Central Community College in Peoria. But Jayme is studying welding and blueprint reading, hoping some day for a job at Caterpillar.
Mr. Barker and his wife, Lynne, a graphics artist for the International Business Machines Corporation, would be happier if Jayme were a liberal arts major, going on to a four-year college and hopes of prosperity.
"He has a friend who is a welder and this friend makes $8 an hour and Jayme thinks this is pretty good starting pay for someone just out of high school," Mrs. Barker said. "But that sort of money is for the rest of your life."
 
 
 
A LIMITED LABOR WAR
 Locked in a labor dispute, Caterpillar Inc. is partly shut down. The United Auto Workers struck two plants on Nov. 4 and four days later the company closed several more. The combination strike and lockout means that, nationwide, 8,000 of Caterpillar's 16,000 blue-collar workers are on the street. But so far, neither side has dared to shut down Caterpillar entirely, invoking the terrible memories of the last, 1982-83, strike.
Peoria changed forever after that 206-day strike. The main issue was American labor costs at a time of recession and intensifying global competition which had made Caterpillar unprofitable for the first time since the 1930's. That dispute ended with massive, permanent layoffs and very modest wage increases for the rest of the 1980's.
After a period of profitability, Caterpillar is losing money again: $86 million in the first three quarters and at least that much in the fourth, the company said last week. And the company is once again demanding concessions. But this time the situation is different.
Caterpillar's sales of tractors and heavy construction equipment are down in the United States and abroad because of the recession, but so are those of its competitors, chief among them Japan's Komatsu Inc. Caterpillar says it has not lost market share, as it did in the early 1980's.
That raises the question: Given that labor productivity has improved greatly, should labor have to bear more of the cost-cutting burden? The union says no because Caterpillar wages are already on a par with those of competitors. But the company disagrees. A spokesman says: "Our whole point is that we have to stay competitive if we are to keep these jobs in the United States."

Argentina's Mr. Fix-It

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES

 BODY:
Last week, the President of Argentina, Carlos Saul Menem, arrived in the United States for a whirlwind tour to drum up much needed investments and loans. But as he made the rounds in Houston, Washington, New York and Miami, many business people were carefully studying another member of the entourage: Economy Minister Domingo F. Cavallo, the architect of Argentina's stabilization program, which is fast becoming the envy of other Latin governments.
Mr. Cavallo's formula is little more than orthodox economics: prohibit the central bank from printing money unless it is backed by dollar or gold reserves; force Argentines to pay taxes; require a balanced budget monthly; lower tariffs; lay off Government workers; sell off bankrupt Government companies and eliminate almost all Government control of business. 
 Implemented in March, the Cavallo plan has had impressive results. Inflation, which had been 2,314 percent in 1990, is under 20 percent for the last six months. Mr. Cavallo claims 150,000 jobs have been created. Foreign investment has flowed in.
Despite such achievements, Mr. Cavallo has his critics, who say he is too sure of himself for his own good and has trouble countenancing opposing views. His projections for tax revenues are overly optimistic, say the critics, who worry that the budget could become unbalanced by next year.
What sets the 44-year-old Mr. Cavallo apart from previous economy ministers here is the team be brought with him. The founder of a highly regarded economic consulting firm, Fundacion Mediterranea, he appointed more than 100 associates to posts in the Economy Ministry. That team of technocrats was critical, for example, in creating a vast deregulation package announced last month.
Many say Mr. Cavallo, who has also served as Foreign Minister, could succeed Mr. Menem when his term expires in 1995. But Mr. Cavallo declines to speculate, noting that he is not even a member of the President's Peronist Party.

The Economic News Was Bad, but the Market Was Worse
 
Last week, when the Dow Jones industrial average fell 120.31 points to finish the week at 2,943.20, it was the stock market's fifth biggest tumble ever. Analysts were quick to point to the week's bad news: Retail and auto sales were off and the Producer Price Index rose unexpectedly. "Concern about the economy is clearly intensifying," said Hugh Johnson, an analyst at First Albany Corporation in Albany, N.Y. But on reflection, the news last week was not so different from the week before -- or the week before that. So why did the market drop? "There's a general pattern that the amount of the movement doesn't necessarily match up with the news," said Lawrence Summers, chief economist at the World Bank in Washington. "That's a puzzle to people who believe in a perfectly rational market," Mr. Summers said. Traders sitting at computers also have tools that make selling easier. "That exacerbates things when the market goes down," Mr. Summers said.
 
 
Midway Left Out in the Cold
 
Midway Airlines thought it was being handed a lifeline when Northwest Airlines said it would acquire the bankrupt carrier by taking over its $153 million of debt. But Midway, based in Chicago, ended up feeling it had been handed a line when Northwest abruptly withdrew from the deal. Last week Midway, which employs 4,300 people, shut down. "There's no choice. We don't have any money," said David Hinson, Midway's chairman. Analysts say the deal unraveled partly because Northwest, a unit of cash-strapped NWA Inc., based in Minneapolis, had received a $740 million loan from the state of Minnesota. Midway's precarious existence -- it was losing $1 million a day -- made Minnesota officials nervous. But Northwest said the deal was off because Midway gave it misleading financial information. Midway disagrees. Fifty-nine Midway planes remain where they last touched down.


Barbie, Minnie and Dumbo Too
 
They have been tumbling off the assembly line together since 1987 -- Barbie, G.I. Joe and Mickey and Minnie Mouse, that is. Last week, the Walt Disney Company and Mattel Inc., which already reaps $160 million in sales from its Disney-related toy line, agreed to extend their licensing agreement for 10 years. The new agreement will give Mattel the right to produce more Disney characters. Pinnochio, Bambi and Dumbo will be added to the list as well as all 101 Dalmations.


DEC Sides With Microsoft
 
Since summer, the International Business Machines Corporation has entered into more alliances than a delegate at a Presidential convention. But last week, its rival, the Digital Equipment Corporation, the nation's No. 2 computer maker, made an alliance of its own with I.B.M.'s arch-nemesis, the Microsoft Corporation, the nation's No. 1 software maker. (I.B.M., once cozy with Microsoft, is now betting on software from Apple Computer Inc. instead.) DEC will now be able to integrate Microsoft's programs, including Windows, into its new offerings. Microsoft gets access to DEC's huge network of six million installed computers. "Windows is a big wave in the market right now," said Rick Sherlund, of Goldman Sachs & Company. "I.B.M.'s fighting it, and DEC wants to ride with it."


A Dreary, Dreary Christmas
 
Even with falling interest rates, consumers are watching their wallets as they wander into the department stores. According to the Commerce Department, retail sales fell by 0.1 percent in October. "The outlook for the Christmas season is not really wonderful," said Kathryn L. Kobe an economist at Joel Popkin & Company in Washington.

 
The French to the Rescue
 
After months of wrangling, California's insurance regulators selected a French group headed by Altus Finance, the investment arm of Credit Lyonnais, to take over the defunct Executive Life Insurance Company. They chose the French group because it promised to return more money to Executive Life's 372,000 nervous policyholders. Ninety-seven percent of them will have no losses, said John Garamendi, California's Insurance Commissioner. The French group was also chosen because it will transfer Executive's huge portfolio of junk bonds into a separate business.
 
 
Selling Off Maxwell's Empire
 
It did not take long. Last week Goldman Sachs & Company sold two million shares of Mirror Group Newspapers P.L.C., which was founded by the late Robert Maxwell.

 
 
 
ECONOMY

 
The Slippery Surge
 
When the Producer Price Index was released last week by the Commerce Department, even the coolest economist's heart sank. The index showed a 0.7 percent surge in inflation at the producer level. Slow growth and inflation reminded some seasoned number-crunchers of the "stagflation" that plagued the economy in the 1970's. But on closer examination, economists were mollified somewhat. The inflation figures were skewed by an almost random run-up of prices for a most unlikely assortment of goods. The problem, said some economists, was that the Commerce Department did not properly correct for seasonal factors. "I think it's an aberration," said Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montagu Economics in Washington.
 

Giving the Numbers Meaning
 
It's not the numbers; it's how you interpret them. So what is the meaning of the modest 0.1 percent increase in consumer prices in October, the smallest gain in seven months? "It is encouraging," said Mickey Levy, chief economist at CRT Government Securities. "But this is the point in the cycle when the Fed typically eases rates too much when it should be patient." That interpretation means when growth comes, so will inflation.
 

Those Wacky Market Forces
 
The next candidate for a Presidential veto emerged from the House last week. It is the plan to put a cap on the interest rates charged by credit card issuers. The House plan would cap rates at about 14 percent. Most cards now carry rates of 18 or 19 percent, while the banks that issue them pay 7 percent or even less for their money. The Administration said it wants lower rates (who doesn't?) but prefers that market forces set them. Aren't those the forces that pushed rates up?


Will the Market Catch the Wave?
 
With the market's 120.31 point drop last week, the nervous chatter on the street turned to the "wave" -- not the football wave, the Elliot Wave. The Elliot Wave measures mass psychology, its adherents say. Bunkum, detractors say. But "wavologists" point to the wave's last big high -- the summer of 1987. After that, the crash. Now they sense a new top has come and gone. "The Elliot wave is about patterns. We think everything has peaked -- real estate, collectibles, jobs on Wall Street," said David Allman, research director for the Elliot Wave Theorist, an investor newsletter in Gainsville, Ga. What's next? "Sometime in the next three years the stock market will be trading at half what it is now."

 
Congress Fiddles, Bush Burns
 
President Bush vetoed two bills intended to extend unemployment benefits. The latest one is being held up by Congress. The House passed a bill last week that provides up to 20 weeks of additional unemployment insurance benefits to three million Americans who have been out of work for at least half a year. But the bill treats each state differently: Connecticut gets 20 additional weeks; Alabama gets just six. Those differences made the Senate balk. Senate and House leaders are haggling while President Bush is shouting "just approve it." The bill will cost $5.1 billion and is intended to pay for itself. How? From an increase in the estimated tax payments of some taxpayers and from a two-tenths of 1 percent surcharge added to the unemployment taxes employers pay. In Washington, that's the closest anything gets to "paying for itself."


The Manufacturing Blues
 
Just when it seemed as if the manufacturing sector was snapping back to life, a study released by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment says "beware." The five-year study says American manufacturing has lost its competitive edge and needs the Government's help to regain its luster. Support is split along party lines: the Democrats for it, Republicans against.
 
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Hedging a Flyer on the U.S.S.R.
 
The recent coup in the Soviet Union, or what's left of it, did not do much to attract investors. So last week, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a Government agency, said it would provide $100 million of insurance coverage against expropriation, political violence and currency convertibility problems to an American investment group called the Soviet Companies Fund. The fund, sponsored by Batterymarch Financial Management in Boston and the State Commission on Military Industrial Products in Moscow, plans to invest $250 million, primarily in companies that make products for the military. OPIC will charge up to 60 cents for each $100 insured. But OPIC may lose on the deal. "The Soviet Union is really not a very good credit risk," said Benjamin Weiner, of Probe International, a consulting firm in Stamford, Conn.


British Standoffishness Softens
 
A single currency for the European Community seems pretty likely now. Prime Minister John Major of Britain indicated last week that he is prepared to accept a single currency by the end of the century. But he said he is against closer political ties between countries. So how will they manage the currency?

 
Even Japan Is Slowing Down
 
Last week, the Bank of Japan lowered its discount rate to 5 percent from 5.5 percent. The Japanese economy is a little out of breath. "Japan is not headed for recession, but it is slowing," said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. "This is not the last discount rate cut this cycle."

HEADLINE: All About/Watches;
Fighting the Recession By Spotting Some Fads And Inventing Others

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
Plagued by the recession, a 10 percent luxury tax on watches costing more than $10,000 and the waning of brand loyalty, watchmakers and marketers are pulling out all the stops these days to sell their wares.
They are doing it by spicing up their lines with high-tech sports watches, multi-featured diving watches, new lines of trendy art watches as well as traditional, jewel-encrusted fashion offerings. They are also doing it by following the latest fad: offering reproductions of decades-old designs. 
 So far this year, world watch production is about equal to the 1990 level of 753 million units, according to Modern Jeweler magazine, a trade publication in Overland Park, Kan. Production was 685 million units in 1989. The largest producer of watches is Japan, followed by Hong Kong and Switzerland. The United States is primarily an assembler of watches from parts made elsewhere. Retail sales of all watches in the United States were about $4.5 billion last year.
"Everyone has found a niche," observes Gerry Grinberg, chairman and chief executive of the North American Watch Company, the American distributor for such high-priced Swiss brands as Piaget, Concord and Movado. "The Swiss have taken the upper price end," he said. "The Japanese have taken the lower, or middle price bracket."
Only at the very low end of market -- from $25 to $150 -- is there a free-for-all. The Swiss have a share with Swatch, the Japanese with Casio and Seiko, the Americans with Armitron (sold under dozens of different names) and the Norwegians with Timex.
Timex, which is privately held, does not disclose its overall sales figures. Industry analysts say Timex dominates the low-end market with about 24 percent of market share. It also produces the nation's largest selling watch: the Iron Man Triathalon, a digital watch priced at $39.95 that sells about 500,000 units a year.
At least one battle in the industry now appears to have been settled: the protracted competition between digital and analog watches. Analog watches have hands; digital watches have displays. Analog watches may have quartz or mechanical movements, while digital watches are only quartz.
The digital watch dominated the 1970's and early 80's. But in 1985, analogs broke through: 173 million analogs were sold against only 149 million digitals. Digital watches regained their lead briefly in 1986 and 1987. But in 1988, analogs took back the lead, this time permanently, industry experts say. In 1990, 405 million analog watches were sold versus 242 million digitals.
Though quartz watches dominate the market, mechanical watches still have significant, though declining, sales. In 1990, 106 million mechanical watches were sold, down from 143 million in 1985.

 
 
A New Caution
Just 1 Trendy Item, Not a Whole Line
 To gain sales momentum, the watch industry is relying on design flair and creativity. Companies are introducing watches in the forms of cucumbers, strips of bacon and even red peppers. Art watches -- some with painted faces -- are also making a reappearance.
But all that creativity is tempered with caution due to the fragile financial condition of many of the nation's retailers. That fragility has caused some manufacturers to market their products differently.
Rather than developing entire lines, or collections, "there's a trend toward item marketing in the business today," said Laurence Grunstein, president of the Citizen Watch Company of America, the American arm of the Citizen Watch Company of Japan. "You develop a hot item and you can quickly sell 25,000 to 50,000 units." he said. "Retailers want those hot items, especially those retailers involved in leveraged buyouts which need faster inventory turnover and more productive use of shelf space to pay down debt."
But Seiko Time, the big Japanese producer, is still opting for collections of watches. This is especially the case with its "sport-tech" watches, where 40 styles of largely analog quartz watches will be offered in a retail price range of $250 to $575.
Seiko is also bringing out a line of 10 new watch styles for the 1992 Olympic Games. Seiko has been designated the official timer for next year's Olympics to be held in Barcelona. "We're going to move aggressively into television with these watches," said Hal Wilensky, Seiko's executive vice president for its American operations. "We feel that a connection with the Olympics will draw a lot of attention to us."

 
 
Rescuing Swatch
It Couldn't Rely On Just Teen-Agers
 What can a company do when its sales finally flatten out because the novelty of its low-price, fashion products fizzles? That is the question Swatch, a unit of SMH International, the big Swiss producer, asked itself.
After a spectacular introduction in 1982, with new quartz technology, Swatch sold a stunning 25 million watches in the United States alone. But in the last few years, sales have dropped sharply.
Swatch decided to change its image, said Chris Keigel, vice president of sales and marketing at Swatch. "The brand had lost some of its novelty, its momentum. We were focused too heavily on teen-agers," Mr. Keigel said. "But if you target yourself on people in their 20's, the Swatch can be considered an aspirational thing, something to strive for at that age and younger."
To change its image, last year Swatch introduced a combination chronograph and watch that sold in stores for less than $100. Swatch sold 100,000 of them in the first few weeks. It also introduced a diving watch with a plastic body and sold it for $50 retail against the standard $250 to $300 for the diving watches made by its competitors.
Swatch is also "getting more American design input," Mr. Keigel said. "European styling is much more colorful, while U.S. design is more traditional, perhaps reflecting a return to basic values," he said.
But Swatch is taking no chances -- just a few weeks ago it began showing the works of the Swiss-Austrian artist Alfred Hofkunst, in the form of Pop Art "vegetable" watches -- like cucumbers and peppers.

 
 
Selling Luxury
Antique Watches Are Reproduced
 With sales of luxury goods hard hit by the recession and the imposition of a luxury tax last January, even upscale producers have had to innovate. One way they have done that is to offer "collectibles" -- limited offerings of specially produced, high-priced watches.
Movado, for example, recently produced a limited run of 110 watches to commemorate its 110th anniversary. All the watches, which had an 18-karat gold case and mechanical movement, were sold, for $10,000 each. Similarly, Movado ran off a limited amount of another, lower-priced anniversary model, a gold-plated mechanical watch for $595. That edition also sold out.
"The biggest change in our business is that people are collecting watches," said Mr. Grinberg, of the North American Watch Company, which distributes Movado. "This has led to new watches being made to look as if they were inspired by the old ones, which means mechanical movements. These may be a little impractical, but people want unique products. They become status symbols."
Hamilton Watch, a division of the Swiss SMH empire, has joined the collectibles trend by reincarnating its Ventura model, which was introduced in 1957 as "the world's first electric watch." The Ventura is now offered with a quartz movement and is selling well.
Piaget, which is distributed by North American Watch, has reached much further back in its nostalgic quest. It recently introduced the Tanagra, a newly-designed jeweled watch named after a city in ancient Greece. The Tanagra, which uses a Greek-design motif, retails for $6,000 to $20,000, depending on the band and jewels.
 
 
 
WATCHMAKER WITH 2,000 FACES
 Durable may be the best way to refer to Armitron, a 35-year-old watch brand assembled in New York by the E. Gluck Corporation. Today E. Gluck is the nation's second-largest watch assembler after Timex, with sales this year of more than $100 million.
Armitron was an early marketer of digital quartz watches. But its first digital watches used displays made of light emitting diodes, or LED's, a technology borrowed from computers. But it soon became apparent that LED's used too much power. Armitron's customers had to replace their batteries so frequently that thousands of them brought their watches back to the retailers. That almost drove Armitron out of business.
To solve the display problem, Eugene Gluck, the company's founder, had his suppliers switch the displays from LED's to liquid crystal. LCD's, as they are called, use less electricity than LED's. Their batteries for the newer watches lasted longer.
Armitron produces mostly inexpensive watches and sells them to discount and mass-market chains like Wal-Mart, K-Mart and Sears. Large retail chains now account for 50 percent of all watches sold.
Mr. Gluck and his designers have developed dozens of collections of watches for a number of different markets.
"When Swatch decided not to sell to mass chains, we came out with the AWatch by Armitron," said Sidney Gluck, Armitron's vice president. "Then, when AWatch succeeded, we decided to produce a fashion AWatch with sports functionality and called it Allsport."
E. Gluck and its affiliated company, Sutton Time -- which produces watches for the clothing designer Anne Klein -- occupies a 160,000-square-foot assembly plant in Queens, N.Y. From that location they produce 2,000 styles of watches.

To the Editor:
Re "Why Poland Can't Flinch" (editorial, Oct. 26): 
 The last 50 years of a socialistic economy have taken their toll upon the psychic character of the Polish people. Although extreme shortages of goods for the general public produced the well-known phrase "nie ma" ("we don't have"), which Polish clerks retorted mechanically as a response to shortages, the phenomena of layoff and unemployment were virtually nonexistent.
This has created a naive response by many Poles. Democratization and the turn to a free-market economy have not been the panacea the multitudes hoped for. The rumblings of voters, many of whom have resorted to strikes in the workplace, reflect a wish to return to a time that, at least from their perspective, appeared better. Yet from my conversations with Polish Government representatives, I believe the greatest enemy, after public discontent, is time.
While the final result of "shock therapy" has yet to be seen, economic inroads have begun and are not merely on the horizon.
The greatest tragedy of the former Government's irresponsibility has been its abuse of the environment. Pollution throughout Poland approaches a catastrophic dimension. Yet the financial resources of the Government prevent an adequate response to this ecological nightmare.
Who can fault any Pole for wishing to escape the ecological poisoning taking place? And the vicious cycle begins. The most able and much-needed worker and professional have decided to flee polluted Poland.
What is needed is a radical infusion of Western money to assist with the privatization so badly needed in many of the industries previously controlled by the Government. At the same time, Western technology to combat the scourge of pollution is essential. The leaders in Warsaw cannot accomplish these tasks single-handedly. The time for help from Washington and the West is now. There may not be an opportunity next time.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
A Wary Step Toward Regional Cooperation

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
A GROUP of countries that together control nearly half the world's economic life met last week, and the world hardly noticed. But that was partly by design; while the fragmented lands of the Asia-Pacific region organized the meeting to demonstrate a growing new unity of purpose, they also showed how wary they are about bonding themselves together too tightly.
The site was Seoul, where the 15 nations that make up Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation met to add momentum, very carefully, to the two-year-old body. For the first time, the members -- Japan, China and other East Asian countries, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand -- agreed to create a permanent secretariat and a budget for 10 modest projects that would promote regional cooperation and growth. 
 A variety of proposals for region-wide cooperation has been floated over the last decade, only to founder because of a traditional lack of identity and coherence. Then in 1989 Australia, which for years resisted defining itself as part of Asia, reversed its stand and pushed for this new body. A realization of what this trade-oriented region was up against in the new world economic order taking shape finally drove the countries that rim the Pacific to embrace the idea of bonding themselves, if not immediately, with a common purpose.
 
Pragmatism
 At last week's meeting, in an unusual display of pragmatism over ideology, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan took their seats side by side. In addition, India, the Soviet Union and a host of Latin American nations have said they would like to join.
The potential significance of this group is evident in its clout: the 15 members account for nearly 50 percent of the world's gross national product, about 40 percent of its trade, 40 percent of its population and 30 percent of its land area.
"This organization is going to have immense implications," said Atsushi Oi, a senior official at Japan's Ministry for International Trade and Industry and a member of Japan's delegation. "The important thing is that it is based on economic reality, not politics. These relationships already exist." But for every positive sign there was also conspicuous nervousness, because of the great uncertainty that has been building in the export-driven economies of East Asia over the role various trade blocs may play in the trading system. As the unusual name Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation implies, so tentative are some participants about the group's direction that they do not even refer to themselves as an "organization" or "association." Indeed, the members spent much of the time in Seoul explaining what the economic grouping, known as Apec, would not be and how the region should not be organized.
Fearful that Apec could evolve into an exclusive trading bloc, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d attacked a Malaysian proposal for a body that would exclude the United States and be led by Japan. Malaysia was showing concern that the East Asian countries were being excluded from the other major trade groupings taking shape, the European Community and the North American Free Trade Agreement, which includes the United States, Canada and Mexico.
Mr. Baker responded with a series of denials about the exclusivity of both the North American body and Apec. "Apec is not a regional bloc," he insisted. "It will not cut off the Asia-Pacific region from the rest of the globe. Rather, Apec aims to be a catalyst for economic integration, trade liberalization and growth." But his sharp remarks only served to show that Malaysia had staked out one realistic option for the group -- and that the burden would fall on the United States to show it wanted to remain engaged in Asia.
 
A Message?
 The Japanese, meanwhile, insisted nervously that they had no intention of participating in a trade bloc. They said the whole aim was a more open trading regime world-wide. But some Japanese hinted that they would not mind it if the West saw that Asia has the will to organize, should it be cut out of the huge European or North American markets.
Japan and South Korea also fought quietly to keep out of the meeting's declaration a commitment to fully liberalize agricultural trade; both nations ban imports of rice and have been resisting pressure that they open their markets. And officials of South Korea and Taiwan have expressed concern over the prospect that they would be dominated by Japan if an Asian bloc took shape. These countries already suffer large trade deficits with Japan.
For all the anxieties on display, the grouping took several important steps, largely because of what the members felt was at stake if they did not act. The decision to organize a secretariat with a budget -- its size to be determined later -- will give Apec some permanence and encourage it to set policy goals. Japan, Thailand and Singapore have suggested they would like to be the group's home.
Apec also issued a declaration for the first time, spelling out its commitment to a free trade regime, even if that meant some members would have to alter longstanding protectionist policies. It called for a reduction of trade barriers, greater interdependence among the members and efforts to improve living standards in East Asia. Perhaps most important, Apec threw its influence behind a quick conclusion to the Uruguay Round, a major negotiation to promote more open markets that has stalled on the question of agricultural products.
The statement was not the sort to grab headlines. But it made a point: Asia, the most economically vibrant region in the world, is becoming organized and preparing to exert its considerable weight. President Bush has postponed his trip to the region, and thus highlighted the questions about America's commitment to the Pacific at a time when the region is starting to show that its greatest years for growth and influence may lie ahead.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
'Repatriation' Is the Trend For Refugees Worldwide

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
REFUGEES have almost always been seen as innocents adrift. With the end of the cold war, the question is being asked, can they go home again?
In the vast archipelago of the displaced, which runs from the arid camps of Malawi and Eritrea through the rocky slopes of Pakistan to the tent cities in the jungles of Thailand, a new word is being heard: repatriation. Depending on who among the world's 18.3 million refugees hears it, it means going home, going to a place that can never be home again, or being forced back to the things once fled from. 
 Repatriation is the word of choice among relief organizations whose tired workers have begun to hope that the long years of regional struggles that drove people from their homes would come to an end as the conflict between East and West began to fade away. But the word may not be so welcome for Vietnamese in Hong Kong being forced on planes to Hanoi, or for Haitians in flight from the military junta, only to be left in new holding facilities at the United States Naval base in Guantanamo Bay.
"Ninety-nine percent of the refugees in the world want to go home," said Sylvana Foa, a spokeswoman for Sadako Ogata, the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees. "People don't give up their culture, home, friends and belongings lightly." Last month, Mrs. Ogata declared her hope that 1992 will be "the year of repatriation."
For the United States, this change in the international approach to refugees is both welcome and discomfiting. The United States used to have an easy rule of thumb for deciding who was a refugee. A person fleeing Communism was almost automatically considered by the State Department to have "a well-founded fear of persecution," the 1951 United Nations language that became the legal definition of a refugee. But a person fleeing civil strife in El Salvador or Haiti was more likely to be an "economic migrant" seeking access to a better standard of living. The former could be nurtured; the latter deported. Now the old refugees from Communism may have become the new "economic migrants" in flight from economic disaster.
Most of the United States' refugee expenditures over those years have gone to resettling fugitives from Communism. Between the fall of Saigon in 1975 and the collapse of Soviet Communism in 1991, the United States admitted 1 million Asians, almost all of them Vietnamese, Cambodian or Laotian. Most of the rest of the 1.5 million admissions in that 16-year period consisted of 250,000 from the Soviet Union, 100,000 from Eastern Europe and at least 20,000 from Afghanistan.
 
Different Priorities
 Yet the number of refugees from countries like Vietnam and Cambodia -- those the United States has been most likely to take in -- is dwarfed by the number fleeing regional conflicts. Estimates by the United Nations and private groups indicate that Africa has 5.4 million refugees, most from conflicts in Ethiopia, Mozambique, Liberia and the Sudan. There are more than 9 million in the Middle East and South Asia, including 4 to 5 million Afghans. About 135,000 Kurds are still refugees, the last of 1.5 million who fled Saddam Hussein's troops. In East Asia, refugees from Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Burma total perhaps 600,000.
Now other voices, like those of the British Government and the administration in Hong Kong, are saying that many in the latest wave of Vietnamese boat people are not southerners fearing persecution from old Communist enemies, but northerners who simply want a better life. These "economic migrants," they say, should be encouraged to go home voluntarily. If they do not, British and Hong Kong authorities argue, they are just as eligible for deportation as are Haitians and Salvadorans who attempt to flee to the United States.
These attitudes led to some unsettling images last week: weeping Vietnamese in Hong Kong being dragged onto a plane back to Hanoi, small boatloads of Haitians held on Coast Guard vessels.
American officials, who have condemned the military junta that ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, are clearly more reluctant to deport these latest Haitian migrants than they were to send home the earlier waves of "economic migrants" whose boats landed on Florida beaches in the 1980's.
"There are two aspects to repatriation: involuntary and voluntary," said Susan Forbes Martin of the Refugee Policy Group in Washington. "The question of involuntary return, in cases like Vietnam and Haiti, involves whether and how you return people who don't meet the formal definition of a refugee. They haven't left for political reasons but for equally troubling reasons.
"It might be a combination of pervasive repression, human rights abuses, deep-seated poverty or ethnic abuses," she said. "If you look at Haiti and Vietnam, you can't say it's pure economics and you can't say it's a pure refugee situation either. People may not be able to claim they have a well-founded fear of persecution, but they may have a well-founded fear of death."
The British argued that they had won guarantees from the Vietnamese Government that there would be no reprisals against those returning. The Bush Administration, with the angry voices of previous Vietnamese refugees ringing in its ears, voiced disagreement with the policy in the diplomatic equivalent of a whisper.
Voluntary repatriation, internationally monitored and with international support for shattered economies, "clearly is a perferred solution," said David Whittlesey, chief of the Division of Asia and Oceana for the International Organization for Migration, an independent group in Geneva. But, he said, "repatriation is going to be difficult in a situation like Cambodia," where fields are mined and the water is malarial.
"Another problem," he said, "is repatriation to what? The infrastructures have been severely damaged. Can repatriation precede the rebuilding of the infrastructure? Can you rebuild the infrastructure without repatriation?"

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Will Kenya's Bad Habits Jeopardize Its Aid?

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya

 BODY:
IN the 1980's Kenya was among a handful of African nations that could rely on large infusions of aid from Washington and the World Bank. Washington's interest in Kenya had a lot to do with its strategic position on the Indian Ocean, which made it a useful ally in the cold war. The World Bank's generosity was largely based on Kenya's capitalist outlook.
In the last two years, American aid has dropped significantly, in part because the cold war evaporated and American aid budgets tightened in general, but also because of growing displeasure with President Daniel arap Moi's intransigence on the issues of democratization, human rights and corruption. 
 Much of Africa is testing the possibilities of political pluralism now, but Mr. Moi continues to cling to a monopoly of power by squashing the opposition even as his regime is accused of corruption. Some diplomats have begun equating him with the despotic leader of Zaire, Mobutu Seso Seko -- a comparison that would have sounded implausible a few months ago.
Some Western donors, especially the United States and the Scandinavian countries, believe that recent events in Kenya will test the World Bank's seriousness about its declaration that "good governance" is a requirement for receiving aid. In little more than a week, Kenya's donors will meet in Paris under the auspices of the World Bank to decide the size of Kenya's aid package next year.
 
A Mysterious Death
 Last week, a retired Scotland Yard detective who had investigated the death of Robert Ouko, a former Foreign Minister, testified that corruption flourishes at the top of the Kenyan Government. The detective, John Troon, said he believed that Mr. Ouko was pushed into a car early one morning in February 1990, taken to the countryside near his house and shot because he was preparing a report on corrupt ministers in the Moi Government.
At the same time as the extent of the corruption has become public, Mr. Moi has refused to recognize opposition groups, and he banned a rally scheduled for yesterday. A dozen well-known leaders of the opposition, which has been calling for a multiparty political system, were arrested and armed riot police used tear gas to disperse crowds attempting to get to the meeting place.
Despite a major policy statement in 1989 that set "good governance" as a guiding rule for eligibility for aid in Africa, funding by the World Bank for Kenya has remained at high levels. In 1989, Kenya received nearly $1 billion from all Western donors, one-third of it from the World Bank and less than $100 million from the United States. By far the largest portion of bank aid went for financial support of the budget. Direct aid from the United States has fallen by half in the last two years, dropping from $80 million to $40 million.
Economists say there are a number of reasons for the World Bank's leniency toward Kenya.
First, the bank decided in the mid-1980's that more attention had to be given to Africa. The bank's vice president for Africa, Edward Jaycox, an American who has been fond of the continent ever since he took a postgraduate trip across Africa in the early 1960's, argued that Africa was a test case for development.
Two former presidents of the bank, A. W. Clausen and Barber B. Conable Jr., went along with Mr. Jaycox's argument. During their tenures, the bank allocated substantially more money to the continent, shifting some long-term aid away from Asia in doing so. In the years 1982-86, yearly disbursements in grants and loans to Africa averaged $1.9 billion; between 1987 and 1991, the support increased to $3.3 billion.
"Up until now it has been difficult for the bank to put money in East Africa other than Kenya," says David Gordon, a former official of the United States Agency for International Development in Kenya. "Uganda, Tanzania, Zimbabwe are all countries where five years ago it didn't make a lot of sense to put money." Uganda was still torn by war, and Tanzania and Zimbabwe still practiced their various versions of socialism. By contrast, Kenya had capable technocrats and a capitalist orientation. So funds were pumped into Kenya even though corruption was getting worse, Mr. Gordon said.
There is little doubt that the atmosphere at the Paris gathering will be grim. And the Kenyan delegation will be laboring under an added liability. The Vice President and Minister for Finance, George Saitoti, who will head the team, was named at the inquiry into Mr. Ouko's death as one of the ministers who demanded a kickback from a company planning to rehabilitate an industrial project.
Mr. Saitoti also offered what diplomats considered an unbelievable explanation last week of why the foreign exchange held by Kenyans overseas had soared tenfold from $200 million in 1982 to $2.6 billion this year. The United States Agency for International Development said the capital flight was due to "investor uncertainty and rampant corruption." Mr. Saitoti attributed the extraordinary size of the foreign holdings to undispersed money from foreign donors, a statement that could not be squared with the facts, diplomats said.
In advance of the Paris meeting, members of the opposition appealed to the donors to get tough. Until there is political reform in Kenya, they argued, economic aid will be counterproductive. "The current trends in our country show the limits of reforming economic policy in a deformed political environment," they said in an open letter.
Two days after the letter was made public, three of the signers, including Gitobu Imanyara, the editor of The Nairobi Law Monthly, were arrested.

California Is Tired Of Hearing the Meaning of It All

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
CALIFORNIANS have long resented what they perceive as a condescending view of their sunny land in the national press. But as long as things went well, they could dismiss this as envy on the part of myopic East Coast editors forced to make their livings slogging through the winter slush of Manhattan. The Californians could tune out, grow rich and get sun tanned.
Now that times have turned tough on the West Coast, those tanned hides have proved thin. The California economy, which nearly everybody here thought invulnerable to national vicissitudes until recently, is deeply mired in recession and lagging the nation in recovery. Compounding this have been recent natural insults like the deadly fire that swept the hills above Oakland and Berkeley last month, not to mention the perennial problems of smog, street gangs and traffic congestion. 
 All of this has spawned a new round of articles in newspapers and magazines calling attention to the fragilities and difficulties of life in the largest state. The latest bruise was inflicted by Time magazine, whose cover story last week played the by-now-familiar theme of the paradise spoiled, the dream endangered.
The California press, which has done its share of chronicling these troubles, is now having a bad reaction to such coverage by the national media. And if the press is any reflection of the public psyche, then that psyche has been bruised.
Why pick on California? demanded Peter Schrag, associate editor of the Sacramento Bee in the Oct. 30 issue. He took issue with a number of recent articles in The New York Times, mainly one by this writer, that discussed the Oakland fire as a symbol of the hazards of pushing California civilization into beautiful but environmentally dangerous areas.
"Not that The Times is all wrong," Mr. Schrag wrote. "The facts are often depressingly correct. California is a troubled place, partly because the myths created by the California-paradise writers generated such absurd expectations and because it hasn't yet discovered a way to keep people out. Read the mounds of celebratory trash about nirvana-by-the-pool that was published in the late 60's and you can understand why sooner or later there had to be a yang for this yin."
But Mr. Schrag went on to say that many other places have troubles, including New York, Connecticut and New Jersey. He cited budget troubles in those states, muggings on the subway, Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and the arson fire at the Happy Land social club in the Bronx that killed 87 people, more than triple the number who died in the Oakland fire. And he cited such environmentally fragile places as Cape Cod and the Carolina coast, hit by recent storms, or flood-prone areas of the Ohio Valley. "Does The Times talk about their disasters in apocalyptic terms every other week and sometimes twice on weekends? Why is this state singled out?"
Then came Robert A. Jones, a columnist for The Los Angeles Times on Nov. 6. "California cannot have a simple disaster," he wrote. "There must be, somewhere, a meaning to each flood, each fire, each earthquake. And that meaning, one way or the other, has to do with doom. I cannot think of any other place on Earth that carries this burden."
He, too, cited the recent East Coast storm that flooded President Bush's summer home in Kennebunkport, Me.: "A bad, malignant storm. But as of yet this storm has inspired no talk of Armageddon. No one has mentioned bargains with the devil. Or the foolhardiness of Easterners who have chosen to defy nature by living along the Atlantic coast.
"And after the President said he planned to restore his house and return for more summers, I have seen no television commentators shaking their heads in wonder. The story, you see, remained merely a storm. It had no moral quotient and carried no meaning about the spiritual corruption of its victims."
Next came Peter H. King, a new columnist at The Los Angeles Times, on Nov. 12. He cited articles in Newsweek, Time, The Wall Street Journal, the Economist and The New York Times, some of which mentioned a growing flow of residents out of California. "What will finally emerge from all this tumult won't be the California that brought the Gold Rush settlers, or my Oklahoma ancestors, or even my friends who came from so many other cities to pursue a dream," he wrote. "But don't schedule the funeral.
"Even the gloomiest accounts concede that our economy is certain to rebound, that the quake and fire victims will rebuild and, most important, that the number of Californians moving out will prove to be an insignificant trickle compared to the incoming tide of foreign immigrants. These immigrants come with dreams of their own, a possibility overlooked in the doomsday reports.
"The oversight is unfortunate -- because what is really going on here is not a death, but a revision. As California is remade, so is the dream."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Washington Tries to Sort Out Health Insurance Proposals

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.

 BODY:
WITH voters making it clear that they are unhappy with rising medical costs and the fact that 34 million Americans have no health insurance, Democrats and Republicans are realizing that the issue will be important in the coming Presidential election.
Republicans in Congress introduced a health insurance bill last week. The White House said it would speed up work on its own bill, and a coalition of businesses and labor unions unveiled theirs on Tuesday.
 
The system's flaws
 Although medical care in the United States is the most sophisticated in the world, the system for delivering it has major flaws. 
 *About 34 million people -- 13 percent of the nation -- have no health insurance. Most work, but are not insured on the job, cannot afford coverage and are not poor enough for Medicaid or old enough for Medicare. The United States is the only major industrialized nation without universal coverage.
*Health care is expensive. Spending per person is three times what it is in Britain and double what it is in Germany and Japan, and a disproportionate amount goes for the administration costs of the many insurers.
*Dozens of insurers, Medicaid and Medicare have their own rules that doctors and patients have to comply with. Many doctors, fed up, refuse to work with some plans.
*Workers lose coverage when they leave jobs. Because small employers pay far more per worker than large ones, many small companies and many with low-wage workers offer no insurance.
*Neither patients nor doctors have much incentive to keep costs down, and fear of malpractice suits leads to unnecessary tests.
 
Bills before Congress
 There are more than 20 health insurance bills before Congress now. All envision one of three kinds of plans:
Canadian-style: Some would create systems like Canada's, under which taxes pay for government-administered health insurance. The simplest bills merely extend Medicare to all legal residents. Under others, patients would present insurance cards, and doctors and hospitals would apply to the government for payment. Governments would either set fees or decide how much they would pay and let doctors charge more.
Critics say such a system would mean large tax increases, would put medical insurers like Blue Cross out of business and replace them with government bureaucracies that would become indifferent and expensive and could end up rationing treatment. Defenders say Canada has universal access to health care for less money per patient than is spent in the United States. But they concede that there are often long waiting lists for some tests and operations, and that the United States develops most state-of-the-art care, which arrives only slowly in Canada.
Play or pay: Most of the other proposals, including that of several key Democrats, keep the element of health insurance that is characteristically American -- it is usually a job benefit. These proposals, nicknamed "play or pay" plans, would require employers of as few as three people to either insure them or pay a tax into a state-administered pool that would offer policies. Some bills propose taxes of 7 or 8 percent of the payroll. Anyone unemployed or self-employed would be covered by an expanded Medicare program or have to buy private insurance. Versions of such plans are used in Germany and France, although the insurers, who levy payroll taxes of from 8 to 16 percent for premiums, are non-profit and heavily regulated.
Most of these bills also include provisions for insurance market reform, described below, and would let the self-employed write off health insurance premiums against taxes.
These plans are strongly opposed by small-business owners, who say the costs would make them lay off workers or go bankrupt.
Insurance market reform: In a limited approach that may have the best political chance of passage soon, some bills would focus on insurers. Most would force them to group small companies in pools insured at rates close to those for big companies. Some would forbid them to refuse people with pre-existing conditions or would reduce waiting periods to six months.
While this can make a dent in the numbers of uninsured, critics say these plans would still leave out the unemployed, seasonal workers, domestics and many others.
Two national health plans that are not in any Congressional bills are British-style health care, under which doctors become government employees, and "market oriented" plans that would cancel all on-the-job insurance and Medicare and give residents tax credits or vouchers to buy their own insurance with. There is virtually no support for the British plan, but growing interest among conservatives in the market one.
 
Cost-cutting provisions
 Different bills include a variety of ways to control spiraling costs.
Rate-setting: Canadian-style bills create government agencies to set fees and medical practices. Other bills create entities that would bargain with doctors and hospitals to lower rates or would oversee negotiations between doctors and insurers.
Managed care: Under "play or pay" bills, patients would be encouraged, as they are now, to join health-maintenance organizations or use networks of doctors that offer discount services. Some have government agencies or insurers scrutinize private doctors' decisions. Critics say this creates new layers of bureaucracy, and irritates doctors.
Certificates of need: Under some Can adian-style systems, Federal or state governments would be able to limit, for instance, how many hospitals, cardiac surgery teams or expensive diagnostic detectors a state or county could have. Defenders say areas with many hospitals like New York City wastefully duplicate resources, while rural areas suffer. Critics say rationing leads to delays or long trips for tests and care. An example of the problem: The United States has 2,000 $2 million magnetic resonance imaging scanners while the whole of Canada has only 15.
Tax reform: Right now, businesses deduct health insurance premiums for employees from before-tax profits. The self-employed can deduct 25 percent of their premiums. Some bills would give small employers tax credits for buying insurance and let the self-employed deduct all their premiums.
Malpractice limitations: Some bills change malpractice laws, limiting awards for pain and suffering, for instance. This is intended to lower malpractice insurance premiums and cut spending on "defensive medicine" -- tests ordered to forestall suits.
Caps on expenditures: Some bills would set an annual health budget for the entire country, which could not be exceeded, though it is not clear how that would be enforced. In Germany, budgets are set even for single hospitals and doctors, and when levels are exceeded, reimbursement drops dramatically. Proponents say this makes doctors and hospitals more likely to weigh priorities and avoid waste. Critics say it means care is denied and medical progress is slowed.
Rationing: Insurers could bargain to exclude some treatments, just as many now refuse to pay for cosmetic surgery and infertility treatment. Some of the bills, for example, do not pay for prescription drugs.
