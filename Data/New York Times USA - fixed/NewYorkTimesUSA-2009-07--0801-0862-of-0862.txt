HEADLINE: Cockeyed Optimists and Steely-Eyed Lenders

BYLINE: By SUSAN DOMINUS. 
E-mail: susan.dominus@nytimes.com

 BODY:
If necessity is the mother of invention, then it would seem that a recession, when needs abound, might push people to embrace innovation. 
 As often as not, however, a shortage of money seems to lead inexorably to a shortage of imagination, as investors and banks hunker down into the safety of the tried and true, even when the untried -- who knows? -- might work. 
 Alex Marshall, a resident of Brooklyn, had an irresistibly good idea, or at least it seemed that way when banks were lending-happy. 
 Two years ago, Mr. Marshall, a native of Virginia, and his wife, Kristi Barlow, decided they would create, in Brooklyn, one of New York City's first buildings devoted to what is known as co-housing. 
 They would find two or three dozen like-minded individuals and families who craved a supportive community, so much so that they would be willing to give up some small measure of their own apartment size in favor of larger communal indoor and outdoor spaces. Residents might frequently take meals together in a dining hall, or gather after work in the flowering courtyard.
 They would make decisions by consensus, and they would design a trailblazing green building, using so-called passive construction, heavy on insulation that would cut some heating billsby 90 percent. Retirees would get to know young families; young families would have all kinds of support (tons of baby-sitting); singles vulnerable to loneliness would enjoy the privacy of their own home within the safety of a warm, connected group. What could be bad? 
 After writing about the proposal in the Park Slope Food Co-op newsletter and on various local listservs, the group, known as Brooklyn Cohousing, started attracting people who eventually became formal members, which meant they had each thrown into the collective pot at least 5 percent of the estimated cost of their future apartments (the ownership structure would essentially be a co-op). Last October, they thought the project was well on its way when they signed a deal to develop a site in Fort Greene, and their membership expanded to 15 families. 
 Some of what happened next was highly predictable: actual costs from the contractors, once they submitted bids, were much higher than estimates.
 The group -- a multigenerational mix of races and backgrounds -- walked away from the contract, losing an amount in the high five figures.
 What followed was also predictable, but everyone who made that prediction had been dismissed as a pessimistic crank. The markets -- financial, real estate and otherwise -- went haywire. Whether the deal might have worked if it had been completed in the go-go real estate days will never be known.
 For a buyer, ''it was the best of times, and the worst of times,'' Mr. Marshall said of market turmoil.
 His group took advantage of falling prices to sign a contract to buy a $5.5 million warehouse in the South Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn, planning an $18 million project that would turn the building into 30 apartments.
 They hoped they would close this spring in a complicated financing deal that they understood was common for developers and that would allow them to close with only about $1 million in cash. Once they closed, they assumed they would be able to attract new members as the project moved along.
 AS much as banks do not like new real estate development these days, they really, really do not like unusual developments by novice developers, as Brooklyn Cohousing gradually learned. Come May, it was clear to the group that it could not get financing without putting down 30 to 40 percent.
 For Mr. Marshall's vision, not to mention the $200,000 he has sunk into the project -- a significant chunk of his family's savings -- all is not lost, at least not yet. He said the group still has a little time to bring in members before the warehouse owner walks away from the deal.
 The group is hoping that the bank will be satisfied with provisional memberships -- people who provide proof that they have 5 percent to put down on their future home in Brooklyn Cohousing and preapproval for a mortgage for the rest.
 On Friday evening, the group has scheduled a public presentation to discuss that option with people still interested in this hopeful experiment in community living and green housing.
 Mr. Marshall's vision was always tailor-made for a somewhat rare species in New York, the supersociable idealist. Now he's looking for some cockeyed optimists, too. Anyone? Anyone?

HEADLINE: An Environmental Group's Campaign of Wry Lies Against Bottled Water

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
CAN an ad campaign turn bottled water into the new tobacco? 
 Taking a cue from antitobacco campaigns, Tappening, a group opposed to bottled water on environmental grounds, has introduced a campaign called ''Lying in Advertising,'' that positions bottled water companies as spreading corporate untruths. 
 One poster claims ''Bottled Water Causes Blindness in Puppies,'' while another reads ''Bottled Water: 98% Melted Ice Caps. 2% Polar Bear Tears.'' 
 ''If bottled water companies can lie, we can too,'' the posters read. 
 The ''lies'' in question here are about the source of bottled water. Eric Yaverbaum, a co-founder of Tappening, charged that some beverage companies did not list the source of their water -- and were using only municipal water.
 The Tappening effort is reminiscent of antismoking ads from Truth, the American Legacy Foundation campaign that fights youth smoking. But while the Tappening campaign has an environmental element, it has something the antitobacco lobbyists do not: a competing product of its own. 
 The campaign was started almost two years ago by two marketing executives, in part to demonstrate their marketing skills but also to promote their own reusable water bottles. 
 Mr. Yaverbaum and his Tappening co-founder, Mark DiMassimo, the chief executive of the advertising agency DIGO Brands, each contributed $100,000 toward Tappening's founding, including a Web site, advertising campaigns and producing reusable bottles. 
 After they introduced Tappening in November 2007, Mr. Yaverbaum said, they sold out of bottles within five days. So far, he said, Tappening has sold about $5 million worth of the bottles, and profits go into producing more bottles and further advertising.
 ''We got a lot of flack for making so much money, which I kind of find interesting,'' Mr. Yaverbaum said. ''Everyone thought, 'Oh, that's so terrible, they're making so much money.' And to me, it's a great model to encourage corporate America, the Fortune 1,000, to go out and do something that can be good for the environment.''
 In this campaign, Tappening plans to spend $535,000 on outdoor posters in New York, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Chicago and Miami, along with an online component. The ads suggest viewers go to Tappening.comto find out ''the truth'' about bottled water, or to StartALie.com to spread an untruth.
 Joseph K. Doss, the chief executive of the International Bottled Water Association, an industry group, said Tappening's charges were unfair. ''We certainly would disagree with the premise that bottled water companies lie in their advertising. Like all products, bottled water ads must be truthful and nonmisleading,'' he said. Even when beverage companies use municipal water, he said, the water is purified and bottled under sanitary conditions.
 Mr. Yaverbaum, who is also chief executive of the public relations firm Ericho Communications, argues that when individuals replace bottled water with tap water, ''One, you can save money. And two, you don't have to fill up landfills with plastic bottles that are going to be there for 1,000 years after you've gone, not to mention the oil that's used to make those bottles, to truck those bottles, to refrigerate those bottles, all to get a product that is, give or take, the same thing you're getting out of a tap.''
 Mr. Yaverbaum said bottle sales were not his primary focus -- bottles from Sigg or Nalgene were around long before the Tappening bottles were, and are just as good, he said. His point was just to get people to drink more tap water. 
 Along with the environmental message and the bottle sales, Tappening lets the two executives be their own client. 
 ''We can come up with an idea and hop to the other side of the desk and say, 'We approve the idea,' '' Mr. Yaverbaum said. 
 ''We're both able to flex our marketing muscle and our marketing prowess and experience without anybody getting in the way,'' Mr. Yaverbaum said. ''I probably don't have too many clients who would've approved this campaign. It's abrasive, to say the least.''
 While bottled water sales declined in 2008, it was not necessarily for environmental reasons. Bottled water sales fell for the first time on record, declining 1 percent, based on gallons sold, according to the Beverage Marketing Corporation, a research and consulting group. 
 ''Our primary belief is that the vast majority is the economy, and the environmental questions probably have had some impact, but I would say secondarily,'' said Gary A. Hemphill, managing director, of the reasons for the decline.
 Besides, he said, sales of individually sized bottled water (as compared to big jugs or home- or office-delivered water) actually increased slightly in 2008, rising 0.3 percent. Those small bottles tended to compete not with tap water but with other beverages, like sodas or teas, he said. 
 ''The consumer looks at that single-serve market not so much as a tap-water replacement but as a refreshment beverage -- you're thirsty, you walk into a convenience store,'' he said. 
 Mr. Doss said he agreed with that argument. ''In the marketplace, bottled water considers its competition to be soft drinks, sodas, juices, teas,'' he said. ''Pitting bottled water versus tap water just doesn't seem like a very useful exercise.
 ''To the extent that people are doing things to discourage people from drinking a healthy product, I just don't see how that's in the public interest.''

HEADLINE: Google's Big Plan for Books

 BODY:
While the Internet has transformed much of the information world, books have been a laggard. Google may change that. It has already scanned millions of out-of-print books, and it has reached an agreement with writers and publishers -- which still requires judicial approval -- to make them widely available. 
 Google's book service raises monopoly and privacy concerns. It also holds great promise for increasing access to knowledge. Much of the information in the world's books is not widely available. When Google began scanning out-of-print books held by major libraries its goal was to create an enormous database that Internet users could access from local libraries or homes. 
 Google fumbled, however, by scanning copyrighted works without the rights holders' permission. Writers and publishers sued, and the parties have now reached a settlement. A federal court in New York has scheduled a hearing this fall on the settlement, which could be hotly contested.
 Google's effort could create new interest in millions of out-of-print books, which would be made available at no cost at public libraries. That means that a student at a community college or a freelance writer could access the same books as a Harvard professor. 
 At a time when publishing's economic model is threatened, there is also an important financial upside for authors and publishers. Google would charge users for accessing copyrighted books from their own computers and sell online ads, and it would give writers and publishers 63 percent of the revenue. The settlement would create a books rights registry to distribute payments. 
 Google's access to most books would not be exclusive since Microsoft or Joe's Online Library could cut their own deal with authors and publishers and scan books as well. However, it is likely that as a result of the settlement, Google would be the only company with the right to ''orphaned'' works, books whose rights owners have not been located.
 If that were to happen, Google could use monopoly power to price these books exorbitantly. The court reviewing the settlement and the Department of Justice should make sure adequate protections are built in.
 The proposed settlement also raises privacy concerns. Google could collect data on what books people read and create a dossier of their political views and other information. Google should generally do a better job of showing how it will respect privacy, and this venture is no exception.

HEADLINE: Job Worries Lower Consumer Confidence

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
 A private research group said Tuesday that Americans' mood darkened further in July as worries about job security offset any enthusiasm about the resumed stock market rally that has helped bolster retirement accounts. 
 The Conference Board said on Tuesday that its Consumer Confidence Index retreated in July to 46.6, down from 49.3 in June. Economists were expecting a reading of 49. It would take a reading above 90 to signal that the economy was on solid footing.
 The two-month consecutive decline follows an upswing in confidence in the spring, fueled by a stock market rally.
 Economists closely monitor confidence because consumer spending accounts for more than 70 percent of economic activity.
 An upbeat report on the housing market, also released Tuesday, offered more evidence that the real estate market was showing signs of life. According to the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller index, home prices in May posted their first monthly increase since the summer of 2006, indicating prices may finally be stabilizing.
 But clearly, despite surging stock prices and a stabilizing housing market, consumers remain nervous about their own financial security because of mounting job losses.
 ''Consumer confidence, which had rebounded strongly in late spring, has faded in the last two months,'' Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board Consumer Research Center, said in a statement.
 She noted that the decline in the Present Situation Index was caused primarily by a worsening job market. The deteriorating outlook for consumers was ''more the result of an increase in the proportion of consumers expecting no change in business and labor market conditions.'' 
 ''More consumers are pessimistic about their income expectations, which does not bode well for spending in the months ahead,'' Ms. Franco said.

HEADLINE: Aeroflot Sheds Its Soviet Legacy and Turns to a Western Fleet

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
Aeroflot's symbol is still the winged hammer and sickle, but otherwise, the former communist carrier has mostly shrugged off its Soviet past. The strongest evidence yet: by the end of the year, it will fly a fleet nearly entirely made in the U.S.A. and Western Europe. 
 Aeroflot is selling all of its Tupolev jets, the workhorse passenger aircraft of the former East Bloc. Once they are gone, only six of about 100 jets in Aeroflot's fleet will be Russian-made. And those planes, Il-96s, will fly within Russia and on select foreign flights, including the Moscow-Havana and Moscow-Hanoi routes. 
 That Aeroflot will fly almost exclusively Boeing and Airbus jets is a remarkable turn for a company that once owned virtually every civilian airplane in the Soviet Union. But the airline has tried to reinvent itself as a business carrier, and its passengers tend to prefer Western airplanes. 
 While experts say Russian airplanes are well-constructed, poor maintenance and repairs brought them a bad reputation for safety after the Soviet collapse. And as any passenger will tell you, they are also more noisy and cramped. ''I look at every bolt and every screw and wonder if any are loose, and I worry,'' Anastasia A. Tkachova, a student flying to London on Aeroflot, said while awaiting a flight at Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow. 
 ''It's more comfortable to fly an Airbus,'' another passenger, Mikhail A. Kotlyarov, said. But he was quick to add, with a touch of regret, ''Russia will be left without its own airplanes.'' 
 Not exactly. In fact, despite Aeroflot's move, Russia's domestic jet industry actually appears to be making an improbable comeback.
 It was the Russian-made planes' far greater fuel consumption that doomed them with Aeroflot, especially given the hard times in the industry worldwide. Aeroflot's chief executive, Vitaly Savelyev, said the company was losing money on about 40 percent of its routes and that it would have to lay off about 6,000 workers in the coming two or three years, the Vedomosti business newspaper reported Monday.
 Over its history, of course, Aeroflot has had myriad problems. Horror stories abound, though statistically flying was as safe here as in the West until a series of recent crashes involving both Western- and Russian-made jets, accidents blamed mostly on pilot error. 
 Ms. Tkachova recalled one white-knuckled take-off when flight attendants, posted in the aisles and looking out the windows, periodically called out updates to the cockpit about ice forming on the wings. 
 Ms. Tkachova said she was so visibly disturbed that a flight attendant later gave her gum, to help her calm down. 
 Irina Danenberg, Aeroflot's spokeswoman, said Aeroflot was selling its Tu-154 jets because they burned so much fuel compared with Western planes, not because of safety concerns. The Soviet legacy is ''completely irrelevant'' today, Nikolai Kovarsky, a Moscow-based business consultant, said of Aeroflot. ''They're extremely friendly, extremely professional. The service is impeccable. And they're Russian.''
 Aeroflot now operates 26 Tu-154 jets that it is taking out of service and selling, in the process laying off cabin crews to help shed employees. The reshaping of its fleet is seen as a victory for the company, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and has struggled to shed its role as a source of subsidies for Russian airplane factories. 
 It is a trend in Russian aviation. For now, the Tu-154 and a smaller variant, the Tu-134, remain the most common passenger airplane in Russia, with about 600 in service. Russian airlines have placed orders for about 100 of the Tupolev factory's newer replacement, the Tu-204. But there are just as many Russian orders outstanding for Boeing and Airbus airplanes, according to Airclaims CIS, an aviation consultancy. 
 Aerospace is among the few competitive sectors of Russia's economy outside petroleum. The absence of modern planes now is not, in fact, a reflection of the current state of the industry but of the postcollapse crisis of the 1990s -- the lead time is long on new plane designs. After a restructuring of aircraft manufacturers in 2005, a new crop of Russian planes is expected on the market through the next decade. 
 Aeroflot has placed orders for 30 new regional jets being built by Sukhoi in partnership with Boeing. And the Sukhoi superjet is also being marketed worldwide as a competitor to regional jets made by Bombardier of Canada and Embraer of Brazil.
 The Il-96, the last Russian model in Aeroflot's fleet, still serves as the Russian presidential jet, though its reputation was damaged in 2005 when Vladimir V. Putin, then president, had to take a backup airplane home from a trip to Finland because the Ilyushin's brakes had malfunctioned. The president of Ilyushin was fired after the incident. 
 Worldwide, only 14 Il-96s are operating, including a model made for Cuba with a flex cabin that converts from passenger seating for Cubana de Aviacion to a V.I.P. layout for presidential trips.
 Because Cuba retains ground crews trained to service the plane, the Il-96s can be flown more cheaply between Moscow and Havana than to European or United States airports, according to Boris Bychkov, the general director of the Moscow office of Airclaims, the aviation consultancy. 
 Meanwhile, the disappearance of the Tupolevs from Aeroflot's fleet, he said, should not be seen as a ''blow to the image'' of Russian plane makers. ''We still have excellent fighter jets.''

HEADLINE: In Victory for Obama, House Panel Approves Restraints on Executive Pay

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In an important victory for the White House, a Congressional committee approved legislation on Tuesday that closely resembled an Obama administration proposal seeking to impose new restraints on executive pay.
 The approval by the House Financial Services Committee, on a party-line vote of 40 to 28, clears the way for the measure to be considered by the full House later this week, when it is likely to be adopted.
 The bill does not set pay limits. Instead, it gives shareholders the right to vote on pay and requires that independent directors from outside of management serve on compensation committees. 
 The shareholder votes would not be binding on company management.
 The measure tries to reduce the potential conflicts of interest involving compensation consultants who play a central role in blessing pay packages. Many of those consultants also provide other services to the companies, putting them in a conflicting role for issuing fairness opinions about pay. 
 The measure also gives regulators the authority to prohibit inappropriate or risky compensation practices for banks and other regulated financial institutions. 
 The Senate is not expected to consider the legislation until this fall, at the earliest.
 The Obama administration's executive pay proposal, embodied in legislation sponsored by Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, is part of its larger package of regulatory changes intended to reduce the chances of another economic crisis. 
 While the measure still faces political obstacles in the Senate, it has not encountered as much resistance as two other cornerstones of the administration's proposal -- a greater role for the Federal Reserve in monitoring large institutions that could pose risks to the financial system and the creation of a new agency to protect consumers from deceptive or ill-suited mortgages, credit cards and other kinds of loans.
 The legislation comes as the Obama administration is separately examining the pay practices of seven big companies that have received significant taxpayer assistance in recent months. The administration's top official for compensation, Kenneth R. Feinberg, has been in discussions with the companies as he considers whether to approve the compensation of top executives at American International Group, Citigroup, Bank of America, General Motors, Chrysler and the financing arms of those two automakers. 
 The legislative debate over the pay measure pits two powerful political forces against each other. One is the public's growing outrage at skyrocketing pay packages, particularly at troubled companies that have needed billions of taxpayer dollars to survive. The other is a coalition of senior executives of large corporations and their lobbyists who have succeeded in the past in blocking or diluting meaningful restrictions on pay practices. 
 That tension was clear at a legislative drafting session, where Republicans who opposed the legislation sought to scale it back sharply, while also decrying the high pay at many troubled institutions. In one colloquy between the two senior members of the committee, Representative Spencer T. Bachus III of Alabama, the ranking Republican, said he had privately told Mr. Frank that ''executive compensation was a very difficult matter for all members of this committee.''
 ''I said doing something about executive compensation would be very popular with the American people,'' Mr. Bachus said. ''I said opposing this would put our members in a very difficult position.''
 Still, Mr. Bachus and his Republican colleagues offered numerous amendments to weaken the legislation, most of which were defeated either by voice or party-line votes. 
 But the Democrats led by Mr. Frank also agreed to some modest changes in the legislation to reduce its scope. They agreed to give the Securities and Exchange Commission the authority to exempt smaller companies from shareholder votes on pay. And they reduced the authority of regulators by giving them power to restrict only incentive-based pay arrangements instead of any kind of compensation.
 The panel adopted an amendment proposed by Representative Mary Jo Kilroy, Democrat of Ohio, to require large institutional investors to reveal how they vote the shares that they own on pay proposals affecting companies that issued those shares.

HEADLINE: China Seeks Assurances That U.S. Will Cut Its Deficit

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
China sought and received assurances from the Obama administration that the United States would reduce its budget deficit once an economic recovery was under way, a senior Chinese official said Tuesday at the end of two days of high-level talks between the countries. 
 ''Attention should be given to the fiscal deficit,'' said Xie Xuren, the Chinese finance minister. He said Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner had assured the Chinese that once the economy rebounded, the deficit would gradually come down from its current record levels.
 Mr. Geithner confirmed that, saying, ''As we put in place conditions for a durable recovery led by private demand, we will bring our fiscal position down to a more sustainable level over time.''
 For China, the rising American deficit is a concern because it could weaken the dollar and put at risk China's vast holdings of Treasury securities and other dollar-based assets. China holds an estimated $1.5 trillion in such securities, making it the United States' largest foreign creditor.
 The unusual exchange between American and Chinese officials, in consecutive news conferences at the conclusion of the so-called Strategic and Economic Dialogue, underscored a subtle shift in power between China and the United States, one in which the Chinese are showing a new assertiveness as they seek to protect their huge investment.
 President Obama's decision to combine the longstanding economic dialogue between the countries with a strategic one meant that while finance officials tried to get their economic policies in line, diplomats were doing the same, especially on the North Korean nuclear program.
 China's vice foreign minister, Wang Guangya, was unusually strong in condemning North Korea for conducting a nuclear test in May, and said Beijing would ''seriously and faithfully implement'' a series of sanctions enacted by the United Nations Security Council. His bluntness was striking; even two years ago, China was circumspect about publicly criticizing the North.
 But Mr. Wang was not specific about what steps China had taken to crack down on financial transactions, or to inspect North Korean cargo transshipped through China's ports, and he talked about coming up with a new series of incentives for the North to return to negotiations.
 While some in the Obama administration have also discussed incentives, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has warned that the United States will not ''buy the same horse'' a second time. He was referring to the Bush administration's decision to take the North off the list of state sponsors of terrorism and to resume oil shipments to the country when it began to dismantle parts of its nuclear plant. 
 North Korea is now reassembling that plant, and the administration is in the midst of a complex dance with the Chinese to force stronger steps.

HEADLINE: 2nd Medtronic Consultant Draws Senate's Scrutiny

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER; Duff Wilson contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A Senate investigation of ties between doctors and the medical device maker Medtronic is putting a spotlight on another of the company's consultants. 
 That physician, Dr. David W. Polly Jr., urged members of a Senate panel in 2006 to continue paying for Defense Department medical research into combat-related injuries. But Dr. Polly did not disclose during his testimony that he was a Medtronic consultant and was billing the company $6,000 for his appearance, according to documents released Tuesday. Instead, he told lawmakers that he was representing a professional medical association of orthopedic surgeons, according to the documents. 
 Dr. Polly, who is a medical professor at the University of Minnesota, subsequently received some of the Defense Department research funds, to head an animal study involving a Medtronic bone growth product called Infuse, according to the documents. 
 Dr. Polly is the latest academic researcher to come under scrutiny in the Senate investigation, which is being conducted by Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican member of the Senate Finance Committee. 
 Senator Grassley publicly released a number of documents, including Dr. Polly's bills to Medtronic, as part of a continuing investigation into the company's marketing of Infuse, a bioengineered bone growth product.
 Between 2003 and 2007, Dr. Polly received more than $1.14 million in fees and expenses from Medtronic, those records show. And the extent of his financial entanglements with the company, as detailed by those records, could raise questions about the ability of academic medical centers to manage potential conflicts of interest by faculty members who are also highly paid consultants to medical product companies. 
 In late 2006, university officials allowed him to work on the Defense Department-financed study of Infuse. The medical school knew he was a company consultant, but under the school's rules Dr. Polly had to acknowledge only that he received more than $10,000 annually. Medtronic paid him about $350,000 that year alone in expenses and fees, the records show.
 In an interview and subsequent e-mail messages this week, Dr. Polly said that he had done nothing wrong in connection with his 2006 appearance at the hearing, which was conducted by the Defense Subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee. A transcript of that hearing shows that he identified himself at the hearing as a representative of a professional medical group, the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. He did not note his ties to Medtronic, according to the transcript. 
 The documents released Tuesday also indicate that for his appearance at the hearing, Dr. Polly billed Medtronic $6,000. 
 Dr. Polly said this week that he could not address specific questions about charges to Medtronic because his billing records were not immediately available. ''If I billed Medtronic for services that were inappropriate I would be happy to refund that money,'' he said in the interview. ''My relationship with the company has always been on the up-and-up.''
 Dr. Polly's study, which the Defense Department paid over $466,000 to support, involved laboratory animals and was intended to show whether the use of various antibiotics in combination with Infuse could speed the healing of badly fractured shin bones that were also deeply infected. Such trauma injuries are common in soldiers wounded in Iraq by roadside bombs and other explosive devices.
 Until 2003, Dr. Polly was the head of the orthopedics department at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington. 
 He is the second former Walter Reed doctor to come under scrutiny by Senator Grassley. The other, Dr. Timothy R. Kuklo, published a study of Infuse's use on Walter Reed patients that a British medical journal retracted in March after an Army investigation concluded that he had falsified its results.
 Dr. Polly is an author on an influential Medtronic-sponsored study that found that the use of Infuse, a bioengineered protein that stimulates bone growth, was cost-effective in spinal fusions when compared with using bone grafts, the traditional material.
 While he was still in the military, Medtronic paid his traveling expenses for medical meetings in this country and abroad.
 The general counsel of the University of Minnesota, Mark Rotenberg, said that the medical school had allowed Dr. Polly to work on the Defense Department study despite his ties to Medtronic because the study involved laboratory rats, rather than people, and because Dr. Polly had said that it was not of economic significance to the company. The medical school instructed him not to disclose any data from the study to Medtronic before its public release.
 Asked about Dr. Polly's testimony, Medtronic said it believed that he should have disclosed that the company had paid him for his preparation for the 2006 hearing and his travel. Late Tuesday, Medtronic said it plans to conduct an internal inquiry of Dr. Polly's activities and would soon announce new policies regarding consultants that covered disclosure-related issues.
 A lawyer for Dr. Polly, John Lundquist, said the physician will review any concerns about how he tracked and billed for consulting activities.

HEADLINE: U.S. Budget Is Scrutinized by a Big Creditor

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
No sooner had President Obama greeted nearly 200 of the bankers, bureaucrats and policymakers who could make or break his economic plans on Monday than they started grilling his economic team with the hardest questions about his economic strategy.
 How long are these huge deficits sustainable, they wanted to know. How long do you keep stimulating the economy, and when do you break for the exits? If the dollar nosedives compared other major currencies, what's the administration's Plan B?
 The questions were mostly asked in Chinese -- by a delegation from Beijing that, diplomatic niceties aside, has come to check in on the investment of more than $1.5 trillion that China has made in United States government-issued securities. 
 ''We are concerned about the security of our financial assets,'' China's assistant finance minister, Zhu Guangyao, said with uncharacteristic bluntness during a briefing for reporters covering the ''U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue'' on Monday. 
 It was a comment that underscored how much the global financial crisis has changed the subtle balance of power in meetings of ''the G-2,'' the shorthand now used to describe sessions between the world's largest economy and its fastest-rising economic power. Gone, probably forever, are the days when American delegations would show up in Beijing with advice about how the Chinese could become a ''responsible stakeholder'' in the world -- the phrase coined by the Bush administration. The demands that the Chinese let their currency appreciate, clean up their banks or get rid of the subsidies for state-owned enterprises have been toned down.
 You do not talk to your biggest creditor that way -- especially when you have a record-sized loan application pending. 
 Throughout the two-day conference, which ends Tuesday, the subtext has been that Mr. Obama must persuade more than just Blue Dog Democrats, moderate Republicans and skeptical economists that he has a plausible long-term plan to bring down a record-breaking federal deficit. He also has to convince the occupants of the Great Hall of the People, whom he needed to show up at this week's $200 billion Treasury auction, and the many auctions that will follow.
 They will show up -- but the lingering question for the next few years is how often, and how enthusiastically they will bid. 
 There is little real danger, despite the periodic warnings from cable-television doomsayers, that the Chinese will sell off their huge holdings in American debt. As one senior Chinese official involved in the country's investment strategy put it several weeks ago, ''As the biggest holder of Treasuries, we would suffer the most from starting a panic.'' The euro and the yen do not seem especially attractive -- China's most expensive import is oil, and oil is still priced in dollars.
 But domestic pressure is growing on the Chinese government to proceed with care. One of the first big investments by China's state-run sovereign wealth fund was a $3 billon stake in the Blackstone Group; when it went sour two years ago, the Chinese press printed angry screeds about how the government had gambled and lost the country's assets. 
 When Fannie Mae went into freefall last year, Chinese officials were on the phone to the United States Treasury, demanding an explanation about how their investment in the mortgage agency's bonds would be protected. There were no threats made about the future of Chinese investments in the United States, but the message was clear. Ultimately, China was protected when the Bush administration took over control of the housing lender in September, one of the government's first steps to try to halt a broader financial implosion.
 Now, with the immediate crisis past, China's questions have taken a different turn. The sessions yesterday -- attended by the Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner; by the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke; and by the director of the National Economic Council, Lawrence H. Summers -- were dominated by questions about how quickly the United States could halt the huge deficit spending. 
 ''I think there were serious questions about what the economic outlook is, what our plans are for withdrawing some of the stimulus -- you know, when we think the right time to do that is, to bring our fiscal deficit down to a sustainable level,'' the Treasury's coordinator for China affairs, David Loevinger, said on Monday evening. 
 The administration, Mr. Loevinger said, brought along Peter Orszag, the budget director, to make the case to the Chinese. He ''was very clear -- and he was also backed up by Summers on this -- that the fiscal stimulus we've put in place was necessary and it's the right thing and it's designed to extend through 2011, but it's not sustainable at the current rate and that we're committed by the end of the Obama administration to bring it down to a sustainable level,'' he said.
 Even five years ago, it would have been hard to imagine any administration trotting out its budget director to justify fiscal strategy to the Chinese. But as Mr. Obama said, slightly amending a phrase that once was commonly used to describe the United States-Japan relationship, the interchange between the America and China now is as ''important as any bilateral relationship in the world.'' 
 Mr. Obama has a big agenda for it -- joint action on global warming, on containing North Korea and Iran, on nudging the Chinese away from their neuralgic views of Taiwan and Tibet. So far the Chinese have insisted that they have no plans to use their financial leverage to influence American policy -- just as Mr. Obama has said he will not use the government's role as the majority shareholder in General Motors to dictate what kind of cars the company makes. 
 Skeptics abound on both pledges. Financial crises can change the balance of power as surely as wars do -- but it may be a few years before we know how that power is employed.

HEADLINE: Pressed by White House, Mortgage Servicers Vow More Modifications

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Obama administration, scrambling to get its main housing initiative on track, extracted a pledge from 25 mortgage company executives on Tuesday to improve their efforts to assist borrowers in danger of foreclosure. 
 In a daylong series of meetings at the Treasury Department, government officials reached a verbal agreement with the executives for a new goal of about 500,000 loan modifications by Nov. 1 and stressed the program's urgency.
 The sessions came amid concerns that the Obama administration will fall far short of its original goal of helping up to four million troubled borrowers with modified loans.
 As of this week, only about 200,000 borrowers were enrolled in three-month trial loan modifications, out of about 370,000 who were offered modifications by mortgage companies.
 ''Today's meeting was an opportunity to identify ways to accelerate the program and bring relief faster,'' the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, said in a statement.
 But mortgage companies also say the Obama administration, which announced the program in February, left the public with the impression that the program would be instantly available.
 ''It was very difficult as an industry as a whole to try to live up to those expectations'' said Dan Frahm, a Bank of America spokesman, who described Tuesday's meeting as a realistic exchange about how the industry can improve its efforts.
 One reason progress has been sluggish is that loan servicers have had to hire and train thousands of employees. 
 The loans have been bundled and sold to hundreds of investors as securities, which often have differing rules about changes.
 Many servicers did not get set up to deal with the surge in problem loans until this year, said Thomas A. Lawler, a housing economist in Northern Virginia.
 The industry, meanwhile, says the Obama administration's program is not exactly simple to set up. It requires that mortgage companies verify borrowers' incomes and submit numerous forms to the federal government.

HEADLINE: Wealth (and Dior) on Their Minds

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
Thanks to the arrest of the scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. at his house in Cambridge, Mass., two weeks ago, we are now in the midst, we are told, of a national dialogue about race. So it seems as suitable a moment as any to gripe about the profiling instincts of television programmers who in recent years have given us a tight, binary vision of what it means to be black in America in the new millennium. 
 On the one hand we have the tough-times caricatures of Tyler Perry, whose series ''House of Payne'' and ''Meet the Browns,'' both on TBS, rank among the top comedies for adults on cable television. Last week TBS announced that it was ordering an additional 20 episodes of ''House of Payne,'' bringing the total number to 172, an astonishing figure for a laugh-track sitcom that began with the wife of a hard-working firefighter becoming a crack addict for no apparent reason. In Mr. Perry's world, the women are large, the foster children are angry, and the men discover daughters they didn't know they had. 
 At the far end of the spectrum there is ''The Real Housewives of Atlanta,'' Bravo's loopy reality-series nod to diversity, a show in which a 6,000-square-foot house stands for slumming it. The goal here, as in all the ''Housewives'' shows, isn't getting your children into Harvard, but having the ability to keep shopping at Dior and Vuitton without the downer parameters of a budget. 
 Mere affluence is what counts for shame on the Atlanta version of the ''Real Housewives'' franchise (which begins its second season on Thursday). There is no point in marrying a cardiologist (or becoming one) when you can hook up with a professional athlete or a vaguely defined entrepreneur who can provide you with a house that has its own beauty salon and the opportunity to hire an estate manager. As Sheree, one of the show's five power shoppers (all but one of whom are black), put it last season, ''I was upper-middle class growing up, but I left that behind for upper class.'' 
 In a timely concession to reconfigurations in the economy, the show begins its new season with Sheree enduring some fantasy version of financial misfortune. Her ex-husband, having failed to pay the mortgage on her mansion for months, leaves her with a house in foreclosure, and she must move to a place that might just sleep 10 comfortably and doesn't even have a game room. In response to her situation, Sheree decides to give herself ''an independence party'' and promptly gets into a shouting match with her way-over-$6-an-hour event planner.
 The upper-middle-class values -- an emphasis on academic achievement or quiet taste -- that were so paramount to ''The Cosby Show,'' which made its debut 25 years ago, form no part of the scenery in this universe (or, for that matter, in any area of reality television). Nor have those standards made a mark on other lifestyle reality series focusing on African-Americans. ''Deion & Pilar: Prime Time Love,'' for example, which ran on Oxygen last year, featured the former football and baseball player Deion Sanders navigating his coliseum-size house in Prosper, Tex., on a motorized scooter. ''The Real Housewives of Atlanta'' are portrayed no differently from ''The Real Housewives of Orange County.'' There's a color blindness to this kind of television. No one stands for anything admirable.
 Still, some shows do even worse depicting the lives of African-Americans, combining two equally regrettable stereotypes in one half-hour. The comedy ''Under One Roof,'' which ended this year on MyNetworkTV, put a wealthy real estate developer and his trophy wife in the same mansion as his just-out-of-prison brother, a guy who likes his gold chains thick and his baseball caps worn sideways. Suffice it to say that no one was sitting around reading Mr. Gates's ''Signifying Monkey.''

HEADLINE: Stimulus Law Bolsters Food Bank Offerings by $100 Million

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
Struggling to meet a demand for food that spiked with the unemployment rate, some food pantries have had to turn away people seeking help. Others are packing a little less food into each shopping bag they give out. But recently the nation's food banks received a $100 million windfall of extra food, as part of the federal stimulus law. 
 The grant is a big boost for the food bank program, which usually gets $250 million a year from Washington, and the amount of food it can buy seems supersize, even for a field that routinely measures servings by the millions of pounds. 
 The stimulus money has bought $15.8 million worth of poultry, $15.5 million worth of canned fruit, $13.3 million worth of peanut products, $25.2 million worth of cheese and $29.4 million worth of pork, according to the Department of Agriculture, which administers the program.
 That last item -- about literal pork in the stimulus -- prompted sniggering earlier this month when the Drudge Report posted a $1.191 million federal stimulus contract for ''2 pound frozen ham sliced'' on its Web site.
 Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack responded that the food would ease hunger and noted that the two pounds mentioned in the contract referred to the size of the packaging, not the amount of ham. ''In fact,'' Mr. Vilsack said in a statement, ''the contract in question purchased 760,000 pounds of ham for $1.191 million, at a cost of approximately $1.50 per pound.'' 
 The extra food is being welcomed by food banks, food pantries and soup kitchens, which say they are seeing big increases in the number of people seeking food. A recent survey by Feeding America, a nonprofit organization whose network of more than 200 food banks helps 63,000 local charities distribute food, found that requests for emergency food assistance were up by 30 percent over the previous year. 
 Pari Blackman, the director of the GAP Food Bank in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., said 350 to 400 families now lined up outside her warehouse for food each week, up from 240 a year ago. Many of the newcomers, Ms. Blackman said, are people who have worked steadily for years but now find themselves unemployed and trying to make ends meet.
 ''I'm seeing a whole different dynamic coming in,'' she said. 
 Clyde W. Fitzgerald Jr., the executive director of the Second Harvest Food Bank of Northwest North Carolina, where job losses in the textile, tobacco and furniture industries are taking a toll, said the extra food was vital to meet the rising needs. The stimulus law is nearly doubling the amount of food Mr. Fitzgerald expects to get from the federal government this year, to 5.2 million pounds, up from 2.9 million pounds. All told, he hopes to meet the growing demand by distributing 13 million pounds of food this year, up from 9 million pounds last year.
 ''The increased demand is so strong, and so sustained,'' Mr. Fitzgerald said. ''This hasn't been like a little blip. We've been at this for 12 months. Those who need food assistance are always going to be the first to be hit in a downturn, and the last to benefit in a recovery.''

HEADLINE: M.T.A. Projects a Balanced Budget Through 2011

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Despite fewer riders, falling tax revenues and the political difficulties in Albany, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said on Wednesday that it would run a modest surplus through 2011. 
 The bad news: The projected budgets are based on estimates of economic trends, in areas like the housing market, that may drastically change. 
 ''The budget is balanced on the head of a pin for the next couple of years,'' said H. Dale Hemmerdinger, the authority's chairman. ''And if the wind doesn't blow too hard in one way or another, we might make it through.''
 At the moment, there are no plans to raise fares until 2011, when they will rise by 7.5 percent. Fares will rise again by the same rate in 2013, as part of a plan previously announced by the authority. 
 But there are many factors that could send the agency back to the brink. Income from taxes on real estate transactions -- a major source of state financing for mass transit -- fell in the first six months of 2009 by nearly half of what the authority had expected. With the housing market still in trouble, agency officials said that revenues could continue to come in below expectations. 
 ''I'm 100 percent sure they're inaccurate,'' said Gary Dellaverson, the agency's chief financial officer, referring to his predictions of the rate at which the housing market will slowly recover. 
 A second shock to the region's economy would further reduce the authority's income from tax revenue, and volatility in the price of fuel could put additional financial strain on the agency. 
 Another variable is the shifting political situation in Albany, where lawmakers might reconsider proposals like congestion pricing and tolls on the East River bridges that could be used to bolster the authority's finances. 
 For now, a precariously balanced budget is projected through 2011, when the agency expects a surplus of $1 million. It says it will probably run deficits in 2012 and 2013, although officials cautioned that long-term numbers were tentative. 
 The steep service cuts that were threatened this year, before state lawmakers passed a last-minute financing package in May, were nowhere to be found in Wednesday's report. But city bus and subway riders may notice less sanitary conditions.
 New York City Transit, the arm of the authority that handles buses and subways, plans to cut $32.5 million from its cleaning budget through 2010. The repainting of stations and some maintenance services for trains, buses and stations will be reduced.

HEADLINE: Managing an Online Reputation

BYLINE: By KERMIT PATTISON

 BODY:
Your customers are talking about you -- and the whole world is listening.
 Local review sites are reshaping the world of small business by becoming the new Yellow Pages, one-stop platforms where customers can find a business -- and also see independent critiques of its performance. 
 How do you manage your reputation when everybody is a critic? 
 For some business owners, this is a terrifying prospect that seems more like mob rule than the wisdom of crowds. Negative reviews can hang an albatross around your neck if they appear prominently in search results. Happily, there is a big upside: referrals from happy clients are traditionally the best source of new business -- and online forums are powerful word-of-mouth. The review process has been democratized. 
 But managing your online reputation requires a whole new skill set, including monitoring the online conversation and engaging with customers and the tech-savvy to promote yourself in the best channels. These skills are becoming essential for mainstream businesses. According to a survey by the Opinion Research Corporation, 84 percent of Americans say online reviews influence their purchasing decisions. (Still not convinced? Tell us why.)
 ''Social media for business now is life or death,'' said Dan Simons, a restaurateur in the Washington area who closely monitors these forums. ''You could open a business and do everything right, but if you're unaware of these social media you will perish. Social media can take a business and put a bullet in it.''
 Monitor
 Customers are abuzz with opinions -- the only question is whether that buzzing reaches your ears. The first step is to tune in.
 Do a vanity search of your business name and see what comes up. Are you easy to find? What is the first impression? Do you have a Web page and blog, and are they kept up do date? Is your business reviewed in online forums or blogs? 
 Try to see your business through the eyes of a customer. Indeed, customers increasingly shop with their browser. One study by the Yellow Pages Association and comScore found that local search for businesses, products and services grew 58 percent last year and reached 15.7 billion searches, more than a tenth of overall search traffic.
 Study local search sites like Yelp, Citysearch and Yahoo! Local. Forums for customer feedback have sprung up everywhere ----Google Maps, Amazon, Angie's List, TripAdvisor, OpenTable, Epinions and a myriad of online communities and niche sites.
 ''Know who the influencers are,'' said Pete Blackshaw, executive vice president of Nielsen Online Digital Strategic Service and an expert on consumer-generated media. ''There are going to be some megaphones that matter more than others.''
 Build systems to stay on top of this online buzz. A Googlealert can automatically inform you when your business is mentioned in a review, blog or online publication. Some review sites have features that automatically send e-mail alerts to business owners when a review is posted.
 Twitter is becoming an increasingly popular microblogging platform for businesses and customers and you can keep track of what is being said about your company with tools like search.twitter.com, TweetDeck, or Twendz .
 Manage
 Once you've tuned into the online conversation, the tricky part is managing it.
 Claim your listing on the local search sites. Many of these listings are free (although some sites offer premium services only to advertisers). The more detailed your profile, the more readily your business will appear in search results. 
 Responding to reviews is a delicate act of customer relations. A snarky review may make your blood boil -- if so, step away from the keyboard and calm down until you can respond graciously. 
 ''Hands down, when I've seen a conflict, it's usually because the business owner is enraged, furious or personally hurt,'' said Jeremy Stoppelman, chief executive and co-founder of Yelp. ''Give yourself some time to cool off and engage in a respectful, courteous manner.''
 You don't need to respond to every review, especially if the overall consensus is positive. A negative review, however, demands special attention. Some business owners post public responses to apologize and try to win back the customer. Some privately message the reviewer.
 Even hostile critics sometimes are mollified by a polite response from the merchant. ''They are so disarmed,'' said Mr. Simons, one of the owners of Founding Farmers restaurant in Washington. ''I've had people immediately go back in and edit what they wrote.''
 Jeff Diamond, co-owner of Farmstead Cheeses and Wines, with stores in Oakland and Alameda, Calif., responds to every review on Yelp -- and he's had more than 100. In one case, a reviewer complained that the person behind the counter was rude. Mr. Diamond sent a private message to the customer, apologized and asked for details. It turned out the employee who helped this customer was hard of hearing. By the end of the exchange, this onetime critic had joined the store's wine club. He has since become a loyal customer.
 ''The most important thing is not to argue with your customer,'' Mr. Diamond said. ''It's to listen to your customer. Try to put yourself in the customer's place.''
 Another no-no is posting false reviews. Don't write fake reviews to puff up your business or trash a competitor. Businesses have been publicly exposed for shilling and suffered major embarrassment. Earlier this month, authorities said the cosmetic surgery clinic Lifestyle Lift would pay $300,000 in civil penalties after an investigation by the New York State attorney general's office found that employees had posed as plastic surgery patients to write glowing reviews of their own business -- a bogus grass-roots movement known as ''astroturfing.''
 ''If you're stuffing the ballot box and that is detected -- which it almost inevitably will be -- the backlash will be really significant and come back to bite you,'' said Kara Nortman, senior vice president of publishing at Citysearch.
 Indeed, the surest way to generate positive reviews is not to ghost-write them but to focus on good service. ''It's all common sense -- the best way to ensure that you have positive reviews is to offer good products, good service, have integrity and be diligent,'' said Greg Sterling, a San Francisco-based Internet analyst who specializes in small business and local search. ''It's really just the rules of dealing with people in the real world, translated online.''
 Fortunately, online reviews can help you do just that. These reviewers are a virtual army of secret shoppers who are telling you exactly what works and what doesn't. 
 Look for patterns. Are people consistently complaining about poor service? Are they constantly praising something that you can emphasize to differentiate your business?
 At Founding Farmers in Washington, online reviews provide so much feedback that Mr. Simons stopped hiring secret shoppers. These comments have led managers to revamp how the front desk handles reservations and walk-ins, mark the vegetarian menu more clearly, coach servers who got bad reviews and even fire some employees.
 ''I would say 97 percent is genuinely useful,'' said Mr. Simons. ''You can tell the reviews that are written by a competitor or just someone who's mean and angry. But generally people don't go to a restaurant to get annoyed, and there's at least some nugget of valuable information.''
 Promote
 These platforms do more than help you protect your good name. They can also serve as tools for marketing, analytics and aiming at customers.
 Becoming an advertiser can buy you more ability to work the crowd. Benefits vary by site, but advertisers generally get more prominent display and other tools. On Yelp, advertisers can highlight a favorite review to appear at the top of their page (the other reviews are ordered according to how recent they are and how many user votes they received). On Citysearch, advertisers can get help with copywriting or video commercials and have their content pushed out to partner sites like MapQuest, AOL CityGuide and MySpace.
 These platforms also can help business owners mine customer information. For example, Yelp has a dashboard that allows business owners to keep track of page views and offer promotions. 
 Danny Leclair, co-owner of Studio DNA hair salons in Los Angeles and Santa Monica, Calif., checks to see how many people come to his Yelp page -- and often sees spikes in traffic after special offers or new reviews. He also uses tools like statcounter.com to see what pages his clients are coming from when they click on his site.
 Once he started mingling in these online communities and using their tools, he got immediate traction. He said 50 percent of his new business now comes from Yelp, 30 percent from Citysearch and 10 percent from Google searches. 
 ''My business began to grow exponentially,'' Mr. Leclair said.
 Quick Tips:
 Set up automatic alerts to notify you when your business is mentioned in a review or blog.
 Local search sites are the new Yellow Pages -- make sure your business is listed. The more complete your listing, the more likely you are to get good search results. 
 Respond to reviews to show readers that you are listening and that you care about customer service. 
 Online reviews are a gold mine of business intelligence. Analyze metrics to get a better sense of your customer demographics. 
 Don't write false reviews to puff your business or trash a competitor. You can severely damage your reputation...and look really silly.

HEADLINE: Entrepreneurs Leverage New Orleans's Charm to Lure Small Businesses

BYLINE: By ABBY ELLIN

 BODY:
IT has been a long time since the word ''optimism'' was spoken in the same sentence as ''New Orleans.''
 But a small group of entrepreneurs has been using that word lately to describe their efforts to attract small businesses to New Orleans. For now, their enthusiasm may be greater than their results. But they say the city's low rents and business tax incentives along with its music and culture have proved to be powerful lures, despite the still-halting efforts to get past the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. 
 ''We're seeing the exact same thing here that we saw in the Bay Area in the mid '90s,'' said Michael Hecht, 38, president of Greater New Orleans Inc., a nonprofit economic development agency. He moved to New Orleans in early 2006 after time in both San Francisco and New York. ''There's a sense of opportunity and possibility, combined with people who have the horsepower to actualize those possibilities.'' 
 Since Hurricane Katrina, at least four formal entrepreneurial hubs have been established in New Orleans: Entrepreneur's Row, the Icehouse, the I.P., (an acronym for Intellectual Property) and the Entergy Innovation Center. While they all hope to help nurture individual businesses, they are not technically incubators. Instead, they house start-ups and established companies while focusing on ''clustering like-minded entrepreneurs to build their businesses together,'' said Tim Williamson, 44, the co-founder and chief executive of the Idea Village, a nonprofit group founded in 2000 that helped created the I.P.
 So far, they seem to be doing something right. According to the Louisiana Workforce Commission, the New Orleans metropolitan area reported an increase of nearly 100,000 nonfarm jobs from October 2005 -- soon after Katrina -- to June 2009. By 2016, the commission expects New Orleans area employment to grow 24 percent from 2006 levels, or to 98.8 percent of pre-Katrina levels.
 ''There has never been a better time in Louisiana for the creative class to thrive,'' said Mitchell J. Landrieu, the state's lieutenant governor. 
 Jon Guidroz, 27, is one of the entrepreneurs who was persuaded to move to the city. He grew up in New Orleans but was living in Massachusetts and working for Free Flow Power, a renewable energy company, after Katrina hit. ''I wanted to return to help,'' he said. But he said he did not see a strong business reason to move.
 Then, last year, Sean Cummings, a real estate developer and entrepreneur in New Orleans, randomly found Free Flow's Web site and noticed that the company had a Mississippi River project in the works. Mr. Cummings, 44, a co-founder of a group called Startup New Orleans, invited Mr. Guidroz to visit his offices in New Orleans at 220 Camp Street, a loft building called Entrepreneur's Row. As an extra incentive, Mr. Cummings even offered to give him six months free rent. 
 ''He helped me fulfill my dream of bringing this business to New Orleans,'' said Mr. Guidroz, who moved back in January. ''Until these guys rolled out the red carpet for me -- immediate access to a substantial network in the city and state for getting things done, finding local investors -- I don't think we would have done it.''
 Entrepreneur's Row was conceived in May 2007, when Mr. Cummings received a phone call from Nicolas Perkin, the co-founder and president of the Receivables Exchange, an electronic marketplace for the buying and selling of commercial receivables. Mr. Perkin had recently gotten married, and he and his bride wanted to relocate to New Orleans from New York. What did Mr. Cummings think? 
 Mr. Cummings thought it was a great idea, and the two men set about figuring out how to attract other entrepreneurs to the city. ''To really prosper, New Orleans must focus on the few opportunities where we have a compelling competitive advantage,'' Mr. Cummings said. ''We must likewise recruit entrepreneurs who are drawn to a joyful quality of life. It's a home-run success story. Entrepreneurs are reinventing New Orleans, like Prague after the curtain, like Milan, like a smaller Seattle.'' 
 Along with three other business executives, Mr. Cummings and Mr. Perkin came up with Startup New Orleans, a Web-based information service to connect entrepreneurs with the resources they need to set up a new business. In March 2008, Mr. Cummings established Entrepreneur's Row. Today, it is home to nine companies, including the Receivables Exchange; Mr. Guidroz's company Free Flow Power; and Audiosocket, a music licensor. (Mr. Cummings has a financial stake in at least six of the companies.) 
 The Icehouse -- a 12,000-square-foot, renovated warehouse in the Seventh Ward, which was severely damaged by Katrina -- opened in April 2008 and now houses seven businesses. They each pay $600 a desk each month, which covers a phone with private number, high-speed Internet, a kitchen and a rooftop deck access. 
 ''One of the things we wanted to do post-Katrina was to make sure that our footprint had maximum impact,'' said Robbie Vitrano, president of Trumpet, a branding and business development firm that is managing the building. ''We wanted to be in a neighborhood that was redeveloping.'' Mr. Vitrano, 45, is also a co-founder of Startup New Orleans.
 Earlier this year, the Idea Village and Greater New Orleans Inc. refurbished an 85,000-square-foot building at 643 Magazine Street in the warehouse district and called it the I.P. (Intellectual Property). It has nine tenants, including TurboSquid, a 3-D modeling company; TJ Ebbert and Associates, a disaster management consulting firm; and Carrollton Technology Partners, a technology development company. The building has a cafe, a gym with his and her saunas, business concierge desk and multiple ''brainstorm rooms.'' 
 Part of the appeal is that New Orleans is, perhaps, the ultimate college campus for adults. After work, many of the young businesspeople gather for drinks at International House, the boutique hotel in the central business district that Mr. Cummings opened 10 years ago across the street from his loft building. Mr. Cummings and Mr. Perkin also hold monthly meetings at the hotel in which business owners can share war stories and vent. 
 ''The thing about this city, like no other -- everybody wants everyone to succeed,'' said Seema Sudan, the owner and director of design at the knitwear company LiaMolly, who moved to New Orleans in October 2007. ''I have never been in a place that is so community-oriented,'' she said. ''Competitive gets you nowhere. It's about being collaborative. And this city is so like that, from the people helping each other rebuild their homes to building businesses.''
 She said she also appreciated the quality of life, and the fact that she paid $800 for a 900-square-foot studio in the Garden District, and $1,800 for a three-bedroom apartment with a yard and tree house. 
 Two years into his project, Mr. Cummings remains enthusiastic. 
 ''I am blown away by the caliber of talent,'' he said. ''It's a thriving creative culture of invention. And it is growing every day.''

HEADLINE: A Siesta, a Snooze, a Resting of the Eyes: A Look at Who Naps

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Wake up, America! Fully one in three adults admit that on any typical day they take a nap, according to a national survey released Wednesday.
 The proportion of self-proclaimed nappers was even higher among adults who had trouble sleeping the night before and who had exercised within the past 24 hours. It was also disproportionately higher among people who are poorer, black, men older than 50, men and women over 80 and among people who are not happy. 
 The Pew Research Center Social and Demographic Trends survey of daily activities found that people who were unemployed were more likely to nap during the week than on weekends and that those with jobs were only slightly more likely to nap on weekends. 
 The survey also asked whether people had trouble sleeping, presumably at night. Women were more likely to, as were people who make less than $20,000 a year and those who, regardless of their income, were dissatisfied with their personal financial situation. 
 The survey did not precisely define what constitutes a nap. Some people claim they are just resting their eyes when they are really snoozing. Others may doze momentarily when reading articles about demographic trends. Still others are driven to nod off briefly by the swaying of their bus or commuter train.
 ''Are we accurate reporters of our own habits?'' said Paul Taylor, the Pew center's director. ''If you asked my grown children whether I nap, their answer is yes. Their defining image of me is in an easy chair with a newspaper in my lap, dozing off. If you ask me, my answer is no. That's my story, and I'm sticking with it.''
 Napping is still often stigmatized, for example by being associated with illness or a lack of ambition. 
 But many people, and experts, praise the benefits of a siesta or a power snooze. Confessed nappers include Albert Einstein, Winston Churchill, Thomas Edison and Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. 
 Napping, writes James B. Maas, a Cornell University sleep expert, ''should have the status of daily exercise.'' 
 Mammals that divide their day between two distinct periods -- sleep and wakefulness -- are in the minority, according to the National Sleep Foundation, which pointed out on its Web site: ''While naps do not necessarily make up for inadequate or poor quality nighttime sleep, a short nap of 20-30 minutes can help to improve mood, alertness and performance.''

HEADLINE: Massachusetts Adjusts a Cut, Providing Some Health Care for 30,000 Immigrants

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
Massachusetts trimmed its ambitious plan to provide health care for virtually all its residents on Wednesday when the legislature failed to restore enough money to the budget to provide full benefits for 30,000 legal immigrants. 
 It did, however, provide for partial coverage, relieving some supporters of the program, who had feared that the cuts would be deeper. 
 Last month, to help close a gaping deficit, the legislature eliminated health insurance for the immigrants, which cost about $130 million a year. Wednesday's vote restored $40 million -- about 30 percent -- leaving unclear just how much care the affected immigrants would qualify for. Those affected are permanent residents who have had green cards for less than five years. 
 It was the first retreat for the health care experiment just as Congress looked to the state as a model. 
 ''It's a first step, and we're pleased they will be covered,'' Eva Millona, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, said of the partial restoration. ''But we still remain very concerned as to what type of coverage they will receive.''
 Ms. Millona and other critics of the original cut had said it unfairly affected taxpaying residents and reversed progress toward near-universal coverage. 
 Gov. Deval Patrick, a Democrat, wanted lawmakers to restore $70 million to the program, but legislative leaders resisted, saying too many other vital programs would have to be cut.
 The affected immigrants are covered under Commonwealth Care, a subsidized insurance program for low-income residents that is central to the state's landmark universal health care law. 
 The reduced benefits, which will affect only nondisabled adults ages 18 to 65, will take effect in September. Ms. Millona said she hoped that the immigrants would at least remain eligible for emergency care and some preventive care.
 Under the 1996 federal law that overhauled the nation's welfare system, the 30,000 immigrants affected by the loss of coverage do not qualify for Medicaid or other federal aid. Massachusetts is one of the few states -- others are California, New York and Pennsylvania -- that nonetheless provide at least some health coverage for such immigrants.
 Because of its three-year-old law, Massachusetts has the country's lowest percentage of uninsured residents: 2.6 percent, compared with a national average of 15 percent. The law requires that almost every resident have insurance, and to meet that goal, the state subsidizes coverage for those earning up to three times the federal poverty level, or $66,150 for a family of four. 
 But the recession has made an already difficult experiment far more challenging. Enrollment in Commonwealth Care has risen sharply in recent months, to 181,000, as more people have lost jobs. That increase, combined with plummeting state revenues, made it impossible to maintain last year's level of service, state officials said.

HEADLINE: Efficiency Drive Could Cut Energy Use 23% by 2020, Study Finds

BYLINE: By KATE GALBRAITH

 BODY:
The biggest opportunity to improve the nation's energy situation is a major investment program to make homes and businesses more efficient, according to a study released Wednesday by the consulting firm McKinsey. An investment of $520 billion in improvements like sealing ducts and replacing inefficient appliances could produce $1.2 trillion in savings on energy bills through 2020, the study found.
 The report said such a program, if carried out over the next decade, could cut the country's projected energy use in 2020 by about 23 percent, a savings that would be ''greater than the total of energy consumption of Canada,'' Ken Ostrowski, a senior partner in McKinsey's Atlanta office, said at a forum in Washington on Wednesday. It would also more than offset the growth in energy use that would be expected otherwise. 
 ''The scale is vast if we can put together the means to pursue it,'' Mr. Ostrowski said.
 Homes account for about 35 percent of the potential efficiency gains, according to McKinsey, while the industrial sector accounts for 40 percent and the commercial sector 25 percent. The report included only efficiency improvements whose long-term savings would outweigh the initial costs. It did not consider the potential environmental benefits of cutting energy use.
 The report acknowledged substantial barriers to achieving the savings, foremost among them the initial costs. The $52 billion annual investment envisioned by McKinsey is four or five times more than the nation currently spends on energy efficiency, and would have to be maintained over a decade. The economic stimulus package passed in February barely makes a dent; by McKinsey's estimate, it contains $10 billion to $15 billion in spending on energy efficiency.
 Some home or business owners may not have the money to finance efficiency improvements, even if they would pay off in the long run. Other barriers include inertia (a homeowner may simply not feel like replacing an old air-conditioner); and poorly aligned incentives (a landlord who does not pay the electric bill has no economic reason to replace the old air-conditioner).
 The potential gains are also spread across millions of homes and businesses, so getting widespread participation would be a challenge.
 ''No question, the potential is there theoretically,'' said David G. Victor, an energy expert at the University of California, San Diego, noting that he had not yet seen the report's details. ''It's really, really difficult to achieve that full potential in the real world.''
 To achieve $1 trillion in savings, Mr. Victor added, would require ''a lot of people and a lot of complex organizations to change their behavior.''
 The McKinsey report's recommendations include providing education and better information about the potential savings from energy efficiency, tighter building codes, stricter efficiency requirements for appliances and greater financial incentives for making efficiency improvements.
 The Obama administration has been pursuing many of these avenues -- for example, some energy-efficiency funding in the stimulus bill requires states to promise to strengthen their building codes. President Obama has also made stricter appliance standards a priority.
 Jon Creyts, a McKinsey partner in Chicago, said that energy efficiency presented the ''most compelling'' way to combat climate change, as well as to achieve energy security and affordability. It is not, however, a panacea, he said.
 ''Energy efficiency is an important and compelling low-cost option,'' Mr. Creyts said, ''but there are reasons that we need to innovate and continue to develop clean sources of energy.''
 Peter Lehner, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said even greater savings were possible. The McKinsey report made conservative assumptions, he noted, and it did not account for savings from changes in behavior -- people turning out lights in empty rooms or turning down the thermostat in winter, for example. 
 Nor did the $1.2 trillion figure take account of a possible cost for greenhouse gas emissions, which could be capped under climate legislation pending in Congress, and could bring about increases in energy efficiency.
 ''Even if we don't get a climate bill this year, it's extremely conservative to think there will not be a price on carbon in the next decade,'' Mr. Lehner said.
 The study was partly financed by McKinsey, and by a group of co-sponsors that included the Southern Company, a utility holding company, as well as the United States Green Building Council and the Department of Energy.
 A separate study released on Tuesday by the National Research Council cited potential energy savings of 15 percent by 2020 and 30 percent by 2030 if more efficient technologies were adopted. Unlike McKinsey, the research council included transportation, acknowledging that it would be a difficult sector to transform quickly.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 7, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on July 30 about a McKinsey study on energy efficiency gave an incomplete quotation from Ken Ostrowski, a senior partner in McKinsey's Atlanta office. Mr. Ostrowski said that if the United States reduced its projected energy use in 2020 by about 23 percent, in ways identified in the study, the savings would be ''greater than the total energy consumption of Canada excluding transportation'' -- not Canada's overall energy consumption.

HEADLINE: Reviving Industrial Jobs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Where the Jobs Are'' (editorial, July 24):
 You are right to warn of the problems the United States economy will experience because ''low-wage fields are the ones that are adding the most jobs.'' Raising the minimum wage is part of the solution, as is ''working with unions, professional associations, community colleges, and employers'' to build better career ladders based on improved worker skills. 
 But even more important is revitalizing a slumping domestic manufacturing sector that traditionally has been working-class America's best provider of well-paying jobs. And domestic manufacturing cannot be revived without much smarter trade policies that focus on two goals.
 First, our trade policies must eliminate the artificial incentives to move overseas the industries that create these well-paying jobs.
 Second, they must respond more effectively to predatory foreign trade practices, like currency manipulation, that have devastated domestic manufacturing for reasons having nothing to do with free trade or free markets.

 Re ''Stores Go Dark Where Buyers Once Roamed'' (front page, July 21): 
 Retail vacancy rates are up, and your article points to high rents as a main reason for such vacancies.
 The truth is that building owners throughout the city are doing all they can to work with tenants to help them get through this terrible economic time. It makes no sense to push paying tenants out to have vacant storefronts. Higher vacancies clearly lead to lower rents, not higher rents.
 Unemployment is at all-time highs, sales taxes are up, real estate taxes are up and people around the world are shopping less while they try to save their homes and make ends meet.
 A commercial real estate broker quoted at the end of the article correctly states what's actually happening in the market. For building owners, ''it's all about tenant retention.''

HEADLINE: Bright Lights, Big Internet

BYLINE: By BILL WASIK. 
Bill Wasik, a senior editor at Harper's, is the author of ''And Then There's This: How Stories Live and Die in Viral Culture.''

 BODY:
THIS summer, as in so many summers gone by, young aspirants to the creative class -- would-be writers, musicians, artists, editors, comedians, performers, thinkers, provocateurs -- are stepping off buses in Port Authority and trains in Penn Station, navigating their rented trucks and borrowed cars through outer-borough blocks. These new arrivals come to New York, first and foremost, to find one another, a flock of other young people like themselves. But they come also to seek success, to chase their ''big break,'' that vague but real moment when, as if by magic, one suddenly finds oneself on the opposite side of the glass from one's nose print. 
 Is New York still worth the trip? Recessions tend to be hard on youthful dreams, but this downturn has proved especially dispiriting. Those in the print media have come to see their present fiscal woes as not merely cyclical but structural, and so their slashed workforce and diminished output seem unlikely to rebound any time soon. Galleries have closed. Foundations, their endowments devastated, have cut back on grants for the arts. Internships across the board are down by more than 20 percent. And those of us who still hold full-time jobs in creative fields are clinging to them for dear life, making it difficult for young people to pry any free for themselves. 
 Meanwhile, another destination beckons, a place that courses with all the raw ambition and creative energy that the hard times seem to have drained from New York. I am referring, of course, to the Internet, which over the past decade has slowly become the de facto heart of American culture: the public space in which our most influential conversations transpire, in which our new celebrities are discovered and touted, in which fans are won and careers made. 
 Wherever young creatives physically reside today, in their endeavors they are increasingly moving online: posting their photos, writing, videos and music, building a ''presence'' in the hope of winning an audience. Monetary rewards on the Internet are still scarce, it is true, but the cost of living is cheap and, more important, the opportunities for attention are plentiful. Every month more YouTube sensations emerge, more bloggers ink big book deals, more bands blow up through music Web sites and MySpace, and every day more young people seek their ''big break'' in the virtual megalopolis rather than in (or as well as in) the physical one.
 The experience of moving online actually bears quite a few similarities to becoming a New Yorker. Disorienting and seemingly endless, the Internet conversation moves at lightning speed and according to unstated social rules that can bewilder outsiders. Also, like New Yorkers, residents of the Internet do not suffer fools, or mince words in belittling them, as anyone who has contributed a redundant post to Metafilter, or an earnest comment to Gawker, can attest. 
 In their scope, both the Internet and New York are profoundly humbling: young people accustomed to feeling special about their gifts are inevitably jarred, upon arrival, to discover just how many others are trying to do precisely the same, with equal or greater success. (For a vivid demonstration of this online, try to invent a play on words, and then Google it. You'll be convinced that there is, in fact, ''nothing new in the cloud'' -- a joke that a British I.B.M. employee beat me to last November.)
 Moreover, the presence of an audience causes online residents to style themselves as outsized personae, as characters on a public stage. On the Internet, as in creative New York, everyone can possess a tiny measure of celebrity, and everyone pays attention to what everyone else is doing, all the time. 
 Six months after my own arrival in this city, when I began a brief stint in 2000 working in the Conde Nast building, I was surprised to see minor incidents from the elevators, or the cafeteria, appear in the pages of The New York Observer, just as a decade before they might have shown up in Spy magazine. Today, of course, that sort of mirthful over-scrutiny is everyone's lot, as any misdirected e-mail message in any city or industry whatsoever is likely to find its way onto blogs and into the public domain.
 But online, when creative affirmation finally arrives, it takes a very different form than it has in New York. In the offline world, getting a ''big break'' is a matter of impressing a subjective intelligence, one person or a few people who look at work with an experienced eye and declare there's something to it. Up until now, it has been intimate encouragement that has literally set the course of whole careers: a gallery offers a show, a record label dangles a contract, a prospective boss plucks one resume from a sheaf, and a path forward is set. 
 Such moments of recognition, by individuals or small groups, have helped to decide not merely who succeeds but at what. A nice note from a famous poet can cause an amorphously creative young person to throw the novels and screenplays overboard and take up verse for life. Without intervention from The New Yorker, John Updike might well have been a cartoonist, James Thurber a journalist, William Shawn himself a composer.
 On the Internet, however, it's not one single subjectivity but a popular hive-mind that decides. The ''big break'' arrives when, with lightning speed and often to one's own surprise, the inscrutable pack decides to start forwarding one's content around. 
 Like the note from the poet, the viral blowup online is transformative: The Gregory Brothers, transplants to Brooklyn from Radford, Va., are a serious soul band, but ever since the sudden success, this spring, of their deliriously funny YouTube series ''Auto-Tune the News'' (which turns news footage of politicians and pundits into pop jams), they've been devoting ever more time to keeping their hundreds of thousands of online fans entertained. Talk to anyone who makes culture online and you'll often hear a similar story -- of the first Web site that took off, or the video or the new meme successfully disseminated.
 And so the move online changes how we make art, but the road ahead there is uncharted and perilous. In the old model, young creatives dreamed of entertaining the millions, but in practice they could do so only by first pleasing a small group of gatekeepers: established figures who controlled access to the audience and, in doing so, protected young people from that audience, its obsessions and desertions, its adoration and its scorn. These old hands had to worry about the numbers, of course, but they rationalized the upticks and downticks through a certain set of professional values, which they themselves spent years imbibing and which they in turn pressed upon their wards. 
 Online, though, the audience can be yours right away, direct and unmediated -- if you can figure out how to find it and, what's harder, to keep it. What to you is a big break is, to this increasingly sophisticated and fickle audience, just one forwarded e-mail message in a teeming inbox, to be refilled again tomorrow with a whole new slate of distractions. ''Microcelebrity'' is now the rule, with respect not only to the size of one's fan base but also to the duration of its love. Believe it or not, the Internet is a tougher town than New York; fewer people make it here, but no one there seems to make it for long.

HEADLINE: Fed's Snapshot Captures a Picture Slightly Less Grim

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
The recession is losing force in most parts of the United States, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday in a snapshot of economic activity from across the country.
 But the picture remains grim in other sections, with retail sales down in the Midwest, loan demand falling in New York, commercial real estate weakening and manufacturing activity stumbling in many regions. 
 The assessments were part of the Fed's beige book, a regular assessment of economic conditions from 12 Fed districts nationwide. Since the spring, the various Fed districts have reported that things were still bad, but not hurtling downward at an accelerating pace.
 Despite stabilizing conditions over all, few businesses or industries are girding for a rebound. Manufacturers anticipate a modest and uneven recovery. Some retailers are bracing for a long, slow recovery; the job market remains dismal and is likely to stay that way for some time.
 ''The weakness of labor markets has virtually eliminated upward wage pressure, and wages and compensation are steady or falling in most districts,'' the Fed said.
 While the broad arc of the economy tracked a similar course, this time there were a few more glints of hope. In four districts, health care companies were hiring. Information technology jobs were opening up in the Richmond and Minneapolis districts. And there were signs that New York's labor market was stabilizing.
 Also on Wednesday, the government reported that new orders to factories for durable goods fell sharply in June as demand for commercial aircraft and motor vehicles declined from a month earlier.
 The 2.5 percent drop in manufacturers' orders was the largest decline in five months, but economists said the picture was brighter than it might seem. Excluding volatile orders for transportation equipment, manufacturers' orders rose 1.1 percent for the month, a larger increase than analysts had forecast.
 Economists said the numbers reflected more stability in the manufacturing sector after months of declines that came as factories shut down, cut their inventories and scaled back production as they confronted the worst economy in decades. Now, manufacturing seems to be finding its footing, economists said.
 ''It tells me we're on the cusp of a very slow and gradual recovery,'' said Tim Quinlan, an economic analyst for Wells Fargo. ''Businesses have been in absolute lockdown all year. Everybody has been scaling back and saving money. Orders seem to be in a bottoming process.''
 Still, new orders for all durable goods -- products that last several years -- were down 26.7 percent in June from a year earlier, the Commerce Department reported, and shipments of goods fell 19.5 percent.
 In June, there were more new orders for metals, machinery, electrical equipment and appliances. Orders for military aircraft rose by 30 percent in June from a month earlier, the Commerce Department reported. 
 But declines in automotive orders, coupled with a double-digit decline in orders for commercial aircraft, weighed on the sector, demonstrating the volatility of the government's figures on durable goods orders. 
 New orders for motor vehicles and parts fell 1 percent in June, reflecting turmoil caused by the bankruptcies of General Motors and Chrysler in addition to sagging demand for domestic automobiles. Orders for civilian aircraft plunged 38.5 percent, one month after they shot up 60 percent.

HEADLINE: 2 Entries at Saratoga's Opener: Hope and Gloom

BYLINE: By JOE DRAPE

DATELINE: SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. 

 BODY:
Hope sprang eternal on the backside of Saratoga Race Course on Wednesday morning as it has for 141 years on opening day. Horsemen rubbed the legs of the 2-year-old fillies who would contest the $100,000 Schuylerville Stakes later in the afternoon and wondered if they might have the next Rachel Alexandra in their barn.
 Horseplayers offered a full-throated and hopeful roar when the public-address announcer, Tom Durkin, sent a field of 11 turf horses off with his signature call this time of year: ''And they're off at Saratoga.'' 
 Late afternoon rain did not dim their enthusiasm. Scores of picnics took place in the backyard of this landmark racetrack, which retains the bucolic charm of the late 1800s.
 New York racing officials, too, remained upbeat despite the ominous economic indicators buffeting the sport. Del Mar in Southern California and Churchill Downs in Kentucky had to reduce racing days because of a horse shortage.
 Here, there is plenty of horse power. The New York Racing Association received a record number of applications for stall space, 3,500, which yielded 134 horses entered for a 10-race opening day. 
 Still, there are realists. Nationally, betting handle decreased 16.9 percent in June compared with 2008, according to Equibase, and wagering is down 10.5 percent for the first half of 2009, compared with that period last year.
 Purses have dropped nearly 7 percent in the same time frame, which has prompted NYRA to be more innovative. It started an incentive program for trainers to get their horses out of the barn and into races.
 In dirt races at nine furlongs or farther, for example, the prize money will increase $4,000 to $8,000 per horse above six betting interests, depending on the level of the race. 
 ''It's pretty straightforward: the more horses in the race, the more people bet and the bigger the purses become,'' said Harold G. Handel, NYRA's executive vice president and chief operating officer.
 This more-for-everyone theory was on display with the five turf races, which typically draw the largest fields, that were featured on opening day. Last summer, the first three weeks were essentially rained out as 35 races were taken off the turf, prompting a 10.3 percent drop in betting.
 Even though the Kentucky Derby champion Mine That Bird and the Preakness winner Rachel Alexandra will miss the $500,000 Jim Dandy Stakes on Saturday, the Spa offers the finest summer stakes racing in the nation.
 Over the next six weeks, 34 graded stakes, 14 of them prestigious Grade I races, will be contested. The Travers Stakes, known as the Midsummer Derby, will be run Aug. 29. The owners of Mine That Bird intend to run him in the Travers as long as he emerges healthy from the $750,000 West Virginia Derby on Saturday.
 Saratoga's stakes schedule began Wednesday with the Grade III Schuylerville, a six-furlong race won by Hot Dixie Chick, whose trainer, Steve Asmussen, also has the superfilly Rachel Alexandra in his barn.
 Jess Jackson, Rachel Alexandra's owner, has not ruled out bringing her here for the Alabama Stakes for fillies or for the Travers, where she would run against the boys again. She is facing the Belmont Stakes winner Summer Bird, who also is aiming for the Travers, in the $1.25 million Haskell Invitational on Sunday at Monmouth Park.
 ''A large part of me wants her to be there, but we will have to see how she comes out,'' Jackson said of Saratoga. ''I would like to see her run there. If she comes out of the race well, we will consider a race there and the alternatives.''
 The prospect of a Travers featuring the three winners of this year's Triple Crown races thrills horsemen and horseplayers alike.
 ''Those are three very classy 3-year-olds, and it would make for a spectacular race,'' the trainer Nick Zito said. ''Those horses are owned by owners who want to do right by the sport.''
 If all three show up, it would be the first time three winners of the classics met here since 1982, when Gato del Sol (Derby), Aloma's Ruler (Preakness) and Conquistador Cielo (Belmont) ran in the Travers.
 Chip Woolley, Mine That Bird's trainer, is hoping to see Rachel Alexandra here in late August.
 ''I would have loved to run Mine That Bird in the Haskell,'' he said. ''There's a lot of money there, a lot of prestige. But the problem is that if you're not within five or six lengths of the lead early at Monmouth, you have no chance. My horse is always going to be 15 to 20 lengths out of it early on.''
 Along with hope, a whole lot of luck is needed to keep an old sport healthy. The horseplayers are hoping for sunny skies at the old Spa and wishing that Mine That Bird, Rachel Alexandra and Summer Bird come out of the weekend races healthy and able to make the Travers a Midsummer Derby to remember.

HEADLINE: Car-Pool Epiphanies: A Memoir About the Ordinary

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
Melanie Gideon does not have a story of divorce, death or abuse to tell. Nor does she write of recovery from cancer, drug addiction or even a miserable childhood. Her memoir, ''The Slippery Year,'' bears the subtitle ''A Meditation on Happily Ever After.''
 With self-effacing humor, Ms. Gideon chronicles the mundanity and small epiphanies of everyday life: taking a trip to Trader Joe's on her 44th birthday, waiting in the car-pool line at her 9-year-old son's school and spending thousands of dollars to buy a mattress that both she and her husband of nearly two decades can tolerate. The book is being published next week by Alfred A. Knopf.
 ''It's really a book about nothing,'' said Ms. Gideon, 45, in a telephone interview last week from the summer home in Maine that she was renting with her husband, Ben Rewis, and their son, who is also named Ben. ''Or everything. What I discovered is that writing about nothing, I was writing about everything.'' 
 In a sly bit of counter-marketing, Jordan Pavlin, Ms. Gideon's editor at Knopf, wrote in a letter to booksellers that appeared at the front of galleys for ''The Slippery Year'' that ''this is a book for the person who has neither the time nor the discretionary income that allows her three months in Italy but longs for the same awakening.''
 It was clearly a reference to ''Eat, Pray, Love,'' Elizabeth Gilbert's blockbuster best-selling memoir. In an interview, Ms. Pavlin said she loved Ms. Gilbert's memoir and only wished to underscore its similar themes to Ms. Gideon's work. ''The goal is to be awake in your own life,'' Ms. Pavlin said.
 For her part, Ms. Gideon, who lives in Oakland, Calif., said she was also a big fan of Ms. Gilbert. ''Sometimes you have to leave the country to jar yourself awake, and sometimes you have to just go more deeply into your own life,'' she said.
 Unlike Ms. Gilbert, Ms. Gideon was not jarred into self-exploration by divorce. Instead, she suffered from the ennui of a long but essentially happy marriage. Invoking a familiar joke, she began one chapter: ''Marriage changes passion. Suddenly you're in bed with a relative.''
 As it turns out, the framework of the memoir is a little slippery as well. The events she portrays in the book, which is structured around 12 chapters, each one apparently representing a month in a single year, actually took place over several years. The incident that opens the book, her husband's purchase of a camper van, actually occurred four years ago, while another chapter, about her son's first stint at summer camp, took place a year before it appears in the chronology. The rest of the book, Ms. Gideon said, took place in the order she writes about it, over 2007 and 2008.
 In an author's note, Ms. Gideon writes that ''timelines and events have been compressed.'' 
 ''I feel like I'm actually still in this three-year period of slippery transformation,'' Ms. Gideon said in an interview. She said that she had collaborated with Ms. Pavlin on how to structure the book, as well as on the title. 
 ''At the end of the day, the conceit of the book still holds true,'' said Paul Bogaards, a Knopf spokesman. ''Ultimately when you come to the book it's not so much the 12 months that matters, but what happens day to day.''
 With a 25,000-copy first print run, Knopf's ambitions are modest. Like every publisher wishing for a breakout, it is counting on word of mouth to propel the book.
 Some early readers have already had the impulse to share the memoir with friends and family. ''I was reading pieces of that book out loud to my friends and husband because I was dying laughing,'' said Karen West, a 43-year-old wife and mother who is director of events at Book Passage, an independent bookstore in Corte Madera, Calif., and San Francisco. 
 And on the ''Book Bench'' blog of The New Yorker's Web site, Andrea Walker wrote that Ms. Gideon made her feel ''like I had just spent several hours knocking back drinks with an especially funny friend.'' Which, she added, ''is some of my highest praise.''
 Other readers have been turned off by Ms. Gideon's breezy tone and what they see as self-indulgence. Vivien Jennings, founder and president of Rainy Day Books, an independent bookstore near Kansas City, Mo., doubted that unemployed customers would relate to a woman who spent $150 getting her hair straightened or complained during a fancy meal at Chez Panisse, Alice Waters's restaurant in Berkeley, Calif. 
 ''Things are pretty tough right now,'' Ms. Jennings said. ''I started thinking: 'Really? Your husband is nice. Your son is great. Maybe you're having a midlife crisis, but I'm not sure I'm really on the page with you.' ''
 Growing up one of four sisters -- one of whom was her twin -- Ms. Gideon has known she wanted to be a writer since she was 8. Her first novel, ''The Girl Who Swallowed the Moon,'' was published by a small press in 1994. She followed with two young-adult books, ''The Map That Breathed'' and ''Pucker.''
 After ''Pucker,'' a dark fantasy about a teenage boy who has been scarred by a fire and needs to return to the world he came from to find a new skin, Ms. Gideon was looking for a change of pace and wrote an essay about her son's first year at summer camp. It was published in 2007 in the online magazine of Edutopia, George Lucas's educational foundation. She followed up a few months later with an essay about her husband's purchase of the camper van, which was published in The New York Times's Sunday Styles section, in the Modern Love column.
 She ultimately scored a book deal with Knopf in January 2008. She wrote some parts of the memoir in real time, she said, finishing it last August in the same cottage she rented this year. 
 Now Ms. Gideon has acquired a taste for personal writing. ''When you are in the process of writing a book like this, everything is material,'' she said. ''You can shut that on and off -- I'm kind of in an off stage now, but I'm starting to think about the next book. So the switch is on halfway.''
 Although ''The Slippery Year'' contains large swaths of snappy dialogue, Ms. Gideon said she never took notes and didn't rush home after incidents to record them. ''The things that I remembered are just what I remembered,'' she said. 
 Ms. Gideon said she did not want to write a memoir that revealed all her family's warts. Her husband, a technology executive at Visa International, comes across as a saint, with his only apparent flaws being a penchant for wearing a goofy helmet while surfing and a snoring problem. 
 ''I didn't want to write a book that trashed the people in my life or overexposed them,'' she said. She added, ''This is not a tell-all memoir, but a tell-some memoir.''

HEADLINE: Increasing Postal Deficits Intensify Talks on Solution

BYLINE: By ANDREA FULLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The debate over how Congress can best ease the financial woes of the United States Postal Service is likely to intensify in coming months as the Postal Service's record-breaking losses continue to escalate. 
 Postmaster General John E. Potter says the Postal Service now expects to run a record $7 billion deficit in 2009, up from projections in March of $6 billion. Losses for the third quarter will not be made public until Aug. 5, but Mr. Potter says those numbers should be similar to figures from the second quarter, when the Postal Service lost $1.9 billion.
 The Government Accountability Office added the Postal Service to its list of ''high risk'' federal programs on Tuesday, urging it to work with Congress to find a solution to its financial problems. 
 Mr. Potter previously beseeched Congress to change laws that mandate delivery six days a week, a request that has met strong opposition from some lawmakers. 
 While some remain dead set against five-day delivery, Dan G. Blair, chairman of the Postal Regulatory Commission, the independent agency that oversees the Postal Service, said the initial ''frosty reception'' from Congress appeared to be changing. 
 ''Congress certainly seems to be saying 'no way,' but what happens when they have another $6 to $7 billion operating debt next year?'' he said, noting that the commission does not plan to take sides in the delivery debate.
 Mr. Potter predicts that Congress will be more willing to change the law as the Postal Service's financial situation worsens. He says that five-day delivery could save more than $3 billion a year. The postal commission estimates the savings at $2 billion. 
 ''It's in line with the demand for our services,'' he said. ''As demand goes down, we should be able to adjust the service that we offer.''
 Representative Stephen F. Lynch, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Postal Service subcommittee, said he was not ready to support five-day delivery without further study, but he did not rule out the possibility. 
 ''I think that the finances are very sobering,'' he said. ''There are not a lot of options here.'' 
 Other lawmakers, however, say there are additional ways to cut costs.
 A bill to allow the Postal Service to pay health benefits from a retirement fund was voted out of committee last week and has 339 co-sponsors. The Postal Service says that could save $2 billion a year from the operating budget. 
 Those savings, however, will not be enough to close the budget gap. Representative Jo Ann Emerson, Republican of Missouri, says cutting overhead and spending less on custom vehicles could also help the Postal Service survive the recession. 
 Partly because of Ms. Emerson's efforts, language mandating six-day mail service has made its way into the fiscal 2010 spending bill that includes money to reimburse the Postal Service. The act also expresses opposition to the consolidation of postal stations. The Postal Service is reviewing more than 3,200 postal stations and branches to see if they could be closed or their operations consolidated, an effort that has prompted outcry in communities afraid of losing branches. 
 ''I realize that the postmaster general thinks that this will save money, but there are other ways that they can cost-cut,'' Ms. Emerson said of the potential consolidations and closures. ''My constituents feel very strongly about having their postal service continue as it always has.''
 Mr. Potter, however, said the review was ''misunderstood.'' He said that the restructuring would mostly entail consolidating the work of mail carriers. Though some postal stations would be relocated, he said, the number of closed stations ''would be few and far between.''
 The Postal Service, which lost $2.8 billion last fiscal year and $2.3 billion in the first two quarters of 2009 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, has already moved to cut costs. 
 A hiring freeze has been in effect since the spring of 2008. In the last decade, the Postal Service has lost more than 160,000 jobs through attrition, Mr. Potter said. In March, the Postal Service announced it would offer early retirement to 150,000 workers, close six of 80 district offices and eliminate 1,400 management jobs. 
 Leaders of two unions that represent postal workers say that cost-saving efforts should continue in place of what they consider extreme measures, like eliminating a day of delivery. 
 William Burrus, president of the American Postal Workers Union, said that the health benefits bill would provide enough temporary relief to survive the economic downturn, after which mail volume would rebound. 
 Mr. Potter said he expected the Postal Service to handle at least 27 billion fewer pieces of mail this year than in 2008. Frederic V. Rolando, president of the National Association of Letter Carriers, said the Postal Service should focus on new ways to generate revenue rather than on making substantial changes in service.
 ''Our take on the five-day delivery is that the Postal Service is making permanent structural changes to a problem that is the result of what is hopefully a temporary deep recession,'' he said. 
 If the debate over five-day delivery remains at a stalemate, and restructuring efforts fail to curb rising deficits, there is an additional option: Mr. Blair said that Congress might have to appropriate money to the Postal Service if huge deficits continued. For now, Mr. Potter said, ''we're not seeking an appropriation.'' 
 Congress has authorized the Postal Service to borrow up to $15 billion, capped at $3 billion a year.

HEADLINE: If Bling Had a Hall of Fame

BYLINE: By CINTRA WILSON

 BODY:
WALL STREET was alive with unintentional self-parody last week. A construction pit was yawning in front of the heart of American capitalism, the New York Stock Exchange, which has sunk to selling ad space on its own forehead: Its Corinthian pillars were obscured by a vinyl billboard for a the Holiday Inn (especially ironic since the sculpture on the pediment above the columns is loftily entitled ''Integrity Protecting the Works of Man''). 
 Down the cobblestone alleys, amid stands selling $6 neckties and discount sunglasses in a greasy haze from bumper-to-bumper hot dog carts, I received a gift from the metaphor gods: A woman in her 80s wearing stretch-cotton leggings, running shoes, a baseball cap and an XL T-shirt with TIFFANY & CO. across the front.
 Tiffany's roots run deep in our nation's history. Tiffany is as American as guns. Since opening in 1837, it has survived the Civil War, two World Wars, the Panic of 1893, the Great Depression, the psychedelic movement and 171 holiday seasons, supplying niceties from diamonds to cuspidors to dog whips. It designed a pitcher for the Lincoln inaugural, and made swords for the Civil War. 
 Tiffany introduced sterling silver to the United States. During the Gilded Age, Tiffany was beloved of European royalty, yet didn't turn down a commission from Diamond Jim Brady to create a solid gold chamber pot with an eye at the bottom, to gaze upon the backside of the actress Lillian Russell. 
 In 1885, Tiffany designed the ''E Pluribus Unum'' insignia that still graces $1 bills. During the wars, Tiffany supplied surgical instruments and precision parts for guns and airplanes. 
 It has designed and produced the Super Bowl trophy since 1967 and the Nascar trophy since 2004.
 Tiffany has always managed to navigate the dark spells of the economic cycle. ''Aesthetics, if properly understood, will almost always increase sales,'' said Walter Hoving, its chairman from 1955 to 1980, whose surefooted taste empowered the creativity of Jean Schlumberger and Elsa Peretti, even during the stagflation of the 1970s. ''Design what you think is beautiful,'' Hoving reportedly told his artists, ''and don't worry about selling it. That's our job.''
 The newer store opened on Wall Street in October 2007, barely a year before the biggest economic calamity since 1929, but seems prepared to ride out this mess, too, by adhering to Hoving's advice ... and employing a few tricks from P. T. Barnum, an old friend and collaborator in the late 1800s. 
 If the uptown Tiffany has not retained the glamour it enjoyed when that Audrey Hepburn movie came out in 1961, the Wall Street location is one of Manhattan's most beautiful retail establishments. Its architects lovingly restored the historic details of the Beaux-Arts building, a former financial institution. To accommodate a retail area, they fit an angular modern interior inside the original walls, almost like a stage set, where it manages to look both discrete and harmonious: a 1960s, butch-romantic Burt Bacharach habitat of glass, wood and mirrors, under a canopy of curlicues set into the vaulted ceiling. 
 There are almost no salesclerks on the floor assisting flip-flop-clad tourists, who browse in a reverent hush with their Starbucks cups, viewing the place as a sort of wealth museum. 
 The first level showcases the greatest hits of perennial Tiffany collections: gloopy floating hearts by Elsa Peretti; bold, knobby shapes by Paloma Picasso. The starchitect Frank Gehry, a Tiffany designer since 2006, has a collection of postmodern baubles and bangles, most notably the Fish, a shape resembling a cubist zucchini, variously wrought in wood, silver, jade and onyx.
 A number of items are devoted to infantilizing yesterday's pampered wives: a spectrum of lucky charms (hearts, stars, moons, clovers, ladybugs, etc.) and tiny replicas of the turquoise Tiffany box itself, which, at least according to the store's mythology, retains a Pavlovian effect on ladies. 
 I have always been mystified by Tiffany's heart-shaped silver dog tags, worn on a choke chain, with the engraved instructions, ''Please Return to Tiffany & Co.'' This, I have always assumed, is precautionary: If your lady gets lost, someone will put her on a plane back to the jewelry store. In any case, they are hugely popular.
 Tiffany has always offered a wide range of prices. Today the store has cases featuring ''Items for under $750,'' and the prices go down from there. For under $100, you can get a black plastic heart, printed in classic dog tag style, on a length of black cord.
 A white marble and glass staircase swirls up to the mezzanine, that one may ascend closer to cherubim while viewing wedding bands and larger diamonds. A fetching young woman was beaming at one of the tables, sipping Veuve Clicquot. 
 ''Are you getting your ring?'' I asked. 
 ''Yes!'' she mock-whispered, wriggling with joy. ''It's all bought and everything! They're just shining it up!''
 Three young Chinese tourists were excitedly viewing a gold necklace with a small diamond at the center, for $900. 
 ''Are you buying necklaces for your girlfriends?'' I asked. 
 ''He is,'' said one with a backpack, pointing at his serious-looking friend. 
 ''How did you know about Tiffany in China?'' I asked the potential buyer. ''Is it famous there?'' 
 ''I use the Internet,'' he said, somewhat defensively. 
 ''How did you know we are from China?'' his friend asked. 
 The buyer became shy and hostile, and suddenly cupped his hands around the diamond he was viewing, so I couldn't see it. 
 I hadn't realized how intensely personal diamond buying is. It is a concentrated riot of vulnerable emotions, best articulated by the rowdy little diamonds themselves. There is something still stunningly romantic about it, despite the commercial hype that beats this idea into meaninglessness. 
 On the way out, I noticed that my newly bling'd bride-to-be had been wearing one of Tiffany's silver dog tags around her neck. Marriages, like the strongest economies, may unexpectedly collapse. Should she run away, at least she is guaranteed to be returned to a place that clearly makes her happy. 
 TIFFANY & COMPANY
 37 Wall Street (between Nassau and William Streets); (212) 514-8015.
 STIFFENY Tiffany has persisted though hell and high water by providing safely tasteful conspicuous consumption for those who have money and don't really know what to do with it. 
 SPIFFANY Just because it's mostly square doesn't mean it doesn't have pieces that are actually artistic (big, fat, semiprecious Paloma Picasso watch-foblike things; interesting Frank Gehry wood and onyx bracelets). And, of course, a world of ornaments in which the bling-o-centric might bedeck themselves. 
 EPIPHANY How to survive yet another Depression, a la Tiffany: Make two versions of the Elsa Peretti silver mesh necklace -- a wider version for $2,100, and a thinner one for $1,350. Very shrewd. Of course, if you're like most of us, you'll still have to be content buying one of the turquoise leather luggage tags.

HEADLINE: House Democrats End Impasse on Health Bill

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Carl Hulse contributed reporting from Washington, and Helene Cooper from Bristol, Va.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Efforts to pass sweeping health care legislation took a big step forward on Wednesday as House Democratic leaders reached an agreement with fiscally conservative party members that would cut the bill's cost and exempt many small businesses from having to provide health benefits to workers. 
 The agreement, brokered by aides to President Obama, overcame a 10-day impasse and would allow a pivotal House committee to resume work on the bill, with an expectation that the panel could approve it later this week. 
 Under the deal, the Democratic leaders promised to defer a vote by the full House until September, so lawmakers could test public sentiment on the measure, which could fundamentally restructure one-sixth of the nation's economy. 
 Elements of the agreement reflect priorities shared by centrist members of both parties who have been trying for months to forge a compromise in the Senate Finance Committee.
 Under the House agreement, the federal government would still establish a public insurance plan to compete with private insurers, but the public plan would not use Medicare fee schedules to pay doctors and hospitals, as envisioned in the original House bill. Instead, the public plan would negotiate rates with health care providers, as private insurers often do.
 Representative Mike Ross of Arkansas, the chief negotiator for the fiscally conservative Democrats known as Blue Dogs, said the changes were ''a huge win for us.'' 
 Blue Dogs said the change reduced the likelihood that the government plan would compete unfairly with private insurers by forcing doctors and hospitals to accept below-market rates. As part of the deal, states could, in addition, set up nonprofit cooperatives to offer coverage to individuals, families and small businesses. The Senate Finance Committee is coalescing around a similar idea, as an alternative to a government-run insurance plan, but it was not in the original House bill. 
 ''We have cut the cost of the bill substantially,'' Mr. Ross said. ''We have delayed a floor vote until September. We have protected small business.''
 But some of the concessions to Blue Dogs set off a revolt among members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, who said they feared that the public insurance plan was being weakened. 
 ''We do not support this,'' said Representative Lynn Woolsey, Democrat of California, co-chairwoman of the progressive caucus. ''It's a nonstarter.'' 
 In the Senate, negotiations in the Finance Committee were also moving forward -- to such a degree that Senate Republican leaders became worried that a deal might be near. One Republican negotiator, Senator Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming, tried to quash that idea, saying the group was ''nowhere near a deal.''
 ''I don't see a way that we can finish before the recess,'' Mr. Enzi said -- just 24 hours after the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, had said he expected the committee to approve a bill next week.
 The Energy and Commerce Committee, the third of three House panels to take up the legislation, was to resume work on Thursday. 
 As he traveled to Raleigh, N.C., and Bristol, Va., Mr. Obama welcomed the agreement. ''I'm especially grateful that so many members, including some Blue Dogs on the Energy and Commerce Committee, are working so hard to find common ground,'' he said. ''Those efforts are extraordinarily constructive in strengthening this legislation and bringing down its cost.''
 The president's travels on Wednesday were part of a White House sales pitch, as officials have been fretting that the script has been hijacked by critics who say that some of his proposals could hurt Americans who already have health insurance.
 ''These folks need to stop scaring everybody,'' Mr. Obama said. 
 After marathon negotiations, four of seven Blue Dog holdouts on the Energy and Commerce Committee reached the agreement with the chairman of the panel, Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California. 
 The Congressional Budget Office said the bill would ultimately provide coverage to most people who are uninsured. Mr. Ross said the Blue Dogs had won concessions that should bring the 10-year cost below $1 trillion, a goal shared by the Senate Finance Committee.
 Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who is chairman of the committee, said the latest estimates from the budget office indicated that his bill would cost ''under $900 billion.''
 The House negotiators, including Mr. Ross and aides to Mr. Waxman, said they had agreed to make these changes in the bill:
 Most employers would still be required to provide health insurance to workers or pay a new federal tax, but more small businesses could qualify for the exemption, which would be available to businesses with annual payrolls of $500,000 or less, compared with a threshold of $250,000 in the original House bill. The maximum tax rate, 8 percent of wages, would apply to employers with payrolls exceeding $750,000, rather than the original threshold of $400,000.
 Medicaid would be expanded, as under the original bill, but states would pay a small share of the additional costs, perhaps 7 percent. The federal government would have paid all the additional cost under the original bill.
 People with low or moderate incomes could still get federal subsidies to help them buy insurance, but they might have to spend slightly more of their own income -- a maximum of 12 percent, rather than 11 percent.
 Representative Earl Pomeroy, a Blue Dog from North Dakota, voted against the bill in the Ways and Means Committee on July 17 but said Wednesday that he could support the revised bill.
 He said he was pleased that the bill would exempt more of the smallest employers, and that the public plan would not use Medicare payment rates, which are low in North Dakota.
 Mr. Ross gave few details about the new provisions to control costs, other than to say that the government would spend less on subsidies and Medicare would save money by linking hospital payments to the quality of care provided, under a new system of ''value-based purchasing.''

HEADLINE: New Poll Finds Growing Unease on Health Plan

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and MEGAN THEE-BRENAN; Helene Cooper, Marina Stefan and Dalia Sussman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
President Obama's ability to shape the debate on health care appears to be eroding as opponents aggressively portray his overhaul plan as a government takeover that could limit Americans' ability to choose their doctors and course of treatment, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.
 Americans are concerned that revamping the health care system would reduce the quality of their care, increase their out-of-pocket health costs and tax bills, and limit their options in choosing doctors, treatments and tests, the poll found. The percentage who describe health care costs as a serious threat to the American economy -- a central argument made by Mr. Obama -- has dropped over the past month. 
 Mr. Obama continues to benefit from strong support for the basic goal of revamping the health care system, and he is seen as far more likely than Congressional Republicans to have the best ideas to accomplish that. But reflecting a problem that has hindered efforts to bring major changes to health care for decades, Americans expressed considerable unease about what the end result would mean for them individually. 
 ''We need to fix health care,'' Mary Bevering, a Democrat from Fort Madison, Iowa, said in a follow-up interview, ''but if the government creates the system, I'm afraid the quality of care will go down and costs will go up: We will pay more taxes.''
 ''It's going to come down to regulation,'' Ms. Bevering said. ''What also worries me is whether we will be told what physician we can have.''
 The poll was taken at a moment of extreme fluidity, both in terms of the complicated negotiations in the House and the Senate as lawmakers and the administration sort out the substance and politics of competing proposals, and in the efforts by both sides to define the stakes of the health care debate for the public. 
 With Congress now almost certain to recess until after Labor Day without floor votes on any specific plan, a vigorous advertising and grass-roots effort to shift public opinion is likely in the next month or two. The poll offers hope to both sides.
 The changes in the public's attitude over the past month, even if not huge, suggest one reason Mr. Obama sought so hard to get Congress to vote on some version of an overhaul before heading home.
 Opponents of the proposed health care overhaul have already spent $9 million on television advertisements raising concerns about it, said Evan Tracey, the chief operating officer of Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks political advertising. The advertisements are financed by the Republican National Committee and aimed at constituents of wavering lawmakers. The committee is also running radio spots. 
 Officials said the advertising would accelerate as the legislators returned home for the summer. The advertisements present the overhaul as a risky experiment, or a government takeover of health care that would prevent people from choosing their own doctors. 
 Mr. Obama is making an intense effort to rebut those claims. On Wednesday, he flew to Raleigh, N.C., for a town-hall-style meeting to address the kinds of public concerns reflected in the poll results. 
 ''First of all,'' Mr. Obama said, ''nobody is talking about some government takeover of health care. I'm tired of hearing that. I have been as clear as I can be. Under the reform I've proposed, if you like your doctor, you keep your doctor; if you like your health care plan, you keep your health care plan. These folks need to stop scaring everybody, you know?''
 Mr. Obama sought in particular to reassure people who already have health insurance and whom the overhaul plans under consideration in Congress would benefit by preventing insurers from dropping them or diluting their coverage if they become ill, while also bringing rapidly rising costs under control. And he sought to stoke a sense of urgency for getting a bill signed this year.
 ''If we do nothing, I can almost guarantee you your premiums will double over the next 10 years, because that's what they did over the last 10 years,'' Mr. Obama said. ''It will eat into the possibility of you getting a raise on your job because your employer is going to be looking and saying, 'I can't afford to give you a raise because my health care costs just went up 10, 20, 30 percent.' ''
 The national poll was conducted by telephone starting on Friday and ending on Tuesday. It involved 1,050 adults, and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
 Mr. Obama's job approval rating has dropped 10 points, to 58 percent, from a high point in April.
 And despite his efforts -- in speeches, news conferences, town-hall-style meetings and other forums -- to address public misgivings, 69 percent of respondents in the poll said they were concerned that the quality of their own care would decline if the government created a program that covers everyone. 
 Still, Mr. Obama remains the dominant figure in the debate, both because he continues to enjoy relatively high levels of public support even after seeing his approval ratings dip, and because there appears to be a strong desire to get something done: 49 percent said they supported fundamental changes, and 33 percent said the health care system needed to be completely rebuilt.
 The poll found 66 percent of respondents were concerned that they might eventually lose their insurance if the government did not create a new health care system, and 80 percent said they were concerned that the percentage of Americans without health care would continue to rise if Congress did not act.
 By 55 percent to 26 percent, respondents said Mr. Obama had better ideas about how to change health care than Republicans in Congress did. 
 There is overwhelming support for a bipartisan agreement on health care, and here again, Mr. Obama appears in the stronger position: 59 percent said that he was making an effort to work with Congressional Republicans, while just 33 percent said Republicans were trying to work with him on the issue.
 Over all, the poll portrays a nation torn by conflicting impulses and confusion.
 In one finding, 75 percent of respondents said they were concerned that the cost of their own health care would eventually go up if the government did not create a system of providing health care for all Americans. But in another finding, 77 percent said they were concerned that the cost of health care would go up if the government did create such a system.

HEADLINE: Council Approves a Proposal To Redevelop Coney Island

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI; Karen Zraick contributed reporting.

 BODY:
With the Bloomberg administration laboring furiously to conclude a deal with a Coney Island landowner, the City Council on Wednesday afternoon approved the mayor's ambitious plan to redevelop the seafront district once known as the world's largest playground.
 It was an expensive and bruising victory for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, whose administration wants to establish a 27-acre entertainment district between Surf Avenue and the Boardwalk, with 9.4 acres devoted exclusively to freak shows, arcades, and roller coasters and other rides. New zoning, approved by the Council, would allow high-rise hotels on Surf Avenue and 4,500 apartments north and west of the amusements. 
 The Council approved the plan 44-2, as officials at City Hall continued work on a potential deal with Joseph J. Sitt, a developer who has been at odds with the Bloomberg administration even as he spent more than $90 million buying property in the area. 
 The Council, which obtained a number of concessions from the mayor, had also pressed the city to reach a compromise with Mr. Sitt, who was on vacation in France with his family on Wednesday. Negotiations with his lawyer, Jesse Masyr, continued until 11 p.m. on Tuesday and through much of Wednesday.
 ''By approving our administration's plan to revitalize Coney Island, the Council has helped us breathe new life into a city treasure that's been in decline for decades,'' Mayor Bloomberg said after the vote. ''Now we move forward with a plan that will return Coney Island to its former glory, ensure its future as a year-round destination for visitors and create a more livable, vibrant community for its residents.''
 Mr. Bloomberg said there was still a lot of work to do, but he was optimistic that a deal could be worked out with landowners like Mr. Sitt. Under a tentative deal discussed Wednesday, according to officials and executives involved in the talks, the city would buy 6 of Mr. Sitt's 10 acres, leaving the remaining property on Surf and Stillwell Avenues for him to develop.
 Critics, including the group Save Coney Island and the Municipal Art Society of New York, say the city's plan is flawed because the amusement district is too small and would be overwhelmed by development. Although the city's new zoning for the area prohibits housing in the amusement area, critics complain that it would allow for up to four 27-story hotel towers along the south side of Surf Avenue, including one in front of the historic Wonder Wheel. And, they say, the city's plan would encourage developers to demolish landmarks like Nathan's hot dog stand.
 ''I think this is a very sad day for New York,'' said Juan Rivero, a spokesman for Save Coney Island. ''People who love Coney Island could see its historic amusement district shrink and its history erased. It's up to the administration to mitigate some of the damage its plan could trigger.''
 In the vote on the plan, ''no'' votes were cast by Councilman Tony Avella of Queens and Charles Barron of Brooklyn, who said the plan would turn the area into a ''Coney Island for the elite.'' Councilwoman Rosie Mendez of Manhattan abstained.
 There is little left today of Coney Island's once-vast amusement district aside from a three-acre stub with the Cyclone roller coaster, the Wonder Wheel and the Parachute Jump. Mr. Sitt bought the Astroland amusement park and closed it as part of plans for what he once described as a Las Vegas-style resort. But the city opposed his plan for apartment towers or time-share hotels in the district.
 Aside from buying Mr. Sitt's land for a price that could exceed $60 million, the city also agreed in negotiations with Council members and union and housing advocates to increase to 35 percent, from 20 percent, the amount of new housing set aside for poor and working-class families. The administration also agreed to set up a job-training program for local residents.
 It is still unclear how soon new housing will be built, given the anemic economy, and whether the new amusement district will attract a developer who can build new amusements that will serve tourists, newcomers and working-class New Yorkers.
 Charles Bendit, a chief executive at Taconic Investment Partners, which owns about 10 acres of land for residential development west and north of the Cyclones ballpark, said he was elated by the Council's vote. But he and other real estate executives conceded that development projects depended on the availability of financing.

HEADLINE: Once-Mothballed Taurus Is Back on Stage at Ford

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich. 

 BODY:
After a 20-year run, the Ford Taurus was headed for the scrap heap in 2007. The automaker planned to retire the name, and call its new sedan the Ford Five Hundred instead. 
 But Ford's new chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, reversed course, figuring the Taurus name still had value, even though its reputation had faltered as the car became best known as a staple of rental car fleets.
 Those instincts will be tested when a new version of the Taurus begins arriving in dealer showrooms next week. How consumers respond will answer a big question for Ford: can it make money on a full-size sedan? 
 ''This a real acid test for our product strategy,'' said James Farley, Ford's head of global marketing.
 Ford says it will exercise a new sense of discipline with the Taurus. Rather than aiming for a home-run product that sells hundreds of thousands of units -- and then be forced to offer incentives to persuade shoppers to buy them all -- Ford plans to build lower numbers of the Taurus. That way, it might be able to avoid steep discounts so it can turn a profit on each one.
 If the car languishes on dealer lots, though, Mr. Mulally's fledgling turnaround could stall.
 The car's base price of $26,000 is higher than some competing models.
 Mr. Farley and other Ford executives readily acknowledge that previous versions of the car were utilitarian and hardly up to the standard of comparable sedans from Toyota and Honda.
 But they also are counting on the image of the old Taurus fading from the public's consciousness.
 ''Its deterioration over time has allowed us the freedom to write a business plan to more realistic expectations,'' Mr. Farley said.
 At its peak in the late 1980s, Taurus was the top-selling car in the United States with more than 500,000 sales a year. The new model's targets are somewhere from 50,000 to 75,000 annually.
 Ford's most difficult challenge may not be lingering feelings about the old Taurus, but the strength of the vehicle market.
 Weak economic conditions have battered auto sales since last fall. In the first six months of this year, overall vehicle sales in the United States have fallen 35 percent from the period in 2008.
 Some industry analysts say the market appears to have bottomed out and could come back slightly during the rest of the year.
 ''Ultimately customers are going to judge you on whether you're offering something new,'' Mr. Farley said. ''This car can't just be a little better. It has to be demonstrably better in every respect.''
 The advertising campaign, which begins next week on national television, focuses on technology. One of the new features is the ''blind spot information system,'' sold as an add-on, that uses radar to detect vehicles that can't be seen in the mirror. Another is the so-called ''eco-boost'' engine that provides additional power without using more fuel.
 Ford's marketing managers spent a month last year interviewing three dozen of the car's engineers to determine which features might be most compelling to potential buyers.
 ''The design speaks for itself, but we've got the goods to show when it comes to features,'' said Matt VanDyke, director of Ford brand marketing.
 The company has also produced a series of Web videos that compare how, for example, the paint job on the Taurus holds up in comparison to a Lexus luxury sedan.
 Art Spinella, president of CNW Market Research, said that his firm had conducted five consumer focus groups on Taurus, and the results had been promising.
 ''It has come across extremely well,'' he said. ''I think the car is going to build its following slowly, but people like it as a product.''
 Ford will observe the introduction of the Taurus next week at its Chicago assembly plant, where the car is being built. It is one of the few American auto factories that actually has a new product coming out.
 Ford's rollout of a new vehicle sets it apart from Chrysler and General Motors, both of which canceled or delayed several models in the months leading up to their recent bankruptcy filings.
 Ford will follow the Taurus with the new Focus and Fiesta, both of which are smaller cars.
 Bringing the Taurus back is just a piece of the broader strategy, Mr. Farley said, as the company shifts from a product lineup that relies heavily on trucks to one with more fuel-efficient cars.
 And while the company is getting lots of positive feedback from consumers for not taking federal aid like G.M. and Chrysler, the good will alone won't sell more cars.
 ''The key is to translate that good will into consumer shopping,'' Mr. Farley said. ''They may want us to succeed, but that's not enough. We need them to get excited about the cars.''

HEADLINE: New Energy Injects Hope in a Colorado Steel Town

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: PUEBLO, Colo. 

 BODY:
Steelworkers have toiled in this unlikely spot in south-central Colorado since the days of the cowboys and the railroad barons. Renewable energy, on the other hand, is a new concept, mostly on the horizon. 
 Joe Pacheco stands at the crossroads.
 Mr. Pacheco, 44, was laid off last month from Rocky Mountain Steel, where he made pipe for the oil industry. Weeks earlier, knowing he might lose his job, he put in his application at a giant plant under construction just down the road. He is hoping for a call from Vestas Towers America, a Danish company that is scheduled this fall to open the world's biggest factory making towers for wind energy. 
 ''I loved the mill and loved working at the mill,'' Mr. Pacheco said over a plate of stuffed sopapillas at the Mill Stop Cafe, a hangout for steelworkers on the south side of this Hispanic-flavored city. ''But I don't bury my head in the sand.''
 Old energy and new, old steel and new: competing economic models are in motion here, one of the last cities in the country where steel is poured for making rail, and steel is what connects the dots. 
 ''Once you have steel in your blood, it stays,'' said Paul Morales, a third-generation steelworker who left Rocky Mountain Steel this year to help get the tower plant ready.
 The new energy economy -- a phrase Gov. Bill Ritter Jr., a Democrat, uses incessantly, to the point of parody by his critics -- is playing out and paying off in places like Pueblo, which is at the overlap of areas rich in potential for wind energy, stretching north into Wyoming, and for solar energy, extending south into New Mexico.
 A recent study by the Pew Center on the States said Colorado ranked fifth in the nation from 2006 to 2008 in attracting venture capital, most of which went to renewable energy. 
 In addition to the $240 million tower plant here, Vestas is opening two other factories in Brighton, Colo., added to one already open in Windsor, to manufacture and assemble components for making wind power. The company plans to hire up to 2,500 manufacturing workers in the state by next year. 
 But in a recession like the current one, the jobs and investments are not enough to make a place really boom. 
 The 550 jobs that Vestas plans to create here will be offset, and then some, by the hundreds of other positions that are moving away. In June, Pueblo's unemployment rate, 8.9 percent, was tied with that of another city for the highest among metropolitan areas in Colorado. By the standards of this recession, that gives Pueblo, with a population of 105,000, a mixed grade: higher than the state's seasonally adjusted jobless rate of 7.6 percent, but lower than the national average of 9.5 percent. 
 Now, steel and energy experts say, what the railroad magnates started here in 1881 to supply steel to the expanding lattice of freight and passenger travel lines in the West may get an unexpected second act as a place where blue- and green-collar labor is combined. 
 ''If this works, they will have taken an old location and reinvented it,'' said Mark Reutter, a journalist and a historian who has been writing about the steel industry since the 1970s. 
 All economics, though, is local. Jobs come and go, and the trick is knowing when to leap. 
 Chris Esquibel, a machinist at Trane Inc., a manufacturer of commercial air-conditioning equipment across town from Vestas, will lose his job on Aug. 8. Mr. Esquibel said that layoff notices went out this spring and that he had been hesitant to apply to Vestas for fear of endangering his severance package if he was called to work. But he recently said he thought it was safe to wade into the application process.
 Other families with ties to steelmaking in Pueblo, like the Evens, still see a long future for traditional steel in this city, which has always been apart, in product mix and geography, from the places usually associated with the industry. 
 Everett E. Even II said Rocky Mountain Steel had recently received orders for supplies to make oil pipe. ''That means somebody out there is planning to drill for oil,'' said Mr. Even, who works for a company that supplies scrap metal to Rocky Mountain Steel and had stopped in for a drink at the Beer Barrel, a bar-and-grill near the mill. ''That's positive.''
 A spokesman for Rocky Mountain Steel could not be reached for comment in repeated calls. Workers there say the plant has roughly 800 employees, down from about 1,000 earlier this year, with most cuts resulting from a downturn in the oil services business. 
 Mr. Even's uncle Bill Even, who retired this year after 34 years of steelmaking (the uncle's father had put in 46 years), was just across the bar, nursing a beer in the late-afternoon sun by the Beer Barrel's open door. He said he was also confident that steel was here to stay -- even more so with Vestas's big new demand for steel that might one day, he hoped, be locally supplied.
 ''It won't be as big, but it will be around,'' he said of steelmaking in Pueblo.
 Brandon Gonzales will not be around to see it. Mr. Gonzales -- whose grandfather, father and father-in-law all worked at the mill -- quit in April to take a job at Vestas. 
 Mr. Gonzales, 28, with young children at home, made the decision despite his family's longstanding ties to Rocky Mountain Steel and membership in the United Steel Workers union, which guarded seniority and spoke collectively to management. (Vestas intends to operate without a union.)
 Other aspects of switching employers, however, were more clear cut.
 New employees at the mill start out with two weeks vacation a year, the standard American package -- even though its parent company, Evraz, is Russian. Vestas, more in keeping with the Western European tradition prevailing in Denmark, gives new employees four weeks. 
 Mr. Gonzales said that was a simple, powerful incentive to change jobs.
 ''To get four weeks off,'' he said, ''I would have had to be at the mill 17 years.''

HEADLINE: Scars of an Ailing Industry

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC and NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: WIXOM, Mich. 

 BODY:
The sheer size of the sites has inspired grand visions for redevelopment -- a $1 billion football stadium, a huge Hollywood movie studio, even the world's largest indoor tennis complex.
 But for the communities saddled with a huge, empty auto plant, the reality is dismal. 
 Abandoned car factories, sprawling over hundreds of acres, often stand vacant for years awaiting demolition, environmental cleanup and a willing developer. 
 Since 2004, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler have closed 22 major auto plants in the United States. Only eight of those have found buyers. And in the wake of the G.M. and Chrysler bankruptcies, another 16 plants will be shut by 2011.
 The most optimistic redevelopment proposals, like a football stadium for the Atlanta Falcons or a movie studio in the small Michigan town of Wixom, a Detroit suburb, are long shots at best. 
 ''The plants, whether they're still standing or reoccupied, are always going to be a haunting reminder of what we were, what we've gone through, and where we still need to go,'' said Representative Thaddeus McCotter, Republican of Michigan, whose district includes an old Ford plant in Wixom and a G.M. plant that will soon close.
 Even sites in attractive locations are hard to sell in the weak economy. With so many companies being squeezed financially, there is a glut of available commercial real estate.
 ''Even if you only go back three or four years, it was easier than today,'' said Phil Horlock, head of Ford's land development division. 
 The loss to the local community when a plant closes goes well beyond jobs. Tax revenue evaporates and related businesses vanish.
 Industry analysts estimate that each job in a plant helps create another five to seven jobs.
 ''Some of those are direct suppliers, but then there are places that workers spend money, like grocery stores, restaurants and day care,'' said Kristin Dziczek of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich.
 Ford's 4.7-million-square-foot Wixom factory, which closed in 2007, was the company's largest assembly plant in the United States. More than six million cars were built there over 50 years. 
 At its peak in the late 1980s, the factory employed nearly 4,000. Now it's an empty shell of rusting corrugated metal, surrounded by desolate parking lots and a barbed-wire fence.
 The plant fronts an Interstate highway, and stretches almost a mile along Wixom Road. It once provided 40 percent of the town's property taxes, but now accounts for less than 15 percent.
 The town has about 13,000 residents, and relied heavily on the paychecks of plant workers. 
 ''When it closed, a lot of businesses around us closed too,'' said Moe Leon, owner of the Bullseye Sports Bar and Grill on Wixom Road. ''We're fighting night and day to stay above water.''
 Last year, a team of executives from Warner Brothers toured the plant as a potential site for a new studio. Other developers have floated proposals for a hotel, an ice hockey arena and a business district devoted to green technology.
 Ford officials said several ideas were under consideration, but there was no timetable for a sale.
 Mr. Horlock said Ford had sold five large factories in the last five years. He said the company generally did not raze a plant, or begin to clean up any toxic wastes, until a deal was sealed.
 The auto company sold one assembly plant, in Lorain, Ohio, to a developer who leases out space to small industrial firms. Honda, a competitor of Ford's with two assembly plants in Ohio, recently started storing excess inventory of cars and minivans in the plant's parking lots. But most closed plants languish. 
 After G.M. closed a factory in Doraville, Ga., last year, there was an initial rush of interest from developers. One of them suggested the site be used for a new stadium for the National Football League's Falcons, but the team's owners have so far shown little enthusiasm for that idea.
 Luke Howe, an assistant to Doraville's mayor, said other proposals for the 165-acre site range ''from the ridiculous to the sublime,'' and no developers had come forward with adequate financing. 
 ''We knew it would be a lengthy process,'' he said. ''It just happened to fall during one of the worst economic times.''
 But some factory sites have remained vacant through good times as well -- a sign of just how difficult it is to create a second life for them. 
 G.M. demolished most of its giant Buick City manufacturing complex in Flint, Mich., a decade ago. The 200-acre property appeared to finally have a future as a transportation hub for long-haul trucks and rail cars, but G.M. could not complete a deal before filing for bankruptcy on June. 1.
 The Flint site, along with dozens of other factories and properties, is part of the old G.M. that is still in bankruptcy and will most likely be sold, eventually, in the liquidation process. The company's best assets were transferred to a new corporate entity that now operates as General Motors. Auto companies sell their old plants for a song, compared to what they put into them. The government in Oklahoma County, which covers much of Oklahoma City, for example, paid $55 million last year for a four-million-square-foot plant that will be leased to the United States Air Force to expand a nearby base. Just eight years ago, G.M. invested $700 million in the plant to modernize it.
 Environmental problems can also hamper a sale. While every plant has different pollution issues, G.M.'s restructuring chief, Albert A. Koch, estimated in bankruptcy court that the company's liabilities for all its closed sites was $530 million. 
 One old G.M. plant that has found a new life is in Linden, N.J. The company shut down the factory in 2005, demolished it two years ago, and sold it to a developer for a mixed-use project called Legacy Square.
 The 104-acre site will be anchored by a Super Wal-Mart store, and ultimately will pay more taxes to the city than G.M. did.
 But the 2,400 permanent jobs will fall far short of the 6,000 workers that G.M. once employed in the city.
 ''The United Auto Workers had very high-paying jobs there, and those will not be comparable to the jobs that are going to be in the shopping mall,'' said Linden's mayor, Richard J. Gerbounka.
 But, he added, ''We're better off than having 104 acres of vacant property sitting there.''
 The worst of the empty auto plants is located, perhaps fittingly, on the downtrodden east side of Detroit.
 The 3.5-million-square-foot factory has been crumbling since the Packard Motor Car Company closed its doors more than 50 years ago. Trees grow on the plant's roof, and chunks of concrete regularly fall from the bridge that connects two of its buildings.
 Trespassers often explore its rotted interior, and photographs and videos of the ruins are easily found on the Internet.
 Vandals have set fires several times this year in the piles of wooden pallets, tires and garbage that litter the complex. It is not unusual to see clouds of thick smoke pouring from the building on a summer evening.

HEADLINE: Bankers Reaped Lavish Bonuses During Bailouts

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY and ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Thousands of top traders and bankers on Wall Street were awarded huge bonuses and pay packages last year, even as their employers were battered by the financial crisis.
 Nine of the financial firms that were among the largest recipients of federal bailout money paid about 5,000 of their traders and bankers bonuses of more than $1 million apiece for 2008, according to a report released Thursday by Andrew M. Cuomo, the New York attorney general.
 At Goldman Sachs, for example, bonuses of more than $1 million went to 953 traders and bankers, and Morgan Stanley awarded seven-figure bonuses to 428 employees. Even at weaker banks like Citigroup and Bank of America, million-dollar awards were distributed to hundreds of workers. 
 The report is certain to intensify the growing debate over how, and how much, Wall Street bankers should be paid. 
 In January, President Obama called financial institutions ''shameful'' for giving themselves nearly $20 billion in bonuses as the economy was faltering and the government was spending billions to bail out financial institutions. 
 On Friday, the House of Representatives may vote on a bill that would order bank regulators to restrict ''inappropriate or imprudently risky'' pay packages at larger banks.
 Mr. Cuomo, who for months has criticized the companies over pay, said the bonuses were particularly galling because the banks survived the crisis with the government's support.
 ''If the bank lost money, where do you get the money to pay the bonus?'' he said. 
 All the banks named in the report declined to comment. 
 Mr. Cuomo's stance -- that compensation for every employee in a financial firm should rise and fall in line with the company's overall results -- is not shared on Wall Street, which tends to reward employees based more on their individual performance. Otherwise, the thinking goes, top workers could easily leave for another firm that would reward them more directly for their personal contribution.
 Many banks partly base their bonuses on overall results, but Mr. Cuomo has said they should do so to a greater degree.
 At Morgan Stanley, for example, compensation last year was more than seven times as large as the bank's profit. In 2004 and 2005, when the stock markets were doing well, Morgan Stanley spent only two times its profits on compensation.
 Robert A. Profusek, a lawyer with the law firm Jones Day, which works with many of the large banks, said bank executives and boards spent considerable time deciding bonuses based on the value of workers to their companies. 
 ''There's this assumption that everyone was like drunken sailors passing out money without regard to the consequences or without giving it any thought,'' Mr. Profusek said. ''That wasn't the case.''
 Mr. Cuomo's office did not study the correlation between all of the individual bonuses and the performance of the people who received them.
 Congressional leaders have introduced several other bills aimed at reining in the bank bonus culture. Federal regulators and a new government pay czar, Kenneth Feinberg, are also scrutinizing bank bonuses, which have fueled populist outrage. Incentives that led to large bonuses on Wall Street are often cited as a cause of the financial crisis.
 Though it has been known for months that billions of dollars were spent on bonuses last year, it was unclear whether that money was spread widely or concentrated among a few workers. 
 The report suggests that those roughly 5,000 people -- a small subset of the industry -- accounted for more than $5 billion in bonuses. At Goldman, just 200 people collectively were paid nearly $1 billion in total, and at Morgan Stanley, $577 million was shared by 101 people.
 All told, the bonus pools at the nine banks that received bailout money was $32.6 billion, while those banks lost $81 billion.
 Some compensation experts questioned whether the bonuses should have been paid at all while the banks were receiving government aid.
 ''There are some real ethical questions given the bailouts and the precariousness of so many of these financial institutions,'' said Jesse M. Brill, an outspoken pay critic who is the chairman of CompensationStandards.com, a research firm in California. ''It's troublesome that the old ways are so ingrained that it is very hard for them to shed them.''
 The report does not include certain other highly paid employees, like brokers who are paid on commission. The report also does not include some bank subsidiaries, like the Phibro commodities trading unit at Citigroup, where one trader stands to collect $100 million for his work last year.
 Now that most banks are making money again, hefty bonuses will probably be even more common this year. And many banks have increased salaries among highly paid workers so that they will not depend as heavily on bonuses.
 Banks typically do not disclose compensation figures beyond their total compensation expenses and the amounts paid to top five highly paid executives, but they turned over information on their bonus pools to a House committee and to Mr. Cuomo after the bailout last year. 
 The last few years provide a ''virtual laboratory'' to test whether bankers' pay moved in line with bank performance, Mr. Cuomo said. If it did, he said, the pay levels would have dropped off in 2007 and 2008 as bank profits fell.
 So far this year, Morgan Stanley has set aside about $7 billion for compensation -- which includes salaries, bonuses and expenses like health care -- even though it has reported quarterly losses.
 At some banks last year, revenue fell to levels not seen in more than five years, but pay did not. At Citigroup, revenue was the lowest since 2002. But the amount the bank spent on compensation was higher than in any other year between 2003 and 2006.
 At Bank of America, revenue last year was at the same level as in 2006, and the bank kept the amount it paid to employees in line with 2006. Profit at the bank last year, however, was one-fifth of the level in 2006.
 Still, regulators may have limited resources for keeping pay in check. Only banks that still have bailout money are subject to oversight by Mr. Feinberg, the pay czar. He will approve pay for the top 100 compensated employees at banks like Citigroup and Bank of America as well as automakers like General Motors.

HEADLINE: Seasonal Distortions Cited in Rise of Jobless Claims

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The number of newly laid-off workers filing first-time claims for jobless benefits rose last week, the government said, though the increase was mostly a result of seasonal distortions. 
 The number of people remaining on the jobless benefit rolls, meanwhile, fell to 6.2 million, from 6.25 million, the lowest level since mid-April.
 The Labor Department said that new claims for unemployment insurance increased by 25,000 to a seasonally adjusted 584,000, above analysts' estimates of 570,000.
 A department analyst said the increase came after claims were artificially depressed earlier this month by the timing of temporary auto factory shutdowns, which happened earlier this year than in most years. Still, this week's total is below the 617,000 initial claims reported in late June before the seasonal distortions began. It reflects a trend that economists say indicates a slowing pace of layoffs.
 The four-week average of claims, which smoothes out fluctuations, fell to 559,000, its lowest level since late January.
 But jobs remain scarce and the unemployment rate, which hit 9.5 percent for June, is expected to surpass 10 percent by year-end.
 And weekly claims remain far above the 300,000 to 350,000 that analysts say is consistent with a healthy economy. New claims last fell below 300,000 in early 2007. The lowest level this year was 488,000 for the week ended Jan. 3.
 The seasonal distortions were the result of auto companies shutting their plants earlier than usual this year. Car makers normally close their factories in early July and temporarily lay off thousands of workers as they retool plants to build new car models.
 Those shutdowns happened in May and June this year as General Motors and Chrysler closed plants after filing for bankruptcy protection. That shift in timing caused new claims to fall sharply in the first two weeks of July. Claims are now rebounding from that artificial decline.
 The recession, which started in December 2007 and is the longest since World War II, has eliminated a net total of 6.5 million jobs. The unemployment rate is expected to rise to 9.7 percent when the July figure is reported next week.
 More job cuts were announced this week. Verizon Communications said Monday that it would cut more than 8,000 employee and contractor jobs before the end of the year.
 Among the states, California had the biggest increase in claims, with 4,290, which it attributed to increased layoffs in the construction and trade industries. Michigan, Florida, Connecticut and Indiana had the next-largest increases. State data lags behind initial claims data by one week.
 New York had the largest drop in claims, with 22,052, which it said was due to fewer layoffs in the service and transportation industries. Wisconsin, Missouri, Pennsylvania and Ohio had the next largest declines.

HEADLINE: Lochte Finds Phelps Is Everywhere but in the Pool

BYLINE: By KAREN CROUSE

DATELINE: ROME 

 BODY:
Ryan Lochte was poised to escape the shadow of his more famous teammate, Michael Phelps, when he glanced up and there, literally larger than life, was a shirtless Phelps.
 At that moment, Lochte could have been forgiven for screaming: Michael! Michael! Michael!
 Before the final of the 200-meter intermediate medley Thursday night, the jumbo scoreboard at the Foro Italico showed a crowd shot of Phelps, who set the world record in the event in Beijing but is taking a break from it this summer. 
 Since 2004, Lochte has played Robin to Phelps's Batman in the 200- and 400-meter I.M.s. He finished second to him in both events at the 2007 world championships and qualified behind Phelps in the 200 I.M. at the 2004 and 2008 United States Olympic trials. ''I looked up at the scoreboard and they showed the crowd, they showed Michael, and I kind of smiled,'' Lochte said.
 It should be noted that Lochte was not wearing his diamond-encrusted grillz teeth at the time. That adornment came later, during the awards ceremony, when Lochte received the gold medal after making off with Phelps's global mark.
 Lochte, who led the final from the opening 50, was timed in 1 minute 54.10 seconds, 0.13 of a second faster than Phelps's record and a 0.46-second improvement over his previous personal best. After shedding suits -- he switched from a full-body Speedo LZR Racer to the waist-to-ankle leggings model -- Lochte returned to the pool and advanced to the final of the 200 backstroke.
 No sooner had Lochte finished the 200 I.M. than the phone of Bob Bowman, the United States men's coach and Phelps's personal coach, started vibrating in his pocket. Bowman, who was on the deck, looked at the text message. It was from Phelps, and according to Bowman it said: ''That was a great swim. I think it's still breakable.''
 Aren't they all? The world record by Lochte was the first of seven to fall on the fifth night of competition at the world championships, bringing the total to 29 in 42 races. Given how frayed the record book is, when the competition concludes Sunday one half expects the public address announcer to say, ''Will the last one to leave please turn off the shredder?''
 The times Thursday were so sublime that Eric Shanteau was clocked under the existing world record in the semifinals -- the semifinals! -- of the 200 breaststroke, and did not even qualify first. He was second behind Australia's Christian Sprenger. 
 The sprinters were so fast that David Walters broke Phelps's year-old American record in the 100-meter freestyle with a 47.33 and finished fifth. Cesar Cielo Filho gave Brazil its first gold medal of the championships with a world-record clocking of 46.91. He touched out two Frenchmen, Alain Bernard (47.12) and Fred Bousquet (47.25).
 Cielo Filho and Bousquet train together in the United States, at Auburn University under Brett Hawke, and Bousquet said they push each other in practice to times that are close to records. In that case, the race must have felt like practice as usual; Bousquet, swimming in Lane 8, was first at the 50, three-hundredths of a second ahead of Cielo Filho in Lane 5, who secured the win with a finishing surge.
 Before the race, Cielo Filho was so nervous his limbs went numb. In the ready room, where the finalists are sequestered, he slapped his legs to try to return feeling to them. ''I never had this before,'' he said, adding that he could not feel his face either. 
 Cielo Filho was wearing the Arena X-Glide, a polyurethane suit that is running neck-to-neck with Jaked in the popularity race. Last year's leader, the Speedo LZR Racer, is a distant third.
 And yet Cielo Filho said he felt neither sleek nor streamlined. How could he when he was dragging all of Brazil behind him? His countrymen, he knew, expected him to win. ''If you get second,'' Cielo Filho explained, ''it's a big disappointment.''
 Bernard and Bousquet were trying to shake off the downer that was France's third-place finish in the 4 x 100 freestyle relay four nights earlier. Bousquet, who swam the last leg, absorbed a lecture from Hawke afterward. ''He told me to stop acting like a boy and start racing like a man,'' Bousquet said.
 Lochte, 24, is never more mature than when he is racing. He has been known to arrive at the starting blocks on his skateboard and he has an adolescent's fixation on the rapper Lil Wayne. But once he hits the water, he is as serious as a recession. There are athletes -- superstars -- who would resent having to share an era with the greatest performer in the history of their sport. Lochte is not one of them.
 Asked if he ever wishes he did not have Phelps to contend with, Lochte replied: ''Not at all. He did such a good job of making a name for swimming. He kind of put swimming on the map.''
 Phelps, Lochte and the backstroker Gemma Spofforth of Britain are the only competitors here to have set world records in the LZR Racer.
 To Lochte, the swimsuit wars are just another battle he's determined to win. 
 ''I mean, everyone's complaining about all these new suits, blah, blah, blah,'' Lochte said, ''and I go out there and wear the same suit as last year and I just give it to them.''
 The night did take its toll. Lochte, a Floridian, walked into the interview room for a news conference with red, yellow, green and blue wires streaming out of his sweats. He was hooked up to a contraption the size of a computer battery that was sending restorative electrical currents to his tired, tight leg muscles.
 ''Hopefully my legs can recover after the beating they took tonight,'' Lochte said.
 He also was wearing nonprescription George Burns glasses, which was perfect, because Lochte is the driest of comedians. All he needed to complete the look was one of the cigars he took home as souvenirs from the Athens Games. 
 Earlier, Lochte had described his grillz. They were different from the ones he wore on the awards stand at this meet two years ago. ''This time,'' he said, ''the diamonds are bigger so I can shine a little more.''

CORRECTION-DATE: August 3, 2009

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about Ryan Lochte's record-setting performance at the swimming world championships on Thursday in Rome misstated the name of the race. It is the 200-meter individual -- not ''intermediate'' -- medley.

On Avenue J in the Midwood section of Brooklyn, a small cup of coffee costs $1.39. An 18-stick package of gum is $1.49. And at Di Fara Pizza, the price of a plain cheese slice: $5.
 Crowds form at the counter at Di Fara and spill onto the sidewalk. They are not an angry mob, but a hungry one. Some order two slices, for $10, and some, like Frank Mancino, a retired electrician from Bath Beach, Brooklyn, whose girth is a statement about his allegiance to pizza in general and Di Fara in particular, order a whole square pie, for $30. 
 ''Worth it,'' said Mr. Mancino, 64, between bites on Wednesday afternoon. ''It's like they dug up my grandma and she made the pie.''
 Di Fara, one of the most acclaimed and sought-after pizza shops in New York City, now sells one of the most expensive -- and still-sought-after -- slices in New York City, on a no-frills Brooklyn block next door to, of all places, a 99-cent store. The price of a slice increased to $5 on July 1, up from $4, the cost for the past year and a half. Just about everything else went up as well: Plain round pies are $25 and specialty square pies are $35.
 There are those who have called Di Fara and left nasty messages on the answering machine, and there are those who have made a special trip to Midwood in recent days to find out what a $5 slice tastes like. 
 And yet, the owner, Domenico DeMarco, 72, a founder, remains undisturbed by the commotion, cutting fresh basil over bubbling pies with a pair of kitchen scissors. 
 ''I use the top ingredients,'' said Mr. DeMarco, whose accent still echoes Provincia di Caserta in Italy, where he is from; it is an ethos that adds to the Di Fara mystique, and perhaps to its prices. ''Other pizzerias, I don't think they use the top.'' 
 The price of a slice has long been one of the city's unofficial economic indicators, and the increase at Di Fara has led to intense analysis among New Yorkers about what, exactly, it indicates: a deepening recession, an easing of the recession, rising inflation, savvy marketing, price gouging, or commodity prices on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange? Or, simply, Mr. DeMarco -- a bespectacled maverick of the New York pizza world, who insists on making every pie himself -- being Mr. DeMarco.
 Even Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg joined the debate, though he was careful not to say whether he was for or against a $5 slice. ''The real question, relative to the local economy, is whether people are trading up from a $2.75 slice or down from a $25 entree,'' the mayor said in reply to a question on Thursday. ''And from what I hear in the subways and on the streets, it's probably a mixture of both. But if you've ever had a really great slice of pizza, you know there are worse deals.''
 And there is an underlying concern about a ripple effect. Other pizzerias ''might follow suit,'' said Adam Kuban, 35, the founder of Slice, a pizza-focused blog that reported the new price. ''Some people might think, 'Mine is at $2.50 or $2.75, maybe I can raise it to $3.' ''
 Behind the counters at a number of city pizzerias, the $5 Di Fara slice has sparked some grumbling. ''I don't agree with it,'' said Francesco Taormina, 42, manager at Rizzo's Fine Pizza in Astoria, Queens, where a plain slice costs $2.50. ''I couldn't possibly think of any slice that could cost that much.'' 
 Of course, Mr. DeMarco believes his pizza is worth the money, and many of his customers believe so as well, arguing that in a city where rents, tolls and subway fares keep climbing, paying more for what many consider the best pizza in New York is entirely reasonable. 
 Mr. DeMarco uses imported ingredients. The flour, extra-virgin olive oil, San Marzano tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella cheese and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese are all brought from Italy, and the basil is from Israel. 
 The only person who makes a Di Fara pie is Mr. DeMarco, because, in his words, ''I believe only one guy should make the pizza.'' When Mr. DeMarco is not available to make the pizza, Di Fara shuts its doors, as it did for several weeks in January while Mr. DeMarco recovered from a car accident.
 A $5 Di Fara slice is thin and crispy, the dough a few seconds shy of burnt, topped with a tangy, subtle sauce, served on a paper plate, over a sheet of wax paper, in an overheated 44-year-old pizzeria with a worn floor, a drippy air-conditioner and a handwritten sign reading, ''Bathroom is out of order.'' 
 On Wednesday, Chris Alese, 28, an off-duty police officer, waited an hour and 20 minutes, paying $61 for two pies and four drinks for his group. ''It's unbelievable,'' Mr. Alese said, referring to the taste. ''You're going to pay for quality.''
 Murat Ugur, 23, was not as impressed. ''So-so,'' he said Thursday, biting into a slice. ''A little oily.'' 
 Margaret Mieles, Mr. DeMarco's daughter and Di Fara's manager, said a number of factors went into the decision to raise prices. The shop has always used expensive imported ingredients, but in the past six months Mr. DeMarco has been more generous with them, part of what she called his new ''heavy hand.'' As a result, she said, more supplies are being ordered more often.
 The increase in the city's sales tax was another reason Di Fara raised its prices, Mrs. Mieles said, since the tax is included in the price. (The tax rate goes up half a percentage point on Saturday.) She denied speculation that the price increase was to make up for a recent reduction in the pizzeria's hours of operation. It used to be closed on Mondays, but is now also closed Tuesdays. Her father wanted -- and needed -- the rest, she said.
 Those hoping the new prices are temporary, like those hoping the wait for a slice will get shorter, will be disappointed. 
 ''We will never, ever lower the price,'' Mrs. Mieles said. ''It can only go up. It can never come down.''

CORRECTION-DATE: August 10, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on July 31 about a price increase to $5 for a slice of pizza at Di Fara Pizza in Midwood, Brooklyn, misstated the age of Francesco Taormina, a manager at Rizzo's Fine Pizza in Astoria, Queens, who criticized the $5 slice. He is 22, not 42.

HEADLINE: Not Just the Wine Is Purple: Lavender Wafts Across Sonoma

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON

DATELINE: SONOMA, Calif. 

 BODY:
-- It is not the perfume that seduces, but sound.
 Or so it was for me one summer morning as I toured a lavender farm in the Sonoma Valley here, Napa's lesser-known neighbor, which in recent years has become a haven for that herb's enthusiasts. Swollen tufts of violet and green shifted in the breeze like beach balls ready to take flight. There was a whisper of sweetness in the air, the fragrant oil from flowering stalks clinging to fingertips and pants legs at the slightest brush.
What attracted me, though -- stopping me as I walked down a gravel path -- was a drone that seemed to pulsate amid the quiet. Was it traffic from a nearby road? An air-conditioner set on low? Neither. Instead the field vibrated with the hum of thousands of bees shifting among blossoms, a waltz of elegance and economy.
 A lavender field, it seems, is an intoxicating but very busy place. 
 Provence is well known for its purple highways. There the French have devised herbal factories where vast acres of lavender are grown for use in essential oils, sachets, bath products, tea and honey. But in the past decade Americans too have come to value its culinary and aromatic attributes. As a result, lavender farms have sprung up in small towns from Texas to California to Washington State.
 For those unable to wander among the sun-soaked fields of southern France, the Sonoma Valley is a civilized alternative. Nestled between the Pacific Ocean and the more crowded Napa Valley, it retains much of the rural charm of California. At a farmer's market in Santa Rosa one Wednesday night, a woman sold fresh bundled lavender for $1, the fragrant bouquets stacked two feet high. In June and July many of the area's small growers invite guests to browse blooming fields at their peak. And restaurants liberally use lavender in place of rosemary or thyme in drinks and summer dishes.
 On the outskirts of Santa Rosa, down a winding two-lane road set among pastures occupied by languid cattle, is Matanzas Creek Winery. It has been a haven for lavender devotees since 1991, when the winery planted nearly two acres. Much of it is Provence and Grosso, French varieties prized for their pungent, herbal aroma. 
 When I arrived this month the fields were in full bloom, orbs of lilac and amethyst offset by the golden foothills dotted with stands of sturdy oak trees. Two women walked along a path ahead of me, one lovingly running her hand along the top of a waist-high plant. I winced as I saw a cloud of rising black. Bees are not likely to sting unless disturbed or threatened. 
 There, too, were other noises of industry. Three men dressed in gardening gear -- khaki pants, gloves and sturdy hats -- used a motorized hedge clipper to trim the bushes, following the arc of the blossoming stalks. It was a buzz of a different sort: commerce. Matanzas Creek's tasting room offers culinary products -- including tea, spice rubs, sugar and salt -- that use lavender from its gardens.
 Unlike Matanzas Creek, few lavender farms allow visitors to show up unannounced. Instead many hold summer festivals. Kenwood is a town on Highway 12 about a half-hour from Matanzas Creek. There I caught up with Rebecca Rosenberg, an urban refugee from San Francisco and a former advertising executive who founded Sonoma Lavender and grows three acres of lavender at her home next to Chateau St. Jean, among the valley's grander wineries.
 Sonoma Lavender is one of the larger lavender farms -- with 6,000 plants -- open to tourists once a year. But it has the hallmark of smaller plots: it is steps from Ms. Rosenberg's front door. It does not distill oil; the oil she uses is imported from France. (Much of the oil sold in the United States is imported.) But the sachets, pillows and cooking lavender that Ms. Rosenberg sells are made with blossoms from her fields.
 As many as 5,000 people each summer attend Sonoma Lavender's three-day festival, which features food and wine booths, crafts and lectures on growing and harvesting blossoms. The rest of the year the curious can view the fields from a long driveway leading to Chateau St. Jean. During harvest, stalks are cut, bundled and hung to dry (using paper clips) in the attic of a barn, giant metal fans circulating the hot air. Once the bundles are crisp -- in about two weeks -- the blossoms are removed. This can be done by hand, scraping dried stalks against a metal screen.
 Ms. Rosenberg explained that she used the Grosso variety in sachets and pillows. She used the more floral Hidcote, an English variety, to brighten sweets, like creme brulee. After we sniffed several stalks, I went next door to Chateau St. Jean, where I bought a sandwich and a glass of sauvignon blanc and watched two couples play bocce on the winery's court.
 One morning I crossed the Sonoma County line to Napa to visit Harms Vineyard and Lavender Fields, which two weeks earlier had had more than 1,000 guests at an open house. Patricia Damery and her husband, Donald Harms, are biodynamic farmers who grow lavender. They tend several plots of Grosso, and each, Ms. Damery said, has a different intensity, depending on where it is grown. 
 To prove it, she invited me to smell four oils her husband distilled from last year's crop. The first had a grassy aroma, another antiseptic, with a hint of eucalyptus. The third was powdery soft, while the last had a sharp edge -- a sour, medicinal smell that exploded in my nose. Last year Ms. Damery and Mr. Harms produced 380 ounces of oil.
 ''It seduces you,'' she said. ''It is so beautiful to look it. It has personality.''
 Back in Sonoma, the Girl & the Fig, a French-inspired restaurant, has embraced lavender, a challenge because if the herb is not used properly, food can taste soapy. One night I had a refreshing lavender mojito made with rum, lime, lavender-infused simple syrup and rosewater. For dessert I enjoyed lavender-and-wildflower-honey creme brulee that had the right balance of floral notes and creaminess. 
 After two days visiting lavender fields I was ready for a less precious view of Sonoma Valley. Jack London State Historic Park in Glen Ellen was a tart tonic. The rolling hills there are overgrown with oak trees and eucalyptus, the spicy smell of damp earth wafting up with the crush of leaves underfoot.
 London lived on the property until his death in 1916. I walked a mile to the remains of Wolf House (keeping an eye out for deer and rattlesnakes), a home he built that was ravaged by fire in 1913. London is buried at the park, and a museum houses a collection of his writings and books.
 In wine country you must oblige the noble grape. So I made an appointment to visit Moon Mountain Vineyard, a boutique winemaker near Sonoma, the town, where I was staying. The winery was a delightful surprise. I lingered for more than an hour and tried at least six wines, soaking up information about the vintages, valley lore and books about wine. One recommended title was ''The Billionaire's Vinegar,'' about the most expensive bottle of wine ever sold. (I bought the book the next day.) My hostess offered a plate of local Point Reyes blue cheese, nuts, gourmet snacks and chocolate for in-between pours, instead of the bland crackers typical of tasting rooms.
 As I said goodbye, the sweet murmur of ''Dreams,'' sung by Stevie Nicks, played in the background. I took with me a few bottles of syrah and a promise to return -- whether the lavender was blooming or not.

HEADLINE: Living in Tents, and by the Rules, Under a Bridge

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I. 

 BODY:
 The chief emerges from his tent to face the leaden morning light. It had been a rare, rough night in his homeless Brigadoon: a boozy brawl, the wielding of a knife taped to a stick. But the community handled it, he says with pride, his day's first cigar already aglow.
 By community he means 80 or so people living in tents on a spit of state land beside the dusky Providence River: Camp Runamuck, no certain address, downtown Providence. 
 Because the two men in the fight had violated the community's written compact, they were escorted off the camp, away from the protection of an abandoned overpass. One was told we'll discuss this in the morning; the other was voted off the island, his knife tossed into the river, his tent taken down.
 The chief flicks his spent cigar into that same river. There is talk of rain tonight.
 Behind him, the camp stirs. Other tent cities have sprung up recently around the country, but Rhode Island officials have never seen anything like this. A tea kettle sings.
 A heavily pierced young person walks by without picking up an empty plastic bottle, flouting the camp compact that says everyone will share in the labor. The compact may be as impermanent as this sudden community by the river, but for now it is binding. The chief speaks, the bottle is picked up.
 The chief, John Freitas, is 55, with a gray beard touched by tobacco rust. He did prison time decades ago, worked for years as a factory supervisor, then became homeless for all the familiar, complicated reasons.
 Layoffs, health problems, a slip from apartment to motel room. His girlfriend, Barbara Kalil, 50, lost her job as a nursing-home nurse, and another slip, into the shelter system. A job holding store-liquidation signs beside the highway allowed for a climb back to a motel, but it didn't last.
 Weary of shelters, the couple pitched a pup tent in Roger Williams Park, close to a plaque bearing words Williams had used to describe this place he founded: ''A Shelter for Persons in Distress.'' But someone complained, so Mr. Freitas set off again in search of shelter. The March winds blew.
 Down South Main Street he went, past the majestic court building and the upscale seafood restaurant, over a guardrail to a gravelly plot beneath a ramp that once guided cars toward Cape Cod. Foul-smelling and partially hidden, a place of birds and rodents, it was perfect.
 He and Ms. Kalil set up camp with another couple in early April. Word of it spread from the shelters to Kennedy Plaza downtown, where homeless people share the same empty Tim Hortons cup to pose as customers worthy of visiting that doughnut chain's restroom. The camp became 10 people, then 15, then 25. No children allowed.
 ''I was always considered the leader, the chief,'' Mr. Freitas says. ''I was the one consulted about 'Where should I put my tent?' ''
 By late June the camp had about 50 people. But someone questioned the role of Mr. Freitas as chief, so he stepped down. Arguments broke out. Food was stolen. 
 ''There was no center holding,'' recalls Rachell Shaw, 22, who lives with her boyfriend in a tidy tent decorated with porcelain dolls. ''So everybody voted him back in.''
 The community also established a five-member leadership council and a compact that read in part: ''No one person shall be greater than the will of the whole.''
 It is now late afternoon in late July, a month after nearly everyone signed that compact. The community remains intact, though the very ground they walk on says nothing is forever. Here and there are the exposed foundations of fish shacks that lined the river long ago.
 Some state officials recently stopped by to say, nicely but firmly, that everyone would soon have to leave. The overpass poses the threat of falling concrete, and is scheduled for demolition. The officials have shared the same message with a smaller encampment across the river.
 For now, a game of horseshoes sends echoing clanks, as outreach workers conduct interviews and raindrops thrum the tent tops. The chief lights another cigar and walks the length of the camp to tell residents to batten down, explaining its structure as he goes.
 Here at the end, nearest the road, are the tents of young single people and substance abusers; this way, rescue vehicles won't disrupt the entire compound.
 Here in the center are a cluster of couples, including two competing for the nicest property, with homey touches like planted flowers. Here too are the food table, the coolers, the piles of donated clothes -- what can't be used will be taken by camp residents to the Salvation Army -- and the large tent of the chief. Plastic pink flamingos stand guard.
 Farther on, the recycled-can area (the money is used for ice and propane); the area for garbage bags that will be discreetly dropped in nearby Dumpsters at night; and, behind a blue tarp hung from the overpass, a plastic toilet. The chief says the shared task of removing the bags of waste tends to test the compact.
 Finally, near some rocks where men go to urinate, live a gay couple and some people who drink hard. Timothy Webb, 49, who says he used to own a salon in Cranston called Class Act, cuts people's hair here. Then, at night, he and his partner, Norman Trank, 45, sit at a riverside table, a battery-operated candle giving light, the moving waters suggesting mystery.
 ''It's what you make of it,'' Mr. Trank says.
 Dark clouds have brought night early to Providence. Heavy drops thump against tarp. Water drips from the overpass, onto the long table of food.
 In the last couple of hours the chief has resolved a conflict about tarp distribution, hugged a pregnant woman who mistakenly thought she had been kicked off the island, conferred with outreach workers and helped with dinner preparations. He is also thinking about tomorrow.
 Tomorrow, an advance party for the chief will leave to claim another spot across the river that turns out not to be on public property. Many in the camp will decide it's time to move on anyway, to a spot under a bridge in East Providence. Camp Runamuck will begin its recession from sight and memory.
 At least tonight there is a communal dinner: donated chicken, parboiled and grilled; donated corn on the cob; donated potatoes. People line up with paper plates.
 The rain falls harder, pocking the river's gray surface, surrounding the dark camp with a sound like fingers drumming in impatience. The chief hears it, but what can he do? He finishes his dinner and lights another cigar.

 Museums
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'THE TREASURE OF ULYSSES DAVIS,' through Sept. 6. Ulysses Davis (1914-1990) was a Savannah, Ga., barber who whittled and carved wooden sculptures in his shop when business was slow. Organized by the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, this show is by far the largest presentation of Mr. Davis's sculpture to be seen outside Savannah and the first to reveal the full scope of his imagination. His best-known works, carvings of historical figures, take a backseat to hybrid beasts and hydra-headed figures. It makes clear that he wasn't just a patriotic folk artist, or an African-American artist affirming his heritage, or an inward-looking, visionary artist. He was all of these, which is to say that no single cliche of ''outsider'' art quite fits him. 45 West 53rd Street, Manhattan , (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20090730 
 BRONX MUSEUM OF THE ARTS: 'LIVING AND DREAMING,' through Sept. 13. This annual exhibition presents works by young artists who have completed a preparatory program for careers as professionals. Most look as if they could use a few years more of seasoning, but a handful appear to be artists to keep an eye on. The highlights include Eva Davidova's surreal videos; Meredith Drum's enigmatic, low-budget sci-fi film; Nathan Bennett's walk-in room resembling a set for a Stanley Kubrick space odyssey; and Jeffrey Hargrave's mock-racist caricatures. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania , (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)20090730
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM OF ART: 'LIGHT OF THE SUFIS: THE MYSTICAL ARTS OF ISLAM,' through Sept. 6. ''What's in your head -- throw it away! What's in your hand -- give it up! Whatever happens -- don't turn away from it.'' That's how a 10th-century Persian spiritual master defined the Islamic devotional practice known as Sufism. Countless other definitions have been proposed since, almost as many as for Islam itself. And variety -- paintings, ceramics, mosque lamps, books -- is what you find in this tiny, exquisite show in the Brooklyn Museum's newly reinstalled Islamic galleries. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)20090730
 FRICK COLLECTION: 'PORTRAITS, PASTELS, PRINTS: WHISTLER IN THE FRICK COLLECTION,' through Aug. 23. This summer's refurbishment of the Frick's East Gallery, where four full-length portraits by James Abbott McNeill Whistler (1834-1903) normally hang, has occasioned a small celebration of Whistler's art. The four portraits have been moved into the Oval Room, where they are joined by a seascape; etchings and pastels of Venice are on view in the Cabinet Room. Both displays reinforce a suspicion about Whistler: that despite his oft-professed regard for the abstract qualities of music -- all those ''symphonies,'' ''arrangements'' and ''nocturnes'' -- he had a rare talent for conveying specific places and personalities. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan , (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Rosenberg)20090730
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'THE SWEENEY DECADE: ACQUISITIONS OF THE 1959 INAUGURAL,' through Sept. 2. What did they get, and when did they get it? This perennial yardstick of a museum's sensitivity to new art is quite useful in this show. All 24 paintings and sculptures date from the 1950s and were acquired by the Guggenheim within a year or so of their making, and many were part of the first exhibition in Frank Lloyd Wright's spiral building. They constitute a mixture of the good, the bad and the innocuous, as well as European, Asian and American. But they also attest to the vision of James Johnson Sweeney, the Guggenheim's second director, who steered the museum away from its founding obsession with ''nonobjective painting'' and into the broad, challenging terrain of art after 1950. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street , (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Roberta Smith)20090730
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'AVEDON FASHION: 1944-2000,' through Sept. 20. The first museum retrospective devoted to Richard Avedon's fashion photography exudes a contagious joie de vivre. With postwar Paris as a stage set, Avedon made fashion photography new by adding movement and then narrative to his images, along with ironic self-awareness and a buoyant exuberance. The best of his early images are as perfect as the best work of Jackson Pollock or Jasper Johns from this period and as profoundly representative of it. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street , (212) 857-0000, www.icp.org. (Smith)20090730
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'THEY CALLED ME MAYER JULY: PAINTED MEMORIES OF A JEWISH CHILDHOOD IN POLAND BEFORE THE HOLOCAUST,' through Oct. 1. Introducing the reluctant painter and accidental memoirist Mayer Kirschenblatt, now 92, who has devoted the last two decades to documenting life between the wars in and around the provincial city of Opatow (Apt in Yiddish), Poland. Wrought with irresistible detail and folk-art dispatch, the paintings begin with his mother's kitchen and reflect an omnivorous curiosity about everyday everything, aided by an apparently photographic memory. Labels pick up where the paintings leave off; words and images combine in a marvel of a book accomplished in collaboration with the artist's daughter, a folklorist whose career choice was shaped by her father's stories. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, , (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Smith)20090730
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'AFGHANISTAN: HIDDEN TREASURES FROM THE NATIONAL MUSEUM, KABUL,' through Sept. 20. The 200 pre-Islamic objects in this important and moving show date from the Bronze Age to the first century A.D. They dropped from sight during the country's recent turmoil, which was deadly for both people and artwork alike. Courageous curators were their salvation; the rediscovery of the pieces was a moment of national thanksgiving. Consisting of vessels, sculpture, architectural ornaments, jewelry and furniture decoration made of bronze, stone, glass, ceramic, ivory, gold and gemstone, they attest to an astounding cosmopolitanism and diverse cultural heritage. Once, many trade routes led through Afghanistan, and proof of its former centrality is both dazzling and heartening. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20090730
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'FRANCIS BACON: A CENTENARY RETROSPECTIVE,' through Aug. 16. This 66-work survey starts with the stagy existentialism of Bacon's early work (the semihuman fiends, screaming popes, flanks of beef) and proceeds to the effulgent colors, insistent rhythms and true anguish of his grand triptychs and portraits. It suggests that his greatest achievement was his ability to paint convincingly men having sex and sometimes making love. As his hero Picasso had done for men and women, Bacon turned sexual passion into a pictorial event, using paint on canvas with finesse and no small sense of drama, while operating under cover of modernism. For once, the male gaze turned emphatically selfward. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20090730
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'LIVING LINE: SELECTED INDIAN DRAWINGS FROM THE SUBHASH KAPOOR GIFT,' through Sept. 7. This almost supernaturally beautiful exhibition presents 40 mostly small drawings by Indian miniaturists of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Rendered with amazing skill, the subjects include bearded aristocrats and bejeweled women; hunting scenes; wild animals and mythic beasts fighting; and gods, goddesses and demons ascending and descending. The art of drawing does not get much better than this. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090730
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through fall 2010. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20090730
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'PEN AND PARCHMENT: DRAWING IN THE MIDDLE AGES,' through Aug 23. This quietly ravishing exhibition ventures where few shows have gone before, with 50 rarely seen works. They prove medieval drawing to be vital, diverse and essential to the medium's Renaissance blossoming. They reveal the medium untangling from manuscript illumination and Christianity in general -- although not without first reveling in some astounding Psalters, gospels, epistles and a saint's life or two. It re-embraces antiquity and provides a framework for speculative (read, secular) thought. The show ends with the visionary drawings of Opicinus de Canistris, a 13th-century Italian cleric who diagrammed his own notion of the relationship between the earthly and spiritual church. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20090730
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ROXY PAINE ON THE ROOF: MAELSTROM,' through Oct. 25. An awesome spectacle awaits visitors to the museum's roof garden: a gnarly thicket of trees and branches extending 130 feet from one end of the open-air deck to the other and rising 29 feet overhead. It looks as if a tornado had ripped through Central Park and deposited its gleanings here -- except that it is all made of shiny metal pipe, as if all that wood had been transformed by someone with a stainless-steel Midas touch. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090730
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'PAGES OF GOLD: MEDIEVAL ILLUMINATIONS FROM THE MORGAN,' through Sept. 13. This quietly compelling show assembles ''orphan'' leaves (illuminated pages separated from medieval manuscripts and sold, individually, to collectors). Organized geographically, the show allows a comparison of illumination styles in England, Italy, Spain and other countries and regions. It also highlights the figures who created and participated in the market for single leaves. They include an Italian abbot, an English art historian and a mysterious artist known as the Spanish Forger. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street , (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)20090730
 MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'GORD PETERAN: FURNITURE MEETS ITS MAKER,' through Aug. 16. This Canadian furniture maker who is widely admired in craft creates what he calls ''furnitural'' sculpture. He is a consummate technician, and his play with elements of furniture is often amusing and sometimes conceptually provocative. ''Table Made of Wood'' (1999) wittily makes its title literal. It is a side table made by gluing together hundreds of wood scraps, adding up to what is as much a Cubist representation as a functional table. 2 Columbus Circle , (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090730
 MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'SCRIPTURE FOR THE EYES: BIBLE ILLUSTRATION IN NETHERLANDISH PRINTS OF THE 16TH CENTURY,' through Sept. 27. Abounding in sex, violence and supernatural happenings, the Bible has been a great source of inspiration for visual artists. This superb show features pieces by some of the biggest names in the history of Western printmaking. Woodcuts and engravings by Lucas van Leyden and Hendrick Goltzius alone would make a visit to the museum worthwhile, but among the 79 works on view there are lots more wildly imaginative and technically amazing feats of printmaking. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street , (212) 408-1500, mobia.org. (Johnson)20090730
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'COMPASS IN HAND: SELECTIONS FROM THE JUDITH ROTHSCHILD FOUNDATION CONTEMPORARY DRAWINGS COLLECTION,' through Jan. 4. The Modern's largest gift of drawings -- a windfall of 2,500 works by 650 artists -- started out as a kind of stunt and matured without becoming a triumph. Initially a yearlong shopping binge in pursuit of a ''cross section'' of drawing at a certain moment, it also tried to fill decades-old gaps in the Modern's drawing collection, often with works by familiar names. These dominate the sampling of the gift: a lackluster exhibition of 354 works by 177 artists that emphasizes the Modern's ambivalence about moving beyond the Minimalism/Post-Minimalist canon, and its tendency to pick big or hot names over truly great drawings. The bottom line? Connoisseurship matters. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20090730
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'WHAT WAS GOOD DESIGN? MOMA'S MESSAGE, 1944-1956,' through Nov. 30. With 102 objects and excellent labels, the Modern explores its role as arbiter of postwar American design, when, channeling the Bauhaus, it deemed good, affordable design a human right. Its campaign included exhibitions titled ''What Is Good Design?,'' design competitions and use of the MoMA seal of approval by selected department stores. Signature items like the Eames storage unit and the Chemex coffee maker mingle with surprises like a back-to-basics chair of string and wood by, of all people, Alexey Brodovitch, Harper's Bazaar's influential art director. The prevailing sense of beauty, restraint and economy is an implicit rebuke to today's inane material excesses. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20090730
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'LEANDRO ERLICH: SWIMMING POOL,' through Oct. 24. From P.S. 1's first-floor hallway you step onto a wooden deck that surrounds a small, fully equipped swimming pool. Glowing lights built into the aqua walls light up watery depths below the gently churning surface. A flight of stairs leads to a lower level and a magical surprise. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)20090730
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'JONATHAN HOROWITZ: AND/ OR,' through Sept. 14. Andy Warhol's grandchildren, numerous beyond count, have cashed in on his rich and radical legacy to see what further possibilities it might yield. Such is the case with the New York artist Jonathan Horowitz in this smart, crisply edited retrospective. The works evoke the media-saturated art of the 1970s, the neo-Conceptualist consumer art of the 1980s and the identity art of the 1990s, landing in a Never-Neverland era, in which analog is poised to turn to digital, and Doris Day and Paris Hilton have equal currency. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Cotter)20090730
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'DAN GRAHAM: BEYOND,' through Oct. 11. This beautifully installed retrospective pays tribute to an influential artist who doesn't necessarily call himself that, and it tends to bear him out. Most impressive are a series of early Conceptual artworks involving surgically precise uses of language and magazines; a series of deadpan, Minimalist-inspired photographs of New Jersey architecture; and ''Rock My Religion,'' an imaginative video about the roots of rock 'n' roll. The video installations and walk-in glass-and-mirror pavilions -- admired because they are interactive -- quickly grow tedious or gimmicky. The many artists who claim Mr. Graham as precedent may surpass him, but there is more than one way to be important. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)20090730
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'SADIE BENNING: PLAY PAUSE,' through Sept. 20. A new stop-action animation by this former film prodigy uses an avalanche of simple, almost naive gouache drawings, sometimes tinted with color, to prowl the margins of urban society. The result is low-key with undercurrents: a picture of the everyday sublime riddled with suggestions of longing, otherness and the difficulties of connection. Solveig Nelson has provided its beautifully accurate (yet largely electronic) soundtrack of city sounds, whether a subway singer or squirrels rifling through a garbage can, people talking in a bar or gates being called in an airport. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)20090730
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'CLAES OLDENBURG: EARLY SCULPTURE, DRAWINGS, AND HAPPENINGS FILMS' AND 'CLAES OLDENBURG AND COOSJE VAN BRUGGEN: THE MUSIC ROOM,' through Sept. 6. This pair of exhibitions leans heavily on the Whitney's sizable collection of Oldenburg and Oldenburg/Van Bruggen drawings, some of which were shown in 2002. But they also include newly restored, never-exhibited films of Mr. Oldenburg's Happenings and a major kinetic sculpture, ''Ice Bag -- Scale C'' (1971), brought back to life by conservators. A centralized gallery of early drawings and soft sculptures defines Mr. Oldenburg's epicurean branch of Pop, with works like ''Giant BLT (Bacon, Lettuce and Tomato Sandwich)'' and ''French Fries and Ketchup'' (both 1963), served up on low, platterlike pedestals. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Rosenberg)20090730
 Galleries: Uptown
 BLANCHE LAZZELL: 'WHITE-LINE COLOR WOODCUTS,' through Aug. 14. This show is a wonderful introduction to one of the unsung geniuses of early American modernism, Blanche Lazzell (1878-1956), an artist who perfected the relatively new technique of white-line woodcut prints into a truly, if modestly, visionary art. The elimination of black lines between the woodcut shapes created an inherent luminosity that Lazzell exploited with her superb sense of color and Cubist-flavored composition. A denizen of Cape Cod, she depicted harbor scenes, landscapes and village rooftops and backyards in images that replace the expected sentimentality with fervent joy. The light has been switched off. Craig F. Starr Gallery, 5 East 73rd Street , (212) 570-1739, starr-art.com. (Smith)20090730
 Galleries: 57th Street
 'PAUL JENKINS IN THE 1960S AND 1970S: SPACE, COLOR AND LIGHT,' through Sept. 25. While seriously overhung, this exhibition affords a rare, extensive look at the work of an artist who borrowed from Abstract Expressionism and then Color Field Painting to devise flowing, billowing veils of color that dazzle with their formal acrobatics and luminous, jewel-toned hues. Working with his well-known ivory knives, Mr. Jenkins makes his colors leap, overlap and splinter, pitting them against whiplash lines and stark white backgrounds that increase their luminosity. His paintings have frequently been too gorgeous for their own good, which means that they can verge on slick. But the selection here shows him at the height of his powers. D. Wigmore Fine Art, 730 Fifth Avenue , (212) 581-1657, dwigmore.com. (Smith)20090730
 Galleries: Chelsea
 GUYTON/WALKER, through next Friday. A Geiger counter designed to measure art-world cleverness would go haywire around the latest collaborative efforts of Wade Guyton and Kelley Walker. Several generations' worth of painting's history, motifs and breakthroughs are evoked -- along with its shipping needs, its use as decor and its influence on design. The dots, stripes, monochromes and Op Art checks of postwar abstraction mingle with Pop Art bananas, zebra-skin motifs and orange slices while migrating from canvas to drywall to Parsons tables and paint cans. Painting as process, as pleasure and as commodity is evoked. The high-key color is especially impressive. But once the references are parsed and sourced, the fun-house formalism tends to ring hollow. Greene Naftali, 508 West 26th Street , (212) 463-7770, greenenaftaligallery.com. (Smith)20090730
 'NAKED!,' through Sept. 19. Although it includes some images of men, a more accurate title for this entertainingly lubricious show would be ''Naked Women of Child-Bearing Age.'' A big part of the show's appeal is its wacky eclecticism. The 44 works range from a 1626 painting of the river god Alpheus chasing the nymph Arethusa, by Moyses van Uyttenbroeck, to Mel Ramos's 2007 sculpture of a voluptuous woman emerging from an open banana peel. Paul Kasmin Gallery, 293 10th Avenue, at 27th Street , (212) 563-4474, paulkasmingallery.com. (Johnson)20090730
 'PROJECT SPACE & ROOFTOP: PAULA HAYES,' through Aug. 15. The best works in this show, which spreads from gallery space to terrace, are hand-blown clear-glass terrariums inhabited by either plants or crystals; rubbery planters of several kinds; and some eco-conscious landscaping devices. All blur the lines dividing sculpture, gardening and design into an art of purposeful, playful beauty and serenity. Marianne Boesky Gallery, 509 West 24th Street , (212) 680-9889, marianneboeskygallery.com. (Smith)20090730
 'YOUR GOLD TEETH II,' through Aug. 15. This exceptional show -- titled after a song by Steely Dan -- ignores the distinctions between art and craft, old and new, commercial and fine. The many works are arranged in unusually tight clusters without labels; formal and visual affinities are established before you quite know what you're looking at. Craft-world greats like Peter Voulkos, Ed Rossbach, Marvin Lipofsky, George Ohr and Edward Moulthrop (you can look them up) rub shoulders with fine-art practitioners like Barkley L. Hendricks, Sergej Jensen, Alexandra Bircken, Alighiero E. Boetti and Cady Noland. All kinds of visual prejudices are shaken up, if not startled out of existence. Marianne Boesky Gallery, 509 West 24th Street , (212) 680-9889, marianneboeskygallery.com. (Smith)20090730
 Galleries: SoHo
 'DASH SNOW, 1981-2009: A COMMUNITY MEMORIAL,' through Aug. 15. In the wake of the recent death of the artist and downtown art star Dash Snow, friends and family have lent photographs and other works by and about him. The walls of the gallery are densely covered, with photographs of the artist in the great majority. The show gives evidence of his charismatic personality, photogenic looks and propensity for fast living. It is not a chance to evaluate his art, but it does raise the question of whether the art can supersede the personality and life story. Deitch Projects, 76 Grand Street , (212) 343-7300, deitch.com. (Smith)20090730
 Public Art
 'PLOT/09: THIS WORLD & NEARER ONES,' through the summer. The big draw in the city's first quadrennial of public art -- an exhibition of 19 site-specific works organized by Creative Time on Governors Island -- is the beautiful, haunted, car-free island itself. Standouts among the uneven melange of artworks include videos by Guido van der Werve, Adam Chodzko, Judi Werthein and the ingenious Bruce High Quality Foundation. Outdoors, beyond the dark rooms, Susan Philipsz, Teresa Margolles, Tue Greenfort, Mark Wallinger and especially Klaus Weber also add substance. But the degree of site-specificity fluctuates wildly, and the concept as a whole is inadvertently called into question. (212) 206-6674, creativetime.org. (Smith)20090730
 Out of Town
 INSTITUTE OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'SHEPARD FAIREY: SUPPLY AND DEMAND,' through Aug. 16. The surprise of the first museum retrospective for the creator of the Obama ''Hope'' poster is that almost everything he does, from abstracted images of Andre the Giant to his album covers for Led Zeppelin and other bands, is visually arresting. But in tracking his 20-year evolution from aesthetic anarchist to savvy, all-purpose designer and illustrator, the exhibition inadvertently casts doubt on his authenticity as a radical street artist. 100 Northern Avenue, Boston , (617) 478-3100, icaboston.org. 20090730
 (Johnson)
 ZOE LEONARD, through Sept. 7. Always an exceptionally moving artist, though only sporadically visible, Zoe Leonard has an exhibition at Dia:Beacon, an hour and a half north of the city. It is different from some of her earlier shows: cooler and less intimate, documentary in form, broadly social in scope. At the same time, it shares a sensibility with what has come before, one attuned to realities of constant change, which as often as not means loss. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y. , (845) 440-0100, diaart.org. (Cotter)20090730
 NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART: 'THE ART OF POWER: ROYAL ARMOR AND PORTRAITS FROM IMPERIAL SPAIN,' through Nov. 1. Drawn from the Royal Armory in Madrid, one of the oldest and greatest repositories of armor in the world, this exhibition presents full suits of armor, as well as individual helmets, shields, swords and armor for horses. There are portraits of 16th- and 17th-century Spanish kings in armor, too, and three spectacular tapestries. But it is the extraordinarily sumptuous metalwork, produced not for warfare but for ceremonial occasions, that is the main attraction. National Mall, Fourth and Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Johnson)20090730
 Last Chance
 'ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM: FURTHER EVIDENCE (PART 1: PAINTING)'; closes on Friday. Despite including artists like Hans Hofmann, Lee Krasner and Joan Mitchell, this exhibition delves into the further reaches of America's most renowned art movement. Its high points include a monstrous collage by Alfred Leslie and excellent works by James Brooks, Alfonso Ossorio and Milton Resnick. But the standout is Beauford Delaney's ''Composition 16'' from 1954-56, a shimmering field of dark, green-tinged yellow that crosses Monet with Pollock and is a must-have for any museum that wants to expand its definition of Abstract Expressionism beyond the white and the male. Michael Rosenfeld Gallery, 24 West 57th Street , (212) 247-0082, michaelrosenfeldart.com. (Smith)20090730
 'LYNDA BENGLIS/ROBERT MORRIS: 1973-74;' closes on Friday. Organized by David Platzker of Specific Object, this excellent exhibition revisits the historic dust-up that ensued in 1974 when the artist Lynda Benglis published a photograph of herself nude (except for some sunglasses and double-headed dildo) in the advertising pages of Artforum, the leading magazine of the day. The back-and-forth collaboration, in video, between Ms. Benglis and the older sculptor Robert Morris is effectively sketched in. But the real action is the letters to the editor published in two issues and the many others not published, most of which are on view here for the first time. Susan Inglett Gallery, 522 West 24th Street, Chelsea , (212) 647-9111, inglettgallery.com. (Smith)20090730
 LEIDY CHURCHMAN: 'GOOD AFTERNOON!'; closes on Saturday. These sly, tenderly wrought figurative paintings on wood constitute an impressive debut. With inspirations that seem to include Grandma Moses, Tom of Finland, Charles Demuth and Hans Holbein, the images both sort out and blur issues of gender and sexual orientation while celebrating relationships of all varieties. Pictorial and social wit combine with color and spatial contradiction to reinforce ambiguities of a sexual and emotional nature. Even the wood contributes to the wholesome, normalizing glow. Sunday L.E.S., 237 Eldridge Street, near East Houston Street, Lower East Side , (212) 253-0700, sundayles.com. (Smith)20090730
 'THE FANTASTIC TAVERN: THE TBILISI AVANT-GARDE'; closes on Friday. Containing little in the way of actual artworks, this extraordinary exhibition nonetheless manages to convey the flavor of a little-known pocket of the Russian avant-garde that flourished between 1910 and the early 1930s in the small city of Tbilisi, located in Georgia in the southern Caucasus. The works on view include four films (among them, the recently rediscovered ''Nail in the Boot''); framed page-by-page color reproductions of magazines and manifestoes; and additional reproductions of stage set designs, watercolors and drawings, as well as vintage photographs. This is doubtlessly only the tip of the iceberg, but it leaves little wonder why Tbilisi was sometimes called the Paris of the East. Casey Kaplan, 525 West 21st Street, Chelsea , (212) 645-7335, caseykaplangallery.com. (Smith)20090730
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'RECLAIMED: PAINTINGS FROM THE COLLECTION OF JACQUES GOUDSTIKKER'; closes on Sunday. This show of paintings returned to the family of Goudstikker, a prominent Dutch gallery owner who died while fleeing the Nazis, is many exhibitions in one. It's a portrait of an enormously successful art dealer who shaped tastes and markets between the wars. It's a marriage of Northern Baroque and Southern Renaissance painting. Most of all, it's an extraordinary, continuing tale of looting and restitution. At the center of all these stories is a small black notebook, used by Goudstikker to catalog his inventory of some 1,400 works and now on display, in actual and digitized form, at the Jewish Museum. Other highlights include a landscape by Salomon von Jacobsz Ruysdael and a portrait by Rembrandt's pupil Ferdinand Bol. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street , (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org.

 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE PICTURES GENERATION, 1974-1984'; closes on Sunday. With this historical survey, the Met tackles a subject in American contemporary art -- namely, a critical and innovative body of media-influenced work produced between two major economic booms -- that has been begging for full-scale museum attention, and gives it the full old master treatment. Much of the art itself -- painting, drawing, sculpture, photography, video, installation, prints, music and books by 30 artists, most of them still active and caught young here -- continues to look good. There are things to quarrel with, from the sweeping ''generation'' concept to a surprising, un-Met-like factual error in the wall labels: the original ''Pictures'' show had five artists, not four; one, Philip Smith, has been deliberately excised here in the interest of writing a neater history. Still, the show is a big step into the pertinent present for this museum. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)20090730

HEADLINE: Split Decision For Officers Alleging Bias In Greenwich

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
Greenwich unlawfully discriminated against five of the eight African-American and Latino police officers who sued the town three years ago, a federal jury ruled this week in a closely watched case.
 Those five will share damage awards totaling $157,000, assuming the town does not appeal. A lawyer for the town said that decision had not yet been made. 
 In a culture rife with discrimination cases brought by minority and white plaintiffs, the complaint, which was filed in 2006 and contended that ''Greenwich is a racially exclusive town,'' has been a sore spot. 
 The lawsuit, which accused the town of tolerating a work environment that was hostile to minority workers and of failing to offer them opportunities for promotion and higher pay, kept the affluent seaside town in the news and on the defensive. It followed other complaints, still unresolved, from three prominent minority women who said they had been hassled when they tried to exercise at the town's beach. 
 The police officers' case finally came to trial this month and lasted 10 days before United States District Court Judge Mark R. Kravitz in New Haven. The nine-person jury deliberated for nearly four days before rendering a verdict on Wednesday. 
 The jury agreed with five of the eight plaintiffs that the town had failed to offer them opportunities for promotion or premium-pay assignments. The five are Terral Hardy, John Rodriguez, Scott Johnson, Carlos Franco and John Woodward. Each of them received $5,000 in addition to their damage awards to compensate them for emotional distress. 
 The jury also made further damage awards to Officers Franco and Woodward, finding that they faced hostile work environments. 
 Three plaintiffs, Robert Brown, Vincent O'Banner and Anthony Cameron, did not prevail on any ground. The jury also rejected a claim that the town had allowed the rankings from a promotional exam to expire in an effort to deny one plaintiff a promotion. 
 All eight officers continue to work as police officers in Greenwich and four of them have moved on to better assignments since the suit was filed.
 ''The case was never about money,'' said Lewis Chimes, their lawyer. ''They're all still working there and the economic damages were not that high. I think the case was about vindication, and if you combine the money with the fact that after we filed, four out of the eight of them were promoted, that's a really good outcome.'' 
 ''It was about change,'' he added. ''So I think our clients by and large are very satisfied.''
 A lawyer for Greenwich, John Wayne Fox, said the jury's ''compromise verdict'' was less harsh than it could have been. 
 ''Now, obviously, we are not pleased in any scenario where there is a finding that there was a failure to promote because of race-related issues,'' Mr. Fox said. ''So we're not happy with that. But there were other aspects where the jury found no wrongdoing. So I look at it as a case where the jury listened attentively and had sympathy for some of these individuals and felt they were treated in a manner that was unfair and gave them what I consider to be reasonable damages.'' 
 Judge Kravitz will have to decide whether the town will also pay the plaintiffs' legal fees, likely to exceed $900,000. 
 The plaintiffs seemed to score points in arguing that their supervisors tolerated offensive comments and did little when complaints landed at their feet. 
 In one instance in 2005, town officials were alerted that an officer had circulated a racially offensive video in an e-mail message while assigned to a federal task force. Mr. Fox said the officer was not under the department's command at the time. 
 In another instance, the eight officers argued, the town responded lackadaisically to a 1998 civilian complaint lodged against a police sergeant by a neighbor, who claimed that the officer had referred to the neighbor's children using a racial slur and threatened to shoot them. 
 The town's insurance policies require it to pay the first $1 million of defense costs or damages, and it has already spent $690,000 on legal fees, Mr. Fox said.

HEADLINE: Study Finds Hope in Saving Saltwater Fish

BYLINE: By CORNELIA DEAN

 BODY:
Can we have our fish and eat it too? An unusual collaboration of marine ecologists and fisheries management scientists says the answer may be yes.
 In a research paper in Friday's issue of the journal Science, the two groups, long at odds with each other, offer a global assessment of the world's saltwater fish and their environments. 
 Their conclusions are at once gloomy -- overfishing continues to threaten many species -- and upbeat: a combination of steps can turn things around. But because antagonism between ecologists and fisheries management experts has been intense, many familiar with the study say the most important factor is that it was done at all. 
 They say they hope the study will inspire similar collaborations between scientists whose focus is safely exploiting specific natural resources and those interested mainly in conserving them.
 ''We need to merge those two communities,'' said Steve Murawski, chief fisheries scientist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ''This paper starts to bridge that gap.'' 
 The collaboration began in 2006 when Boris Worm, a marine ecologist at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and other scientists made an alarming prediction: if current trends continue, by 2048 overfishing will have destroyed most commercially important populations of saltwater fish. Ecologists applauded the work. But among fisheries management scientists, reactions ranged from skepticism to fury over what many called an alarmist report. 
 Among the most prominent critics was Ray Hilborn, a professor of aquatic and fishery sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle. Yet the disagreement did not play out in typical scientific fashion with, as Dr. Hilborn put it, ''researchers firing critical papers back and forth.'' Instead, he and Dr. Worm found themselves debating the issue on National Public Radio.
 ''We started talking and found more common ground than we had expected,'' Dr. Worm said. Dr. Hilborn recalled thinking that Dr. Worm ''actually seemed like a reasonable person.''
 The two decided to work together on the issue. They sought and received financing and began organizing workshops at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, an organization sponsored by the National Science Foundation and based at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
 At first, Dr. Hilborn said in an interview, ''the fisheries management people would go to lunch and the marine ecologists would go to lunch'' -- separately. But soon they were collecting and sharing data and recruiting more colleagues to analyze it.
 Dr. Hilborn said he and Dr. Worm now understood why the ecologists and the management scientists disagreed so sharply in the first place. For one thing, he said, as long as a fish species was sustaining itself, management scientists were relatively untroubled if its abundance fell to only 40 or 50 percent of what it might otherwise be. Yet to ecologists, he said, such a stock would be characterized as ''depleted'' -- ''a very pejorative word.''
 In the end, the scientists concluded that 63 percent of saltwater fish stocks had been depleted ''below what we think of as a target range,'' Dr. Worm said. 
 But they also agreed that fish in well-managed areas, including the United States, were recovering or doing well. They wrote that management techniques like closing some areas to fishing, restricting the use of certain fishing gear or allocating shares of the catch to individual fishermen, communities or others could allow depleted fish stocks to rebound. 
 The researchers suggest that a calculation of how many fish in a given species can be caught in a given region without threatening the stock, called maximum sustainable yield, is less useful than a standard that takes into account the health of the wider marine environment. They also agreed that solutions did not lie only in management techniques but also in the political will to apply them, even if they initially caused economic disruption.
 Because the new paper represents the views of both camps, its conclusions are likely to be influential, Dr. Murawski said. ''Getting a strong statement from those communities that there is more to agree on than to disagree on builds confidence,'' he said. 
 At a news conference on Wednesday, Dr. Worm said he hoped to be alive in 2048, when he would turn 79. If he is, he said, ''I will be hosting a seafood party -- at least I hope so.''

HEADLINE: German Approach to Joblessness Whittles Down Numbers, for Now

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH; Victor Homola and Stefan Pauly contributed reporting from Berlin.

DATELINE: REUTLINGEN, Germany 

 BODY:
Even as the German economy suffers through its worst slump since World War II, the government unveiled a seemingly happy surprise on Thursday: Not many people lost their jobs last month.
 So has Germany escaped the ravages of the downturn? Probably not, economists say. The apparent resilience of the labor market is more indicative of a peculiarly German approach to combating the punishing recession than of underlying trends in the economy. Germany has found creative ways to keep people off the jobless rolls, whether they have work to do or not. 
 Politicians laud the measures, which aim to keep unemployed people nominally on someone's payroll, as a bridge over the steepest period of economic collapse. But many economists argue that the short-term jobless statistics may mask a less optimistic trend that could undermine confidence in the fall, when recovery is supposed to take hold. 
 ''The Achilles' heel is in the coming months,'' said Ulrich Wortberg, analyst at Landesbank Hessen-Thuringen. ''The recovery is filled with risks.''
 The number of unemployed in Germany showed a moderate rise of 52,000 in July. Compared with the same period a year ago, 252,000 people have lost jobs.
 Those figures are dwarfed by the increase of six million in the number of jobless over the past year in the United States, even allowing that Germany has a little more than one-fourth the population of the United States. Where the unemployment rate in the United States soared to 9.5 percent in June compared with 5.6 percent the year before, the German unemployment rate was 8.2 percent in July compared with 7.7 percent a year ago.
 With Chancellor Angela Merkel seeking re-election in September, the unemployment numbers have real political implications. While there are no suggestions of any tinkering with the data, it is widely noted in Germany that both government and big business have an incentive to lift people's spirits so close to the election.
 ''At the end of the day, German corporations will have to restructure anyway, will have to downsize capacities,'' said Eckart Tuchtfeld, senior economist at Commerzbank. ''And that contributes, of course, to our picture of a somewhat subdued recovery, particularly in Germany, because of the lags in reaction to the economic crisis.'' 
 Economists estimate that the government-subsidized program of short working hours -- known as Kurzarbeit -- has helped avert roughly 400,000 layoffs so far, with 1.3 million to 1.4 million people in the short-time program, according to government estimates. But with the economy expected to shrink by at least 6 percent this year, experts say that stopgap measure will give way at last to a far bigger wave of layoffs this fall, after the election.
 Metin Marul was let go from his assembly-line job at a Mercedes supplier near Stuttgart in May. He still has not found a new position to replace the one he lost. Yet according to the government, he is not unemployed.
 Mr. Marul, 42, is one of about 60 employees from the closed factory who ended up instead on the rolls of what is known in Germany as a transfer company. At an office in Reutlingen run by the company MyPegasus, Mr. Marul, a Turkish-born immigrant, works on his resume, talks to an adviser about how to look for work and can take courses to advance his technical skills or improve his non-native German.
 He can also collect roughly 80 percent of his salary for a year, with the costs split between the government and his former employer. ''It's better for me at the transfer company, because I can learn here and look for work,'' Mr. Marul said.
 At the Wadan shipyard in the northern state of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, nearly 2,500 workers are expected to enter a transfer company, with the state government putting up more than $20 million to cover the shipyard's share of the expense. Daniel Friedrich, a spokesman for the union IG Metall, called the state's decision to ensure that a transfer company could be set up a ''responsible'' one, but said the union was worried about the future.
 ''The fear is there that after the Bundestag election, firms will pull back from short-time work and instead go ahead with more layoffs. At that point the subject of transfer companies will automatically take on a new dynamic,'' Mr. Friedrich said.
 MyPegasus has 20 permanent offices around Germany, but right now it has an additional 30 temporary offices, set up on a project-by-project basis. The company's executive director, Rainer Schwille, said they were currently at a record level; usually they would have 1,000 to 1,500 people, but that number has risen to 2,500.
 And he said more laid-off people were expected. ''We fear that the layoffs will only intensify after the summer vacations are over, and the companies still don't have the level of orders that they did before,'' Mr. Schwille said.
 Employees at MyPegasus said the transfer company was more than just a technical difference from unemployment. ''There's a psychological aspect. A lot of people fall into a hole when they say, 'I'm unemployed now.' At a transfer company you don't feel that way,'' said Jochen Bordt, 40, a mechanics instructor. ''It does you good not to fall so deep in the hole right away.''
 Mr. Marul, who worked for eight years at the auto parts factory before he was laid off, said that it was a boost to have somewhere to go where he saw familiar faces from the shop floor. ''For eight years we were making things together; maybe we can do it here,'' he said.
 Not everyone is optimistic about their chances. Uwe Baier, 31, was laid off in April from a job making oil coolers for trucks at a nearby factory. At MyPegasus he is learning to use computerized machine tools for the first time, which he praised as an important work skill for the future. He did not, however, think it would help him enough in the present economy to find a new job.
 ''In the next couple months? It's not good,'' Mr. Baier said. ''I'd say my chances are bad.''

HEADLINE: Exxon Profit Falls 66%, Long Drop From Record

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
Exxon Mobil's stellar earnings growth in recent years had hardly disappointed its investors. But now, the company whose profit for last year was the largest in corporate history is slipping in its performance.
 Exxon Mobil said Thursday that its second-quarter profit tumbled 66 percent, a sign the company was not immune to lower oil prices and weaker demand. 
 The company reported that its net income fell to $3.95 billion, or 81 cents a share, from $11.68 billion, or $2.22 a share, in the period a year ago. 
 The results were well below market estimates of $1.02 a share and the weakest for the company since the third quarter of 2003, reflecting lower oil and gas production and losses at the company's domestic refining business. Exxon's shares fell 1 percent, or 71 cents, on Thursday to close at $70.72.
 Long accustomed to outshining its peers, Exxon's weaker performance reflects the severity of the economic downturn throughout the energy industry. Royal Dutch Shell, Europe's biggest oil company, said on Thursday that its second-quarter profits also tumbled by 67 percent, while BP and ConocoPhillips also reported big drops in profits earlier in the week. 
 It is the third consecutive quarterly fall in earnings at Exxon. Last year was the company's most profitable ever, with full-year earnings of $45.22 billion thanks in large part to record high prices.
 ''They've definitely been growth-challenged for a few quarters,'' said Brian M. Young- berg, senior energy analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis. ''They have a good portfolio of projects, but until they start delivering, investors are generally skeptical of their guidance. It's also hard to grow when you're as big as Exxon.'' 
 The global recession is expected to reduce oil consumption worldwide for a second year, the first time that has happened since the early 1980s, hurting the demand for gasoline or jet fuel. 
 Oil companies, which are struggling to adapt to a new environment of lower prices and weaker demand, have responded by slashing costs, paring drilling activities and shutting some operations. 
 ''Our results show that no one is immune from global economic conditions,'' Kenneth P. Cohen, the company's vice president for public affairs, said in a conference call with reporters.
 Exxon's combined oil and gas production fell 3 percent in the quarter, because of restrictions imposed by OPEC producers and lower output from mature fields. Exxon's oil production in the quarter averaged 2.35 million barrels a day and gas production was about 8.01 billion cubic feet a day. The company said it increased its output from new projects in Qatar and in the United States.
 Output has dropped at most oil companies in recent years, as big projects have been delayed and OPEC nations have restricted production to help prop up prices. 
 But given the company's size, some analysts are concerned that Exxon will have trouble meeting its self-imposed target to increase production by 2 percent this year. The company's lower output in the past quarter might limit this year's overall growth, according to Macquarie Securities analysts. 
 Exxon is about to start up the latest phase of its huge liquefied natural gas project in Qatar, and so far this year has begun production at four of its nine major projects planned for the year.
 Profit at the company's production and exploration unit fell to $3.81 billion in the second quarter, down $6.2 billion compared with a year earlier. In its refining business, Exxon's profit dropped to $512 million, down $1.05 billion from a year ago. That included a loss of $15 million at Exxon's domestic refining business.
 Despite the lower profit, Exxon continued its program to reward shareholders by buying back shares and paying dividends. The company spent $5.2 billion in the second quarter to buy back 75 million shares. Its capital spending program, one of the largest in the industry, fell by 6 percent, to $6.6 billion in the past quarter, but it still on track to reach about $29 billion this year.
 ''Global economic conditions continue to impact the energy industry both in the volatility of commodity prices and reduced demand for products,'' the company's chairman and chief executive, Rex W. Tillerson, said in a statement.
 Exxon's report caps a week of lower earnings across the energy industry after oil prices tumbled from last year's record levels and the global economy slowed down. Oil prices, which had reached a record closing price of $145.29 a barrel last July, recently traded around $63 a barrel.
 Also on Thursday, Royal Dutch Shell reported that its net profit fell 67 percent in the second quarter, to $3.82 billion, from $11.6 billion in the period a year ago. Shell said that it planned to reduce capital spending by more than 10 percent next year to about $28 billion and that it would cut jobs.
 Earnings at Shell's exploration and production unit dropped 77 percent, to $1.33 billion, from $5.9 billion a year ago, mostly on lower oil prices. Production declined 6 percent, to 2.9 million barrels of oil and equivalents a day, while prices were $52.62 a barrel, down from $111.92 in the period a year ago.
 ''Our second-quarter results were affected by the weak global economy,'' said Peter R. Voser, Shell's chief executive. ''This weakness is creating a difficult environment both in upstream and downstream.''
 On Wednesday, ConocoPhillips, the third-largest American oil company after Exxon and Chevron, said that its quarterly profits tumbled 76 percent, to $1.3 billion, after a loss in its refining business. Chevron reports its earnings on Friday.
 The British oil giant BP said earlier this week that its profit declined 53 percent, to $4.39 billion. The company said it would reduce its costs by $3 billion this year, $1 billion more than it had initially planned. The company's chief executive, Tony Hayward, also signaled that he expected oil prices to hover in a range of $60 to $90 a barrel.

HEADLINE: Homes Amid the Vines

BYLINE: By BETHANY LYTTLE

 BODY:
GRAPES aren't the only cash crop in Yamhill County, Ore., in the Willamette Valley southwest of Portland. Real estate, cultivated in tandem with vineyards and wineries renowned for their pinot noir, has been attracting second-home buyers, investors and wine lovers since the 1980s.
 ''We get lots of second-home buyers who want an acre of land to grow their own grapes and a house with a garage where they can make their own wine,'' said Randy McCreith, the owner of Bella Casa Real Estate Group in McMinnville, the Yamhill County seat and one of its largest cities, with about 31,000 residents. And, he said, the area gets ''boomers who want 10 to 20 rural acres for a small operation or sometimes just for the views.'' 
State land-use laws have limited the scope and pace of development in the county, something that pleases those who see the laws as protective and frustrates those who would prefer fewer limits on growth. For real estate agents, the advantage is a pristine landscape with property values that should increase over time because of the restrictions. 
 Unlike their California counterparts in the Napa and Sonoma Valleys, Yamhill County buyers needn't break the bank to open the bottle of local wine. The high end of the second-home market is $1 million to $1.5 million. (Higher prices are generally for full-time commercial vineyards.) A smaller home on one to five acres can be found for $350,000 to $600,000.
 For those who want to sip rather than grow, a house on an acre lot within an incorporated town can be found for $175,000 to $300,000. This is particularly true in some of the smaller towns, like Amity, that are still emerging as second-home and retirement destinations. 
 Even with the land-use laws, inventory has been high and demand low for the past two years. Mr. McCreith said that most buyers had come from the South and Southwest and that Yamhill County was feeling the ripple of market and economic problems in those regions. ''During the fourth quarter of 2008, the market here came to a screeching halt,'' he said. Since January he has seen increased and relatively steady activity, but prices remain somewhat unstable. 
 HIGH
 This 4,326-square-foot clapboard farmhouse, built in 1913, is on 15.3 acres with views of the Willamette Valley and the Pacific Coast Range. Dayton, which has a population of about 2,300, is about six miles east of McMinnville. The house has a covered porch and established gardens, and the land is suitable for vineyards. There is a main-floor master bedroom, dormers in the upper-level bedrooms and two and a half bathrooms. The house has been fully restored, and the property has two outbuildings and a two-bedroom guest house. Taxes are $2,085 a year.

HEADLINE: Bravado That Swaggers To Its Own Beat

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH. 
'''Ron Arad: No Discipline'' opens on Sunday and continues through Oct. 19 at the Museum of Modern Art; (212) 708-9400 or moma.org.

 BODY:
The designer Ron Arad has always had a lot of nerve, and it ricochets around his rambunctious, ultimately inconclusive retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art like an ammo belt's worth of stray bullets. Sometimes the bullets hit, turning random targets into bull's-eyes. More often they are wide of the mark, resulting in things that seem self-indulgent and frivolous. No wonder this show, which opens on Sunday and is the first major survey of Mr. Arad's work in the United States, is titled ''Ron Arad: No Discipline.'' 
 In the late 1980s and the 1990s, Mr. Arad was the design world's darling, a man whose name was regularly linked to words like maverick, bad boy, visionary, influential and derring-do. He was known for ignoring the boundaries among traditional disciplines like industrial design, architecture and sculpture before this was a widespread fashion in the design world. 
 He has designed buildings, though few have yet been built, and he has devised several versions of the stackable mass-produced chairs that since the 1930s have signaled serious design intent. 
 But he is also widely associated with the trend of nominally functional, usually one-of-a-kind collectibles known as design art -- another label he dismisses. Mr. Arad's versions are usually chairs or chaise longues or bookcases that often rock, roll or move in other ways and are made of expensive or unwieldy materials like Lucite, Corian, bronze or stainless steel. They also seem to be trying their best to look like generic abstract sculpture, Pop Art or even Arte Povera -- as when Mr. Arad, inexplicably, cast a sound system in concrete.
 Mr. Arad has always marched to his own drum. He was born in Tel Aviv in 1951 and, after studying art at the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design in Jerusalem for two years (1971 to 1973), he landed in London, which had the advantage, he once said, of being nearer to Israel than Greenwich Village was. There, he trained for five years as an architect at the Architectural Association School of Architecture. He worked briefly in an architect's office, but disliked being in the employ of others. He soon left and set up his own studio, but attracted no clients. 
 In 1981, casting about for something to do cheaply and quickly, Mr. Arad came across a Rover car in a junkyard. He took the leather-covered seats and fastened them to curved bases made of Kee-Klamps, a scaffolding system first devised for livestock corrals, and set them in his studio's storefront window. Their alluring combination of distressed luxe and improvised postpunk ''Mad Max'' swagger quickly attracted notice and found a buyer who turned out to be Jean Paul Gaultier. 
 Et voila! Mr. Arad had backed into design, in a ready-made, Conceptual Art sort of way that also took advantage of the fact that car seats are among the most comfortable, best-designed ready-made seating around. The ''Rover Chair'' sold like hotcakes and remains an impressive addition to the history of chairs. 
 Seen in slightly different form in Paris at the Centre Pompidou last spring, this show has been organized at the Modern by Paola Antonelli, senior curator in the museum's architecture and design department, and Patricia Juncosa Vecchierini, a curatorial assistant in that department. The entrance is flanked by sectional seating systems designed by Mr. Arad and are available for use. One elaborates Surrealist curves and swellings into bright red undulating sofas and ottomans; the other, geometric, masses bright pylonlike forms and resembles the '60s designs of Verner Panton. Inside the gallery itself, Surrealism too often has the upper hand.
 For starters, the exhibition resembles a fancy furniture showroom at night, what with the penumbral cast of the gallery's dark, dark blue walls, and the enormous display structure, designed by Mr. Arad, that fills the room like a small ship or a Quonset hut. This turns out to be a grid of Cor-Ten steel, more than 16 feet tall, that curves and twists through the space in two loops, like a rubber band. 
 The squares of the grid, lined with polished stainless steel, function as shelves that hold most of the objects in the show. Other items are arranged inside the loops or placed outside them, pushed against or hung on the walls, as in back-of-the-shop storage. All told, these are not optimum viewing conditions. 
 The show proceeds in vaguely chronological order, with Mr. Arad's earliest works arrayed in the first loop of the grid structure. These include examples of the original ''Rover'' chairs as well as more recent spinoffs in stainless steel and rusted steel that look like bad Realist sculpture. 
 The ''Well-Tempered Chair,'' an important work from 1986, abandons the ready-made for mimicry. Ingeniously simple and said to be a challenge to sit on, it minimally parodies the form of an easy chair with four sprung sheets of tempered steel fastened together with wing nuts. 
 Next comes a rough-edged, dented and misshapen armchair in welded steel, which suggests a violent disagreement among Tony Smith, John Chamberlain and Donald Judd, and its cousin, the smoothed-out, easier-to-take ''Big Easy'' armchair. This series, which began in 1988, takes the armchair into Pop, Toontown territory indebted to Walt Disney, Claes Oldenburg, Scott Bruton and Jeff Koons. (The big, rounded arms are invariably compared to Mickey Mouse ears.) Originally in steel and antirust paint, this design has mutated to stainless steel (1989), upholstered red wool over foam (1990) and colored polyethylene (2003). 
 My favorite ''Big Easy'' variant is the 1999 ''New Orleans,'' whose gleaming white fiberglass is covered with exuberant explosions of color and confetti-like marks that are fused with the surface, since they were painted on the interior of the mold in which the chair was cast. It looks like a party in a chair, even while recalling that failed 1970s painting trend Lyrical Abstraction. 
 Mr. Arad is at his best when he strips down to essentials, whether his forms follow their functions or appear to be abstract. The ''FPE (Fantastic, Plastic, Elastic)'' chair of 1997, another stackable design, is breathtakingly spare. It combines an undulating plane of red plastic with an extruded aluminum frame to achieve an astounding spareness and fluid grace. 
 Unfortunately it is displayed on a high shelf almost out of sight. But its fabrication is detailed on one of the show's many small DVD screens, which also animate the architectural models on view. Occasionally they introduce something that should be in the show, like ''The Table That Eats Chairs'' of 2000. Another feat of economy, it involves bright plastic chairs that fold to mere inches and slide into channels on the underside of the glass table top, freeing up space while adding color to the table.
 There's a similar pleasing economy in certain smaller pieces, like ''Infinity'','' an infinitely expandable wine rack that begins with one delicate plastic stand that holds one bottle of wine in the approved horizontal position. 
 In other instances function disappears, but the user's participation is required. The PizzaKobra lamp presents as a flat (pizza-shape) coil of gleaming metal that unwinds and holds almost any position, with small lights at its end. And Mr. Arad's highly successful tempered-steel Bookworm bookshelves can loop and coil on the wall in any configuration. 
 The most beautiful Bookworm, however, is ''This Mortal Coil,'' a variation that has a set form: its spiral resembles the cross-section of a chambered nautilus, or maybe something from a stage set by Salvador Dali or Isamu Noguchi. Books might ruin it, and I doubt that anyone seriously interested in them could tolerate it for long. But it is maybe Mr. Arad's best sculpture.
 The works that justify Mr. Arad's reputation are scattered a bit too thinly throughout this exhibition. Far too many of the others are not very interesting toys for rich people that do not justify the materials or space they consume. One of Mr. Arad's Lucite chaises has embedded in its center a phrase from Marcel Duchamp that says, ''There is no solution because there is no problem.'' The words mean one thing coming from an ascetic artist who didn't make much art. Given the current state of the world, and coming from a prolific architect-designer-artist like Mr. Arad, it sounds more like ''Let them eat cake.''

HEADLINE: CAR-REBATE PLAN SELLS OUT IN DAYS

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
New-car shoppers appear to have already snapped up all the $1 billion that Congress appropriated for the ''cash for clunkers'' program, leading the Transportation Department to tell auto dealers Thursday night to stop offering the rebates.
 But a White House official said the program had not been suspended, creating confusion about its status. The program offers $3,500 to $4,500 for people who trade in an old car for a new one with higher fuel economy. 
 In a statement issued Thursday evening, Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, said: ''We are working tonight to assess the situation facing what is obviously an incredibly popular program. Auto dealers and consumers should have confidence that all valid CARS transactions that have taken place to date will be honored.'' 
 The program, formally known as the Car Allowance Rebate System, was scheduled to be offered until Nov. 1, or as long as the money was available. But the program was so successful that it has exhausted all the money allocated within the first week. Dealers have submitted applications on behalf of consumers seeking rebates on about a quarter-million vehicles. 
 The National Automobile Dealers Association surveyed its members in recent days and warned the Transportation Department on Thursday that it had a very large backlog of applications, said Bailey Wood, a spokesman for the association. 
 Late in the day, the group said the Transportation Department had responded by telling it to stop taking applications at midnight. The government and the dealers were concerned that buyers would close trade-in deals to buy new cars assuming they had a big rebate coming only to discover later that money was not available. 
 The dealers' group said late Thursday night that it had not heard about the White House policy reversing the decision. Mr. Wood said that his group would ask Congress and the White House to add money to the plan.
 Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood has already been making calls to members of Congress, telling them about the situation. The Michigan delegation was planning a meeting Friday morning to discuss the situation, a Congressional aide said. 
 On Thursday evening, the government Web site describing the program, www.cars.gov, still showed a chart shaped like a fuel gauge that indicated $779 million was available for trade-ins of cars and light trucks. Earlier Thursday, the Transportation Department issued a news release that said that applications for fewer than 23,000 vehicles had been submitted as of Wednesday, with a rebate value of just under $100 million.
 The Transportation Department had begun accepting applications for the rebates on Monday, when rules putting the program in place took effect. But car dealers had been accumulating the applications since July 1, when Congress put the law into effect. 
 The program had two goals: aiding the ailing car industry and improving fuel economy of the vehicles on the road. 
 Cars submitted under the program were to be junked. They had to be less than 25 years old and have a fuel economy, as rated by the window sticker, of 18 miles a gallon or less. 
 The size of the rebate depended on the fuel economy of the replacement vehicle. Consumers were also supposed to receive the scrap value of their trade-ins.
 From the dealers' point of view, the program was a resounding success.
 ''Two hundred and fifty thousand vehicles in four weeks?'' Mr. Wood said. ''One word comes out of my mouth: Wow.'' 
 As word spread unofficially on Thursday night, car dealers were suddenly unsure of what to tell would-be buyers. 
 A Ford dealership in Paramus, N.J., did not know of the apparent suspension until a reporter called seeking comment. 
 Other dealers said they had no idea what the status of the program was, or whether the deals that they had already signed would be honored by the government. Some said they were notified by e-mail message by fellow dealers.
 The dealers' association, however, had been warning that the money would go quickly.
 Under the program, a buyer who picked a car with a mileage improvement of more than four miles per gallon but less than 10 were eligible for $3,500; a buyer whose new vehicle was rated 10 miles per gallon or better than the old one was eligible for $4,500. 
 Until the cash-for-clunkers program began, the auto industry had been on track for annual sales of about 10 million units, down from the peak of about 16 million units a year.

HEADLINE: Markets, Buoyed by News, Rise to Year's Highest Close

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Upbeat earnings news and a decline in the number of people receiving unemployment benefits helped lift stock markets on Thursday to their best finish this year and their highest levels since last fall. 
 Nearly every major market was in the black. Stocks rose modestly in Asia, closed nearly 2 percent higher in Europe and were up in Latin America, from Mexico to Brazil. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index almost reached 1,000 points, while the Nasdaq index, which is up 26 percent for the year, rose to its highest point since October.
 Near the end of the day, the markets gave up some of their gains and closed below those benchmarks.
 ''The negatives have been diminishing, but the positives haven't taken hold,'' said Bill Schultz, chief investment officer at McQueen, Ball & Associates. ''I don't think anyone is pounding the drums about a new growth spurt taking place in the near term.''
 Still, the performance was a shift from a few recent days of listless trading. Thursday's gains extended a three-week surge that has lifted global markets more than 10 percent. 
 Positive earnings news, analyst upgrades and economic figures ignited the move. 
 MasterCard, the BT Group and Visa reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings, while the mobile phone company Motorola posted a profit after analysts had predicted a loss. Alcatel-Lucent, the French-American telecommunications company, posted a quarterly profit for the first time since it was created nearly three years ago. A Goldman Sachs analyst upgraded General Electric. And the government said that the number of people on the unemployment rolls fell by 132,000 for the week ended July 18.
 First-time jobless claims rose by 25,000, to a seasonally adjusted 584,000 last week. 
 All sectors of the market ended in positive territory on Thursday, led by industries and big banks. Investors bought into companies that make basic materials like chemicals and metals as the price of oil, copper and gasoline bounced back from losses a day earlier.
 The Dow Jones industrial average was up 83.74 points, or 0.92 percent, at 9,154.46, while the S.& P. 500 rose 1.19 percent, or 11.60 points, to 986.75. The Nasdaq was up 0.84 percent, or 16.54 points at 1,984.30. 
 Oil prices also rose, settling at $66.94 a barrel, up $3.59 on the day, and reversing almost all of their losses from a day earlier. Shares of the oil giant Exxon Mobil fell 1 percent, to $70.72, after it reported a 66 percent decline in profits. 
 As lending rates among banks continue to fall and interest rates on corporate bonds settle, volatility is easing out of the markets, and more investors are being enticed to buy, analysts said. The economy is still struggling, and unemployment is expected to reach at least 10 percent by 2010, but many investors are buying stocks. 
 The Treasury's 10-year note rose 13/32, to 96 1/32. The yield fell to 3.61 percent, from 3.66 percent late Wednesday.
 Following are the results of Thursday's Treasury auction of seven-year notes:

HEADLINE: Lender Sues Annie Leibovitz, Seeking Her Homes to Pay $24 Million Debt

BYLINE: By ALLEN SALKIN

 BODY:
An art finance company that lent Annie Leibovitz $24 million against the rights to her photographs and properties has filed a lawsuit asking a judge to order her to allow real estate agents into her homes in Greenwich Village and Rhinebeck, N.Y., so they can be sold to pay her debts.
 As part of the suit filed in State Supreme Court on Wednesday, the company, the Art Capital Group, produced a contract that appeared to show that Ms. Leibovitz agreed to allow the company to sell her homes and the rights to every photo she had ever taken. 
 The suit charges that Ms. Leibovitz has engaged in ''boldly deceptive conduct'' and failed to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars due under her agreements with Art Capital and a subsidiary, American Photo.
 Ms. Leibovitz approached Art Capital, which is based in Manhattan, in June 2008, concerning her ''dire financial condition'' arising from ''mortgage obligations, tax liens and unpaid bills to service providers and other creditors,'' the suit alleges.
 Ms. Leibovitz reportedly earns $3 million a year for her magazine work for Vanity Fair and Vogue and tens of thousands of dollars daily for commercial shoots.
 But she appears to have experienced financial challenges, facing a lengthy and litigious renovation on three adjoining town houses she bought on West 11th Street in Manhattan, federal and state tax liens of more than $1.4 million, and lawsuits from a lighting company and a stylist she had hired, asking for a total of more than $700,000. 
 A spokesman for Ms. Leibovitz, Matthew Hiltzik, said the claims in the lawsuit were not true. ''This is part of Art Capital's continued harassment and attention-getting efforts,'' he said. ''There has been tension and dispute since the beginning. Annie is in the same shoes as many other people involved with Art Capital. For now, her attention remains on her photography and on continuing to organize her finances.''
 Art Capital, with headquarters in the former Sotheby's building on Madison Avenue, specializes in lending money with art as collateral, functioning as a high-end pawnshop that specializes in fine art and offers loans at interest rates generally from 6 percent to 16 percent.
 Art Capital and Ms. Leibovitz set up a one-year credit agreement for $22 million, starting in September 2008, the suit alleges. At that time, she withdrew $5 million from the credit line and, according to the suit, acknowledged that her ''fine art, intellectual property and real estate assets, all collateral for the loan, would likely need to be sold in whole or in part'' as part of her financial restructuring.
 In December, Ms. Leibovitz entered into another agreement with Art Capital and its subsidiary, which increased her credit line to $24 million and lowered her interest rate. In exchange, she signed a sales agreement that authorized Art Capital to sell the rights to her photographs and her homes, and to collect a commission on those sales, the suit alleges. The proceeds of such a sale would be used to pay back the $24 million Ms. Leibovitz had by then taken out, and to pay off fees and commissions to Art Capital, with anything left over to go to the photographer.
 Since then, Ms. Leibovitz has refused to cooperate with Art Capital's efforts to sell her photographs and property, the suit charges. She has not allowed real estate agents engaged by Art Capital into her homes for the purpose of appraising their value and showing them to potential buyers, according to the suit.
 Art Capital is asking the court to declare that its agreements with Ms. Leibovitz are in effect, compelling the photographer to provide access to her homes, and that she is in breach of contract.
 The suit charges that Ms. Leibovitz has stated she will not cooperate with Art Capital in the sale of the rights to her photographs, a position that the suit claims is ''nonsensical,'' given that the company has obtained appraisals for the collection exceeding the loan amount. 
 The credit line expires Sept. 8, at which time the $24 million is due in full with any unpaid interest, fees and expenses, the suit alleges.

HEADLINE: In an Industrial Belgian City, an Immigrant's Brutal Dilemma

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
''Lorna's Silence'' is the new film written and directed by Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, Belgian brothers whose highly recognizable, frequently imitated style has won them recognition nearly everywhere in the world. A predictable but unfortunate exception is the United States, where the audience for challenging movies from other countries seems to shrink by the month. Mention of the Dardennes, which elsewhere might elicit a nod of the head, is here more likely to be met with furrowed brows.
 But their fictional features, fixtures of the Cannes Film Festival (where two, ''Rosetta'' and ''The Child,'' have won the top prize, in 1999 and 2005), are similar enough in method and mood that ''Lorna's Silence'' is as good a place as any to make or renew their acquaintance. Its setting is a rough industrial city in the gritty Francophone part of Belgium -- Liege, in this case, rather than Seraing, the Dardennes' hometown. Their preferred social milieu is still the gray zone between the traditional proletariat and a new underclass that includes immigrants, petty criminals and hard-pressed, respectable workers trying to maintain a sense of decency and continuity in their lives. 
 Like other Dardenne films, ''Lorna's Silence'' has no musical soundtrack and an abundance of rough, ground-level, close-up camerawork. But if the Dardennes are realists, they are also moralists. They compose fables of ethical difficulty with religious overtones that seem to grow more explicit with each new movie. ''The Son'' (2002) carried Christian implications in its title, its theme of forgiveness and the vocation of its protagonist, a teacher of carpentry. ''Lorna's Silence,'' with a narrative that turns partly on a mysterious pregnancy, evokes, subtly but unmistakably, a range of maternal biblical associations not limited to the tale of the Nativity.
 Though there is a whiff of mysticism -- or perhaps of grace -- in the wind, the atmosphere is dominated by the harsh materialism of the modern cash economy. Everything is for sale: sex, honor, dignity, life. Lorna (Arta Dobroshi), an Albanian immigrant, has a menial, more or less legitimate job in dry cleaning, but she is also ensnared in a shady underground cash nexus. Her boyfriend, Sokol (Alban Ukaj), is an itinerant worker who comes to see her when his travels permit. Lorna has secured legal residency in Belgium through her sham marriage to a drug addict named Claudy (Jeremie Renier). 
 Lorna's organized-crime-connected sponsors have paid off Claudy and now plan to dispose of him so that Lorna can marry a Russian crime boss who needs papers. The idea, to which Lorna agrees, is to help Claudy overdose, but he complicates matters by starting, under her influence, to clean up his act. Lorna's predicament is thus stark and brutal: a practical dilemma that is also a spiritual crisis. She is pinned between financial debt and human obligation, and trapped by a combination of self-interest, fear and highly inconvenient compassion.
 Though their films resonate with a deep concern for the poor and the marginalized, and a quiet outrage at the pitiless aspects of capitalism, the Dardennes are hardly determinists. Like the young thief played by Mr. Renier in ''The Child'' or the factory worker in ''Rosetta,'' Lorna is at once a victim of circumstance and a free agent. Impossible situations do not remove the necessity of individual choice, and Lorna is worth caring about not because she is an emblem of innocent suffering, but because she is stubborn, willful and capable of taking action.
 Ms. Dobroshi, with a wary, diffident pout that conveys both fragility and ruthless decisiveness, is not someone you will soon forget. There is nothing abstract about Lorna's plight, even if it can also be taken as a symbol of the alienation and degradation that threaten millions in a postindustrial, globalized economic order. Her humanity makes her abrasive and off-putting as well as pitiable and potentially tragic.
 ''Lorna's Silence'' is engrossing and powerful, which may be just another way of saying it's a film by the Dardenne brothers. If it falls a bit short of the standards of their best work, that is only because it is not quite a masterpiece. At least three of their other nondocumentary features come close to that status -- ''Rosetta,'' ''The Son'' and ''The Child''-- and that is partly because their literary and narrative conceits are almost completely absorbed into their presentation of life as it happens. These films seem, when you first encounter them, like facts, with the adamantine gravity of stones or trees, and only later does an appreciation of their careful, crafty artifice seep in.
 ''Lorna's Silence,'' in contrast, seems from the outset more determined, more plot driven, more written. The Dardennes' other films have won prizes for acting and overall excellence at Cannes, but this one was singled out last year for its screenplay, which is very good but which is also perhaps too much in evidence. Every fictional character, of course, is controlled by an external force, but in this case the reversals and surprises in the narrative undermine our crucial sense of Lorna's autonomy, and of her solitude. 
 Only great filmmakers could provoke disappointment by making a movie that is slightly less than great, and ''Lorna's Silence'' is, precisely because of its limitations, a more accessible and less austere experience than ''Rosetta'' or ''The Son.'' It's the closest thing to a crowd pleaser that these rigorous, demanding and profoundly humane artists are likely to make.
 ''Lorna's Silence'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sex, nudity, violence and drug use.

HEADLINE: Merck Selling Stake in Animal Venture

BYLINE: By NATASHA SINGER

 BODY:
The drug giant Merck said Thursday it would sell its stake in a big animal-health joint venture for $4 billion -- but with a side deal that could eventually let the company create an even bigger version of the same business. 
 Under the agreement, Merck is selling its share of Merial to the big European drug maker Sanofi-Aventis. Merial is a leader in the rapidly growing business of medicines for livestock and pets. 
 Merial had revenue of about $2.6 billion last year, including about $1 billion in sales of Frontline, a treatment that protects animals against fleas and ticks. Merial, based in Duluth, Ga., operates in more than 150 countries and has about 5,400 employees worldwide.
 Merck is selling its Merial stake to help clear a path for its planned merger with Schering-Plough. Schering has its own, even bigger animal health business called Intervet/Schering-Plough. Regulators have indicated that owning Intervet and half of Merial would make the combined Merck-Schering too dominant in the animal health market. Intervet had sales last year of $2.97 billion.
 But then there is that side deal with Sanofi. Under a separate agreement that would take effect after completion of the Merck-Schering merger, which is expected later this year, Sanofi would have the option to combine Merial with Intervet in a joint venture -- with the new Merck entity as its partner. 
 That Merial-Intervet venture, if it can win approval from antitrust authorities in the United States and Europe, would create the world leader in medications and vaccines for animals. 
 ''It will be the No. 1 animal health company,'' said Tim Evans, the managing director of Vetnosis, a research and consulting firm in Edinburgh, Scotland, that specializes in animal health and veterinary medicine. The combined business would have nearly 30 percent of the worldwide animal health market, he said.
 For drug makers, animal health products offer strong growth potential, with global sales rising 7.2 percent last year, to $19.2 billion, Mr. Evans said. By contrast, sales of human prescription drugs in the United States grew 1.3 percent, to $291 billion, according to IMS Health, a health care information company.
 Animal health has always been a natural fit for pharmaceutical companies, both in terms of product development and manufacturing. And now, with an increased worldwide demand for protein from farmed livestock, and concerns over a safe food supply, animal vaccines have become a more important asset for drug companies. 
 Moreover, because there are no insurers or national health officials trying to keep costs down, companies can set their own prices for animal medicines -- products that are bought directly by veterinarians and the owners of pets or livestock. 
 Animal health products ''were traditionally the stepchild of the pharmaceutical industry because they had lower margins,'' said David S. Moskowitz, chief of equity research at Caris & Company. ''Now they are the crown jewels, because they are growing faster than traditional pharmaceuticals.'' 
 As part of the option agreement, the value of Merial has been fixed at $8 billion. Merck's contribution of Intervet to the joint venture would be valued at a minimum of $9.25 billion. If the companies were to join Merial and Intervet, Sanofi would make a payment to create an equal ownership stake.
 Industry analysts are also examining another potential animal health juggernaut, this one that would result from the impending merger of Pfizer with Wyeth. Pfizer's animal health business had sales last year of about $2.8 billion, while Wyeth had worldwide sales of animal health products of about $1 billion. Pfizer has said it plans to divest some animal health assets to gain regulatory approval for the Wyeth merger. 
 Even so, the potential Merial-Intervet joint venture, considered along with the combined Pfizer and Wyeth businesses, would account for half of global animal health sales, said Mr. Evans of Vetnosis. ''The animal health industry will be highly concentrated with two behemoths, and the other players will be relatively small,'' he said. 
 Bayer, with annual sales in animal health of about $1.3 billion, for example, would then become the No. 3 player in the market, he said, but at less than one-quarter the size of a combined Merial-Intervet. ''With such a highly concentrated market, it is going to be very difficult for other players.''

HEADLINE: Dow Posts Loss, but Its Shares Rise

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The Dow Chemical Companyposted a quarterly loss on Thursday, but its shares rallied as the company's cost-cutting efforts helped offset a decline in sales. 
 Dow did not give a specific outlook for the rest of the year, except to say it expected demand for its products -- which fell in the last two years -- to recover.
 ''The United States economy has found bottom, but will be slow in recovering as unemployment continues to be a drag on consumer spending,'' Andrew N. Liveris, Dow's chief executive and chairman, said.
 Dow reported a second-quarter net loss of $435 million, or 47 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $24 million, or 3 cents a share. Sales fell 31 percent, to $11.32 billion. 
 Excluding charges and preferred dividends, the company earned 5 cents a share. The results were the first to include the performance of Rohm & Haas, a specialty chemical maker that Dow acquired in April for more than $16 billion.

HEADLINE: It May Be Outrageous, but Wall Street Pay Didn't Cause This Crisis

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
There is a lot about Wall Street pay to make the rest of us livid, or at least jealous. And now Congress seems poised to act on it.
 The House of Representatives is expected to pass on Friday a bill to empower regulators to change what the bill's sponsor, Barney Frank, calls ''imprudently risky compensation practices'' on Wall Street.
Other companies will have to face regular shareholder votes on pay, although the votes will be nonbinding, and board compensation committees will have to jump through more hoops.
 The big winners will be compensation consultants, for whom there are likely to be more jobs available as conflicts of interest force companies to hire more consultants. 
 I doubt all of this will hurt very much, unlike the last Congressional stab at doing something about excessive executive pay, passed when Jimmy Carter was president. That led to soaring pay and some of the abuses that now outrage people.
 But neither will it do much good.
 It is galling to see executives making tens of millions of dollars for running companies that have to be bailed out by taxpayers, but there is little evidence that big pay -- or the incentives connected to it -- caused the financial train wreck that sent the world into recession.
 To the contrary, there is plenty of evidence that no one who counted -- traders, chief executives or regulators -- understood the risks that were being taken.
 A new study shows that banks run by chief executives with a lot of stock were, if anything, likely to do worse than other banks in the crisis.
 ''Bank C.E.O. incentives cannot be blamed for the credit crisis or for the performance of banks during the crisis,'' states the study, by Rene Stulz, an Ohio State University finance professor, and Rudiger Fahlenbrach of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology.
 ''A plausible explanation for these findings is that C.E.O.'s focused on the interests of their shareholders in the build-up to the crisis and took actions that they believed the market would welcome,'' Mr. Stulz said.
 The chief executives were wrong, of course. Most lost tens of millions of dollars in equity value but sold few shares before the crisis hit. 
 Whatever else they lacked, they had plenty of incentive to keep their banks from failing.
 But those incentives did not matter when they should have. Bankers and regulators believed in the ''Great Moderation,'' a term popularized by Ben Bernanke, then a member and now the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, in a 2004 speech.
 Thanks in part to ''improvements in monetary policy,'' Mr. Bernanke said, without excessive modesty, there had been ''a reduction in the extent of economic uncertainty confronting households and firms.'' Recessions, he added, ''have become less frequent and less severe.''
 Bankers were not the only ones who concluded that the chances of a very bad outcome were exceedingly low. As year after year went by with nothing very bad happening, they saw no reason not to borrow more and more money to place what they deemed to be safe bets.
 It may be worth noting that, of the 98 financial companies studied by Professors Stulz and Fahlenbrach, the one with the most valuable holdings of stock and options in his company at the end of 2006 was Richard Fuld of Lehman Brothers. His holdings, now worthless, were valued at $1 billion.
 I had lunch with Mr. Fuld in early 2008, after the financial crisis was under way and less than eight months before Lehman failed. The conversation was off the record, but I am sure he had no inkling of the how great were the risks Lehman faced as a leader in the mortgage securitization business.
 He was later raked over the coals in Congressional hearings about his huge compensation. That most of it was in stock and options that he never cashed in seemed to be something most legislators could not comprehend. 
 As Congress moves to do something about executive pay, it is worth asking what would have happened if Mr. Fuld had somehow realized in 2005 that the mortgage business was a time bomb and had gotten Lehman out of it. Within a year, its profits would have sagged and its share price collapsed. Mr. Fuld would have been labeled a dunce, and might have lost his job. The same can be said of Jimmy Cayne of Bear Stearns and Stan O'Neal of Merrill Lynch, the two runners-up in the richest bank C.E.O. sweepstakes of 2006.
 President Obama has proposed legislation to deal with many aspects of the financial crisis, and it is no surprise that this bill is the one that seems to be having the easiest road to passage, even though every Republican voted against it in the House Financial Services Committee. The banks probably realize it won't make much difference and are doing their most intensive lobbying elsewhere.
 I asked Professor Stulz what he thought of the bill. ''It is hard to believe that regulators will be better at devising compensation plans with proper incentives,'' he said. ''Properly designed capital requirements are a much more efficient approach to regulate the risk of financial institutions than fiddling with compensation.'' 
 Indeed, much of the financial ''innovation'' of recent years consisted of bankers coming up with ways to evade capital requirements. The regulators are now trying to deal with that, but their efforts are handicapped by bankers warning that they will maker fewer loans if capital rules are tightened.
 That said, the bill could help some. The Sarbanes-Oxley law, passed in 2002, does seem to have resulted in board audit committees taking their jobs much more seriously. It would be good if the same happened at compensation committees. Perhaps it will do some good to tie compensation to long-term results, or to force executives to hold stock rather than sell it quickly when options vest.
 Still, as Alan Blinder, the Princeton economist and former vice chairman of the Fed, wrote recently in The Wall Street Journal: ''The executives, lawyers and accountants who design compensation systems are imaginative, skilled and definitely not disinterested. Congress and government bureaucrats won't beat them at this game.''
 The last time Congress took action in response to populist outrage at executive pay, it changed tax laws to bar salaries of more than $1 million from being deducted as corporate expenses. Payments based on performance could still be deducted.
 The result was not what Congress intended. At large companies, $1 million soon became a floor, not a ceiling, for the boss's salary. Bonus and stock option plans proliferated to take advantage of the ''performance-based'' loophole. Eventually, we got to the oxymoron of ''guaranteed bonuses.''
 Since most of their promised compensation was in the form of bonuses, Wall Streeters could not understand why people thought they should not be paid just because their firms had to be bailed out. A promise is a promise, they said.
 We can hope that this bill will have fewer unintended consequences. But even if Mr. Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, is right to call it ''the first step towards comprehensive financial regulatory reform,'' there will have to be much larger steps taken to reach that goal.

HEADLINE: In India, New Crusade on Corruption

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
When Ashwani Kumar took over as India's top anticorruption official last year, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, his new boss, advised him, ''Follow the righteous path.'' 
 Yet the job before him had frustrated many others. India ranks 85th in a corruption perception index created by the nonprofit antigraft group Transparency International, worse than China, Mexico or Brazil.
 Mr. Kumar, 58, a career policeman and director of the Central Bureau of Investigation, has taken his Sisyphean task head on. In just a few months, he has heightened the visibility of India's fight against complex corporate crimes and enlisted public support for his programs to battle corruption in the government. 
 Most notably, his agency's business investigative skills gained acclaim internationally, after the founder and chairman of one of India's largest information technology companies, Satyam Computer Systems, confessed to falsifying $1 billion in cash on its balance sheet in January, India's largest and broadest modern fraud. 
 Just 45 days after taking the case, the Central Bureau of Investigation had charged six people and produced a thorough account of how investigators suspected the fraud had occurred, based on hundreds of interviews and backed by thousands of pages of documents. The bureau even described the minutiae of the accounting tricks and dual-invoicing tactics used to commit the fraud. 
 In contrast, the United States Department of Justice took years to put together a compelling case against top executives of Enron, the now-bankrupt energy company. The comparison may not be completely parallel, because a confession revealed the fraud at Satyam. But the scale of the accounting scheme has led analysts and academics to label Satyam ''India's Enron.''
 Sudhakar V. Balachandran, an assistant professor of accounting at Columbia Business School, said the United States could learn a lot from India's rapid response to Satyam. 
 Foreign investors ''know that swift decisive actions were taken,'' Mr. Balachandran said. ''If I'm an investor looking at an emerging market, I'm going to look for signs that it functions well.'' That includes undertaking a swift criminal investigation at the first sign of corruption or fraud, he said.
 Some rights advocates say that the bureau has been overzealous and has ignored due process. Under the bureau's guidance, two of Satyam's outside auditors have been in jail for seven months without trial, held on charges of criminal conspiracy. They have been denied bail, even though they maintain their innocence and have yet to be convicted of any crime. Mr. Kumar's office, however, contends that their incarceration is justified.
 Beyond Satyam, Mr. Kumar has big ambitions for the bureau. With just 5,000 agents, it is less than half the size of its closest American equivalent, the F.B.I., although India's population is more than four times that of the United States. But India's bureau is trying new ways to fight graft and bribery that may help make up for what it lacks in numbers. 
 For example, the bureau is embarking on a countrywide campaign to curb corruption that enlists support from the public by asking for people to use their cellphones to text in details of corruption. 
 Economic growth, increasing industrialization and globalization mean that economic crime is rising, Mr. Kumar said. ''Traditional crimes are fading into the background'' in favor of digital crimes and credit card fraud, he said. 
 Since Mr. Kumar took office, the bureau has arrested dozens of bank managers, bureaucrats, engineers and contractors on suspicion of crimes including accepting bribes, forging documents and stealing petroleum. A recent investigation into top officials at the All India Council for Technical Education, a group created by the government to improve the vocational skills of India's youth, uncovered 36 bank accounts that were used to hide illicit cash. 
 At a meeting this year with private sector bankers, Mr. Kumar pledged that the bureau would act as a ''facilitator in the growth of the financial sector,'' by curbing something that United States regulators had failed to stop -- mortgage fraud and risky lending.
 Mr. Kumar seems at first like an unlikely crusader against complex financial fraud. He spent much of his 35-year career in the forests of the mountainous state of Himachal Pradesh, fighting illegal logging and poaching. But he quickly rose through the ranks of India's civil service, becoming director general of police in the state. His success there caught the eye of the Singh administration.
 The law has played a big role in the Kumar family. His father was a policeman, and he is married to the daughter of a policeman.
 Discussing respect for the environment gets him fired up, and he is thrilled to point out that the bureau's new headquarters will be a ''green'' building. His office is spotless, he is scrupulously polite and he sticks to a rigorous schedule that involves waking at 4 a.m. for two hours of work, then an hour of exercise. 
 Mr. Kumar says his prominent cases have earned him enemies. And he cautions that the bureau cannot halt corruption on its own. The bureau deals with the investigation, ''but the punishment is given by the courts,'' he said.
 And he willingly acknowledges that corruption sometimes occurs within the bureau.
 ''Human beings are always frail, and such incidents do happen,'' he said. ''The question is, 'Do we tolerate this kind of behavior?' The answer is, 'Absolutely no.' '' 
 Corruption specialists say that his fight can be effective, even if he is surrounded by a corrupt system. 
 ''One person can make a difference, just as all leaders can make a difference,'' said Christiaan Poortman, global programs director for Transparency International. In Mr. Kumar's case, his anticorruption efforts may bear fruit, Mr. Poortman said.
 ''If he has the ear of the prime minister, who knows? It might work,'' Mr. Poortman added.

HEADLINE: Walt Disney Says Profit Fell 26% In Quarter

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
If the Walt Disney Company, with its vast theme park operations and television advertising business, is a bellwether for swaths of the economy, third-quarter earnings do not bode well for a recovery.
 Profit at Disney, the world's largest media company, declined 26 percent for its fiscal third quarter, hurt by soft advertising sales at ABC and ESPN and drooping consumer spending at Disney World.
 The immediate prospects of both divisions remain a question mark, with major advertisers sitting on the sidelines for the fall season at ABC and fourth-quarter resort reservations running behind last year despite steep discounting. 
 ''We do see signs of economic stability, but the pace and certainty remain uncertain,'' said Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive. 
 The company also continued to suffer from a creative slump at its film studio. Walt Disney Pictures is struggling with declining DVD sales because titles like ''Bedtime Stories'' and ''Confessions of a Shopaholic'' have been duds. Even the smash success of Pixar's ''Up'' was not enough: the unit lost $12 million in the quarter, compared with a profit of $97 million in the year-earlier period.
 Thomas O. Staggs, chief financial officer, said the studio was also hurt by production costs for ''G-Force,'' a live action-animated hybrid about gun-toting guinea pigs that opened No. 1 at the box office last weekend. Mr. Staggs described the movie as ''very expensive,'' but declined to specify its budget.
 Over all, Disney's net income fell to $954 million, or 51 cents a share, from $1.28 billion, or 66 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Revenue fell 7 percent, to $8.6 billion. Earnings per share for the current quarter included a one-cent restructuring charge related to an accounting gain. Excluding that charge, Disney narrowly beat Wall Street's expectations.
 Mr. Iger, speaking on a conference call to analysts on Thursday afternoon, tried to focus attention on promising offerings ahead. At the film studio in particular, he emphasized three live-action movies: a 3-D version of ''A Christmas Carol'' starring Jim Carrey in four roles, Tim Burton's ''Alice in Wonderland,'' and ''Prince of Persia'' from Jerry Bruckheimer.
 Mr. Iger said he was ''very excited'' about ABC's fall schedule, singling out the time-warp drama ''Flash Forward'' for praise. The network hopes the series, which is being produced internally, will become the successor to ''Lost,'' which is entering its sixth and final season.
 Disney, looking to its parks division for growth, last month reached an agreement with the Hong Kong government for a $500 million expansion.
 For now, though, the recession is still taking a toll. Profit at the parks dropped 19 percent, to $521 million. Revenue was down 9 percent, to $2.8 billion, despite the benefit of the Easter holiday falling in the quarter this year.
 At media networks, a division that includes ABC and ESPN, profit declined 13 percent, to $1.3 billion. Revenue dipped 2 percent, to $4 billion. At ESPN, certain affiliate fees tied to programming thresholds will come in the fourth quarter this year, the company said, making apples-to-apples comparisons for the unit difficult.

HEADLINE: House Bucks President On Spending for Military

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The House on Thursday approved President Obama's plan to kill the F-22 fighter jet. But Democratic leaders bucked White House veto threats on other programs, and they heatedly rejected a Republican effort to strip more than 550 earmarked expenditures from the $636 billion military bill.
 Mr. Obama and other political leaders had hailed last week's vote in the Senate to cancel the F-22 as a sign of their progress in changing military spending practices. 
 But in sometimes tense exchanges on the House floor on Thursday, two Republicans, Representatives Jeff Flake of Arizona and John Campbell of California, sought to embarrass some other representatives and to suggest that little had changed in how Congress pushes pet military projects.
 While the House voted 269 to 165 to approve an amendment that stripped out money for building more F-22s, it overwhelmingly rejected efforts by Mr. Flake and Mr. Campbell to cut up to $2.7 billion in earmarks, including money that lawmakers had inserted on behalf of specific companies on 553 smaller projects.
 The bill also included more than $1 billion to continue work on larger projects the administration wants to kill, like a new presidential helicopter, and nearly $1.2 billion for combat planes that the Pentagon did not request. 
 But in an echo of the Republican accusations of pork-barrel spending in the huge economic stimulus package this year, much of the debate on the military bill focused on earmarks like $1.5 million for a gunshot-detection system and $8 million for a project to upgrade torpedo capabilities.
 Mr. Flake said $200 million of the earmarks were requested by companies that had been clients of the PMA Group, a lobbying firm that is under investigation over its ties to several congressmen, including Representative John P. Murtha, the influential Pennsylvania Democrat who was in charge of the bill.
 Mr. Flake, a longtime critic of earmarks, said some of the companies had performed poorly on government work. He also said many of the companies had raised substantial amounts of campaign money for Mr. Murtha and others legislators, including Republicans, who sponsored their projects. 
 ''That simply doesn't look right,'' Mr. Flake said, adding that the House ''ought to want to have a higher standard.'' 
 Mr. Murtha, who put together the bill as the chairman of the House military appropriations subcommittee, defended the practice and lashed out at Mr. Flake.
 Mr. Murtha said he had long sought earmarks as a way to create jobs in Pennsylvania. He said the state had sent a disproportionate number of soldiers to Iraq and Afghanistan compared with the level of military contracts it had typically received.
 He said that he had an obligation to bring work to the small businesses in his area and that some of the earmarks, like $2.2 million for body-armor research, grew out of his visits with troops in Afghanistan and with wounded troops in hospitals. 
 ''I'm not sure how often Mr. Flake goes to the hospital,'' Mr. Murtha said. 
 Mr. Murtha, who was visibly angry, said several times that the bill included language instructing the Pentagon to seek competitive bids on the earmarked projects, and other lawmakers noted that Congress has the final say on spending decisions.
 But Mr. Flake said that in the past, most companies that had sought the earmarks ended up with the contracts.
 The overall bill, which would set military appropriations for 2010, passed by 400 to 30. The Senate will take up its version later this year, and the two bills will need to be reconciled in conference.
 Mr. Obama had repeatedly threatened to veto any bill that included more money for the F-22, the world's most advanced fighter, as the Pentagon seeks to shift more from high-tech weaponry to simpler systems the troops can use now. 
 After the Senate voted 58 to 40 last week to cancel the F-22, Mr. Murtha decided to give up the fight for it as well. He offered the amendment on Thursday that removed $369 million for parts, which had been meant to be a down payment toward 12 more planes. 
 The administration has also received support from Congress to scale back a $160 billion Army modernization plan and other programs.
 But the White House warned this week that the president's advisers would consider recommending a veto if the House went ahead with plans -- as it did Thursday -- to try to save the troubled effort to create a new presidential helicopter and to finance development of an alternative engine for another new fighter plane, the F-35.
 After Thursday's vote, Tommy Vietor, a White House spokesman, said the president had asked for a review of the House bill, including the earmarks. 
 Mr. Vietor said that over all, Congressional spending bills included 25 percent fewer earmarks this year than last year.
 Still, he said, ''We knew from the start that changing the old ways of Washington would not happen overnight.''

HEADLINE: Are We What We Search?

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
Ancient Greece had the Oracle at Delphi. The Shang dynasty had oracle bones. Contemporary America has Google.
 Earlier this month, Lawrence Summers, President Obama's top economic adviser, unveiled a new class of tea leaf to gauge the direction of the American economy: Google searches. The number of queries for ''Great Depression,'' which surged earlier in the year, had declined sharply, Mr. Summers noted. Economic anxiety is abating. The economy is probably turning the corner. 
 It was not the first time Google was invoked to show us the way. The company has a tool to track the path of the flu virus by looking at geographic trends in Internet queries for related terms. A study by Google researchers suggested search patterns could be used to track everything from home sales to the popularity of tourist destinations, and add to the accuracy of forecasts for new-home starts and car sales.
 Polling has long been used by marketers and politicians to detect shifts in fashion and policy. Surveys of consumer confidence play a major role in economic forecasting. Economists have also tried to marshal collective wisdom with ''prediction markets,'' where people's bets on all sorts of things are distilled into a remarkably accurate forecast. (Punters on Intrade.com, by the way, think there is a 75 percent chance that the economy will grow in the third quarter, but only a 12 percent chance that it grew in the second.)
 Still, there is something new and mysterious about the high-tech oracle. Polls are a useful indicator of people's tastes because they ask people what they like. Prediction markets require players to forecast. Google searches offer a roundabout impression of the world: what people want, what they fear, what they expect. It's harder to tell what they mean.
 What was going on when searches for terms related to suicide jumped fivefold last November? Was it the recession? Were people looking for techniques? Maybe it was the proximity of Christmas. 
 The number of searches for terms about depression in the economics category peaked in February, but so did searches about recovery. Anxiety about a Great Depression has abated since then, as Mr. Summers suggested. So has interest in the term ''dead cat bounce.'' But in June and July people became very interested in a ''double dip'' recession.
 For all the uncertainty about the meaning of Google's statistics, using them to help make the case that the economy is turning the corner might be a shrewd move. We might not know exactly what they signify, but they can provide any economic forecast with a populist cover.

HEADLINE: The Health Debate, at a Fever Pitch

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''New Poll Finds Growing Unease on Health Plan'' (front page, July 30): 
 We should be ashamed of ourselves for allowing the message of those who are driven by the powerful insurance lobby, and those who oppose the president's plan for purely political reasons, to shape our opinions. 
 They have offered no alternatives to the president's health care reform plan, and in fact have done nothing except muddy the waters of reasonable logic with relentless, misleading and scary commentary and whisper campaigns, often verging on outright nuttiness. 
 If we can't see through that for what it is, especially after the last eight frightening years, we deserve whatever pathetic health care reform rises from the ashes. 
 In November, we voted for change, and we got it, and it can be said that in many ways, it is not the same old government of the last eight years. Unfortunately, it is the electorate that remains the same -- susceptible to fear tactics and misleading innuendo. When will we ever learn?
 Patricia A. Weller Westminster, Md., July 30, 2009
 To the Editor:
 The public sentiments that threaten health care reform may be traced to President Obama's failure to deal with a 30-year legacy of market fundamentalism that has dominated our public discourse since Ronald Reagan's first presidential campaign. 
 In the context of this legacy, it comes as little surprise that Americans see government as the problem rather than as the solution and that they want to remain ''free to choose'' their health care options. These are core elements in the antigovernment ideology ushered in by the Reagan Revolution.
 Mr. Obama would have been better served by a series of small wins on energy, the environment and education that would build confidence in the efficacy of government before he tackled the largest social reform since the New Deal.

 The writer is a professor at the Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy, University at Albany, SUNY.
 To the Editor:
 There is no wealth without health. We spend the most on health in the West, yet have among the worst health outcomes.
 What the poll reflects is the administration's failure on two levels: first, the rapidity of presenting such a complex issue, and the lack of a lengthy nationwide educational campaign that informs the American people as to its content and costs while proactively addressing the sound bites adopted by Republicans and their allied health care industry that have derailed past reform attempts.
 President Obama should deliver an Oval Office address admitting these shortcomings, delaying health care reform to next year given his full plate, regroup and undertake a national campaign to garner grass-roots support and make health reform an election issue for Congress. He must insist on a public health option that provides insurance to Americans whose lifeline depends on emergency rooms, free clinics and drug samples from doctors.
 Mohamed Khodr Winchester, Va., July 30, 2009
 The writer, a medical doctor, was public health director of the Lord Fairfax Health district in Virginia from 1992 to 1999.
 To the Editor:
 David Leonhardt (''Health Care and the T-Word,'' Economic Scene, July 29) is quite correct in identifying the growth in health care spending at a rate far greater than the growth in the United States economy as the critical health care problem. He is also correct in noting the waste and unnecessary expense in our health system. But he is quite mistaken in believing that tax reform will eliminate the perverse incentives in the system and deliver the kind of system we need.
 The ''root of the problem,'' to use his language, lies in the way doctors are organized and the way they practice and are paid. Doctors are, and should be, the most important factor in determining how clinical resources are used in the diagnosis and treatment of illness and injury. Neither insurers nor government administrators can make the medical care decisions in a given case. Only doctors and their patients can do that.
 The solution to our problem is to cap total national expenditures through an earmarked, graduated health care tax, provide universal coverage on a prepaid basis and encourage physicians to practice in private, not-for-profit multispecialty groups, where they would work for salaries rather than fee-for-service. 
 That kind of reform will not be easy to achieve, but it should be the ultimate goal of our legislative efforts, because it would be the best -- maybe the only -- way to make the medical care system work efficiently for the benefit of patients, at a cost we can afford. Tinkering with taxes on private insurance isn't going to do the job.
 Arnold S. Relman Boston, July 29, 2009
 The writer is professor emeritus of medicine and of social medicine at Harvard Medical School and a former editor in chief of The New England Journal of Medicine.
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Health Policy Is Carved Out at Table for 6'' (front page, July 28):
 Six moderate/conservative senators from the smallest states will dictate the terms of health care reform, or whether there will be reform, to the rest of the American populace. 
 These senators oppose single-payer, even a public option, and are obsessed with the ''cost'' argument. Polls, however, consistently indicate that an overwhelming majority of Americans want either single-payer or a public option and are not so concerned with the cost if health care is delivered.
 An even larger majority wants major, fundamental health care reform. 
 We tout our ''democracy'' throughout the world, and at every election cycle its praises are sung, yet a handful of senators acting outside the mainstream, apparently in line with their small constituencies, can thwart the will of the vast majority of Americans, denying in the process, or limiting, a fundamental right of all: a healthy life. 
 John E. Colbert Taos, N.M., July 28, 2009
 To the Editor:
 You report that the small cohort of senators carving out the health care bill have ''tossed aside'' the government option. In doing so they have cut out the heart of any meaningful reform. To the majority of the American electorate this is bound to prove a bitter disappointment, nothing less than a betrayal of its trust in electing the Democratic Party to its majority role in government. 
 President Obama can restore that trust by threatening a veto unless this minimum requirement for reform is included in the final bill.
 Robert Brandfon Schererville, Ind., July 28, 2009
 To the Editor:
 The diabetes-, hypertension- and heart attack-causing trans fat-laden and sugared snack ''foods'' at the centrist table are the underlying issue. Seventy-five percent of disease is lifestyle-induced. Thus, theoretically most of that disease is preventable. And unless this is addressed, there will never be any ''bending of the curve'' to decrease health care costs.
 That's where the savings are. And that's where health care should lead. 
 Isn't good health for all Americans the goal? Senators Max Baucus, Charles E. Grassley, Olympia J. Snowe et al. need to take care of their own health and need to send a clear message to all of us by avoiding such fare. No excuses. They display the same ''it won't happen to me'' attitude that too many of us recklessly and irresponsibly live by. 
 ''North Dakota Diet Food'' and ''we're too important and busy to be bothered with what we eat'' aren't funny or cute. In the end they're deadly -- actuarially and literally. 
 Any health care insurance plan should include a substantial tax on trans fat and sugared foods and tobacco products to account for the increased costs to society of covering the disease and illness caused by their consumption. This tax is fair and across the board. If someone chooses to use them, he should pay more for health insurance.
