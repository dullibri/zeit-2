HEADLINE: Wall Street Tumult Casts Pall on Manhattan Real Estate

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
As the financial services industry expanded rapidly in mid-decade, Manhattan office rents skyrocketed, investors competed furiously for buildings and developers planned huge trading floors to lure tenants. As recently as last year, large blocks of space were scarce, and landlords had the upper hand.
 These days, however, confidence and optimism have given way to fear, uncertainty and gloom. Wall Street is expected to shrink significantly, and the market for commercial real estate has ground to a virtual standstill (though many investors are hopeful of profiting handsomely by choosing the right time to get back in). ''The speed at which this has flip-flopped has been stunning,'' said Mike Kirby, a principal of Green Street Advisors, a Newport Beach, Calif., research company that analyzes real estate investment trusts. The company follows the Manhattan market closely because one-third of the nation's public office sector, in terms of its value, is in New York. 
 Green Street has predicted that the city will lose 60,000 financial jobs before the economic crisis is over and that the Manhattan availability rate could exceed 13 percent (though that is far less than the Manhattan availability rate of 19.8 percent in the third quarter of 1991, the nadir of the last prolonged downturn). The proportion of office space that is empty now, or will be available within a year, rose to 8.9 percent in the third quarter, from 7.2 percent in the second quarter, according to Studley, a brokerage firm that represents tenants.
 Most of the increase, however, was attributed to 11 Times Square, a 40-story office tower being built on speculation at Eighth Avenue between 41st and 42nd Street. The building is scheduled to be completed next September, but no tenants have been announced. 
 At the moment, asking rents in Manhattan are flat, according to Studley, but they are expected to decline as companies seeking to shed excess space sublease it at a discount. 
 Three of the biggest players caught up in the economic crisis -- Lehman Brothers, which is seeking bankruptcy protection; Merrill Lynch, which was acquired by Bank of America; and the insurance giant American International Group, which received an $85 billion bailout from the government -- occupy 9.2 million square feet in Manhattan. No one knows how much of this space will be put on the sublease market, or when. 
 The financial turmoil has prompted some large law firms and other tenants to angle for a better deal in leases. 
 ''They all start by saying that the deal is off,'' said a leasing broker who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to discuss his firm's negotiations. ''For some, it really is off. Others are using this as leverage.'' Tenants that are not under pressure to make leasing decisions are waiting, he said.
 Also waiting are dozens of investors who have amassed billions of dollars of capital but are not ready to spend it because no one knows how much values have dropped. ''More money is sitting on the sidelines now than ever before in my lifetime, but nobody wants to risk it,'' said Jules Demchick, the chairman of J. D. Carlisle, a New York developer.
 The default rate for commercial mortgage-backed securities -- bonds backed by loans that are pooled and sliced according to varying levels of risk -- is less than half a percent. But real estate professionals say defaults are likely to spike in two or three years when many loans that originated in 2006 and 2007, when the market was at its frothiest, need to be refinanced. The income from these highly leveraged properties is expected to fall short of the robust projections of rental growth that were made when the buildings changed hands. 
 The collapse of Lehman Brothers will also have repercussions for operators of a number of Midtown office buildings. 
 In addition to originating loans, selling these loans in commercial mortgage-backed securities and providing ''mezzanine'' loans at higher interest rates than the senior loans, Lehman was also an aggressive supplier of bridge equity. These were infusions of cash that enabled deals to close quickly, thereby giving its partners a competitive edge. An operating partner might have put up 5 percent of the equity, or even less, with Lehman putting up the balance in the expectation of selling its position to its investors. Often, Lehman played several roles in a given deal.
 Lehman frequently provided financing for Broadway Partners, the once aggressive investor in office towers that is now facing a mountain of short-term debt. One of Lehman's biggest deals in New York involved $1.2 billion in financing for 237 Park Avenue, a 21-story tower that Broadway Partners acquired in May 2007, said Orest Mandzy, the managing editor of Commercial Real Estate Direct, a news and information service. Lehman's equity positions in Manhattan include the office towers at 1745 Broadway and 545 Madison Avenue, in which it has a minority stake.
 In May 2007, Lehman put up most of the $480 million that was used to buy 200 Fifth Avenue, the former International Toy Center, which L & L Holding is turning into a prime office building. Lehman had to keep its interest because the credit squeeze was beginning and no buyers emerged. L & L, which formed a $500 million partnership with Prudential Real Estate Investors in June, hopes eventually to buy Lehman's stake at a discount. Half of the 15-story building is leased to the Grey Group, a global communications company; the remainder has not been spoken for. A consortium of foreign banks provided a construction loan. 
 ''We are the likely buyer,'' said David W. Levinson, chief executive of L & L Holding. He added that the building itself, to be completed in January, will not be affected by Lehman's demise.
 Because he has ready access to cash, Mr. Levinson is in an unusual position, said Robert J. Ivanhoe, chairman of the real estate practice for the law firm of Greenberg Traurig. Some of Lehman Brothers' other partners are likely to lose control of their buildings. ''The typical sponsor is going to have to go out and raise the money,'' Mr. Ivanhoe said. ''The likelihood of success in this marketplace is remote.''
 Anyone who bought a building when the market was red-hot is likely to see an erosion of equity, said Paul M. Fried, a principal of AFC Realty Capital, a mortgage brokerage based in New York. ''If you've acquired property with highly leveraged capital, you've got a problem,'' he said. ''New York or Washington assets may hold their value better than assets in other markets, but they still may take some hit. And when they take a hit, then your equity has just been devalued.''
 But just how deep will that hit be?
 The Real Estate Roundtable, which represents the nation's largest real estate companies, successfully lobbied for commercial real estate debt to be included in the proposed $700 billion government bailout to help establish a fair price for the assets. Jon Southard, a principal at Torto Wheaton Research, an arm of CB Richard Ellis, the brokerage firm, said that under a well-run government auction, sellers would be penalized for overpaying for their buildings because of poor underwriting. But unjustifiably low prices based on panic over the economy would be avoided. 
 But Mr. Kirby of Green Street Advisors said New York real estate players were perfectly capable of figuring out how much an office building is worth. ''Why the government has to play a role there, I don't know,'' he said.

HEADLINE: MEDICARE RULES SAY, 'DO NO HARM'

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

DATELINE: ST. PAUL 

 BODY:
If an auto mechanic accidentally breaks your windshield while trying to repair the engine, he would never get away with billing you for fixing his mistake. On Wednesday, Medicare will start applying that logic to American medicine on a broad scale when it stops paying hospitals for the added cost of treating patients who are injured in their care.
 Medicare, which provides coverage for the elderly and disabled, has put 10 ''reasonably preventable'' conditions on its initial list, saying it will not pay when patients receive incompatible blood transfusions, develop infections after certain surgeries or must undergo a second operation to retrieve a sponge left behind from the first. Serious bed sores, injuries from falls and urinary tract infections caused by catheters are also on the list.
 Officials believe that the regulations could apply to several hundred thousand hospital stays of the 12.5 million covered annually by Medicare. The policy will also prevent hospitals from billing patients directly for costs generated by medical errors. 
 Because Medicare is the largest insurer in the country, its decision to refuse payment for preventable conditions has already influenced others -- public and private -- to set similar criteria. 
 Over the last year, four state Medicaid programs, including New York's, have announced that they will not pay for as many as 28 ''never events'' (so called because they are never supposed to happen). So have some of the country's largest commercial insurers, including WellPoint, Aetna, Cigna and Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in seven states.
 A number of state hospital associations, including here in Minnesota, have brokered voluntary agreements that members will not bill for medical errors. In April, Maine became the first state to ban the practice statutorily. 
 The Congressionally mandated Medicare measure is not projected to yield large savings -- $21 million a year, compared with $110 billion spent on inpatient care in 2007. But it carries great symbolism in the Bush administration's efforts to revamp the country's medical payment system, which has long been criticized as driving up costs through perverse incentives that reward the quantity of care more than the promotion of health. 
 The real money, many health economists believe, may come from reorienting the payment system to encourage prevention and chronic disease management and to discourage unnecessary procedures. The two major-party presidential candidates support such a realignment, a rare point of consensus in a polarized health care debate.
 ''This is a specific case of the larger pay-for-performance trend, the idea that you should pay more for quality than lack of quality, or in this case pay less for defects,'' said Dr. Donald M. Berwick, president of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement. ''This whole trend is like a juggernaut, and it is not going to stop.''
 Pay-for-performance makes use of both the carrot and the stick. Medicare now grants bonuses to doctors and hospitals that report quality measures. It is experimenting with rewarding physicians who follow protocols for treating diabetes, coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an arm of Congress, recently recommended reducing payments to hospitals with high readmission rates.
 Three years ago, HealthPartners, a Minnesota-based health maintenance organization, was first in the country to refuse payment to hospitals for never events. Company officials said the policy has yet to save much money. But at Regions Hospital in St. Paul, which is owned by HealthPartners, the change has reinforced a new focus on reducing medical errors. 
 ''Historically, there's been some acceptance that these things happen,'' said Brock D. Nelson, the hospital's president. ''We've come to now accept that they're avoidable. And that's a sea change.'' 
 Some improvements have been technological, like an electronic prescribing system that has helped cut medication errors in half. Others are breathtaking in their obviousness, like diligent hand-washing.
 Nurses have been trained to provide more information during shift changes about whether patients are prone to falls. High-risk medications like heparin are now marked with pink labels to ward against mix-ups.
 Shortly before Cynthia A. Kehborn's recent ankle fusion surgery, her orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Peter A. Cole, checked records and asked her repeatedly whether he would be operating on her left leg. He then took a sterile marker and signed his initials on her left ankle.
 As they prepared for surgery, technicians tallied sponges and blades so they could later be sure that none were left behind. Before taking up his scalpel, Dr. Cole was reminded by the ''Time-Out!'' towel covering his surgical tray to call for a brief break.
 ''We have Cynthia here for a left ankle fuse,'' he announced. ''Does everybody agree?'' After all in the room chimed their agreement, he made his incision.
 In pre-op, Ms. Kehborn, 48, said it had never occurred to her that patients might be charged for a medical error.
 ''It should be the hospital's and doctor's responsibility to step up to the plate and own up to their mistakes,'' she said. ''I'd be livid if we had to pay for it.'' 
 The patient safety movement picked up steam in this country in 1999, when the Institute of Medicine, a prestigious advisory group, estimated that 44,000 to 98,000 Americans died each year from preventable medical errors.
 In response, at least 20 states have passed laws requiring hospitals to report mistakes or preventable infections publicly, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services now requires hospitals to report on 42 quality measures. Hospitals that do not fully report may be docked up to 2 percent of their reimbursement.
 In 2002, the National Quality Forum, a standard-setting consortium for the health care industry, compiled a list of 27 largely preventable adverse events, a list that grew to 28 in 2006 with the addition of ''artificial insemination with the wrong donor sperm or egg.'' In 2003, Minnesota became the first state to require reporting of all errors on the list, and last year the state's hospital association became the first to announce that its members would not bill for them.
 The number of never events in Minnesota reported to the state has been low -- 106 in 2004-5, 154 in 2005-6 and 125 in 2006-7. The most frequent errors have been bed sores, retained objects and wrong-site surgeries. Regions Hospital had six or seven reportable errors in each of those years, including one death, a suicide.
 Because individual hospitals may report only a few serious errors a year, they have started collaborating to look for common threads and propose solutions. Some of the innovations were initially greeted with rolled eyes, but hospital officials say that has lessened. Nonetheless, studies by the University of Minnesota found that some of the safety procedures, like the pre-surgery time-outs, have largely become rote. 
 Clear trend lines are not expected for several years. Some states have found through audits that not all errors are being reported, but Minnesota officials believe that compliance is high.
 ''There's been an understanding by hospitals that we're not trying to get them, that we're really focused on what we can learn from these events,'' said Diane C. Rydrych, the state health department official in charge of reporting. 
 Nancy E. Foster, vice president for quality and patient safety at the American Hospital Association, said hospitals had generally accepted that many of the 28 adverse events should never happen, like giving a patient the wrong type of blood. But she said other areas could be gray, like an injury caused by a malfunctioning device. 
 ''Anyone -- I don't care who they are -- always finds it a little provocative to be held accountable for something that is not within their control, especially when you have dedicated yourself to doing the right thing for your patients,'' Ms. Foster said. Such unforgiving standards, she said, can ''set an expectation among patients that staff will be closer to perfect than they actually can achieve.''
 Even America's Health Insurance Plans, the leading industry trade group, has questioned whether some of the conditions on the Medicare list are always preventable.
 But Peter V. Lee, executive director of the Pacific Business Group on Health, based in San Francisco, said occasional inequity was a price worth paying to send the message that careless medicine will not be tolerated. ''I don't worry about that 1-in-100 case that can't be avoided,'' he said, ''because the benefit of not paying for the 99 that shouldn't happen means a far greater focus on avoiding harm. What we want is to encourage doctors and hospitals to get to zero.''

HEADLINE: Likes Taking Risks, Profitable Returns

BYLINE: By DAN FOST

 BODY:
EVAN SHEFTEL of New York knew he could grow his business of buying and refining old jewelry. All he needed was capital, and quickly. But he had exhausted his credit with conventional lenders. 
 Across the country, in Los Angeles, Jay Turo and his company, Growthink, were looking for profitable investments.
 Thanks to the Web site RaiseCapital.com, founded in March 2007 and based in Port Washington, N.Y., they found each other. Without even a face-to-face meeting, Growthink, a venture investment firm, put $500,000 into Mr. Sheftel's business, eAssay, this year and is already seeing returns. 
 In a financial counterpart to online dating services, companies like RaiseCapital, Go4Funding and Go Big Network are giving small businesses a new way to meet prospective investors. And with turmoil in the financial markets, credit tightening and uneasiness about the conventional financial system, these companies hope to provide opportunities to invest, to lend and to borrow -- and to find a market for these services. 
 ''When you have a bunch of smart, ambitious people suddenly flood the market, it makes sense that a lot of new companies will be formed,'' said Bob Goodson, the chief executive of YouNoodle, which is trying to bring together entrepreneurs and investors. ''Investments in start-ups are highly volatile, but at least it's a sector that's upfront about the risk.''
 Robert Bertsch, president and co-founder of RaiseCapital, said: ''Most people, to get in front of a venture capitalist, need to have a connection or be a Stanford graduate. Our investors are not going to be all over you for a balance sheet or your exit strategy. They're looking for something that suits their interest.''
 Some of these sites are gathering places for investors who want a stake in companies, while others are for people who want to lend money. Whatever success they may realize, they are not expected to replace traditional venture capital or angel investing anytime soon. And whether the sites will take hold or which kind will win out is uncertain, for all of their anecdotal success stories. 
 ''Everyone has a slightly different take on things,'' said Adeo Ressi, a serial entrepreneur who started TheFunded.com, a Web site where start-up chief executives can discuss investors and match them with other entrepreneurs. ''It's not clear who the winner will be or even what the right approach is.'' 
 Legal issues loom on several fronts. Companies must be cautious when offering investments to the public, and they have to be careful not to act as brokers, which are highly regulated. 
 The companies' approaches vary widely. RaiseCapital and others try to arrange equity investments in businesses. Prosper, Zopa, Lending Club and others bring together would-be lenders with small-business borrowers. Ideablob, an outgrowth of Advanta, which issues small-business credit cards, and Cambrian House, a Canadian company, both allow potential investors to vote on ideas and help shape businesses. SellaBand, a Dutch company, helps musicians get financial backing from fans online.
 Still other companies, like TheFunded and YouNoodle, are trying to build social networks in the entrepreneurial community, in the manner of Facebook or LinkedIn. 
 How the companies expect to make money also varies. Some, particularly lending firms, earn a commission on each transaction. Others rely on premium services, sponsorships or vendors that pay for access to their sites' users. 
 Proponents compare the new companies to blogging, which allows the general public to publish online. The new financing companies hope to allow small businesses and entrepreneurs to bypass the limited-access corridors along Silicon Valley's Sand Hill Road, where venture capitalists decide which start-ups get money.
 ''People need a platform like this as an extra measure to obtain funding,'' said Mr. Bertsch, the president of RaiseCapital. ''In some cases, it's a company's last means of survival.'' 
 Mr. Bertsch said inquiries from new visitors to the site had jumped 21 percent in one month recently, to nearly 8,000. 
 When someone seeks a loan on Prosper, the site's participating lenders ''decide who and what get funded, rather than an elite group of bankers,'' said Chris Larsen, Prosper's founder and chief executive. At Prosper, based in San Francisco, applicants state why they want a loan -- to start a business, pay down credit card debt, buy a house, pay for school -- and how much they want, as well as the interest rate they hope to pay. Prosper runs a credit check and publishes the rating, and members can bid to participate in the loan, as if it were an item for sale on eBay. 
 The system worked perfectly for Marc Matthias and Benny Rivera, who needed $25,000 in April to start Diverse Desserts, a cake- and dessert-design company based in Manhattan. They needed money quickly, and they had taken out all the conventional loans they could, Mr. Matthias said. At Prosper, they received their loan in a week, at 11.5 percent interest, from more than 400 lenders who put up $50 to $500 each. 
 Prosper has made more than 27,000 loans, totaling $170 million, since Nov. 1, 2005. Jim Bruene, editor of Online Banking Report, an industry publication, said Prosper's pace of about $100 million in loans this year was ''a decent start, but that's 20 houses in Los Angeles. It's not a lot. It could be the tip of the iceberg; it's hard to know.''
 A crucial question, Mr. Bruene said, is how much regulation the government will impose on both the lending and the financing sites. 
 Aaron Kornfield, a lawyer at Fenwick & West in San Francisco who advises YouNoodle, said private companies needed to be careful about any form of general advertising regarding the sale of their securities, including the solicitation of investments online. 
 ''Private companies are not supposed to advertise the sale of their securities,'' he said. He added: ''Investors can figure out what companies are doing on Web sites like YouNoodle, and then they can talk offline. But to go out and say, Here I am, invest in me, that's not a smart idea.''
 But Mr. Bertsch, the president of RaiseCapital, said confidently, ''The government does not monitor transactions between private individual investors and private business opportunities.'' 
 So the key to success may be whether a company can get attention and attract the interest of investors, then continue the ensuing dialogue in a private forum, similar to the dating services. 
 Manoj Duggirala, 23, was pursuing a master's degree in material science and engineering at Stanford when he signed up on YouNoodle because he had an idea for a business, but no connections. Through YouNoodle, he found an investor, Jan Leeman. After a courtship of several months, Mr. Leeman invested $70,000 in Mr. Duggirala's company, GiveandTake, an online shopping firm that has not yet opened. 
 ''What is appealing about YouNoodle to me is the university connection,'' said Mr. Leeman, an entrepreneur turned angel investor. ''There are at least half a dozen stories of two grad students from Stanford starting something that turns into something wonderful.'' Even though he attended Stanford and lives near the campus, ''it's difficult to get access to what the students are doing,'' he said.
 At YouNoodle, Mr. Goodson said that, according to the National Venture Capital Association, $30.5 billion in venture capital was invested in 2007, and the University of New Hampshire has estimated that angel investors put in another $26 billion. ''That's a colossal amount, and it's nearly all done without the use of technology,'' he said. ''People are still sitting down face to face and giving each other pitches. That's a lot to be distributed without a more intelligent use of technology.''
 One YouNoodle investor is Peter Thiel, a founder of PayPal (now owned by eBay) and a managing partner of the Founders Fund venture firm. ''There's something strange about venture capital'' operating much as it did in the 19th century, he said, ''when it's investing in all of these 21st century technologies.''
 Mr. Sheftel, at eAssay, was running a wholesale jewelry business in New York, R. Sulimani, when the economy began to sour. People were selling their ''broken, old, outdated jewelry'' to raise cash, he said, and he knew he and his partner could buy it, refine it into gold bars and sell it for a small profit -- if they could expand. But without the option of a bank loan, he ''decided to try out RaiseCapital,'' he said.
 He called a few prospective lenders he had met on the company's site; one of them was Mr. Turo, managing partner of Growthink. 
 Mr. Turo said he was drawn to RaiseCapital as a way of looking beyond Silicon Valley and the Bay Area. One Growthink investor had already asked Mr. Turo about opportunities in jewelry, and within a few weeks Mr. Turo had provided Mr. Sheftel with half a million dollars. Mr. Sheftel was then able to increase his revenue to $250,000 to $300,000 a week from an average of $150,000. 
 The two have still not met in person; Mr. Turo said that for an investment this size, and the modest risk involved, a meeting was not necessary. 
 ''I don't think RaiseCapital is the place to do seven-figure investing,'' he said. ''It's like a dating site. You make a connection online, and you take it offline,'' which in Mr. Turo's case meant due diligence and writing a check. ''There's only marginal value in a face-to-face meeting.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: October 13, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article in the special Small Business section on Oct. 1 about Web sites that match investors with start-up companies misstated the amount of money that Growthink, a venture firm, invested in eAssay.com, a jewelry- purchasing business. The managing partner for Growthink, Jay Turo, said his firm did not invest the $500,000 that the match-making Web site Raise- Capital.com said it invested, but he would not specify the size of the investment. (Mr. Turo was contacted for comment about the $500,000 amount before publication, but he did not deny or confirm the amount at that time.)

HEADLINE: Bay Area Holds Commercial Appeal Despite Stumbles of Housing Market

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif. 

 BODY:
The residential real estate downturn in the suburbs surrounding Oakland and San Francisco has been frightening. Prices, even in exclusive communities in Contra Costa, Sonoma and Solano Counties, are down 40 percent or more since 2006. In the last 12 months, median home prices in the nine-county San Francisco Bay region have tumbled 32 percent, according to real estate reports.
 But the region's two big bayfront cities are not experiencing the same sharp pain, though there has been some softening in the market. Home prices in San Francisco are roughly the same as they were last year. In Oakland, single-family homes are selling at 10 percent below the 2007 market, and a sudden arrival of new downtown condominiums on the market has lowered prices in that sector 20 percent and more. 
 Still, commercial real estate developers in both Oakland and San Francisco continue to build, and big projects are in the planning stages. Office vacancy rates in San Francisco hovered around 7 percent for much of the year, about half the national level, but they are starting to tick up, brokers say.
 Rents remain so high, though, that companies are steadily crossing the bay to seek less expensive offices in the downtown of Oakland, home of 400,000 people, where prime office vacancy rates have remained under 10 percent for the year, according to several real estate companies.
 Under Jerry Brown, who was mayor from 1999 to 2006, Oakland experienced considerable redevelopment for offices and homes. That trend is continuing as major new office, retailing and housing projects have been announced in recent weeks.
 This week, Shorenstein Realty Services, a major Bay Area developer, is scheduled to break ground on a 23-story, 600,000-square-foot office building on 12th Street. The building is the newest in a group of office buildings, called City Center, that the company has constructed in the last seven years.
 ''Our existing assets are full in Oakland,'' said Todd Sklar, senior vice president and head of Shorenstein's development group. ''We think there is room for more high-quality space.''
 Peter Wang, an Oakland-based developer, says the same. He has been working since last year to gain permits to build Encinal Tower, a 56-story, $600 million mixed-use tower, which would be the city's tallest. The 1.7 million-square-foot development will have ground- and mezzanine-level retailing, 24 floors of office space and 22 residential floors. 
 In addition, Ellis Partners, based in Oakland, has placed a $350 million bet that fresh, locally grown food can serve as the theme of a mixed-use development on the city's south side. The project is the six-story Jack London Market, a $50 million, 170,000-square-foot development, which is scheduled to open early next spring in Jack London Square, a retail and entertainment section along the bayfront.
 Developers cite the region's growing population and proximity to the high-tech industry, and other economic and demographic trends as reasons for the relative durability of the downtown markets. But they also note the proximity of the bay and many large tracts of bayfront land.
 No other major metropolitan area in the country has nearly as many shoreline acres available for development as the San Francisco Bay region, according to real estate professionals here. Major industries, among them big food-processing plants and oil refineries, have pulled back from the shoreline. The military, which operated shipyards, a naval air station and other installations here, has closed nearly all of its bases, leaving huge tracts of shoreline property. In most cases, the properties have residual toxic contamination that is being cleaned up. 
 Once scrubbed of contaminants, the parcels are proving to be big draws. The Lennar Corporation recently won voter approval in San Francisco to develop 772 bayfront acres in and near the old Hunters Point Naval Shipyard. Lennar is also planning a community of homes, offices, parks and retail development on Treasure Island, an old naval installation near the bay's center, and is building homes at Mare Island, a closed Navy installation near Vallejo.
 At the north end of Alameda, an East Bay island city of 72,000, Catellus, a unit of ProLogis that specializes in mixed-use and retail development, is converting the Navy's old 213-acre supply facility into a planned community. Roughly half the land has become Bayport, a neighborhood of 485 single-family homes, a new elementary school and an 11-acre park. 
 Catellus is set to start construction of Alameda Landing on the remaining 97 acres. This includes thousands of feet of shoreline where the company is planning to build a promenade and a 32,000-square-foot waterfront district with restaurants, entertainment and retail facilities. Other features include a 300,000-square-foot retail center, 400,000 square feet of offices and up to 300 residential units.
 ''We expect that Alameda Landing will sell as well as Bayport did,'' said Aidan Barry, Catellus's first vice president. ''The location on the bay just can't be beat.''
 In Jack London Market, named for the writer and Oakland native, the principals of Ellis Partners have set out to combine the waterfront location with the Bay Area's love of California cuisine. 
 According to the company's plans, the project will feature two levels and have 70,000 square feet reserved for sellers of locally grown and specialty foods. The upper floors will house offices and nine restaurants, featuring menu items made from foods that have been organically grown and locally produced. 
 James F. Ellis manages the development company, one of Northern California's largest, in partnership with his father, Harold A. Ellis Jr., and his sister, Melinda Ellis Evers. He said that Jack London Market is intended to provide the same kind of economic focal point for Oakland and the East Bay region as Pike Place Market in Seattle, the market at Fanueil Hall in Boston, and the Ferry Building market on the other side of San Francisco Bay.
 Jack London Market is meant to become the next chapter in a distinctive narrative of fresh, organic and healthy food that this region of California has been writing for decades. 
 ''Focusing on local food just fits the demographic here in Oakland and the Bay Area,'' Mr. Ellis said. ''These are young professionals, single or married without children, who are staying in the city and have the kind of disposable income that gets them out to eat good, fresh food.''
 After the market opens, perhaps as early as the fall of 2009, Ellis Partners is planning to start a 250-room hotel and two 140,000-square-foot office buildings.

HEADLINE: Take Half a Ton Of Beef...

BYLINE: By STEVEN STERN

 BODY:
LATE mornings during the week, the Williamsburg restaurant Marlow & Sons feels almost like the Old World establishment it's meant to simulate. Up front customers drink coffee amid the cheeses and produce of a quaint miniature grocery. 
 And every Tuesday morning in the rear dining room, a scene plays out that's not just Old World old, but positively primeval. Sitting around a weathered wooden table, the heads of a tribe are dividing up the meat of large animals -- on paper, at least. 
 All of the meat served at Marlow & Sons and the three other Brooklyn restaurants Mark Firth and Andrew Tarlow own -- Diner, next door, and two branches of the upscale taqueria Bonita -- comes from small farms in New York and Pennsylvania. Since last fall, rather than picking and choosing the cuts they need, the restaurants have ordered entire carcasses, butchering them at Marlow & Sons, in a cramped back room. 
 It's a unique and almost perversely ambitious arrangement, one that fits with the do-it-yourself aesthetic Mr. Firth and Mr. Tarlow have cultivated. (After talking about writing a cookbook, they decided instead to begin a quarterly magazine, one that they and their staff write, edit, design and publish themselves.) But their practice also reflects a widespread interest in what might be called, for lack of an official term, ''alternative meat.'' It's meat that is everything industrial products are not: sustainable, humanely raised and, ideally, local.
 For chefs and restaurant owners, getting hold of the good stuff can mean buying particular cuts directly from farmers who do their own processing, and whose supply can be irregular because they must navigate a web of United States Department of Agriculture regulations. Or it can mean dealing with a national distributor like Heritage Foods, originally the sales and marketing arm of Slow Food USA. If, like Dan Barber of Blue Hill at Stone Barns, you happen to have a Rockefeller estate at your disposal, it means raising your own sheep, pigs and chickens, then slaughtering and butchering them on the spot.
 For a growing number of young chefs, even those without as much real estate, reviving the craft of butchery is a noble end in itself. Nate Appleman of A16 and SPQR in San Francisco, Tamara Murphy at Brasa in Seattle and Mark Cutrara at Toronto's Cowbell are as adept with a meat cleaver as they are with a chef's knife. Much of the inspiration for this butcher pride clearly comes from Fergus Henderson's London offal emporium, St. John, and, closer to home, from Thomas Keller's restaurants. 
 Jonathan Benno, chef de cuisine at Mr. Keller's Per Se, is an earnest disciple of his boss's philosophy. For him, the main advantage of in-house butchering is the flexibility it provides. When you get the whole animal, he said: ''You can do anything you want with it. You're not bound by the way an outside butcher breaks down the pig.'' 
 Mr. Benno butchers his own pigs throughout the year, and spring lamb and venison in season, building degustation menus that proceed through various bits of anatomy. In the Per Se kitchen, pork shanks are braised, pig tails are fried and pork trimmings turned into classic French charcuterie. The tricky part of whole-animal cooking, he pointed out, is finding an outlet for every part. 
 ''It's easy for us as cooks to use the more popular cuts,'' he said. ''But when you start talking about the head, the feet, the knuckle, you need to get creative.''
 This need is exactly why Mr. Tarlow and Caroline Fidanza, executive chef for Diner and Marlow & Sons, convene a meeting every week, with somebody from Bonita. Because those two restaurants are farther afield (one is a few blocks away, the other on DeKalb Avenue in Fort Greene), negotiating their weekly meat requirements is a logistical challenge. 
 The moderators for these summits are Sean Rembold and Dave Gould, tag-team chefs de cuisine for Diner and Marlow & Sons.
 On a recent Tuesday, the group sat down a few hours after the main weekly delivery arrived -- ''a Volkswagen's weight in meat,'' in the words of Tom Mylan, who butchers for all four restaurants. 
 There were two split pigs, up to 250 pounds each. And there was an entire grass-fed steer, which might come in at almost half a ton. Each of its two sides comes in cut into eighths, a size few restaurants ever see. The beef is accompanied by what the staff calls the offal party pack: a tongue, liver, heart and oxtail. (By law, more esoteric innards like tripe, sweetbreads and the like cannot leave the slaughterhouse unless they have been specially processed.)
 While Mr. Mylan was struggling to divide the order into workable segments, the group inside started on the pigs. 
 ''I don't need the trotters,'' said Juventino Avila, then the chef at Bonita. ''You sent me trotters on Friday.''
 Mr. Gould, filling in a flow chart he was composing on brown butcher paper, confirmed: ''Keeping the trotters. You want the heads?''
 ''Oh, I'd like the heads,'' Mr. Avila said. ''Can you send the heads to DeKalb?'' 
 Bonita has been serving quesadillas de cabeza, bits of pork head meat in fried corn masa turnovers, and they have been selling well. The headcheese at Marlow & Sons has not been such a hit.
 As an anthropologist might tell you, the operative concept here was economy. There was a lot of meat, and all of it had to be used somehow in a week. But it had to be shared. This plan can be financially viable only if everything is used wisely. Everyone from chefs planning menus to prep cooks making stock to waiters talking up headcheese needs to take responsibility. 
 ''It's about juggling, training your staff to switch gears at a moment's notice,'' said Chris Cosentino, a high-profile partisan of head-to-tail eating. The chef and a co-owner of Incanto in San Francisco, Mr. Cosentino spreads the word at his organ-meat-centric Web site, offalgood.com, and recently started Boccalone, a salumi business based in Oakland. 
 When you take on whole animals, he said, ''you never stop working. There have been times when I've had to stay till 3 in the morning to butcher pigs so my walk-in wouldn't be cluttered.''
 Mr. Cosentino draws the line at breaking down steers in his kitchen (he has a network of small-scale ranchers and processors who supply his beef), but he is a believer in avoiding packaged meat, no matter how impressive its provenance. The advantages, he believes, are not just culinary and ecological but also ethical: his cooks ''see what's coming in the door.'' 
 To drive home the point, he has taken his staff to witness animal slaughters. After that, he said: ''I don't have mistakes anymore. They don't burn meat. They don't miscount. There are no screw-ups.''
 While other restaurant kitchens might occasionally see whole animals -- say, a pig or lamb ordered to add some excitement to the specials menu -- comparing that to what goes on at Incanto or Diner and its siblings is like comparing a roller coaster to a car without brakes. Certainly it's the most fuss anyone has ever made to get a good burger.
 For years, Diner has tried to get grass-fed meat with sufficient regularity to keep customers in burgers seven days a week. Their needs were met for a while by Josh Applestone, a butcher who supplied top-notch ground beef. 
 But last year, Mr. Applestone, who, with his wife, Jessica, runs Fleisher's Meats, retail shops in Kingston and Rhinebeck, decided to rejigger his business model so that his wholesale customers would have to buy whole or half animals. He gave them two options: he'd either carve the carcasses himself when he made his delivery, or train restaurant staff to do it themselves.
 Mr. Applestone currently carves sides of beef for Flatbush Farm, a Brooklyn restaurant; he has taught the sous-chef at Casa Mono to break down a pig. No one else, though, chose to go as far as the Diner crowd: they decided a full-time butcher was precisely what they needed. ''It's like we cracked the code,'' Mr. Tarlow said.
 Crucial to this bit of meat cryptography is Mr. Mylan, who had been the manager of Marlow's grocery store. Last October, he moved in with the Applestone family, and while the restaurant paid his salary, he learned to handle band saws and meat hooks. After a month, he returned to Williamsburg with new skills, a knife belt and a certain swagger.
 ''He came back with muscles,'' said Mr. Firth.
 Mr. Mylan, 32, an inveterate culinary hobbyist, has long cured and concocted things in his apartment. Since his reinvention as a meatcutter, he's become a local culinary celebrity, teaching sold-out classes in butchering at Brooklyn Kitchen, a Williamsburg housewares shop.
 Ms. Fidanza hopes that Diner's practices might serve as a model for other restaurants. ''It's easier than people think,'' she said. 
 As Mr. Mylan pointed out, this is not a novel concept. ''When I was growing up in Reno,'' he said, ''every good-sized hotel-casino had their own ranch and their own slaughterhouse. It's not that weird an idea. It just seems weird to us because our cultural memory is so short.'' 
 That level of vertical integration is probably out of reach for Mr. Firth and Mr. Tarlow, but they are moving ahead with the next phase of their plan: a butcher shop. They have just leased a space a block over from Diner, at 95 Broadway. Called Marlow & Daughters, it could open as soon as the end of the year. 
 The store will be the first retailer in the city offering nothing but local meat from small farms, cut to order, seven days a week. It will also supply Marlow & Sons, Diner and both Bonita locations, allowing them more leeway in menu planning. 
 But almost certainly there will still be that sense of economy -- a consciousness of waste, the need to use everything. Or almost everything.
 ''We really want to use beef suet in the deep fryer,'' Ms. Fidanza said, ''but everybody has a different opinion on that. I'm not interested in offending people. It's kind of heartbreaking, because it's just so delicious. And it makes so much sense.'' 
 Mr. Rembold said, ''We need to hire a candlemaker.'' 
 They just might.

HEADLINE: Hauling Junk (With a Touch of Class)

BYLINE: By DEE GILL

 BODY:
VALUE-ADDED junk hauling may sound like a questionable product to sell: it assumes that people will pay hundreds of dollars to get rid of ratty sofas and assorted flotsam in professional and socially conscious ways. 
 Its biggest selling points are friendly employees who presumably look more respectable than the local odd jobber, and who will, unlike the far less expensive city garbage collector, climb into that nasty basement or garage to haul out your junk.
 Yet to the bafflement of industry experts, quality junk-hauling sells. 
 Take Omar Soliman and Nick Friedman, the 26-year-old founders of College Hunks Hauling Junk, based in Tampa, Fla. The pair started the company in Washington five years ago and now employ 25 people there; they also have franchises in 15 metropolitan areas. 
 Sending out college students in golf shirts and khakis, College Hunks had $2.9 million in business last year. Mr. Soliman and Mr. Friedman said they expected sales of $4 million this year.
 The company charges by the size of the cargo: for an eighth of a truck, a quarter and so on, up to $500 for a full load, or $99 for a single item. Extra charges apply for some concrete, dirt, construction materials and other loads. And they will not remove some materials at all, like combustibles and other hazardous waste. The haulers promise to recycle and donate what they can -- and say that it's to their advantage to eliminate as much as possible this way, because they pay by the pound for whatever they drop off at the dump.
 More than half of College Hunks' business comes from homeowners in upscale neighborhoods who discard many items that the company takes to Goodwill Industries instead of to the dump. While some charities offer pickup services, they may be selective in what they accept and may not clean out a space, Mr. Friedman said, adding, ''Calling College Hunks gets the stuff out in one sweep.''
 About 30 percent of the company's revenue comes from businesses -- property managers, for example, who hire the company to clear rental units. 
 College Hunks has sold 36 franchises since January 2007, each requiring a minimum investment of $75,600, which includes a $25,000 franchise fee, to get started. ''In our minds, we want to have 80 to 125 franchise partners across the country,'' said Mr. Soliman, the chief executive. ''We think we can do that within three years.''
 From the beginning, their business plan called for franchising, as the least expensive way to expand the company. By the summer of 2006, when 12-month revenues were up to about $500,000, Mr. Friedman and Mr. Soliman had enough cash from operations to spend around $250,000 for lawyers and consultants to roll out a franchise plan.
 Among the expenses were setting up a call center that could take orders from around the country and software that would allow customers to search online for College Hunks by ZIP code.
 They also hired George Palmer, 63, as director of franchise development. ''I've been in franchising for more than 30 years; that's longer than the College Hunks have been on the face of the earth,'' Mr. Palmer said. 
 His job is to arrange support for the franchisees, including marketing materials designed for specific customers, like real estate agents, bankers or moving companies. He also hosts conference phone calls with franchisees, where tips are shared -- on good insurance rates, for example.
 If the College Hunks plan sounds familiar, that is probably because a company called 1-800-GOT-JUNK? has already done it. Based in Vancouver, British Columbia, 1-800-GOT-JUNK? sells the same services as College Hunks, and it has blanketed the United States and Canada with more than 300 franchises in the last nine years. It reported $121.37 million in revenue last year. 
 Mr. Friedman said College Hunks was already the largest junk-hauling business based in the United States, and that 1-800-GOT-JUNK? was the only competitor with more than a few trucks.
 College Hunks -- whose phone number is a similar 1-800-JUNK-USA (its Web site is 1800junkusa.com) -- is undaunted by the competition. While Mr. Friedman said 1-800-GOT-JUNK? ''is the McDonald's of the junk-hauling business,'' he said his company just wanted to be ''the Burger King.'' 
 Franchise consultants say there is nothing wrong with that strategy. They point out that Wendy's did not enter the fast food market until about two decades after McDonald's invented it. 
 College Hunks was conceived in the summer of 2003, when Mr. Friedman was a college intern at the International Monetary Fund in Washington and when Mr. Soliman started picking up junk for cash. The two, who have known each other since attending Sidwell Friends School in Washington, hauled junk together on weekends.
 They split about $9,000 that summer. Then Mr. Soliman returned to the University of Miami and Mr. Friedman to Pomona College in California for their senior years, but their phones kept ringing for hauling jobs in Washington.
 So Mr. Soliman drew up a business plan for College Hunks and entered it in the Leigh Rothschild Entrepreneurship Competition at his university. He took first place and won $10,000.
 After graduating with a business degree, Mr. Soliman took a marketing job in Washington and used his prize money to restart the junk business on the side. Mr. Friedman helped, but he had an economics degree by then and a job at a consulting company. 
 ''I created spreadsheets, economic research to help billion-dollar businesses make more billions,'' he said. Six months later, he left to join Mr. Soliman and the junk business full time. 
 They recruited haulers from the University of Maryland, in nearby College Park, and area community colleges, paying them $11 an hour, with bonuses of $20 to $50 a shift if a customer called in and complimented their work.
 The company's name notwithstanding, the haulers don't have to be hunky, Mr. Friedman said, but ''clean-cut,'' which he defines as well-groomed with no prominent piercings or tattoos. There is also at least one Hunkette, as they call a female hauler, and women also work in the corporate office. 
 Mr. Soliman and Mr. Friedman designed a logo with a cartoonish muscle man and invented a slogan: ''Let tomorrow's leaders haul your junk today!'' They put out fliers and door hangers and handed out business cards.
 Shortly before their 25th birthdays, they were ready to franchise, and they obtained a toll-free phone number with the word junk in it, paying a Michigan medical company $13,000 for 1-800-JUNK-USA. The number helped their marketing efforts immensely, they said. 
 ''It was easy to remember and sounds like a national company,'' Mr. Soliman said.
 Big waste-collection companies might pose formidable competition if they pursued junk hauling, but they haven't so far, and some of them openly disdain the idea of collecting junk from inside homes.
 ''I question the need and the appropriateness of companies like 1-800-GOT-JUNK?'' said Robert Reed, a spokesman for Norcal Waste Systems, based in San Francisco. The company collects garbage for San Francisco and nearby cities, and it recycles about 60 percent of what it collects in its facilities, Mr. Reed said.
 Most homeowners get free or inexpensive pickup of bulk items from the curb once or twice a year as part of their city garbage collection, Mr. Reed said. So why would people spend $400?
 ''Most people are able-bodied and can haul their own stuff,'' he said. ''You just get a dolly, which most people have in their garage, and pull it out to the curb.'' 
 Those sentiments were echoed at the National Solid Wastes Management Association, a trade group whose members include large trash companies, and in Waste Age, a publication that covers the waste-hauling industry. 
 But at 1-800-GOT-JUNK?, Launi Skinner, the president and chief operating officer, said quality hauling services were needed because ''everyone in our society has junk.'' 
 And sometimes it takes a sense of humor to move it. Among the College Hunks is Kevin Burns, a 21-year-old student who is also a full-time employee. 
 Last month, Mr. Burns was working on a job at a small apartment in Tampa. Magazines, notebooks, plastic soda bottles, lamp parts, 1980s electronics and, inexplicably, feathers covered every surface.
 While her 10-pound Chihuahua yapped furiously, the resident, Deirdre Blancett, asked the haulers to remove the sleeper sofa, the television, the computer desk -- pretty much all of her furniture -- and whatever was on it. 
 When the job was about half done, Ms. Blancett's nephew, Brian Vans Evers, arrived. Noting the College Hunks sign on the truck, he spat tobacco juice and remarked that college students had time for junk hauling. 
 Mr. Burns introduced himself and finished filling the truck. Then he slapped a College Hunks magnet on the tailgate of Mr. Vans Evers's pickup and said he hoped he could work for him again.
 Mr. Vans Evers looked at the magnet, just above his ''Yur Followeeng a Rednek'' bumper sticker. The house his aunt is moving into has more junk than this apartment, he said, adding that ''maybe we'll give you a call.''

HEADLINE: Building Better Bodies

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
JACKSON, Mich.
 IN this factory town in south-central Michigan, hard hit by the decline of the auto industry and home to a population whose health grimly lags well below national averages, several dozen small-business owners have joined forces in a wellness campaign that rivals those of the country's giant corporations. 
 With fewer employees to rely on, small businesses are particularly vulnerable when workers take sick days or function poorly on the job. 
 ''If they're not healthy and alert, they can't do things like designing projects,'' said Mike Shirkey, owner of Orbitform Group, a machine tools company with 55 employees in Jackson. 
 An engineering graduate of the University of Michigan, Mr. Shirkey compares the wellness program with the ''measure and improve'' approach that he applies to manufacturing. Two years ago, Mr. Shirkey helped persuade other business owners in Jackson to join a CEO Roundtable, a forum and self-help group for top executives that is trying to address employees' health as a crucial part of corporate strategy, rather than as simply a cost-management problem. 
 Kirk Mercer, president of R. W. Mercer, a Jackson-based contractor that builds small factories, doctors' offices and other commercial buildings in the Midwest, said he was so taken with this approach that he was urging his small subcontractors, each with a handful of employees, to join the wellness roundtable.
 There, businesspeople share ideas and encourage one another, but each business makes its own health-care decisions and pays for whatever coverage it provides; there is no pooling of employees for insurance purposes or to achieve other economies of scale, and no government contribution to the program. 
 If the strategy works, the result will probably be healthier workers and lower medical costs, and that will be striking, when many small businesses are unable to provide any health coverage at all -- and one in seven Americans is uninsured. At least half of them work for small companies or are self-employed.
 Promoting wellness is especially urgent in Jackson, whose residents have more health problems than people living elsewhere, according to a recent survey paid for by the Allegiance Health system, which operates the local hospital; the county health department; and other local agencies.
 In Jackson County, 70 percent of adults are overweight or obese, compared with 63 percent nationally, and 14 percent have diabetes, well above the 9 percent national rate. More than 1 in 4 is a smoker, compared with 1 in 10 nationally. Many people in the county do not realize they are taking serious chances with their health, the survey found; they do not have insurance and cannot afford health services. 
 Jackson's economic health is shaky as well. As the city's population has declined slowly to about 34,000, median household income has fallen to $31,000, a third less than Michigan as a whole, and the countywide (metropolitan area) unemployment rate has climbed to 9.7 percent, compared with 9.1 percent statewide in July.
 Historically, Jackson has several claims to fame. It calls itself the birthplace of the Republican Party, noting that on July 6, 1854, the party formally organized itself and held its first convention here, according to the city's Web site; among those in attendance was Abraham Lincoln. 
 Jackson was a major rail hub and the onetime headquarters of Buick Motors, and it remains home to a state prison, now more than a century old, that looms over the city like a medieval fortress and was for decades the largest prison in the country. 
 If Jackson's wellness initiative succeeds, the small city may once again be at the forefront of a national trend.
 Several states, including Maryland, New Hampshire and Rhode Island, have recently required insurance companies to offer wellness benefits to employees of small businesses, and a foundation-financed business group in Colorado, with encouragement from Lt. Gov. Barbara O'Brien, is also planning a wellness program for small- and medium-size employers. 
 As part of the broad national debate about health care, Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic candidate for president, has proposed a tax credit for small businesses to help them pay health insurance premiums for their employees. His Republican rival, Senator John McCain, has called for every family to receive a tax credit of up to $5,000 to help pay for insurance, while making employees' health benefits taxable as income. Mr. McCain has recommended incentives to reduce costs, including disease management and health and wellness programs.
 No matter what kinds of changes are made in the health system, many policy experts are counting on wellness and disease-management programs to slow the relentless rise of medical costs. 
 In Jackson, the two largest employers are Consumers Energy, the local power company; and Allegiance Health, the local hospital, and the latter has been especially involved in the initiative. ''We hope we can develop ways for the providers and payers to work together,'' said Georgia Fojtasek, a nurse with a doctorate in education who is the chief executive of Allegiance Health. Allegiance administers the wellness program and spends $2 million annually to support community health projects.
 Among the small-business participants in the wellness program is Bob Lefere, president of the Pioneer Foundry, which is paying for a nicotine patch to help a 30-year-old mold maker quit smoking. He was the last smoker on the foundry's 15-person staff.
 The link between smoking and dangerous lung and heart problems is widely recognized, and some large companies require workers who smoke to pay higher premiums unless they at least try to quit. Pioneer Foundry, a union shop for 50 years, already provides for annual physicals and 12 months of infant care under its contract with the Glass, Molders, Pottery, Plastics and Allied Workers International Union. Mr. Lefere said that when contract talks open next year, he might propose adding a health club membership for workers. 
 Orbitform has already installed a fitness center, with exercise machines and showers that workers can use at lunchtime and before and after work.
 At Great Lakes Industry, which makes power-transmission equipment and auto parts, Larry Schultz, the president, marshaled some fellow exercise enthusiasts to clean up a storage area and transform it into a small fitness center. Mr. Schultz also got rid of the candy machines and offers free fruit and vegetable snacks. 
 Running on one of its treadmills helped Gary Lykins, a shipping and customer service manager at Great Lakes Industry, shed 45 pounds he had gained after he left the factory floor for a more sedentary job. ''I run 100 miles a month on that thing,'' Mr. Lykins said. 
 Great Lakes Industry and Orbitform also pay for health coaches, provided by Allegiance Health, who meet several times a year with employees and their spouses to guide them toward goals like losing weight, eating healthy food and lowering blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
 ''There are a lot of things you just don't think about until somebody sits down with you and explains,'' said Robert Dean, 36, a machinist who works the night shift at Great Lakes Industry. 
 His wife Sarah, 28, said she had not smoked for almost two years after they met with a coach for the first time. ''We both smoked before that, and we tried to quit a lot of times,'' she said.
 Mrs. Dean, who operates a day care center for 11 toddlers, said she put on weight after she and Robert were married. ''I didn't have to fit into my dress anymore,'' she said. ''It was kind of a mental thing.'' Now, with daily exercising and dutifully eating fruits and vegetables, she has slimmed down. ''I fit into a size 8,'' she said. ''I haven't fit into an 8 since sixth grade.'' 
 Great Lakes Industry, which is self-insured, offers single employees a $681-a-year reduction in their health insurance premiums if they participate in the wellness program. Married employees get the same reduction and an additional $681 discount for their spouses, who are required to join. The deductible is also waived, and co-payments for medical services are halved to 10 percent for participating workers. 
 The health coaches help establish goals for the workers, who are expected to ''make an honest effort'' to reach them, Mr. Schultz said. The coaches give special attention to people with chronic conditions like diabetes, asthma and heart disease.
 Last year, Great Lakes Industry added fully paid health ''prevention benefits,'' including immunization shots and physical exams. Participants must select a primary-care doctor and follow her recommendations.
 With 95 percent of its 65 or so employees participating in the program, health costs for Great Lakes Industry employees average $7,363 each last year, including $200 for the coach. That was down from $9,158 in 2006. 
 But ''return on investment is difficult to measure,'' Mr. Schultz said, because a small company's health costs were likely to be erratic from year to year, with variables like births, accidents and illnesses. He is estimating an average cost of $8,095 for 2008.
 ''I believe we have at least flattened or dampened the trend line,'' he said, referring to annual cost increases. His employees have been paying 14 to 20 percent of total costs, and he does not want to shift more of the costs to them. 
 ''These are factory folks,'' Mr. Schultz said. ''Health care is an important benefit. I don't believe the solution to the cost problem is to shift more to families. If they are actively participating in improving their health, we as an employer can afford to provide them with a rich benefit plan.'' 
 His daughter, Dr. Amy M. Schultz, began learning about health insurance when she helped out at Great Lakes Industry as a teenager; now she is director of prevention and community health at the local hospital, and she works with Prof. Dee Edington, director of the University of Michigan Health Management Research Center, which advises the Jackson programs. 
 Participants fill out questionnaires about their medical history and health-related behavior, and the health risk appraisals and analyses for the employers are conducted through the U.M. Health Management Research Center, Dr. Schultz said.
 Phil Sponsler, the president of Orbitform, said he was ''a big proponent'' of the program. He is 6-foot-3 and weighed 248 pounds when he learned that his blood pressure was high, he said. Now he gets up early and works out with a friend (who happens to be his cardiologist). When he gets to work at 6:30 a.m., he eats his own concoction of cereal, nuts, olive oil, flax seed and cinnamon for breakfast. He said he now weighs 231 and his blood pressure is managed.
 Ms. Fojtasek of Allegiance Health said businesspeople on the hospital's board, like Mr. Shirkey and Mr. Schultz, had encouraged the hospital to push for health improvements in Jackson.
 Healthy employees are good for business in more ways than one, Mr. Schultz said, adding, ''We treat our customers and each other better when we are feeling good.''

HEADLINE: Small Banks Score a Coup By Lobbying

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS; David Stout contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- An obscure proposal to increase federal insurance on bank deposits won the support of the Bush administration, both presidential candidates and Republican and Democratic lawmakers on Tuesday, in a major lobbying coup for community banks.
 At the same time that the measure was being hailed by Democrats and Republicans as a way to rescue the rescue plan, thousands of independent bankers scrambled to drum up support for the package in communities across the country. 
 The chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Sheila C. Bair, gave a ringing endorsement for the concept of increasing the limit on insured deposits to $250,000 from $100,000, at least temporarily. 
 She was following the presidential candidates, Senator Barack Obama and Senator John McCain, who had announced their strong support for the idea earlier in the day.
 Republicans and Democrats vied to claim the popular idea as their own. Republican lawmakers said they had championed it during last weekend's heated negotiations over the scope of the bailout bill, but that Democratic leaders had rejected it.
 Democrats said they had no recollection of that provision being proffered in the chaotic talks, but top Democratic Congressional aides said the leadership was willing to add it to the bill and knew of no opposition. 
 Increasing the cap on deposit insurance, proponents say, would bolster confidence in the banking system and would help small-business owners, who often keep more than $100,000 to meet payroll or for daily operations.
 The idea has been discussed and even embraced abroad. France and Ireland, for example, have decided that all bank deposits will be insured, without limit, until the global crisis has passed.
 But the real force behind it -- and the big beneficiary -- was the group that represents 8,000 local banks across the country, the Independent Community Bankers of America. The group has been in a long-running battle with rival financial institutions like money-market mutual funds and money management companies over insured deposits. 
 On Tuesday morning, as administration officials tried to map out a strategy for salvaging the bailout plan, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. held a conference call with members of the banking group. By the afternoon, the group's top officials in Washington had sent out an urgent appeal asking bankers to hold ''citizens' meetings'' that night to promote the bailout in any district where a member of Congress had voted against it.
 Camden R. Fine, president of the Independent Community Bankers of America, said that the group had members in every Congressional district and that, ''If we want to go grass roots, we can go grass roots.'' He added, ''We might be small, but we're pretty nimble.'' 
 It remained unclear whether that effort would deliver any extra votes. 
 Democratic and Republican leaders on Tuesday were sorting through short lists of other possible sweeteners to attract new votes for the bailout measure. Democrats raised the possibility of wooing liberal lawmakers, who saw the plan as too tilted toward Wall Street, by adding an economic stimulus measure to extend unemployment benefits and food-stamp assistance.
 But Congressional leaders seemed most intent on attaching the deposit insurance proposal, possibly without charging higher premiums to banks, as the best way to save the bill. There were also plans to attach provisions that would extend a long list of expiring tax breaks, including $14 billion for renewable energy projects. 
 Some versions call for a permanent increase in the insured deposits. A permanent increase would have to be financed with an increase in premiums paid by the banks, though that increase might not happen immediately.
 Regardless of the details, Mr. Fine said, an increase in federal deposit insurance has been a passion of his members -- especially now that federal regulators have begun putting taxpayer money behind shotgun marriages for loss-plagued banking giants like Washington Mutual.
 ''If we have learned one thing in the past several weeks, it is that we have a two-tiered banking system in this country,'' Mr. Fine said. ''We have the too-big-to-fail banks and we have the smaller banks. You can't have one class of depositors who are 100 percent protected and another class of depositors who face risk.''
 Investment firms and mutual fund companies, which compete in the market for low-risk savings instruments, have opposed higher deposit insurance out of fear that the banks would receive an unfair advantage over them.
 The banks, meanwhile, have ardently opposed attempts to offer federal insurance on deposits in money-market mutual funds.
 In fact, both the American Bankers Association and Mr. Fine's independent bankers protested last week when the Treasury Department announced a new program to protect depositors in money-market mutual funds, which until last week were not guaranteed against loss. 
 ''I was on the phone with Treasury less than 30 minutes after they made the announcement,'' Mr. Fine said on Tuesday.
 The Bush administration quickly retreated. Instead of offering to insure all deposits in money-market funds, it said it would insure only deposits made before the panic broke out on Sept. 19 and it said the insurance would last only for an initial period of three months. 
 As it scrambled to rescue the bailout, the Bush administration signaled its strong support for an increase in deposit insurance and left open the issue of whether banks should have to pay for it. The F.D.I.C's reserves are already being depleted by losses from the failure of banks.
 Ms. Bair has already said that the agency would have to increase premiums to shore up the insurance fund's reserves as officials brace for a wave of additional bank failures. 
 By more than doubling the protection on insured bank deposits, the government would increase its exposure to potential costs down the road. If the F.D.I.C.'s reserve fund cannot cover its costs, it has the authority to borrow money from the Treasury. Taxpayers would almost certainly have to foot the bill. 
 Indeed, many experts contend that Congress's decision to increase the limits on deposit insurance in 1990, to $100,000, from $40,000 per account, lulled depositors into complacency, encouraged reckless lending by savings and loan institutions and led to huge losses that ultimately cost the government more than $200 billion.

HEADLINE: Failed Deals Replace Real Estate Boom

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
After seven years of nonstop construction, skyrocketing rents and sales prices, and a seemingly endless appetite for luxury housing that transformed gritty and glamorous neighborhoods alike, the credit crisis and the turmoil on Wall Street are bringing New York's real estate boom to an end.
 Developers are complaining that lenders are now refusing to finance projects that were all but certain months or even weeks ago. Landlords bewail their inability to refinance skyscrapers with blue-chip tenants. And corporations are afraid to relocate within Manhattan for fear of making the wrong move if rents fall or a flagging economy forces layoffs. 
 ''Lenders are now taking a very hard look at each particular project to assess its viability in the context of a softening of demand,'' said Scott A. Singer, executive vice president of Singer & Bassuk, a real estate finance and brokerage firm. ''There's no question that there'll be a significant slowdown in new construction starts, immediately.''
 Examples of aborted deals and troubled developments abound. Last Friday, HSBC, the big Hong Kong-based bank, quietly tore up an agreement to move its American headquarters to 7 World Trade Center after bids for its existing home at 452 Fifth Avenue, between 39th and 40th Streets, came in 30 percent lower than the $600 million it wanted for the property. 
 A 40-story office tower under construction by SJP Properties at 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue for the past 18 months still does not have a tenant.
 And the law firm of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe last week suddenly pulled out of what had been an all-but-certain lease of 300,000 square feet of space at Citigroup Center, deciding instead to extend its lease at 666 Fifth Avenue for five years, in part because they hope rents will fall.
 ''Everything's frozen in place,'' said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, the industry's lobbying association, shortly after the stock market closed on Monday.
 Barry M. Gosin, chief executive of Newmark Knight Frank, a national real estate firm based in New York, said: ''Today, the entire financial system needs a lubricant. It's kind of like driving your car after running out of oil and the engine seizes up. If there's no liquidity and no financing, everything seizes up.''
 It is hard to say exactly what the long-term impact will be, but real estate experts, economists and city and state officials say it is likely there will be far fewer new construction projects in the future, as well as tens of thousands of layoffs on Wall Street, fewer construction jobs and a huge loss of tax revenue for both the state and the city. 
 Few trends have defined the city more than the development boom, from the omnipresent tower cranes to the explosion of high-priced condominiums in neighborhoods outside Manhattan, from Bedford-Stuyvesant and Fort Greene to Williamsburg and Long Island City. Some developers who are currently erecting condominiums are trying to convert to rentals, while others are looking to sell the projects. 
 After imposing double-digit rent increases in recent years, landlords say rents are falling somewhat, which could hurt highly leveraged projects, but also slow gentrification in what real estate brokers like to call ''emerging neighborhoods'' like Harlem, the Lower East Side and Fort Greene.
 At the same time, some of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's most ambitious large-scale projects -- the West Side railyards, Pennsylvania Station, ground zero, Coney Island and Willets Point -- are going to take longer than expected to start and to complete, real estate experts say.
 ''Most transactions in commercial real estate are on hold,'' said Mary Ann Tighe, regional chief executive for CB Richard Ellis, the real estate brokerage firm, ''because nobody can be sure what the economy will look like, not only in the near term, but in the long term.''
 Although the real estate market in New York is in better shape than in most other major cities, a recent report by Newmark Knight Frank shows that there are ''clear signs of weakness,'' with the overall vacancy rate at 9 percent, up from 8.2 percent a year ago. Rents are also falling when landlord concessions are taken into account.
 The real estate boom has been fueled by a robust economy, a steady demand for housing and an abundance of foreign and domestic investors willing to spend tens of billions of dollars on New York real estate. It helped that lenders were only too happy to finance as much as 90 percent of the cost on the assumption that the mortgages could be resold to investors as securities.
 But that ended with the subprime mortgage crisis, which has since spilled over to all the credit markets, which have come to a standstill. As a result, real estate executives estimate that the value of commercial buildings has fallen by at least 20 percent, though the decline is hard to gauge when there is little mortgage money available to buy the buildings and therefore few sales.
 Long after the crisis began in 2007, many investors and real estate executives expected a ''correction'' to the rapid escalation in property values. But after Lehman Brothers, the venerable firm that had provided billions of dollars of loans for New York real estate deals, collapsed two weeks ago, it was clear that something more profound was afoot.
 And there was an immediate reaction in the real estate world: Tishman Speyer Properties, which controls Rockefeller Center, the Chrysler Building and scores of other properties, abruptly pulled out of a deal to buy the former Mobil Building, a 1.6 million-square-foot tower on 42nd Street, near Grand Central Terminal, for $400 million, two executives involved in the transaction said.
 Commercial properties are not the only ones facing problems. On Friday, Standard & Poor's dropped its rating on the bonds used in Tishman's $5.4 billion purchase of the Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village apartment complexes in 2006, the biggest real estate deal in modern history. Standard & Poor's said it cut the rating, in part, because of an estimated 10 percent decline in the properties' value and the rapid depletion of reserve funds.
 The rating reduction shows the growing nervousness of lenders and investors about such deals, which have often involved aggressive -- critics say unrealistic -- projections of future income.
 ''Any continued impediment to the credit markets is awful for the national economy, but it's more awful for New York,'' said Richard Lefrak, patriarch of a fourth-generation real estate family that owns office buildings and apartment houses in New York and New Jersey.
 ''This is the company town for money,'' he said. ''If there's no liquidity in the system, it exacerbates the problems. It's going to have a serious effect on the local economy and real estate values.''

CORRECTION-DATE: October 3, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about failing real estate deals in New York following the turmoil on Wall Street referred incorrectly to the status of a plan by the law firm of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe to lease space at Citigroup Center. The law firm is still considering the move, a partner said, and has not in fact decided to extend its lease at its current location, 666 Fifth Avenue. The article also misidentified the city where HSBC -- which has canceled plans to move its American headquarters to 7 World Trade Center -- is based. It is London, not Hong Kong.

HEADLINE: A Return to West Texas for Another Football Season

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
It seems especially apt that ''Friday Night Lights'' should return to television for its third season just when any prospect of a brighter economic future has come to seem like a fool's prophecy. 
 Dillon, the West Texas town where the series is set, has always been a place in need of a bailout, financially, and emotionally too. There are few jobs beyond the parameters of the Applebee's parking lot, and the only ways to make real money seem to be selling cars or crystal meth. 
 Dillon is red state America scaled down to ''Winesburg, Ohio'' dimensions and more poetically portrayed. The town revolves around the world of high school football, but its existential battle is elsewhere: what Dillon is always fighting is the disease of diminished expectations. The fundamentals are in no way strong. 
 ''Friday Night Lights'' (which begins Wednesday on DirecTV, the satellite subscription service that is helping finance it, and moves to NBC in February) is delivered with the precision and manner of ethnography -- it never condescends. 
 The story picks up nine months after the last season ended. A new school year has begun, and Coach Taylor's wife, Tami, played by the wonderful Connie Britton, has been promoted from guidance counselor to principal of Dillon High School, which puts her on the front lines of the district's budgetary crisis. 
 There is apparently no money for chalk or new textbooks. Underpaid educators are fleeing for parochial schools. Boosters for the Dillon Panthers have raised a whole heap of money, but they are insisting that it go to a scoreboard worthy of the Dallas Cowboys.
 ''We've lost four teachers to budget cuts this year,'' Tami explains to the boosters' commando, Buddy Garrity, played grandly by Brad Leland as if the character were Texas itself. ''We need a Jumbotron, you think?''
 The culture of football is constantly shown to be imposing priorities beyond the field and obscuring any alternatives. The college scholarship prospects of the star running back, Smash Williams (Gaius Charles), have been scuttled first by a suspension during his senior year and then by an injury in the intervening months. The new season finds him working full time at a soft ice cream franchise, the Alamo Freeze.
 Smash has a devoted mother, but most of the young people in Dillon rely on the Taylors as surrogate parents: their own mothers and fathers have given themselves over to debilitating habits or have simply given up. In children's literature and, by extension, television's depictions of adolescence, the sons and daughters of the absent mythically manage to thrive. But there is nothing remotely fantastical about ''Friday Night Lights'' -- the uncared-for scuffle and suffer. 
 The sense of anxious desperation caused by lack of guidance seems heightened this season. Tyra (Adrianne Palicki), all pluck and long leg, has bloomed fully into a heroine from a '30s or '40s melodrama, and I mean that in the best possible way. She is determined not to turn out like her unemployed mother, abandoned by one man after another, or her stripper sister, whom she envisions someday divorced and constantly hankering for more child support. 
 Tyra becomes intent on going to a good college, even though an undermining vice principal belittles her for thinking that with a 2.6 grade point average she could get into the University of Texas, Austin, because, really, she ought just to be thinking about Dillon Tech.
 ''Friday Night Lights'' both compellingly honors conservative codes of family values, and doesn't: the discrepancy has perhaps nowhere been clearer than it seems to be this season. The two-parent family is idealized, but at the same time religion is understood as an unreliable savior, and sex as a consistent comfort.
 Last season Lyla Garrity (Minka Kelly) turned to evangelical Christianity after her parents' divorce and her own complicated relationships started to undo her. Although the conversion was depicted with unusual sensitivity, the writers refused to present faith as any kind of tranquilizer for teenage lust. Lyla had a kind, churchgoing boyfriend, but we knew that she wanted her ex, Tim (Taylor Kitsch), in all of his dreamy vulnerability and broad wingspan and louche ways, and that prayer wasn't going to cure the ache. The new season skips over the details of breakup and reunion, and begins with Tim and Lyla simply together, as if to suggest what a lopsided matchup the battle between sacred fealty and profane passion really is.
 In its third season ''Friday Night Lights'' still charges along with so much to recommend it. Wednesday night also signals the return of ''Dirty Sexy Money,'' but watching that now seems like bad manners.

HEADLINE: A View From Wall Street

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
I went to Wall Street on Monday afternoon to see what the agonies of American-style financial capitalism would look like close up. As I watched the lines of suits marching grimly up the street, I was taken aback by the normality of the scene. 
 News that the Bush administration's $700 billion bailout package had been slapped down in the House of Representatives did seem to add to the excitement around the New York Stock Exchange. There was a couple holding up signs observing that ''Capitalism is Dead'' and suggesting that a ''Workers Revolution is the Solution.'' 
 A large, white-bearded man in a green robe and a skull cap who called himself God's ''warner'' angrily lectured a dozen or so people waiting for their dates on the steps of the Federal Hall National Memorial, pointing to a hamburger he recovered from a trash bin as proof of America's moral failings.
 On the corner of Broadway, a man in boxing gloves and a derby hat harangued the throngs making their way up Wall Street while balancing a large slice of watermelon on his head. ''I am not a Democrat. I am not a Republican. I am an American,'' he said, adding something about smoking, drinking and Google. I overheard a pin-striped man confessing into his cellphone: ''I'm sorry I didn't tell you to buy puts.'' 
 I'm not sure what I thought I'd find on my pilgrimage. Who knows what to expect of a financier who just saw the Dow drop 777 points? What I didn't expect was a scene that looked pretty much like any busy street in Manhattan around 5 p.m. Indeed, to me the most salient feature was the proliferation of TV cameras and the throngs of tourists snapping pictures of what, I assume, they thought was a historic occasion.
 I don't know quite what to make of the routine quality of this commotion. The financial crisis sweeping across the world still has a ways to run. Spilling over from Wall Street to Main Street, it threatens to drag the world economy into a steep recession. Chances are that the world that will emerge from this will be unlike the world we know. 
 But the sense of everyday bedlam did impress upon me just how many conversations can be going on at the same time. And they are all going on here. EDUARDO PORTER

HEADLINE: New York to Seek Grants To Save Threatened Jobs

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Expecting the loss of as many as 120,000 jobs in the region because of the financial crisis emanating from Wall Street, New York State officials are preparing to ask for more than $60 million in federal aid to preserve threatened jobs and retrain displaced workers. 
 Labor department commissioners from several states, including New Jersey and Connecticut, were to discuss the potential fallout with federal officials on Wednesday, said M. Patricia Smith, New York's labor commissioner. 
 She said that her department had been working closely with New Jersey officials to coordinate assistance for people losing jobs in financial services, many of whom commute between states.
 ''What we're saying is we're having an economic emergency here,'' Ms. Smith said. ''We're predicting 40,000 jobs lost in the financial sector and an additional 80,000 jobs as secondary effects. That's 120,000 people that we need to help find jobs.''
 To help the state shoulder the cost of the expected demand, Ms. Smith said, her department planned to apply for national emergency grants from the federal Department of Labor, as it did after the 9/11 terrorist attack. 
 In 2001, the state received an emergency grant of $20 million for retraining, a spokesman for the state labor department said; the state used $16 million and returned the remainder. Other states have received emergency grants after natural disasters, like Hurricane Katrina.
 New York will seek $10 million to help those who are laid off find new jobs or develop skills to change careers, Ms. Smith said. The state plans to ask for an additional grant of $50 million to preserve, through subsidies, jobs lost or threatened by the financial crisis.
 As a hypothetical example, Ms. Smith said, a subsidy could pay part of the wages of workers in a restaurant in Manhattan's financial district whose jobs would otherwise be eliminated because of a decline in business. 
 She said similar wage subsidies had been used to preserve jobs in the garment district and in other sectors after 9/11. The federal labor department, for example, gave a $1 million emergency grant to help workers in Chinatown after the attack. The wage subsidies would go mostly to lower-paid, less-skilled workers whose jobs would be indirectly jeopardized by the expected layoffs in financial services, Ms. Smith said. 
 Separately, she said, the department would use some of the retraining grant to create a placement office specifically for laid-off professionals in financial services. That center would be in the department's offices on Varick Street in Manhattan, she said.
 The New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development has a similar professional services group at its One-Stop Career Center in Dover in Morris County, said Jack Patten, director of the Morris-Sussex-Warren Workforce Investment Board. This year, that group has helped more than 25 professionals find new jobs with salaries of more than $100,000 a year, Mr. Patten said.
 The first step in applying for federal aid will be for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to jointly seek a regional innovation grant of $250,000 to gauge the economic impact of the cutbacks in financial services and identify other industries that are growing and could absorb some of the cast-off workers, Ms. Smith said. That application should be filed this week, she said.
 ''New York will be the lead state on the grant,'' said Kevin Smith, a spokesman for New Jersey's labor department in Trenton. He said he thought that the applications for the much larger emergency grants would be filed on behalf of the region but he did not know what amounts would be sought. 
 He said New Jersey officials did not yet have an estimate of how many jobs might be lost as a result of the financial crisis.
 Likewise, Connecticut's labor commissioner, Patricia H. Mayfield, said it was ''too preliminary to assess the impact of the last several weeks on our workforce.'' She added that, ''recognizing that Connecticut workers could be very much affected by what is happening on Wall Street, our state will continue to talk with our neighbors regarding a joint grant request.''
 Ms. Smith said collaboration would be necessary because many of the jobs lost will be scattered around the region, in the towns where Wall Street workers live. 
 ''We want to be able to try to show that the impact is a regional impact,'' Ms. Smith said. ''It's not just New York. Lots of people who are primarily affected live in New Jersey or Connecticut. Therefore, lots of people who will be secondarily affected work in the areas where these people live.''

HEADLINE: At a Tipping Point

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Carter Dougherty contributed reporting from Frankfurt and Andrew Kramer from Moscow.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Barely a week after Europeans rebuffed American pleas to join in their bailout of the banking system, Europe now faces a financial crisis almost as grave as that in the United States -- demonstrating how swiftly this contagion is spreading around the world.
 In the last two days, governments from London to Berlin have seized or bailed out five faltering banks. In Ireland, where rumors of panicked withdrawals from banks spooked the stock market, the government has offered a two-year blanket guarantee on all deposits and bank debt.
 Asia has been less buffeted by the turmoil, though a brief run on a bank in Hong Kong last week brought back dark memories of June 1997, when speculation against the Thai currency sparked a financial crisis that fanned rapidly across Asia, and later to Brazil and Russia.
 Economists see a parallel between these two crises a decade apart: once creditors panic and begin to pull out their holdings, the underlying health of banks -- or entire countries -- no longer matters a great deal. In a global financial system, national borders are porous. 
 ''In this day and age, a bank run spreads around the world, not around the block,'' said Thomas Mayer, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank. ''Once a bank run is under way, it doesn't matter anymore if you have good loans or bad loans. People lose confidence in you.''
 In a sign of how vulnerable Russia remains to contagion, officials halted trading on the Moscow stock exchange for two hours on Tuesday morning, fearing investor reaction to the House's rejection of the Bush administration's bailout plan. Trading resumed, and after President Bush vowed to win approval of the package, shares bounced back.
 ''People ask, 'What on earth is happening with Russia?' '' said Roland Nash, chief analyst at Renaissance Bank in Moscow. ''Russia is reacting to the unprecedented size, complexity and danger coming out of the U.S.''
 The shock waves could reverberate to the United States, experts said, since Russia has plowed its oil wealth into American debt, including Fannie Mae's. Russia has additional problems, including unstable oil prices and a newly assertive foreign policy that is unpopular with many investors. 
 The trigger for the loss of confidence in Europe, Mr. Mayer and other experts said, was the Treasury Department's decision two weeks ago to let Lehman Brothers fail. That ricocheted through European markets, hurting banks and retail investors with exposure to Lehman.
 It took a few days longer for Europeans to digest the implications of the collapse. But now that they have, they are turning a remorseless eye on other institutions they suspect of being vulnerable.
 As the White House scrambles to retool its rescue plan for the financial system, the global creep of the crisis has far-reaching implications, administration officials and outside experts said.
 It is likely to move Europeans to mount a more coordinated effort to shore up banks, a move that the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., pleaded for last week. President Nicolas Sarkozy of France is calling for a minisummit of leaders in Paris on Friday.
 ''We all agree that the method by which everyone comes up with ad hoc solutions in his corner the moment a crisis starts in a financial company isn't a systematic enough method,'' said Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg, chairman of a group of European finance officials.
 On Tuesday, France and Belgium threw a $9 billion lifeline to Dexia, a Belgian-French lender -- a day after Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg cobbled together $16.2 billion to rescue another bank, Fortis.
 Europe's woes could place additional burdens on an American plan, as more banks fall into distress. If the Treasury wins Congressional approval to buy mortgage-related securities from banks, how it prices those assets will affect the solvency of European institutions.
 Some of these banks suffer a form of guilt by association by being in the home lending business. Others, like Fortis, lack a strong base of deposits, which acts as a buffer against credit-related jitters.
 Countries that suffered housing bubbles -- like Ireland, Britain and Spain -- are especially vulnerable, as are several Eastern European countries and other emerging markets, which are running steep current account deficits and low foreign currency reserves.
 Ireland's finance minister, Brian Lenihan, traced his country's predicament back to Lehman Brothers, saying that the American authorities ''were mistaken in permitting that bank to go to the wall because it has had very serious consequences for the world financial system.''
 The Irish plan guarantees bank deposits and debt for customers and creditors of six banks. That makes the government responsible for $400 billion, twice the country's economic output.
 Experts predict a rash of bank failures in Europe, though some say the process may prove less politically fraught than in the United States, given the tradition of nationalization there. 
 So far, the hurdle to a broader plan has been the European Union's legal and political restrictions that require burden-sharing and consensus. ''The Europeans are more rigid and rule-based than the Americans,'' said Simon Johnson, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. ''But when things get bad enough, they'll find the flexibility.''
 One red flag, he said, is UBS, the giant Swiss bank that is heavily exposed to mortgage-related securities and is headquartered in a small country that is not a member of the union. ''Opinion is divided as to whether Switzerland could bail out UBS,'' Mr. Johnson said.
 Beyond individual banks, the United States has to worry about the health of major holders of American government debt, from Russia and China to oil-producing states in the Middle East.
 Russia is a particular concern, experts said. With oil prices swooning and its own banks in crisis, it is coming under financial strain. If the Russians were to sell off their American debt holdings, it could depress the dollar and multiply the cost of a bailout.
 Russia has already begun whittling its vast foreign reserves to finance an aid program for its banks. American officials said shifts in foreign holdings of American debt were not great.
 Other big creditors, like China, are in better shape financially, according to experts. But even there, growth is slowing, as trans-Pacific trade dries up. Should that contraction be traumatic and cause a banking crisis, it could lead the Chinese to sell their American holdings, these experts say. 
 The dollar has also remained remarkably stable, given the turmoil on Wall Street and in Washington -- another sign, economists said, that foreign investors have not yet lost faith in the United States. Partly, though, that reflects a paucity of other safe places to invest money.
 ''We would run into a huge problem if foreigners lost confidence,'' said Kenneth S. Rogoff, an economist at Harvard. ''The rest of the world will give us several swings at the ball before they give up on us.''

HEADLINE: A Recovery In Shares On Hopes Of a Bailout

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM and VIKAS BAJAJ; Diana Henriques and Matthew Saltmarsh contributed reporting.

 BODY:
It seemed, by many accounts, a far happier day than the last. 
 Hours after their worst drop since 1987, stocks reversed course on Tuesday and headed right back up on hopes that lawmakers were nearing an agreement on a bailout for the financial system. The Dow industrials jumped 485.21 points, erasing more than half its loss from Monday. Bank stocks rose sharply, investors were lured out of Treasury bonds, and the dollar soared.
 But alarms were sounding elsewhere in the byzantine channels of the global financial system, sending a clear message that the health of the world's economy remained at risk of worsening. 
 Even as President Bush and Congressional leaders worked to make a rescue plan palatable to lawmakers, the flow of credit neared a standstill, making it more difficult for businesses to obtain the money they need for routine expenses like utilities and payroll. Banks were still reluctant to lend, despite billions of dollars of cash offered up by central banks around the world. Early on Tuesday, banks were charging one another the highest overnight borrowing costs ever recorded, as measured by an important rate known as Libor. 
 Even the triple-digit stock rally, spurred by investors' hopes that Congress will approve a revised version of a bailout plan, represented yet another of the big daily swings that reflect fragility and fear. 
 ''This remains a volatile market,'' said Quincy Krosby, the chief investment strategist at the Hartford, a financial services firm. ''It remains a market that will move on headlines, on rumor. And it's a market that has divorced itself from fundamentals.''
 Of course, Tuesday's rally was not unwelcome. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.3 percent, more than halving its 8.8 percent loss from Monday, the biggest single-day decline since Oct. 19, 1987. The Dow rose 4.7 percent to close at 10,850.66. The Nasdaq composite index gained 5 percent. 
 Shares of banks and financial firms, which have been beaten down in recent weeks, rallied across the board. Bank of America, Citigroup and Merrill Lynch shares all rose 15 percent. 
 Many analysts say they believe the bailout will be necessary to relieve the problems in the credit markets, which they say pose a more serious threat to the economy than the recent declines in stocks. 
 But in the eyes of the public, the Dow can often be the most visible gauge of the economy's health. Some analysts hoped that a silver lining of Monday's sell-off would be an increased urgency among lawmakers to pass a revised bill.
 ''While some policy makers don't understand exotic funding markets, they definitely understand what nearly 1,000 points off the D.J.I.A. in one day's time means,'' Michael T. Darda, chief economist at the research firm MKM Partners in Greenwich, Conn., wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday morning.
 Nonetheless, problems in the credit markets were widespread on Tuesday, making it more difficult for businesses and consumers to obtain financing, and driving down the value of assets held by money-market funds. 
 The interest rate on one-day commercial paper -- usually a cheap source of financing for businesses -- jumped to 3.95 percent, from 2.24 percent on Monday, pushing up the cost of these short-term loans. 
 In a sign that banks were increasingly unwilling to lend to one another, the Fed funds rate that they charge each other to get overnight loans to finance day-to-day operations, jumped as high as 7 percent on Tuesday morning -- well above the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target -- before gradually falling back.
 In the money-market world, institutional and retail investors appeared to be seeking more safety by transferring cash to funds that invest only in government securities, considered among the safest. From Sept. 15 to Monday, $372 billion, or 19 percent of their total assets, flowed out of prime funds. That reduced the amount of money available to corporations that count on these investors to purchase their short-term notes, which help supply their daily cash needs. 
 ''The money markets have completely broken down, with no trading taking place at all,'' Christoph Rieger, a fixed-income strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort in Frankfurt, said. ''Central banks are the only providers of cash to the market; no one else is lending.''
 Tuesday was also the close of the third quarter, a day when money managers must disclose their holdings. That tends to make them more cautious about how they manage their portfolios, which they hope to present in a favorable light. 
 Louis V. Crandall, chief economist at the research firm Wrightson ICAP, said the end-of-quarter pressures had been even greater this month because of the problems in the credit market. Many money-market funds, he said, were lending money only for a day at a time rather than for several months.
 Managers of those funds have been swamped with requests from investors looking to withdraw their money after units in a multibillion-dollar money-market fund fell below a dollar last week.
 ''Everyone is concerned even more about liquidity than about credit,'' Mr. Crandall said. ''As a result, everyone's investment horizon has come in sharply.''
 Wrightson ICAP, Mr. Crandall's firm, conducts a daily, anonymous survey of bank borrowing costs in New York. On Tuesday, its survey showed that banks were paying 4.356 percent for one-month unsecured loans, up from 2.499 percent a month earlier.
 Caution remained despite additional efforts by central banks to jump-start the flow of credit. The European Central Bank lent out 190 billion euros, or $273 billion, to banks to help unlock the hoarding mentality that has gripped them. The Bank of Japan pumped another $29 billion into credit markets.
 European stocks ended higher on Tuesday after a volatile session, helped along by the rise in the New York indexes. The FTSE-100 in London gained 1.7 percent; the CAC-40 in Paris rose 2 percent; and Frankfurt's DAX index rose 0.4 percent.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury bill fell 2 1/32, to 101 14/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 3.82 percent, up from 3.58 percent late Monday.
 Following are the results of Tuesday's Treasury auction of 15-day cash management bills and four-week bills.

HEADLINE: Medical Matchmaking: Towns Need Doctors, The Doctors Need Visas

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
Glossy chamber of commerce brochures from small towns and rural areas along Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River and in the Adirondack Mountains beckoned on tables in the Sheraton New York Hotel in Midtown Manhattan. But it was not the allure of hiking, fishing or wineries -- or even the free cookies and coffee -- that attracted scores of novice doctors to a job fair on Sunday.
 It was the possibility of a green card. 
 Many of the doctors, residents at New York City hospitals, had come from abroad on visas, including the restrictive J-1 ''exchange visa,'' which requires them to return home for two years once they finish their studies unless they can get a waiver to work in a medically underserved area. New York State recommends about 30 doctors for J-1 visa waivers annually; typically half of the visas go to doctors working in neighborhoods like Washington Heights or the South Bronx and half to upstate communities that do not have enough physicians.
 Getting such a waiver is akin to winning the lottery, and to apply for a ticket, doctors must have a signed employment contract, said Caleb C. Wistar, a State Health Department planner who was at the job fair to give advice. ''This is the shining prize of working in underserved areas for people who are not citizens,'' he said.
 Visa politics helped turn the job fair into a matchmaking exercise. The 30 upstate hospitals that sent representatives, whose expenses were covered by the Greater New York Hospital Association, promoted their towns' friendly neighbors and good schools. The immigrant doctors, willing to relocate for economic and professional opportunities, listened politely, then worked up the courage to ask what for many of them was the most pressing question: ''Do you sponsor visas?''
 Dr. Ranka Bulajic, a Serb, analyzed the job market by ethnicity: Eastern Europeans, she explained, were willing to work in colder climates like northern New York State or Oregon, while those from Africa or the Caribbean tended to prefer Alabama or Virginia. Dr. Jiwu Sun, who graduated from China's prestigious Third Military Medical University, said that, at the age of 40 -- and with a wife, two children and limited English -- he was in no position to make demands of potential employers. Dr. Nadia Ferder, 34, who was born in the United States but grew up in Buenos Aires, said she did not want to return to Argentina because the economy was so bad that ''lawyers, economists, doctors, architects, they are all driving cabs.''
 Many studies show that newly trained American doctors, burdened with student loans and seeking status and challenges, gravitate toward urban centers. A 2007 study of physician recruitment by the Center for Health Workforce Studies at the State University of New York at Albany found that physicians practicing upstate were more likely to have come from outside New York than their downstate counterparts.
 The study said that when doctors had trouble finding jobs, the main reason was their reluctance to look outside the most desirable locations, like New York City. While many American doctors aspire to work on Park Avenue, experts say, foreign-born doctors are willing to take more modest jobs as a way of establishing a toehold in the United States. 
 Dr. Romina Tollerutti, 31, who graduated from medical school at the University of Buenos Aires, said she learned English six years ago when she decided to come to the United States for her residency, and had struggled with the unfamiliar multiple-choice format of the medical-licensing exam. She and her husband, also a doctor, hope that fluency of Spanish will help make them more attractive to employers. 
 Dr. Tollerutti said that even as a third-year pediatric resident at Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens, she was doing better financially than she would as a fully trained doctor in Argentina. ''We are not saving money,'' Dr. Tollerutti said. ''But we have a cellphone, we have cable, I pay rent, and we have money to go out.''
 Like other foreign-born physicians, Dr. Tollerutti said that having gone to a government-run medical school, where her tuition was free, made her more flexible in her job possibilities than many of her American colleagues who had to pay off staggering student loans.
 Dr. Bulajic, 35, who earned her medical degree from the University of Kragujevac in Serbia and has Canadian citizenship, is doing her residency at St. John's Episcopal Hospital in Far Rockaway.
 She said New York City hospitals have their pick among residents and would rather hire a doctor with a green card than sponsor someone for a visa waiver. To work in Canada, she said, she would need another year of training. Her husband is an electrician, and they would prefer to live in an area where construction jobs are plentiful. But Dr. Bulajic is pregnant and her mother lives in Toronto, so a job in upstate New York sounded appealing, she said.
 One of her competitors for a waiver was Dr. Andre Phillips, 27, from Barbados, who said he had earned his medical degree at the University of the West Indies campus in Jamaica, tuition-free, before landing a residency in internal medicine at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn. Dr. Phillips is scheduled to finish his residency in 2010, on a J-1 visa.
 Dr. Phillips said he had been solicited by hospitals in the Dakotas, but would rather stay on the East Coast, closer to his family in Barbados. His goal, he said, was not to be rich but to be comfortable. ''Money is not the reason I went into medicine,'' he said, adding that he would be satisfied with ''a nice three-bedroom house and a sedan.''
 A recruiter from the Finger Lakes region said her hospital could sponsor visas.
 ''How about the lawyer's fee?'' Dr. Phillips asked.
 ''We reimburse that,'' the recruiter replied.
 Nearby, Rich Duvall, a human resources administrator for Carthage Area Hospital in Carthage, N.Y., gave the hard sell to a doctor from India and his family. Carthage, a medically underserved area that calls itself ''the gateway to the Adirondacks,'' had it all, he said: snow sports, river sports, hiking and, thanks to the soldiers at nearby Fort Drum, diversity.

HEADLINE: The Crisis, as Seen By the Have-Nots

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com

 BODY:
On a chair outside Johnson's Barbecue on Tinton Avenue in the Bronx, Keith McLean had thoroughly considered the $700 billion bailout of Wall Street.
 ''That's for C.E.O.'s,'' said Mr. McLean. ''And I am a P-O-O-R.''
 Mr. McLean, who helps out in the barbecue stand, lives in one of the poorest Congressional districts in the country, a half-hour subway ride to Wall Street. On Monday, Jose E. Serrano, the Democrat who represents the district, voted against the bailout package. He was the only member of Congress from the city to do so. 
 In a walk through parts of the district, it was easy to find people who, while indifferent to the outcome of the vote, were intensely interested in the machinations leading to the drama of closed banks and astronomical bailouts. For many, the financial package was another in a series of manufactured crises.
 James Jacobs, who cuts hair at Six Corners Barbershop, said he felt that an atmosphere of paranoia had been deliberately cultivated, leading to the war in Iraq and now to the financial alarm.
 ''They scare people with bomb threats,'' Mr. Jacobs said. 
 Edwin Mitchell, who works in a car dealership, was sitting alongside him. ''We got stuck up,'' he said. 
 ''It's corporate America doing what corporate America does,'' Mr. Jacobs said.
 ''Organized crime,'' Mr. McLean said.
 ''It's the new organized crime,'' Mr. Jacobs said.
 ''Ain't nothing new about it,'' Mr. McLean said.
 ''We're not going to see none of that,'' Mr. Jacobs said. ''Not one red cent. Whichever way it goes. We ain't going to see it, we ain't going to feel it. If we do it feel it, its going to be negatively, and a few of us might lose a few jobs.''
 Mr. McLean had tracked the news carefully. ''Washington Mutual, he was on the job three weeks, he got $11 million,'' he said.
 Actually, it was more. Three weeks before Washington Mutual failed, it hired Alan H. Fishman as its chief executive officer, and paid him a signing bonus of $7.5 million. He is also eligible for $11.6 million in cash severance.
 For the men in front of Johnson's, there was plain symmetry between the Iraq war and the financial crisis: Young people shipped out to a trillion-dollar bloodbath in the Middle East, in pursuit of nonexistent weapons of mass destruction; and banks collapsing on top of mortgages handed out to people without enough money for a bag of groceries. And how, Mr. Mitchell wondered, could it be that Osama bin Laden had not been captured? ''You can look down from outer space and see a dime on a city street, and you can't find him?'' he said.
 From personal experience, he said, he knew that credit cards were another species of mirage. 
 ''How does a person get credit that never had a regular job, no bank account, no sign of being a respectable person, and he winds up with three or four credit cards?'' Mr. Mitchell asked. ''I was out of work there for a couple of years, and I ended up with three credit cards. American Express. Visa. I forget the other one. And the banks give all these loans to people knowing they can't pay, but they get a commission. Let them pay their commissions.''
 If disgust, or horror, at the bailout was universal, there was not unanimity on what had to be done. The owner of the barbecue stand, Dwayne Johnson, 50, said he was outraged that many members of the Congressional black caucus had voted against the bailout. 
 ''They voted no, they don't have that right,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''The only way you can help the community is get it passed. If you're the president and you can't get 10 votes to pass it, then that's bad. If you're Obama, you can't get 10 votes, that's bad.''
 Midaglia Rodriguez, 60, said that she worried that a new Depression was just over the horizon, and that she believed the bailout was necessary. ''It should go through, to fix the situation,'' she said.
 Regardless of the outcome of votes in Congress, Mr. Mitchell said, he would still face the daily struggle to make a living and keep a roof over his head.
 ''I love this country, the best country on the planet. I love this city, best city in the world,'' he said. ''I don't see a change that is going to affect me. I'm going to do what I always did. Survive. The best way I could.''

HEADLINE: An Urban Farmer's Dream Rewarded

BYLINE: By BARBARA MINER

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE 

 BODY:
 WILL ALLEN already had the makings of an agricultural dream packed into two scruffy acres in one of Milwaukee's most economically distressed neighborhoods.
 His Growing Power organization has six greenhouses and eight hoophouses for greens, herbs and vegetables; pens for goats, ducks and turkeys; a chicken coop and beehives; and a system for raising tilapia and perch. There's an advanced composting operation -- a virtual worm farm -- and a lab that is working on ways to turn food waste into fertilizer and methane gas for energy. 
 With a staff of about three dozen full-time workers and 2,000 residents pitching in as volunteers, his operation raises about $500,000 worth of affordable produce, meat and fish for one of what he calls the ''food deserts'' of American cities, where the only access to food is corner grocery stories filled with beer, cigarettes and processed foods. 
 Now, with a $500,000 ''genius grant'' that the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation awarded him last week, Mr. Allen is dreaming bigger.
 ''I'd like to see Growing Power transform itself into a five-story vertical building being totally off the grid with renewable energy, where people can come and learn, so they can go back to their communities around the world and grow healthy food,'' Mr. Allen, 59, said in an interview at the farm.
 For Mr. Allen, only the second working farmer to win the award, according to the foundation, his efforts are not meant simply to keep people well fed. He sees Growing Power as a way to organize people whose voices are rarely heard and to fight racism.
 ''I am a farmer first, and I love to grow food for people,'' Mr. Allen said. ''But it's also about growing power.''
 For 16 years, through sales, and proceeds from grants, he has extended Growing Power's operations in Milwaukee and Chicago, spreading the gospel of urban farming around the world and training fellow agricultural dreamers. 
 An imposing 6 feet 7 inches tall, Mr. Allen, who grew up on a farm outside Washington, D.C., played professional basketball for a time after college, mostly in Europe. In 1993, he left a job with Procter & Gamble and bought a roadside farm in Milwaukee's economically depressed north side -- the last remaining registered farm in the city -- and got local teenagers involved. 
 Now, along with its main farm in Milwaukee, Growing Power, a nonprofit group, has a 40-acre farm in a nearby town, and gardens throughout the city. The group also has operations in Chicago, including a garden at the Cabrini-Green housing project and urban farms in Grant and Jackson Parks. 
 In addition to retail sales at the Milwaukee headquarters, Growing Power sells to food co-ops, other retail stores and about 30 restaurants in the Milwaukee and Chicago areas. 
 The Growing Powers headquarters looks like a farm stand in need of a paint job and feels like a 1960s community center. Young and old mill about, shopping and waiting for a tour or a training session or a conference.
 There is constant activity, with projects at various stages of completion. Mud-encrusted boots share space with pick-axes and pots of salad greens.
 ''It's a crazy place,'' Mr. Allen said. 
 As with any top-notch farmer, Mr. Allen takes special care with his soil. Using millions of pounds of food waste, his farm produces endless compost piles, which are then enriched by thousands of pounds of worms, essential to producing what he calls the highest quality fertilizer in the world.
 ''There are worms in every pot of soil and every tray of vegetables in this greenhouse,'' Mr. Allen said.
 His food, free of chemicals, tastes better, Mr. Allen said. ''And that's what the really good chefs understand.''
 Paul Kahan, the chef and managing partner of the award-winning Chicago restaurants Blackbird and Avec, is one of the chefs who has been working with Mr. Allen's organization. 
 ''They are wonderful people and do some interesting things that fit in with what we are trying to do,'' Mr. Kahan said. ''We buy regular produce, such as tomatoes, but they do some things in particular that we really love: pea tendrils, baby beet greens, nasturtiums, baby mustard greens.''
 Mr. Allen said he learned it all from his parents. ''We're having to go back to when people shared things and started taking care of each other,'' he said. ''That's the only way we will survive.'' 
 ''What better way,'' he mused, ''than to do it with food?''

HEADLINE: Tighter Credit Only Adds To Auto Industry's Troubles

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC and NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- After enduring a brutal sales slump caused by high gas prices and a faltering economy, the last thing the American auto industry needed was a credit crisis.
But with banks tightening up their lending, any hope for a recovery in vehicle sales this year has been dashed.
The virtual lockdown on credit is hurting Detroit's Big Three and other automakers at every level. More consumers cannot get auto loans. Dealers are hard-pressed to secure financing for new inventories. The auto companies themselves are running short of cash and can hardly afford to borrow more at interest rates as high as 20 percent. 
It all adds up to an increasingly dismal forecast for the industry. Vehicle sales fell 11 percent in the first eight months of the year compared with 2007. But September sales, which automakers will report Wednesday, are expected to be down as much as 19 percent, according to the auto research Web site Edmunds.com.
''We thought we had hit bottom, but it doesn't look that way,'' said David Healy, an analyst with Burnham Securities. ''Unfortunately, October could be even worse.''
The biggest problem for the industry is the difficulties prospective car buyers are having in securing loans.
In 2007, nearly 83 percent of applications for auto loans in the United States were approved, according to CNW Marketing Research of Bandon, Ore. But so far this year, the approval rate has plunged to 63 percent.
''It frankly has become a nightmare for dealers and consumers who need a vehicle,'' said Art Spinella, CNW's president. ''This is the worst we have seen it since we've been tracking it since 1984.''
Many shoppers -- some with blue-chip credit histories -- are able to get loans only at high rates.
''Instead of paying 7 percent like they should pay, they might have to pay 9 or 10 percent, and they're just passing,'' said Larry Kelly, general manager of Ritchey Cadillac-Buick-Pontiac-GMC in Daytona Beach, Fla.
The squeeze is particularly severe for customers with less-than-stellar credit scores who need subprime loans at higher interest rates.
While 67 percent of those consumers were approved for loans in 2007, only 22 percent are getting them this year, according to CNW.
''The subprime market has, for all intents and purposes, dried up,'' said Mr. Spinella.
Automakers have already experienced a drastic drop in sales of larger vehicles like pickups and sport utility vehicles because of gas prices that hit $4 a gallon this spring.
But Mark LaNeve, head of North American sales for General Motors, estimates that G.M. is losing 10,000 to 12,000 sales a month because of tighter lending practices.
''It's a bigger problem than $4-a-gallon gas,'' said James Press, a Chrysler vice chairman. ''We have buyers coming in, but they can't get a loan.''
Detroit is bracing for particularly bad sales numbers for September. According to estimates from Edmunds.com, Chrysler sales may be down as much as 36 percent, G.M.'s may drop 23 percent, and Ford Motor Company sales could be down 25 percent.
Even Japanese automakers, which specialize in fuel-efficient smaller cars, are expected to record a rough month, with Toyota projected to be down by 17 percent and Nissan by 11 percent.
One Pennsylvania auto dealer said the credit squeeze was only adding to problems caused by a weak economy that many fear could turn into a recession.
''I think it's just that people don't have any money and the last thing they're thinking about is buying a new car,'' said Frank Davin, general manager of Woltz & Wind Ford outside Pittsburgh.
Auto dealers are also struggling to get financing for their vehicle inventories from banks and the finance companies, like Ford Motor Credit, that are controlled by automakers.
Many dealers are choking on the costs of keeping unsold S.U.V.'s on their lots, and can't get loans to fill their showrooms with better-selling models.
Financial institutions are leery of financing any new vehicles because they cannot bundle the loans into securities to sell to investors -- primarily because of the damage wrought by the failure of similar mortgage-backed securities.
The lack of available credit is accelerating the demise of many dealers. Nearly 600 of the nation's 20,770 franchised new-car dealerships have closed their doors this year, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association.
The casualty list includes Bill Heard Enterprises, the top-selling Chevrolet dealership group in the United States, which filed for bankruptcy protection this week.
''We're losing the number of dealerships we would typically see in a recessionary year,'' said Paul C. Taylor, chief economist at the dealers' association.
The credit squeeze is affecting the Detroit automakers' own finances, too. G.M., for example, is burning through more than $1 billion in cash a month, but cannot go to the credit markets to raise additional capital. The company recently drew down $3.4 billion from its revolving credit line, and is in the process of cutting $10 billion in costs to improve its liquidity.
Ford's credit arm recently decided to cease providing vehicle loans to Mazda, its Japanese affiliate, so it could concentrate on financing sales of Ford's domestic brands.
Ford also is dipping into its corporate cash reserves to repay $1.5 billion in debt coming due Wednesday on previous bond sales. In a more stable economic environment, Ford would most likely refinance the debt rather than pay it off.

HEADLINE: Time Is Running Out for New Tax Breaks

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN

 BODY:
GIVEN the economic climate, small-business owners may be loath to make major purchases of new equipment or furnishings this year. But for those with money and an inclination to spend it, now is a good time to buy, as Congress enacted generous tax incentives for this year only. Businesses considering major expenditures may realize significant tax savings if they act promptly. 
 The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 allows businesses to take an immediate write-off of up to $250,000 for equipment purchased this year, double the amount allowed in 2007. Businesses that place the assets in service this year are entitled to an additional 50 percent depreciation. 
 Sidney Kess, a New York tax lawyer and certified public accountant, gave this example: ''Say a small business bought $600,000 worth of equipment and placed it in service -- it could write off the $250,000, and half the remaining $350,000. That's a total first-year write-off of $425,000. The remaining $175,000 would have to be depreciated. If it's seven-year equipment, that would mean writing off $25,000 a year over the next seven years.'' 
 Under the tax code, seven-year equipment includes office furniture and fixtures, safes, refrigerators and dishwashers and certain manufacturing machinery. Depreciation periods can vary, based on the equipment involved. Computers and copiers, for example, are given a five-year depreciation period. 
 Julian Block, a tax lawyer in Larchmont, N.Y., pointed out that a taxpayer must have earned income to claim the equipment write-offs, but that any earned income, not just that from the business, will suffice. 
 As an example, he noted the case of a person who lost his job recently and decided to open a restaurant. The cost of equipment and furnishings exceeds the income he expects the restaurant to earn this year, but because he received a salary for several months and because his wife is employed, as joint filers they will be able to write off the restaurant equipment against that income, too. 
 The immediate write-off and resulting tax savings could give many businesses a welcome cash-flow advantage during a tough economic period. Of course, many businesses are too small to make such big purchases or simply do not have the need. But tax professionals say other fourth-quarter opportunities for tax savings are available.
 Barbara Weltman, a tax lawyer in Millwood, N.Y., and author of ''J. K. Lasser's Small Business Taxes,'' said that even the smallest businesses may need to buy a car, truck or van, and the stimulus act grants a special first-year depreciation allowance for business vehicles in 2008. For cars it is $10,960; for trucks and vans, it rises to $11,160.
 Both limits are $8,000 higher than the previous first-year depreciation limit. As a result, many businesses that had once thought it better to lease vehicles may now want to consider buying them, she said. 
 Other recent laws may also provide tax breaks for certain small businesses, Ms. Weltman said. Under the military tax bill enacted in June, small businesses that employ and continue to pay National Guard and Reserve members who are called to active duty may be able to claim a tax credit of up to $4,000 per eligible employee. 
 The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 provides a tax credit of up to $7,500 for first-time homebuyers with income of up to $75,000 for single filers and $150,000 for couples filing jointly. A partial credit is available to those with up to $20,000 more in income. This could benefit people who have a cramped home office in a rental apartment and are considering buying a home or apartment at today's depressed prices, she said.
 A credit reduces taxes dollar for dollar, making it more valuable than a deduction, which simply reduces taxable income. This credit may be claimed on home purchases after April 9 of this year and before July 1, 2009, but taxpayers should be aware that the credit must be repaid, starting within two years, at a rate of up to $500 annually for 15 years. The home must be the buyer's principal residence. 
 Contributing to a tax-deferred retirement plan is always one of the best ways to reduce taxes in the year of the contribution while laying the foundation for a secure future. 
 Avery E. Neumark, a partner in the New York accounting firm Rosen Seymour Shapss Martin & Company, says he is advising owners of small businesses to set up 401(k) retirement plans if they have not already done so. 
 Federal law does not require businesses to offer retirement plans to employees, but it forbids those that offer plans from discriminating in favor of top executives. Consequently, many small businesses, especially those that employ large numbers of unskilled workers, have traditionally shunned sponsoring plans, fearing their expense. 
 The appeal of a 401(k) is that workers, as well as the owners, pay for their own retirement contributions through salary deferrals. Participants may defer up to $15,500 this year, and those 50 or older may defer an additional $5,000. ''If the company wants to match contributions or not, it's their choice,'' Mr. Neumark said.
 Mr. Neumark added that a solo practitioner or a business with only a few professional employees might want a defined-benefit plan and a profit-sharing plan, as well as a 401(k), because those individuals can put away far greater amounts, something that appeals especially to people approaching retirement age. For example, a 50-year-old earning $225,000 might put $175,000 into a defined benefit plan, $20,500 into a 401(k) plan and $13,500 into a 6 percent profit-sharing plan for a total of $209,000. 
 With the economy in turmoil, no one can predict what will happen with tax policy next year. Still, with the potential for tax increases, many professionals favor action this year to take advantage of low rates on capital gains and most dividends.
 Mr. Kess, the New York lawyer and accountant, advised closely held incorporated businesses that are in a position to pay a dividend to do so before the end of the year. If some of the company's stock is owned by family members like children or elderly parents who are in the 10 or 15 percent bracket, they will owe no tax on the dividends. 
 The current long-term capital gains tax rate of 15 percent might also make it advantageous to sell a business now, Ms. Weltman said.

HEADLINE: Cities Are Cutting Back Projects

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH; Nick Bunkley contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Cities, states and other local governments have been effectively shut out of the bond markets for the last two weeks, raising the cost of day-to-day operations, threatening longer-term projects and dampening a broad source of jobs and stability at a time when other parts of the economy are weakening.
 The sudden loss of credit, one of the ripple effects of the current financial turmoil, is affecting local governments in all parts of the country, rich and poor alike. In New York, a real estate boom has suddenly gone bust. Washington has shelved a planned bond offering to pay for terminal expansion and parking garages already under construction at Dulles and Reagan National Airports. 
 Billings, Mont., is struggling to come up with $70 million more for a new emergency room. And Maine has been unable to raise $50 million for highway repairs. 
 ''We really are in terra incognita here,'' said Robert O. Lenna, executive director of the Maine Municipal Bond Bank, which helps that state's towns and school districts raise money. He said he had worked in public finance for 34 years and had never seen credit evaporate so completely. 
 Maine had already begun some of its road work when the bond markets stopped functioning, so now it is scrambling for bank loans to keep the dump trucks rolling. If money does not start flowing soon, Mr. Lenna said, Maine will have to cancel some of its road and bridge projects. 
 The only alternative would be what New York City did on Monday: Go into the locked-up markets and whip up demand by offering to pay investors a very high return.
 Analysts said the dysfunction in the municipal bond markets appeared to signal the end of an era of relatively cheap money for governments and, probably, the start of an era of tough choices for communities. When the market starts moving again, they said, it will look a lot like the municipal bond market of 10 years ago, before the arrival of financial wizardry in the form of structured-finance products, which lowered borrowing costs but added big new risks. Instead, governments will probably be issuing plain-vanilla bonds with fixed rates of interest, higher than they are accustomed to. 
 And higher rates suggest some degree of belt-tightening, especially difficult in places where tax revenues are being squeezed because of falling real estate values and the slowing economy. 
 Municipalities will probably be able to function, but may not expand services, said John V. Miller, chief investment officer at Nuveen Asset Management, a municipal bond investment firm. ''For some, the level of service they provide will decline.'' 
 Some governments, already straining to balance their budgets, will have to cut payrolls, he said, and others may decide to raise taxes. 
 Last year, governments across the country issued about $23 billion of fixed-rate municipal bonds in September. This September they issued $15 billion -- all but about $2.2 billion of it in the first two weeks of the month, according to Municipal Market Advisors, a research and strategy firm. 
 Tight money is already becoming apparent in some states. In Montana, officials had planned to sell $130 million of bonds to the public last December to pay for a new emergency room, cancer center and improvements at the Billings Clinic, a 272-bed hospital in the state's largest city. But they were dissuaded by higher interest rates even then. 
 ''I've been second-guessing it since then,'' said Michelle Barstad, executive director of the Montana Facility Finance Authority. ''Things just keep getting worse and worse.''
 The authority borrowed $60 million of the total cost from private lenders in May, but is now unsure where to get the remaining $70 million. Ms. Barstad said one option under consideration was to borrow about $20 million from local banks and scale back the project, at least for now.
 ''We're just sitting on our hands like everybody else, trying to figure out what to do and how we do it,'' said Ms. Barstad, adding that she would welcome a return of the days of simple, fixed-rate bonds. 
 The credit crisis caused Athens-Clarke County, Ga., to delay a $221 million bond issue planned for the day Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy. The county has been planning for 10 years to upgrade three sewage treatment plants built more than 40 years ago when the population was much smaller. 
 The county's finance director, John Culpepper, said he had delayed the issue rather than raise the monthly sewer bills to the system's 39,000 customers. 
 ''We're going to wait it out for the next month or two, until the market returns to more normal conditions,'' he said. 
 The Washington Metropolitan Airports Authority has already begun construction of a bigger international arrivals building at Dulles, a new parking deck at Reagan National and other major projects, and said it intended to forge ahead using cash and commercial paper.
 New York City decided to brave the markets on Monday and ended up having the whole place to itself. It managed to issue $300 million of bonds for public schools, the only issue of the day. The New York Transitional Finance Authority will pay 5.75 percent on those 30-year bonds, the equivalent of a 10.5 percent interest rate to New York City residents, who will not have to pay city, state and federal tax on the income. 
 Yet even with that rate, the issue was not completely sold, said Mr. Miller of Nuveen.
 ''This is for a very well-liked name, a very well-known name,'' said Mr. Miller, explaining that New York City's bonds usually sell out quickly. 
 Mr. Lenna said Maine's advisers had warned that it might end up paying interest as high as 10 percent if it brought its highway bonds to market now. ''We're not going to go out and incur these costs,'' he said. 
 The municipal bond markets had already hiccupped before the latest turmoil. But analysts say the gridlock began in mid-September, when Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy. 
 Lehman Brothers was one of several Wall Street firms that had created structured-finance products for municipalities for the past few years. These products could be hybrids, allowing a local government to issue what seemed like a fixed-rate bond that could in turn be bought by an investor who received a variable rate of interest. 
 Governments generally prefer fixed-rate bonds because the cost is predictable -- but variable-rate bonds were attractive because of their generally lower rates. Securities firms tried to merge the best of both worlds by linking derivatives contracts to municipal bonds. One structured product was a variable-rate demand note, which gave the investor the option of putting the note back to the securities firm if the investor decided the rate was too low. 
 The notes were often bought by mutual funds for their tax-exempt bond funds. The booming demand for those funds, in turn, held down the price of borrowing for states and cities, at least for a while. But when Lehman collapsed, the mutual funds suddenly perceived a risk: the securities firms that had created the products might go out of business. So, owners of the notes put them back to the securities firms that had sold them. 
 The prices investors were willing to pay for the notes plunged, driving up short-term rates for municipal bonds. Securities firms, under pressure, unwound the notes and reconstituted them as old-fashioned fixed-rate bonds. 
 None of this had anything to do with the behavior of local governments or their ability to repay their debts, but it brought the municipal bond market to a halt.
 Thomas G. Doe, president of Municipal Market Advisors, said his firm was fielding calls this week from government contractors asking how much credit might be available next year. For insight, he pointed to municipal bond data from the 1930s. 
 ''During the first few years after the '29 crash, municipal issuance dropped 24 percent,'' he said. ''It wouldn't be unreasonable to think that we could see municipal issuance go from a total of $430 billion last year, to something like $350 billion next year, which would be a drop of 25 or 30 percent.'' 
 This would not mean widespread bond defaults, he said, just greatly narrowed local budgets. 
 ''It's no different from a family budget,'' he said. ''We're not going to go out to dinner any more. We're not going to buy a new car. That's the similarity.''

HEADLINE: Corner Bar Cashes In as Newark Redevelops

BYLINE: By DAVE CALDWELL

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
 FOUR years ago, John Brito and Antonio Rodrigues, natives of the Ironbound section of Newark, bought a rough-and-tumble corner bar downtown on Mulberry Street called the Caverna. They planned to turn the three-story building into an establishment that was part pub and part lounge, both uncommon then in Newark.
 Nearly $1 million in renovations later -- more than 15 times as much as they had expected to spend, they said -- their Arena Bar and Lounge has become a popular pre- and postgame stop for fans of the New Jersey Devils, the National Hockey League team that began playing at the Prudential Center, one block north, last October.
 After another round of renovation, the bar has reopened just in time for the start of the hockey season (the Devils' first home game is Oct. 10). Mr. Brito and Mr. Rodrigues are anticipating a replay of last season's successes. 
 Then, about two hours before each game, fans, many wearing red or white Devils apparel, streamed into the bar for a beer or a burger. When a game ended and thousands of fans poured out of the 17,625-seat Prudential Center, many stopped at the Arena Bar to wait out the traffic. The arena is also home to Seton Hall University basketball games and many concerts. But even when nothing was going on at the Prudential Center, the bar did a brisk business at lunchtime and on many nights.
 ''We knew the area was going to turn around,'' said Mr. Brito, 35. ''It was just a matter of time.''
 Newark, six miles west of Manhattan, has been slowly trying to revive itself, particularly since the Prudential Center opened. The Arena Bar appears to be among several successful small businesses that are hoping both to piggyback on the city's recovery and contribute to it.
 ''Wagering on Newark makes for a smart bet,'' said Stefan Pryor, deputy mayor for economic development. ''Newark is an up-and-coming city. We've got incredible assets that have been underleveraged for a long time, and we've got more assets along the way. Every day, businesses and residents are arriving in Newark with the expectation that the city's only going to get better.''
 The Arena Bar was a much riskier venture when Mr. Brito and Mr. Rodrigues bought the space in March of 2004. A site nearby had been selected for the arena, but it was far from certain that it would be built.
 Then, for 20 months of the nearly two years through late 2007 that it took to build the arena, the stretch of Mulberry Street in front of the Arena Bar was closed to car traffic. Construction workers still came, and Mr. Pryor held his office Christmas party there as a show of support, but the business foundered.
 ''It was uncomfortable, to say the least,'' Mr. Brito said.
 ''It devastated us for a while,'' said Mr. Rodrigues, who is 36.
 Both had experience in real estate, and they still thought they had a sound idea. The Arena Bar is a block from the Newark police headquarters and about two blocks from City Hall, so government workers provided a core of customers. There was no place downtown quite like the bar, with its cherry-wood floors and hardwood moldings.
 From the beginning, they wanted to create more than a sports bar, so they shied away from names like Devil's Den. They picked a logo that included a silhouette of the Colosseum in Rome. They painted the walls burgundy, rather than the Devils' bright red.
 Business was so good that the owners began a $350,000 renovation and expansion project in July. They received a license to sell food and drink outside, and the sidewalks were repaved in stone as a seating area. The main room was remodeled, with ''Jerusalem gold'' stone walls and a new bar. A garage in the back of the building is being converted into another bar.
 The main room and new area will be open to everyone at lunchtime and before games and events. The intention, Mr. Brito and Mr. Rodrigues said, is to create two late-night ambiences: an elegant lounge with a dress code and disc jockey, and a louder, higher-energy sports bar. The menu is to be expanded to include salads and freshly squeezed juices in the main room, but there will always be space on the menu for a burger.
 Draft beer is a big seller before Devils games, but the Arena Bar also offers more than 50 martinis and a menu that includes picadinho, a Brazilian hash with pork cubes, shrimp and potatoes. Mr. Brito and Mr. Rodrigues furnished the back of the main floor with plush sofas and wingback chairs, and they lower the curtains on weekends to create the aura of a lounge.
 The emergence of the Arena Bar and other businesses has changed the decades-old perception among suburbanites that Newark was unsafe at night. Many doubted that Devils fans would come to the Prudential Center in quite the same numbers as they had to the team's former home, now known as the Izod Center, in East Rutherford, 12 miles away.
 But when the Prudential Center opened with a series of Bon Jovi concerts, the police established a mobile command center near the arena and a huge presence for blocks around, to make sure people felt safe. The Devils drew about 10 percent more fans last season than they did the year before, and the Arena Bar's business tripled after the Prudential Center opened.
 Chip Hallock, president of the Newark Regional Business Partnership, said of the neighborhood: ''What I've heard is people saying, 'This isn't what I expected.' There's kind of a good will and a good feeling. People are on the street, and I think it's just the beginning of what's going to happen around here.''
 When Jim Tencza and Lou Linn, who work in Paramus, arrived early for their first Devils game, they asked a police officer to direct them to a good place for a beer, and he pointed to the Arena Bar.
 ''You've got good food, good beer and good scenery,'' Mr. Tencza said before a game last season, smiling as he nodded at one of the waitresses.
 And the prices are reasonable, Mr. Linn said. ''They don't gouge you.''
 A pint of domestic beer sells for $4, and there are often specials. Inside the Prudential Center, a 12-ounce bottle of domestic beer is $7. The Arena Bar has also given discounts in ''Restaurants Round the Rock'' fliers -- referring to the Prudential Rock logo that has become the arena's nickname -- put under the windshield wipers of cars parked nearby. People will stay hours after a game because they are more comfortable in the neighborhood now.
 ''I've never had a problem,'' said Kelly Maione, a Devils fan from Flanders, N.J. ''I thought it was going to be a dirty and not a friendly area. I used to wait for somebody to walk with me to my car. Now, it's like, 'See ya!' ''
 Above the bar's main floor are two open floors, which Mr. Brito and Mr. Rodrigues said might be converted into a V.I.P. lounge and a cigar lounge. They have 15 employees, including a recently hired general manager, and they plan to do more hiring as the business grows, they said. 
 ''People are starting to understand that there's a 24-7 resident population here now,'' said Alfred C. Koeppe, president of the Newark Alliance, a nonprofit group of business leaders. ''It's just a matter of time before you see something like a first-class bookshop going in downtown. It's like what's happened at Yankee Stadium for all those years. How many feet can you walk without seeing Derek Jeter's jersey in a storefront?''
 The streets around the Prudential Center are often awash in hockey fans wearing copies of the red jersey worn by the Devils' goaltender, Martin Brodeur. A 350-room hotel is planned for the area, and Mr. Brito said business at the bar could double over the next year.
 ''Yeah, it was a big risk that we took,'' Mr. Rodrigues said.
 But, he added after a pause, for the Devils and the Newark business community, ''it was an even bigger risk.''

HEADLINE: At the Lyon Biennial, Peeking at the Past to Glimpse the Future

BYLINE: By ROSLYN SULCAS

DATELINE: LYON, France 

 BODY:
The theme of the 2008 Lyon Dance Biennial, which ended on Sunday after a 25-day run, was ''Retour en Avant.'' That's one of those French phrases that are full of evocative meaning -- in French. Translated into English (as ''Past Forward,'' in press materials), it simply sounds vague, which may not be altogether untrue of the goals of this biennial, the 13th edition since it was founded in 1984.
 But clarity of intention aside, the biennial is one of the most ambitious and important dance festivals in the world, and its largeness of scale and intention is splendid to see at a time of ever-shrinking financing for the arts. (Past editions have tackled German Expressionism, American modern dance and the African diaspora, among other subjects.)
 And although Guy Darmet, who has directed the festival since its inception, says that times are tough in France, too, he succeeded in increasing the biennial's budget by about 15 percent (to about $9.6 million this year) for what is billed as its 25th-anniversary edition, which brought 42 companies from 19 countries to Lyon. 
 ''Culture is not a priority today for our president,'' Mr. Darmet said in an interview, across the road from the magnificent Palais de Commerce, where the biennial had its headquarters. ''But in our region we are lucky enough to have politicians who understand that culture makes the city more attractive. By now, dance is a Lyonnais specialty, like quenelles.''
 Mr. Darmet was referring to the airy creamed dumplings that are one of the many distinctive dishes in a city that loves its food. It loves its dance, too. The final figures for the festival showed that slightly more than 84,000 people had attended performances all over the city and its suburbs, with the traditional Defile, a carnival-like parade, drawing around 350,000 spectators.
 So perhaps Mr. Darmet, who has announced that he will retire as artistic director in 2010, has earned the right to a little vagueness. ''The festival is 25 years old,'' he said. ''It was time to have a look at those years, which have been vital for contemporary dance in France. Do we have a contemporary dance repertory in Europe? What happens to works when the choreographer is no longer there? I wanted us to ask these questions about our past, and at the same time look to the future by having more new work than ever.''
 These ideas are broad enough to incorporate almost everything that Mr. Darmet programmed for this biennial. The title, ''Retour en Avant,'' was borrowed from a 1983 work by the Lyonnais choreographer Michel Hallet Eghayan, which opened the festival. And Mr. Darmet cast a look back by offering works like ''Les Petites Pieces de Berlin,'' by the choreographer Dominique Bagouet, first performed at the biennial in 1988, and danced here by the Ballet de Lorraine. Bagouet, who died in 1992, is widely considered an important choreographer in France, as is Carolyn Carlson, whose 1983 solo ''Blue Lady'' was performed here by the Finnish choreographer Tero Saarinen. (Mr. Saarinen also offered his new ''Next of Kin,'' a visually striking but monotonous evocation of unconscious fears, apparently all based on horror movies.) 
 There were 16 new works at this biennial, but the big event came toward the end. It was Angelin Preljocaj's new ''Snow White,'' set to music by Mahler, with costumes by Jean-Paul Gautier and a first-night audience packed with a who's who of European dance. Mr. Preljocaj -- unlike Bagouet or Ms. Carlson -- is actually considered an important choreographer outside of France, but he made no case for that here.
 ''Snow White'' (''Blanche Neige'' in French) is exactly what you don't expect any self-respecting contemporary-dance choreographer to do. It's a literal retelling of the fairy tale, fit for a ballet company that needs something safe for the box office. There are rappelling dwarfs, the Wicked Stepmother in a sex-shop-special outfit, a large mirror, mirror on the wall, nymphs (why nymphs?), courtiers and the Handsome Prince. 
 The choreography is full of the sharp, precise jumps and turns that characterize Mr. Preljocaj's work, but it mostly feels no more than dully competent, even -- perhaps especially -- in the pas de deux for Snow White (Nagisa Shirai) and the Prince (Sergio Diaz). 
 Even competence would be welcome when it comes to the hapless Stepmother (Celine Galli), who Mr. Preljocaj appears to consider a central character while offering her little more than the opportunity to strut and posture in dominatrix heels. And let us draw a veil over the extraordinarily horrible costumes by Mr. Gautier: among other things, the heroine in a diaperlike looped white dress, the Prince accessorized in fluorescent orange.
 Another biennial premiere, Les Ballets C de la B's tongue-twisting ''Aphasiadisiac,'' didn't manage such epic dreadfulness, but this vague piece by Ted Stoffer for four dancer-musicians never amounted to much. Apparently based on ideas about aphasia -- difficulty in expressing thoughts or understanding language -- the work offered bursts of trademark C de la B musical vitality and lots of inexplicable play with bricks. 
 The inexplicable is never a problem in work with its own internal coherence. In Pierre Rigal's ''Press,'' the choreographer performs in a small box, just big enough to hold a chair, a lamp and his body. (Then the box shrinks, and his body must adapt.) With Beckettian economy and extraordinary physical control, Mr. Rigal manages to simultaneously suggest the stuff of unconscious nightmares and the everyday human condition. 
 Which, on an entirely different scale, was also the subject of Maguy Marin's ''Turba,'' a biennial co-production first performed last year. Like Ms. Marin's other recent pieces, there is no real reason ''Turba'' should be called dance. In the work, 11 performers speak (in different languages) texts from Lucretius's ''On the Nature of Things,'' while slowly donning various costumes and wigs. The stage is covered by 30 tables, which are gradually covered with clothes, large branches and carpets of flowers. The music (by Denis Mariotte) is mostly a repetitive electronic phrase that gets variously louder and softer. The miracle is that Ms. Marin makes theatrical magic from these elements, building to a scene of memorably epic chaos halfway through and creating a stagescape of haunting beauty.
 The meandering second half is less successful, but ''Turba'' once again shows Ms. Marin's powerful theatrical gifts and her willingness to take huge risks. That's what we want from a major festival, and sometimes that's what we get.

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Bounce Back After a $10 Decline

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Oil prices swung higher Tuesday, recovering from the previous day's plunge as edgy investors trickled back into the market on hopes that Congress would resurrect a failed financial bailout plan. 
 Light, sweet crude for November delivery rose $4.27, or 4.4 percent, to settle at $100.64 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 On Monday, prices fell $10.52, to settle at $96.37 -- the second-largest drop ever in dollar terms -- after House legislators rejected the $700 billion bailout, stunning investors and raising fears of a long economic crisis that could sharply curb global energy demand.
 Crude has fallen about $25, or 20 percent, in the last seven days.
 Some recovery was to be expected after Monday's fall, and analysts said prices would probably remain in a holding pattern until the fate of the financial rescue plan was determined. Lawmakers were expected to reconvene in Washington on Thursday, though it was unclear if they would try another vote on the bailout.
 Whether or not there is any agreement on a United States bailout, oil market watchers say global financial tremors have already forced consumers and businesses to scale back energy consumption, a trend that could take prices lower in coming weeks.
 ''Oil is going to have a tough time getting back over $100 and staying there,'' said Matt Zeman, head commodities trader at LaSalle Futures in Chicago. ''Even if the bailout gets done, it's not going to solve everything immediately. The slowdown will have to work itself out for demand to take off again.''
 Weaker demand for fuel continues to weigh on prices at the pump.
 A gallon of regular shed a penny overnight to a new average of $3.633 in the United States, according to the auto club AAA, the Oil Price Information Service and Wright Express. Prices hit a record average of $4.114 a gallon on July 17.

HEADLINE: A Deadline For Survival At The Sun

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
 When the first issue of The New York Sun hit the streets six years ago, reviving one of the storied names in American journalism with a new conservative tone, some of the analysts who followed the newspaper industry predicted that there would be rough going. It had been years since a brand-new newspaper had tried to capture the minds of readers in New York, not to mention money from advertisers.
 The Sun's editors and reporters loved the David-and-Goliath odds they faced, competing against long-established papers with larger staffs and bigger budgets. They prized their scoops, even as the paper ran up million-dollar losses year after year.
 Then came the news that caught them by surprise. On Sept. 4, at the top of the front page, was a 984-word ''Letter From the Editor'' announcing that The Sun would close by the end of this month unless it drummed up new financial backing. 
 The letter said The Sun had already talked with ''a number of newspaper proprietors and other potential investors,'' and The Sun's president and editor, Seth Lipsky, said in an interview, ''I'm making the rounds.''
 ''I haven't raised all that I need,'' he added, ''but I've raised a lot.''
 And so The Sun finds itself at what Mr. Lipsky called ''a crossroads,'' facing a self-imposed deadline at a time when the newspaper industry itself is reeling. Nationally, advertising and circulation have slipped in the Internet age, and some papers, including The New York Times, have used buyouts and layoffs to reduce their staffs. 
 For a while, The Sun's front page bragged that it had ''150,000 of New York City's most influential readers every day.'' But its paid circulation is only about 14,000, Mr. Lipsky said. One way or another, it gives away about 66,000 copies a day. 
 ''We're in a tight spot,'' Mr. Lipsky said. ''The New York Post went down to the last hour before Rupert Murdoch swept in'' and took control in 1993. 
 Mr. Lipsky paused. ''He's not going to sweep in on this one.''
 That made Mr. Lipsky's letter all the more ominous. Some readers sent in checks of $100 or $200 -- not enough, Mr. Lipsky joked in the interview, to cover the paper's deficit.
 The staff was committed to The Sun -- so committed that Mr. Lipsky's announcement caught the city editor at the time, David Lombino, off guard. The Sun had just offered jobs to two reporters, and its newest correspondent in Washington, who was already on the paper's staff, had just moved there from New York. 
 'Guerrilla-Style Troupe'
 ''We felt very much like we were in the Wild West of the industry, putting out a daily newspaper in the country's biggest media market with relatively few resources and a startup climate,'' Mr. Lombino said. ''We were this ragtag, guerrilla-style troupe.'' 
 The afternoon before the letter appeared on the front page, Mr. Lipsky called the paper's top editors into a conference room to tell them about it. Mr. Lombino -- who had already decided to leave The Sun for a public relations job at the New York City Economic Development Corporation -- said he and another editor had speculated before the meeting about what Mr. Lipsky would say. They figured the possibilities were a move to new offices, a switch to a weekly schedule or a makeover as a Web-only publication.
 Mr. Lipsky said he made the announcement ''so nobody would be under any illusions'' about the hurdles The Sun faced. 
 Some of those hurdles seemed typical of a startup company going through its growing pains. But some were peculiar to the startup that The Sun was: a newspaper based in New York that was determined to be different from the city's other papers. 
 Scott Sherman, writing in The Nation last year, described The Sun as ''a paper that functions as a journalistic SWAT team against individuals and institutions seen as hostile to Israel and Jews.'' He said its ''day-to-day coverage of New York City emphasizes lower taxes, school vouchers and free-market solutions to urban problems.''
 One former editor said the staff had drunk Champagne in the newsroom in 2003 when the American-led invasion of Iraq began. As at least one commentator noted in the wake of Mr. Lipsky's letter, The Sun, in editorials, had mentioned Vice President Dick Cheney as ''the one who would bring the most to the race'' for president this year.
 The Sun covered the city with a staff a fraction of the size other papers depend on. Mr. Lombino said The Sun's local news staff had six reporters, two of whom also worked for other desks. That was about half the number when he became city editor in March 2007. He said that some reporters who left had not been replaced, and that others had been transferred to other sections of the paper. 
 The Sun was the brainchild of Mr. Lipsky, a former Wall Street Journal reporter and editorial writer. In the 1990s, he started The Forward, an English-language offshoot of the venerable Yiddish-language newspaper The Daily Forward. 
 For The Sun, he lined up backers who included Michael H. Steinhardt, a longtime friend of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and a former chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council; Roger Hertog, an investment banker who was chairman emeritus of the Manhattan Institute, a conservative policy-research organization; and Bruce Kovner, a hedge fund manager. 
 Another original backer was the Canadian-born newspaper baron Conrad M. Black, whom Mr. Lipsky has described as ''one of the greatest newspapermen of his, or any, time.'' Mr. Black's company, Hollinger International, sold its stake in The Sun after he was ousted as Hollinger's chairman in 2003. 
 Last year, after Mr. Black was convicted on federal fraud charges that had nothing to do with The Sun, Mr. Lipsky said Mr. Black had been ''an inspiring partner and friend.'' And according to Mr. Lipsky, it was Mr. Black who set The Sun on its trajectory. 
 Originally, Mr. Lipsky's idea was to take the name and logo of the famous New York newspaper that went out of business in 1950. That New York Sun is perhaps best remembered for the ''Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus'' editorial and the exposes about labor union corruption that inspired the film ''On the Waterfront.'' Mr. Lipsky said his initial plan was for a six-page newspaper with a circulation of 7,000 ''modeled in my mind'' on the Italian newspaper Il Folio. 
 A Change in Plans
 He said he raised $15.9 million by the fall of 2001. In November of that year, Mr. Lipsky and his associate, Ira Stoll, gave a dinner at the Harvard Club for The Sun's investors. Mr. Lipsky described the newspaper he had in mind and, according to Mr. Lipsky, Mr. Black told the group, ''This is not a good plan.''
 ''He felt the better approach would be to go for a newspaper that is not a quixotic paper operating on the margin like a six-page broadsheet,'' Mr. Lipsky said, ''but that one should go for what he called a 'primary read,' which he said would need to be a 16-page broadsheet with a sports page and a business page.''
 ''We liked what he said,'' Mr. Lipsky said, ''and started drafting a new plan.''
 The first issue, on April 16, 2002, had 18 pages. ''We launched with the slogan of 'New York on Page 1,' '' said Mr. Stoll, the managing editor, who started a Web site in 2000 called smartertimes.com that was a critique of The New York Times. ''It was a time when The New York Times Company was talking about its national edition. We thought we saw an opening here in New York City, but as we got into it, I think it was not so unique a selling proposition as we thought.''
 As time went on, he said, The Sun opened bureaus in Washington and at the United Nations, neither of which were provided for in the paper's original plan. He said The Sun had also sent reporters to Iraq, and to Beijing for the Olympics. ''And we had a reporter in Darfur very early on,'' he said.
 In the beginning, Mr. Lipsky recalled, he was bullish about its chances: ''I hoped to get to break even within the first year.''
 Mr. Lipsky and Mr. Stoll would not discuss the paper's financial picture in detail. ''By the standards of the newspaper business,'' Mr. Stoll said in an interview in his office, ''our losses aren't that unusual. I mean, Gannett spent an awful lot of money starting USA Today. Starting a publication takes a lot of money -- and time.''
 Mr. Stoll said The Sun had been ''on the way'' to markedly better numbers before it made ''a strategic decision'' to raise the price to $1 a copy, from 25 cents. At the same time, The Sun increased what the newspaper industry calls ''controlled circulation'' -- copies distributed free. The Sun also stopped charging for access to its Web site.
 Mr. Lipsky said the controlled circulation was ''a great attraction to our advertisers.''
 But John Morton, a newspaper industry analyst, said it was unlikely that The Sun could ever draw enough advertising to cover its operating costs.
 ''The problem with The Sun is they never developed very much paid circulation,'' Mr. Morton said, ''and they're limited now by how much they can give away because it costs money to give away newsprint. When you lose money on every copy you distribute, it doesn't take much for the money to mount up.''
 Carving Out a Niche
 Stephen B. Shepard, the founding dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York, said The Sun had carved out a place for itself with its coverage of foreign policy issues and the arts. 
 ''It's meant to be a niche paper targeted for a certain New York readership that can get certain things there that they can't get from The Times,'' he said. ''Whether it's had any impact, it's very hard to measure.''
 That was a question that dogged one of Mr. Lombino's predecessors as city editor, Colin Miner, now a freelance reporter for The Oregonian in Portland, Ore. Mr. Miner said that in 2003, a source leaked the mayor's management report, City Hall's annual report card on itself, three days before the mayor planned to announce it. 
 ''I did a front-page story,'' Mr. Miner said. ''No one noticed, at which point, I did a second front-page story.'' 
 Only then, he said, did he get an angry call from Edward Skyler, who was Mayor Bloomberg's press secretary.
 ''There were a lot of people who didn't understand why anybody would give us a story,'' Mr. Miner said. ''That was part of the fun. It made us more determined to get more stories because nothing says you're serious like a good scoop.''

CORRECTION-DATE: September 24, 2008

 CORRECTION:
 An article on Monday about the financial hurdles faced by The New York Sun, which has said it will close by the end of September if it does not receive new backing, misspelled the name of the Italian newspaper cited as an early model for The Sun. It is Il Foglio, not Il Folio. And a picture caption misidentified one of the editors at a planning meeting. The editor shown standing is Geoffrey Foster, the sports editor, not Kelly Sherin, the photo editor. (Because of a production error, a passage from this correction was merged in some editions on Tuesday with an International correction, above, about the Moscow Journal.)

HEADLINE: What Now, After the House Vote?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Defiant House Rejects Huge Bailout; Stocks Plunge; Next Step Is Uncertain'' (front page, Sept. 30):
 The failure of the House bailout bill actually looked like democracy in action. It's been eight long years since our representatives in Washington have paid attention to their constituents, and it was a refreshing sight to watch on television as the bill failed to pass in the House. 
 I know the victory of defeat is short-lived, some form of a bailout will pass, and our hard-earned tax money will go down the Wall Street rat hole eventually. 
 But it's encouraging to think that maybe, just maybe, people have finally had enough abuse at the hands of their elected leaders and are now willing to take a more active part in government and their futures. Jon Eisen 
 San Diego, Sept. 30, 2008
 The writer is a certified financial planner.
 To the Editor:
 What's worse than a flawed bailout? How about an ill-conceived, hastily cobbled-together bailout that fails to achieve its goal? 
 I am having a difficult time understanding why this needs to be such a rush job. Clearly there is a consensus that something will have to be done. The very idea of a bailout drove the market up on Friday. The snatching away of the corporate welfare with little oversight plunged it down on Monday. 
 It would be interesting to know who drove those runs, both up and down. I don't think it's people like me with my piddling little stock account. Was the downward spiral so sharp because the eventual bailout may include more checks and balances than some on Wall Street are used to having?
 To lay the failure of this particular bailout plan at the feet of the Republicans strikes this lifelong Democrat as less than fair. There are plenty of Democrats who also voted no. I don't know that this was the worst thing that could happen.
 Gretchen Adamek 
 East Hartford, Conn., Sept. 30, 2008
 To the Editor:
 In its narrow-mindedness and vindictive attitude, Congress is biting off its nose to spite its face.
 Sure, there are many high-flying and reckless chief executives who deserve contempt, or maybe even jail, but the average American today has his retirement money invested in a stock I.R.A. or a 401(k) account.
 I would therefore suggest that New York City change the name of Wall Street to Main Street. Eric Schlusselberg 
 Teaneck, N.J., Sept. 30, 2008
 To the Editor:
 It used to be said that the Democrats were the party of war, while the Republicans were the party of depression. Now the Republicans have made themselves the party of both. The worst administration in American history has outdone itself. David S. Frankel 
 South Dennis, Mass., Sept. 30, 2008
 To the Editor:
 I am appalled by what happened in Washington on Monday. It was not bad enough that Congressional Republicans played politics with the economy, but they did so to the tune of a 778-point drop in the Dow.
 This bailout needed to pass. I am worried about getting a paycheck, paying off a credit card at reasonable interest, securing my retirement and one day getting a mortgage. 
 For Republicans to vote no just because they thought Speaker Nancy Pelosi's speech on the House floor was mean was simply adolescent. 
 I am happy that Ms. Pelosi had the courage to confront the administration for its negligence in oversight of the financial markets. The Republicans needed to do their job and save this economy.
 These Congressional Republicans need to realize that they are not in the majority, stop whining about it, mature a bit and do their jobs. Austin Evans 
 San Diego, Sept. 30, 2008
 To the Editor:
 As I read about the complaints by opponents of the bailout bill and about the blame game conducted by both Democrats and Republicans, I thought about my grandfather, who owned a small business and lived through the Great Depression. 
 Saving the banking and credit system in this country isn't a bailout of Wall Street fat cats. It's protecting the savings of the middle class and allowing vibrant businesses to have access to credit and capital. 
 Without a bailout, a great number of Americans, including many of those who celebrated the bill's failure, will know the kind of fear my grandfather suffered: wondering how to put food on his family's table. Adrienne Donald 
 New York, Sept. 30, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Now that the first thought experiment is over, I believe we should consider the potential effects of investing $700 billion in things we already know we need. 
 A huge government investment in our neglected roads, bridges and schools, combined with money for energy conservation, research, retooling and retraining programs, would bring a smile to almost everyone's lips. 
 Who knows, some of the Main Street-based stimulus money might even trickle its way back up to Wall Street. 
 Andrew Bohm 
 Newton, Mass., Sept. 30, 2008
 To the Editor:
 We now have stunning evidence of widespread discontent with the bailout plan engineered by President Bush and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., which rewards rather than punishes the irresponsible risk-taking that has brought Wall Street to its knees. 
 If, as seems to be the case, frozen credit is paralyzing the economy, a simple solution would be to establish a temporary government lending program that would provide the necessary credit, with oversight, without enriching the perpetrators of financial disaster. 
 I suspect that such a plan would not cost any $700 billion and would not be pouring money down the black hole of nonexistent equity, as the loans would be repaid in a timely manner. 
 Richard P. Novick 
 New York, Sept. 30, 2008
 To the Editor: 
 Words matter. By calling it a ''bailout'' plan, people are disposed to think we're spending a huge amount of money to help people who did shady acts and don't deserve to be helped. 
 Why not call it a ''markets stabilization'' plan? After all, the real purpose of it is to stabilize the markets so that the nation's financial system can have more time to work through the difficulties and dislocations caused by incautious lending and falling home prices. 
 We're not just helping bad people. We're doing this to help the whole system, which operates on behalf of all people -- bad and good. James Bernstein 
 New York, Sept. 30, 2008
 To the Editor:
 The bailout vote was a demonstration that democracy remains alive in the United States and that a few congressmen still listen to their constituents.
 The president and the Republican and Democratic House and Senate leaders seem to believe that voters bestowed on them the role of sole determiners of the fate of the citizenry.
 The bill voted on was poorly drafted, raised constitutional questions and would not have resolved the financial problems facing this nation. 
 We need systemic changes, starting with a revision of the Federal Reserve Act. We should thank those representatives who still believe in democracy. 
 Don Holmes
 Sun City West, Ariz., Sept. 30, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Re ''What's Worse Than a Flawed Bailout?'' (editorial, Sept. 30):
 It is interesting that the House Republicans rejected the bailout bill because of ideology, when it was the ideology of these deregulators that brought about the nation's worst financial crisis since the Depression. 
 They don't seem to get it. An economic earthquake has created a huge crack in the philosophical foundation of the Republican Party, but their House members seem to be in denial, blaming everyone except themselves. 
 Because of their behavior, they have a double responsibility to act promptly in a mature and nonpartisan fashion to avert the destruction of our financial system.
 John Chalmers 
 Gresham, Ore., Sept. 30, 2008
 To the Editor:
 In ''Revolt of the Nihilists'' (column, Sept. 30), David Brooks writes that ''what we need in this situation'' is ''not heavy-handed government regulation, but the steady and powerful hand of some public institutions that can guard against the corrupting influences of sloppy money and then prevent destructive contagions when the credit dries up.'' 
 Will someone please explain exactly what Mr. Brooks means by that if it's not regulation? Does he really believe that we can prevent corruption without regulation? Whose ''hand'' is going to do this, and is it invisible? Sarah Lum

HEADLINE: Even Healthy Retailers Fear Loss of Credit Lifeline

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON; Michael Barbaro, Jason Grant and Eric Konigsberg contributed reporting.

 BODY:
For the past year, New Yorkers have largely felt apart from the economic turmoil enveloping other parts of the country. But businesses in and around the city have reason to fret, now that banks are becoming more tightfisted during the deepening crisis in credit markets worldwide. 
 Small businesses often live at the mercy of their creditors. When times are good, loans are easy to get. When business sours, loans can dry up. With banks handing out fewer loans and raising interest rates, even healthy businesses are becoming worried that they will not get the credit they need to keep their doors open and their bills paid. 
 Joseph McKenna, the owner of a Quiznos sandwich franchise on East 50th Street near Third Avenue, is among the worried. Mr. McKenna, who formerly worked in a lending division at Citibank, said he was concerned that his bank, JPMorgan Chase, would raise the interest rate on his $28,000 credit line if Congress does not approve a bailout package to calm the financial markets.
 His nightmare involves the bank's freezing his credit line, which he uses to pay for food and beverage deliveries, repairing equipment and fixing his store.
 ''It could happen any week, or any day -- you never know,'' said Mr. McKenna, who said sales fell 20 percent in August, the worst performance in the three years since he took over the shop. ''If you don't have a line of credit, it could kill you.''
 Restaurant owners up and down Third and Lexington Avenues, he said, are facing the same problems. 
 So are other small stores, including Jill Anderson, a women's clothing boutique in the East Village that relies heavily on credit cards.
 Ms. Anderson has kept her boutique, on East 9th Street, going by using 20 credit cards, half in her name and the rest in her business's name. But during the past two years, she said, as interest rates increased, she had limited herself to three credit cards to buy about 30 percent of her fabric and materials. She is trying to pay off the $90,000 debt on the other 17 cards.
 If the interest rates rise further, she will have more trouble paying down her debt. She also worried that her credit might be frozen.
 ''For me, if they up the rates on what I'm carrying on my debt load right now, I'd seriously have a chance of going out of business,'' she said.
 The banking industry's problems hit retail businesses twice, because their customers also rely on credit to buy big-ticket items like computers, flat-panel televisions and home furnishing.
 And then there is the automobile industry, which has already been hurt by rising fuel prices. Up and down Route 17 in New Jersey, dealers say their customers are demanding unreasonable discounts or are unable to buy the cars they want because their credit ratings have fallen.
 ''We still get A's and B's, but we see more D's and E's,'' said Kevin Gilbertson, the general manager of Maywood Mitsubishi, referring to consumer credit ratings. ''Once they figure it out, they come back for a lesser car.''
 Mr. Gilbertson and managers at other dealerships said sales boomed the last few years partly because customers were taking out home equity loans to help pay for their cars. That option, he said, has dried up as home prices have slid.
 The Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller housing index released on Tuesday showed that home prices in the New York metropolitan area fell 7.4 percent in July compared with the same month in 2007.
 Mr. Gilbertson said car sales had fallen about 20 percent at his dealership this year.
 Consumers short on cash are also finding out that some auto manufacturers, like Chrysler, are no longer offering leases. When they apply instead for auto loans, they are increasingly being told that their credit scores have declined and that financing terms have become more onerous.
 ''There's confusion in the public because of the economy and because banks are teetering on the edge,'' said Lawrence Vayda, a salesman at Parkfield Saab in Rochelle Park, N.J. ''They think they can just come in and there will be a fire sale. But even GMAC's top-tier rates are high.''
 Wall Street's troubles are sending a shudder through many of the city's high-end stores, too. 
 Some owners said they had recently begun paring down their inventories in effort to take on less debt. ''For Christmas merchandise, we're being more conservative with our buying less stuff and fewer really high-end items,'' said Elliesha Villanueva, the owner of the Green Onion, a children's clothing shop in the Cobble Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn.
 Deborah Buck, who owns Buck House, an antique shop in Carnegie Hill, Manhattan, said that about a year ago, she stopped using her credit cards to acquire most of her inventory and pay for her travel. ''I have a line of credit from the bank, but I don't like to be more than $20,000 out because I don't know what's coming in,'' she said.
 Bud Konheim, the chief executive of Nicole Miller, the upscale dressmaker in Manhattan, said this should be the high season for charity balls and society parties, the kind of events that reliably draw women to his stores in droves. But last weekend, as the financial crisis erupted, sales dropped for the first time in decades.
 Nicole Miller's shoppers are supposed to be insulated from economic crises -- dresses range from $400 to $1,200 -- but ''financial stress is trumping what-to-wear stress,'' Mr. Konheim said. ''That is a big worry, because the second that something gets more important than what to wear to the party, we have a very hard job.''
 Mr. Konheim, whose company sells clothing to chains like Saks and Bloomingdale's, said he was worried that personal credit would soon freeze for many people as Wall Street firms tumble.
 ''If that happens, I don't even want to think about what happens at the retail level,'' he said. ''Who is walking around with a lot of cash to buy things? Nobody.''

Japan's industrial production fell at the fastest rate in at least five years in August, the unemployment rate rose and household spending tumbled, deepening the slump in the country's economy. Factory output dropped 3.5 percent from July, the country's Trade Ministry said. The jobless rate climbed to a two-year high of 4.2 percent, and household spending slumped 4 percent, the most since September 2006, the government said. Japan may already be in a recession as the economic problems in the United States weaken exports and demand at home plummets because of rising prices and the deteriorating labor market. ''Japan has one leg in a serious recession,'' said Masamichi Adachi, senior economist at JPMorgan Chase in Tokyo. ''We have to lower our growth forecasts for Japan this year given today's numbers.''

HEADLINE: Riding a Wave of Fish Tacos

BYLINE: By MATT GROSS

 BODY:
TO some purists, the East Coast fish taco does not exist. Simply putting batter-fried or grilled mahi-mahi on a tortilla and topping it with cabbage, crema and salsa verde is not enough. No, it must be sold from a shack, misted with Pacific spray and approved by the board-shorts-clad aficionados of Baja California.
 Yet as New York trudges into fall and winter, three restaurants are assembling fish tacos that not only evoke memories of warm sand but elevate this humble surfer snack into a work of art. 
 PINCHE TAQUERIA227 Mott Street (Prince Street), (212) 625-0090, and 333 Lafayette Street (Bleecker Street), (212) 343-9977, pinchetaqueria.com; Monday to Thursday, noon to 11 p.m., Friday and Saturday to midnight and Sunday to 8 p.m.
 These two downtown locations, outposts of the 35-year-old Tijuana original, are loyal to the dish's West Coast origins. In fact Pinche -- translated generously, the name means ''puny'' and describes the dining room -- sports a grill trucked in from Mexico.
 That grill is primarily used for pork for some other dishes, not for deep-frying fish, but it contributes an aura of authenticity, for these are textbook-perfect fish tacos ($3.75 apiece). Atop a borderline-puny corn tortilla, the beer-battered mahi-mahi wears a frizzy toupee of shredded cabbage squirted with crema, the runny Mexican version of sour cream.
 Pinche's tacos are an exercise in harmony. The buttery mahi-mahi is made richer by a prickly tomatillo salsa, while the cabbage contributes a sweetness that is surprising if you haven't eaten good raw cabbage in a while. The house-made tortilla even tastes of roasted corn. If that sense of balance were transferable, you would be ready for the overhead waves of the Tijuana Sloughs.
 TOLOACHE 251 West 50th Street, (212) 581-1818, toloachenyc.com; Monday to Thursday, 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 5 to 11 p.m., to 11:30 p.m. Friday; Saturday, 11:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m.; and Sunday, 11:30 a.m. to 11 p.m.
 Toloache, by contrast, has little interest in stoking surfer nostalgia. The menu is full of fork-and-knife food like adobo-rubbed tuna and enchiladas with fig salsa, and not beach-friendly. The dining room, at the edge of Times Square, is all fancy angles, from the intricately patterned tiles on the walls to the blocky ceviche bar to the starlike silver lamps in the front window. 
 Toloache's fish tacos likewise show a design sensibility. The package is tidy, with hunks of freshly fried tilapia anchored to a corn tortilla by loose guacamole and topped with chipotle-crema-dressed jicama slaw. With such solid foundations, catastrophic taco collapse is unlikely.
 But this is no bloodless work of taco modernism. The flavors -- the guacamole's sharp spice, the slaw's smoke and crunch -- hit you in the face like one of those spiny window lamps. That throb you may feel afterward is the price: at $16 for two lunchtime tacos plus rice and beans (as a dinner appetizer, without the sides, they're $13), a flight out west starts to seem like a bargain, especially after a $13 margarita.
 MERCADITO CANTINA172 Avenue B (10th Street), (212) 388-1750, mercaditony.com; Sunday to Tuesday, 5 p.m. to midnight, Wednesday and Thursday to 1 a.m., Friday and Saturday to 2 a.m. (Lunch and brunch hours to begin later this month.) 
 This latest branch of the Mercadito empire sidesteps Baja tradition entirely. Taking a cue from Momofuku, the long, cedar-sheathed dining room is dominated by a bar and bar-height tables. The lighting is very AvroKO-esque: bare Edison bulbs.
 While the aesthetic may be trendy, the fish tacos are not. They appear minimalist: seared shards of tilapia on a single corn tortilla, topped with a crescent of avocado, a splash of salsa verde and purple pickled onions diced to an impressive fineness. Tastewise, however, they're maximal, the fish startlingly crisp, its easy richness amplified by the sweet-sour mix of onions and salsa. 
 And unlike the beer-battered, crema-drenched Baja style, these are light enough that seconds or thirds make sense. (Economic sense, too: they're $9 a pair.)
 ''The fish taco's going to change your life, man!'' a bartender said as I ordered a pair (and a side of sauteed corn fungus and chips with an unusual peanut salsa). He was right. I was back a few days later for more.

HEADLINE: Brother, Can You Spare a Loan?

BYLINE: By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
MANY of America's small-business owners are scrambling for cash.
 Although experts do not yet have hard data about how the financial turmoil of the last few weeks may hamper entrepreneurs' access to capital, many were already having difficulties getting financing before the escalation in the credit crisis.
 By now, financing options for all stages of the small-business cycle are limited. Typically, start-ups and unprofitable companies have relied on credit cards and home equity loans. As their businesses thrived, they often turned to bank credit lines. And when it was time for the next big growth spurt, they usually got a small-business loan. But all of these options are less feasible now than they were a short while ago. 
 For example, after a quarterly survey of senior loan officers in July, the Federal Reserve reported that 65 percent of domestic banks said they had tightened their lending standards for small-business loans over the previous three months. At the same time, 70 percent told the Fed that they were charging more for those loans. 
 And in an August opinion poll, two-thirds of entrepreneurs told the National Small Businesses Association that their companies had been hurt by the credit crunch. Todd McCracken, the organization's president, said that members tended to own larger and more profitable businesses, so he thought that the credit crunch was probably having an even greater impact on America's small businesses.
 ''If you think you might have a cash crunch, you should act now,'' Mr. McCracken said, adding that it would be better for many small-business owners to have cash on hand, even if that meant paying a little extra interest.
 But small-business owners are not without financing options, even in these tenuous times, especially if they have strong enterprises with solid balance sheets. If, on the other hand, their businesses rely on a particularly shaky area of the economy -- like the housing or auto markets -- then some small-business experts advise them to reassess the wisdom of taking on more debt.
 Above all, entrepreneurs will need more of a financial stake in their own companies. 
 ''Bankers are more selective than they were a year ago about the businesses they choose to finance, and the owner is going to have to have more equity in the deal,'' said Ken Esch, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers in the private company services group.
 This could also be a bad time for owners with established companies to take equity out of their businesses -- no matter how tempting that may seem, given the sinking values of their personal brokerage accounts or home equity.
 ''Many small-business owners don't keep enough money in their businesses,'' said Robert C. Seiwert, the head of the Center for Commercial Lending and Business Banking at the American Bankers Association. ''They take it out for lifestyle reasons. Bankers don't like to see that. They don't want to support someone's lifestyle in the form of a small-business loan.''
 Mr. Seiwert also advised owners to strengthen their business plans, especially if they had not recently updated them. ''They should have three scenarios -- the good, the bad and the ugly -- and they should be prepared to execute on all of them,'' he said. ''And if their business plan is based on expansion, I would revisit those assumptions given the economic uncertainty today.''
 Some small-business owners who are finding it difficult to get a credit line with a bank may be tempted to carry large balances on their business credit cards. But the terms can change suddenly, just as they can with personal credit cards.
 William L. Treciak has spent the entire 20 years of his working life in the credit card payment-processing industry. Five years ago, he founded his own company, Electronic Data Payment Systems, which is based in Dover, Ohio, and processes credit card transactions for merchants. He found it ironic that even he was ensnared by escalating credit card interest rates.
 Mr. Treciak said he was offered a small-business card with an interest rate of 11.99 percent in mid-2006. That was lower than interest rates on his company's bank credit lines at the time, so he took the deal. But then, he said, the card company raised his rates six times, to reach 34.99 percent this spring.
 ''Obviously, I paid the balance off and shut the card down,'' said Mr. Treciak, who added that he had never been late for a payment and had never given the company any other cause to raise his rates. ''I grew up in this industry, so I knew better.'' 
 Financial experts say this situation demonstrates why small-business owners should opt for a small-business credit line at a bank -- if they can qualify for one. But even a bank credit line may not be a sure thing, especially if a small business encounters an obstacle.
 Dave Boothe, who owns Allstates Refractory Contractors, in Waterville, Ohio, said his bank closed his credit line after a difficult year in 2005, when he suffered his first loss since buying the business in 2002. In early 2006, Mr. Boothe's bank said it was closing his $50,000 revolving credit line and issuing him a five-year note for the balance of $47,000. This debt had a fixed interest rate of 10.5 percent, which he said was two percentage points higher than the credit line.
 Mr. Boothe said that his business, which fixes industrial furnaces, had become profitable again over the last two years and that he had tried to open another credit line with several banks, to no avail.
 Mr. Esch, of PricewaterhouseCoopers, said business owners who were relying on short-term debt -- like revolving credit lines or credit card balances -- should try to convert it into long-term debt, like a small-business loan. ''Companies that converted to a long-term debt structure a year ago are much less dependent on the credit markets, which are very volatile today,'' Mr. Esch said.
 But the number of new loans backed by the federal Small Business Administration has dropped sharply over the last year. 
 For example, the number of loans backed by a major federal loan-guarantee program fell 30 percent over the last 12 months. The average size of the small-business agency loans went up, though, because most of the shortfall had come from smaller loans.
 Bank loan officers -- not the government -- make lending decisions for all Small Business Administration-backed loans, so the federal agency does not have data on whether tighter lending standards or a decline in applications led to this trend. But Eric Zarnikow, the associate administrator for the office of capital access at the Small Business Administration, said it was probably a little of both.
 ''When we talk to loan officers, we are consistently hearing that demand is down,'' Mr. Zarnikow said. ''They are saying that small-business owners are less willing to take on additional debt, and the borrowers who do come to us are less creditworthy.''
 Still, there is little doubt that some who might have qualified for small-business loans a year or two ago -- when lending standards were much more relaxed -- are finding it tougher today.
 For example, Mr. Treciak, who owns the credit card processing company in Ohio, said his small-business loan applications had been turned down about eight times during the last two years. 
 Jennifer Behar, who owns Jennifer's Homemade, a bakery in Miami, said she too was finding it hard to get her first traditional small-business loan. Ms. Behar, who describes herself as a ''self-taught baker,'' sells her chocolate biscotti and rosemary flatbread in fashionable grocery stores like Dean & DeLuca andWhole Foods Market, and on jennifershomemade.com.
 Ms. Behar started her business in 2005 with a home equity loan and a small-business credit card from American Express. She qualified for a bank credit line of $50,000 in 2006. After her revenues doubled in 2007, she asked her bank to double her credit line to $100,000, which it did in April. But Ms. Behar said she had been turned down by several banks for a loan to help finance her company's growth.
 If owners can't get the credit they need for their businesses, they might consider giving up some equity. Mr. Treciak and Ms. Behar said they were considering selling a stake in their companies to investors or venture capitalists -- an option both said they probably would not have considered had they received business loans.
 Ms. Behar has asked the Global Entrepreneurship Center at Florida International University for advice. ''They are helping me figure out how much money I really need, and how much I am willing to give up,'' she said ''Certainly I want to control the business and run it the way I want to.''

HEADLINE: Home Prices Plunge, but Pace of the Decline Slows

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
A closely watched index released on Tuesday showed that home prices tumbled by the sharpest annual rate ever in July, but that the rate of the monthly decline slowed.
 The Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller 20-city housing index fell 16.3 percent in July from the same month a year ago, the largest drop since its inception in 2000. The 10-city index plunged 17.5 percent, the biggest decline in its 21-year history.
 Prices in the 20-city index have plummeted nearly 20 percent since peaking in July 2006. The 10-city index has fallen more than 21 percent since its peak in June 2006. 
 Annual prices did not gain in any city in the Case-Shiller 20-city index in July, the fourth consecutive month that has happened.
 The pace of monthly declines is slowing, however. Between May and July, for example, home prices fell at a cumulative rate of 2.2 percent -- less than half the cumulative rate experienced between February and April.
 But there is ''no evidence of a bottom,'' said David M. Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S.& P.
 Las Vegas prices plunged the most, nearly 30 percent; Phoenix dived 29 percent and Miami 28 percent. Prices in the seven cities in the Sunbelt all fell 20 to 30 percent, compared with a year ago.
 Only seven cities showed positive or flat returns on a monthly basis from June to July, down from nine that showed month-over-month gains in June. Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Denver and Minneapolis have all posted positive returns for three months or more.
 In other economic news on Tuesday, the Conference Board said its Consumer Confidence Index showed that Americans' confidence in the economy unexpectedly improved in September, but the reading still hovered near a 16-year low and it did not fully reflect the financial turmoil that has rocked Wall Street and Main Street in recent days.
 The index is now at 59.8, up from a revised 58.5 in August. Economists surveyed by Thomson/IFR expected a reading of 55.5.
 The level is about half of what it was a year ago and near the lowest since the index registered 54.6 in October 1992 when the economy was coming out of a recession.
 The cutoff date for responses to the survey was Sept. 23, and thus it does not capture Monday's stock market plunge, which wiped away $1.2 trillion in the value of retirement funds, mutual funds and individual stock holdings.
 ''September's increase in the Consumer Confidence Index was due solely to an improvement in the short-term outlook,'' said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board Consumer Research Center, in a statement. ''However, these results did not capture all of the tumultuous events in the financial sector this month, and until the dust settles a bit more, we will not know the full impact on consumers' expectations.''
 Ms. Franco added that shocks like the 1987 stock market crash ''generally tend to have a temporary adverse effect on confidence, lasting on average two to four months unless they result in significant job losses.
 ''Just as noteworthy, consumers' assessment of current conditions continues to indicate that the current economic environment remains quite weak.''
 Another report, the business barometer released by the National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago, declined to 56.7 from 57.9 in August. While the number fell, the index still indicated expansion.

HEADLINE: Gazing at America, the French Still See a Wild Frontier

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; Maia de la Baume contributed reporting.

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
The French have always found American elections amusing, in a horror movie sort of way. They grumpily regard the American president as in some unfortunate sense also their own, but they see the campaign through their own cultural lens.
 They value sophistication above almost anything, and so they regard their own hyperactive president, Nicolas Sarkozy, with his messy romantic life and model-singer wife, as ''Sarko the American.''
 But this year has been difficult for the French. Mr. Sarkozy has generally supported American foreign policy and has praised the United States' openness and entrepreneurial verve. And the sudden emergence of Senator Barack Obama -- black, and seen as elegant and engaged with the larger world -- has sent many French into a swoon.
 But the combination of two recent surprises -- Gov. Sarah Palin and America's terrifying financial meltdown -- has brought older, nearly instinctual anti-American responses back to the surface. 
 These two surprises, one after the other, have refreshed cliches retailed under President Bush, confirming the deeply held belief of the French that the United States remains the frontier, led by impenetrably smug and incurious upstarts who have little history, experience or wisdom.
 Even worse, from the French perspective, Americans are reckless optimists, incurably blind to the tragedy of life, to the weary convolutions of history and thus to the need for lengthy August vacations and financial regulations.
 While the French see themselves as the heirs of urban revolutionaries, with a strong distaste for politicized religion, the American revolutionary spirit seems to them these days to come like a hurricane from the uncosmopolitan right -- from the dry, dull flatlands of Texas ranch country or the emptiness of Vice President Dick Cheney's Wyoming, and now from the odd sunset communities of Arizona and the bizarre bars, churches and hockey rinks of Alaska.
 The financial meltdown also seems inevitably American, a product of the reckless audacity that the French pretend to abhor, but often secretly admire. But however careful France's own banks may have been, the United States is so large and so dominant that the French are afraid of being hit with what one economist, Daniel Cohen, called the ''toxic waste'' of the scandal.
 This year, mocking the candidates has become an industry, with the satirical puppet show ''Les Guignols de l'Info'' recently adding a squeaky-voiced Senator John McCain puppet to the jug-eared Obama model. In general, though, Americans are portrayed as Sylvester Stallone, lunky and thick-headed. Ms. Palin has been a kind of godsend.
 The French know exactly what to make of her, said Frederic Rouvillois, and that is the problem. Ms. Palin may be an American dream but she is a French nightmare, said Mr. Rouvillois, a lawyer and social historian who has just written a book titled ''The History of Snobbery.'' 
 ''She's a caricature of a certain America that hasn't parted with its boorish 'Wild West' side,'' said the impish Mr. Rouvillois, who has also written a history of good manners. ''For the French snob, the only admissible American is from the East Coast, knows Henry James, is comfortable in French, a sort of European on the other side of the Atlantic.''
 A little, yes, like Senator John Kerry.
 Le Canard Enchaine, the country's satirical, investigative weekly, did a take on Ms. Palin under the headline ''Alaska, It's Exquisite.'' If Mr. McCain is a war hero, Ms. Palin ''is the heroine of a trashy soap opera,'' the paper said. The picture magazine Paris Match called her ''La Pasionaria come in from the cold,'' a reference to her fervent conservative and religious beliefs, as its reporters, too, trawled Wasilla, Alaska, for insights into this new American life form.
 France, like most of Europe, is quite taken with the Democratic candidate, whom the French regard as a ''metis,'' politely translated as someone of mixed race, usually used for those of African colonial ancestry. Mr. Obama is seen uniquely as an American metis with global experience and antecedents in Africa, through his Kenyan father, not in slavery. 
 Bernard-Henri Levy wrote in the magazine Le Point of Mr. Obama as a new type of American black politician.
 ''Obama is, certainly, black,'' Mr. Levy wrote. ''But not black like Jesse Jackson; not black like Al Sharpton; not black like the blacks born in Alabama or in Tennessee and who, when they appear, bring out in Americans the memories of slavery, lynchings and the Ku Klux Klan -- no; a black from Africa; a black descending not from a slave but from a Kenyan; a black who, consequently, has the incomparable merit of not reminding middle America of the shameful pages of its history.''
 He goes on for a while, but you get the idea.
 There is less philosophizing about Ms. Palin. Dominique Dhombres, writing in a commentary in Le Monde under the headline ''She Believes in God, America, the Family and Firearms,'' calls Ms. Palin ''a powerhouse -- she's almost a tank.'' He then compares Mr. McCain to Monsieur Verdoux, ''the dapper family man who murders 12 women for their money,'' as played by Charlie Chaplin. ''I guess you could call them Monsieur Verdoux and his pit bull.''
 Mr. McCain is admired for his bravery, but his ''maverick'' qualities are less understood, partly because he is seen as so conservative on social and religious issues. His experience in foreign affairs is appreciated here, even though some recall his remark during the prewar Iraq debate, when he described the French this way: ''They remind me of an aging movie actress in the 1940s who is still trying to dine out on her looks but doesn't have the face for it.''
 On Saturday, after the first debate and the economic meltdown, Francois Sergent, the foreign affairs editor of the newspaper Liberation, criticized American exceptionalism and Mr. McCain's embrace of it. ''McCain, with that name of a character in a western, incarnates this American exceptionalism that pleases the Republicans so much -- and if we believe the polls, still half of Americans,'' he wrote. ''But in the world of the real economy, we measure today the consequences of that hegemony without reference to that ideology.''
 Mr. Rouvillois, the expert on snobbery, said there was a general acceptance in France that the American president, in general, was not particularly interested in Europe or France. ''People have always said that American presidents didn't know exactly where France was,'' he said.
 And as for moose-hunting, he said, it is no worse than what French women used to do long before there was a Louis Vuitton. ''When women of Louis XV's court would hunt wild boars with their knives, it wasn't less violent or bloody than killing a moose with a scope-mounted rifle,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Both Obama And McCain Make Push For Bailout

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER and JEFF ZELENY; Michael Cooper reported from Kansas City, Mo., and Jeff Zeleny from Reno, Nev.

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo. 

 BODY:
Both presidential candidates intensified their efforts Tuesday to help push the financial bailout plan through Congress, lobbying skeptical lawmakers and warning publicly that a failure to act would cause a widespread economic crisis that would hurt regular people, not just financiers.
 Senators Barack Obama and John McCain both began the day suggesting a change in the bailout legislation to raise the federal insurance limit on bank deposits to $250,000 from $100,000, a move that had originally been sought by House Republicans, whose overwhelming opposition doomed the bill on Monday. And both men used their campaign appearances Tuesday to press for action in Congress. 
 But the challenges facing the two candidates were daunting. Both men found themselves advocating the passage of an unpopular bill less than two months before Election Day, and trying to do so without further complicating the delicate negotiations going on in Washington. On the stump, meanwhile, they tried to strike a balance between bipartisanship on the financial bailout and the thrust-and-parry of a political campaign. In a sign of the choppy political crosscurrents, the Republican National Committee began running a new advertisement criticizing Mr. Obama, and seeming to stoke anger over the bailout plan.
 ''Wall Street squanders our money and Washington is forced to bail them out with -- you guessed it -- our money,'' the advertisement begins. ''Can it get any worse?''
 But behind the scenes, both candidates telephoned members of Congress to urge them to pass the bill and to see where things stood. And both spoke by telephone Tuesday morning with the man they hope to succeed, President Bush. Also, both Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain said they would return to Washington on Wednesday for a vote on the bailout.
 Mr. Obama, who had been criticized by Republicans on Monday for failing to aggressively lobby individual House members for the bill's passage, called skeptical House Democrats, his aides said. And Mr. McCain, whose decision to insert himself into the negotiations last week was faulted by Democrats for injecting presidential politics into a delicate mix, made calls to members of Congress between campaign stops, his aides said, but did so quietly and with an emphasis on how he could be helpful.
 Publicly the communications strategies of both candidates were strikingly similar on Tuesday. In campaign appearances and in television interviews both men urged putting partisan politics aside to argue for passage of the bailout plan, warning that the failure of the financial sector would have a devastating ripple effect that would cause serious hardships for Americans. 
 Mr. McCain, the Republican nominee, told a business roundtable in Des Moines that the evaporation of credit was already making it harder to get loans for students at a technical college in Milwaukee and for Sonic, the drive-through burger chain. 
 ''When small businesses and big businesses like Sonic franchisees can't borrow, contractors don't get the remodeling work, equipment makers lose sales, and restaurants go out of business,'' Mr. McCain said. ''It hurts the entire community.''
 ''I know that many of the solutions to this problem may be unpopular,'' he said, ''but the dire consequences of inaction will be far more damaging to the economic security of American families, and the fault will all be ours.''
 Mr. Obama adopted a similarly serious tone as he echoed those themes to thousands of supporters in Nevada.
 ''We are now in a very dangerous situation where financial institutions across this country are afraid to lend money,'' he said. ''If all that meant was the failure of a few big banks on Wall Street, that'd be one thing, but that's not what it means. What it means is that if we do not act, it will be harder for you to get a mortgage for your home or the loans you need to go to college, or a loan you need to buy a car to get to work.''
 Mr. McCain, whose campaign initially sought to place blame for the collapse of the bill on Mr. Obama, took a much less partisan tone on Tuesday, refraining from attacking Mr. Obama in his talking about the bailout. And Mr. Obama made the rare move of not criticizing -- or even mentioning -- Mr. McCain. 
 ''There will be time to punish those who set this fire, but now is the moment for us to come together and put the fire out,'' Mr. Obama said, departing from his prepared text. ''Think about it. If your neighbor's house is burning, you're not going to spend a whole lot of time saying, well that guy was always irresponsible, he always left the stove on, he always was smoking in bed. All those things may be true, but his house could end up affecting your house. And that's the situation we're in right now.''
 Mr. McCain also called on Mr. Bush to act now to use the authority of the recent housing bill to start buying mortgages, saying that there was nearly $1 trillion available to do so and that the action would shore up mortgage values.
 Of course, bipartisanship went only so far. While the candidates tried to stay above the fray, their campaigns traded attacks, and their harsh advertisements continued to run.

HEADLINE: Labeled as a Bailout, Plan Was Hard to Sell To a Skeptical Public

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER; Jackie Calmes contributed reporting from Washington, and Brian Stelter from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
When the Bush administration announced its $700 billion plan to shore up the nation's shaky financial system, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. called it the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Everyone else called it the bailout. And from that point on, its fate may have been set.
 The politics of governance in Washington is as much about marketing as anything else, and from the beginning, the plan often came across as a taxpayer-financed parachute for high-flying Wall Street tycoons. The fact that its most prominent public advocate was Mr. Paulson, a former chairman of Goldman Sachs, probably did not help shake the image.
 By the time it was rejected by the House on Monday, those selling the plan -- the White House, Congressional leaders and both presidential candidates -- had long since lost the perception battle to critics on the Internet and radio and television talk shows. And if there was any broad agreement on Tuesday, a fractious, finger-pointing day in Washington, it was that the plan needed to be rebranded to have any hope of resurrection. 
 ''The hurdle is overcoming the word 'bailout,' '' said R. Bruce Josten, executive vice president of the United States Chamber of Commerce. ''It has continued to be used by members of Congress. You see it in the press today all over the place. This is not a bailout; this is Treasury buying toxic assets that they will dispose of over a period of time and resell.''
 Senator John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee, offered the same analysis in a morning interview as he discussed where to go from here. ''The first thing I'd do is say, 'Let's not call it a bailout. Let's call it a rescue,' '' he said on CNN. ''Because it is a rescue. It's a rescue of Main Street America.''
 As they sifted through the wreckage, the administration and its Congressional allies concluded that in their rush to fashion an enormously complicated, enormously expensive package, they did not do a good enough job explaining to the public why it should matter. They said they should have done more to make the case that upheaval on Wall Street would hurt businesses and consumers around the country.
 ''Hopefully we can do a better job of making clear just what our goal is and what we're trying to fix,'' said Tony Fratto, a White House deputy press secretary. ''Maybe more American people will be able to see that and hopefully more members of Congress.''
 Deeply unpopular in the polls, President Bush let Mr. Paulson be the public face of the plan at first, hoping his credibility would close the deal. But Mr. Paulson by his own admission is not a politician. His term, the Trouble Asset Relief Program, did not catch on. Since he unveiled the phrase on Sept. 19, it was used in just 23 television talk shows or public hearings transcribed in the Nexis database. By contrast, a Nexis search found 508 mentions of the phrase ''Wall Street bailout'' in that period.
 Mr. Paulson became a lightning rod for critics who viewed the plan as a power grab by the Treasury secretary and demanded more detail and accountability for how he would purchase and resell so many risky securities.
 ''The messaging was about as wooden and wonkish as it could be,'' said Patrick Griffin, a former White House lobbyist for President Bill Clinton. ''Poor Paulson -- that was not his forte. And they started behind the eight ball. I never understood why they took so long to have the president engage.''
 Peter H. Wehner, a former Bush White House aide, said he doubted the terminology made the difference. ''If someone could have called it a rescue plan the first day instead of bailout, do we really think that would have changed anything in a fundamental way?'' he asked. ''I don't think so. I think the public viewed this from the beginning as a bailout of Wall Street and I don't think moving around the deck chairs would have changed that.''
 If there was blame to be apportioned for the marketing failure, it cut across party lines. The final leadership message delivered on the House floor as the vote drew near came from Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, who rather than sticking to the bipartisan script, delivered a scathing attack on Mr. Bush. Whether or not it cost Republican votes, as some argued, it poisoned the atmosphere.
 ''It would have been given by the shrillest, most insignificant back bencher, but never, never should have been delivered by a speaker attempting to pass a difficult but critical measure,'' said Karl Rove, the former deputy White House chief of staff. ''This was a time that called for being a big leader, not a small and petty partisan.''
 Either way, the administration fell behind from the beginning. When it wants to roll out a major new economic initiative, it traditionally lines up allies in the business community, organizes surrogates to speak and develops a vocabulary for presenting the idea in the most appealing light. In this case, the plan came together heading into a weekend and the usual allies were not rallied until the following Monday.
 ''We had less time for that than normally,'' said Michele Davis, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Treasury, who help devise communications strategies. ''The situation that Wednesday and Thursday in the credit markets was so horrific, and with the short Congressional schedule ahead of us, we had to get out fast.''
 For economic issues, the administration typically reaches out to two particularly influential opinion leaders whose views carry great weight with Congressional conservatives -- Paul Gigot, editor of The Wall Street Journal editorial pages, and Lawrence Kudlow, the syndicated columnist and CNBC host. In this case, both men embraced the plan, but for once they did not sway other conservatives.
 That was clear to anyone browsing the Web or listening to talk shows. ''There has been this big, tremendous rush to spend hundreds of billions of your dollars to buy out these bad loans from these banks,'' Sean Hannity said on his nationally syndicated radio show last week. ''This is a manufactured crisis,'' Rush Limbaugh said on his radio show as the House vote began Monday.
 The viral emotion was evident in the Internet traffic. Yahoo Finance, the most popular financial news site, reported a 40 percent increase in message board postings. A CNNMoney.com blog post about the Bush plan announcement generated 2,200 comments, with greed being the most common theme. The site's news story about those comments was headlined, ''Mad as hell.''
 CNNMoney.com recorded 44 million page views on Monday, including 6.4 million during the hour of the House vote, setting new records for the site, as did CNBC.com, The Journal, The New York Times and other news organizations. Millions of e-mail messages overwhelmed House servers.
 Freedom Works, an organization affiliated with Dick Armey, a Republican and former House majority leader, created its own Web site, NoWallStreetBailout.com, and collected thousands of electronic petition signatures within hours.
 ''The biggest problem they had trying to peddle this package is they just didn't have the credibility,'' Mr. Armey said. ''They said, 'The world's going to fall apart if we don't get what we want.' And the voting public and many members said, 'We've heard this before and we're not going to buy it.' ''

HEADLINE: Lesson From a Credit Crisis: When Trust Vanishes, Worry

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
In 1929, Meyer Mishkin owned a shop in New York that sold silk shirts to workingmen. When the stock market crashed that October, he turned to his son, then a student at City College, and offered a version of this sentiment: It serves those rich scoundrels right.
A year later, as Wall Street's problems were starting to spill into the broader economy, Mr. Mishkin's store went out of business. He no longer had enough customers. His son had to go to work to support the family, and Mr. Mishkin never held a steady job again.
Frederic Mishkin -- Meyer's grandson and, until he stepped down a month ago, an ally of Ben Bernanke's on the Federal Reserve Board -- told me this story the other day, and its moral is obvious enough. Many people in Washington fear that the country is starting to spiral into a terrible downturn. And to their horror, they see the public, and many members of Congress, turning into modern-day Meyer Mishkins, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
All of which may be true. But there is good reason for the public's skepticism. The experts and policy makers who so desperately want to take action have failed to tell a compelling story about why they're so afraid. 
It's not enough to say that markets could freeze up, loans could become impossible to get and the economy could slide into its worst downturn since the Great Depression. For now, the crisis has had little effect on most Americans, beyond their 401(k) statements. So to them, the specter of a depression can sound alarmist, and the $700 billion bill that Congress voted down this week can seem like a bailout for rich scoundrels.
Mr. Bernanke and his fellow worriers need to connect the dots. They need to use their bully pulpits to teach a little lesson on the economics of a credit crisis -- how A can lead to B, B to C and C to Depression.
Let's give it a shot, then.
Why are we talking about the Depression, anyway?
Almost no economist thinks that even a terrible downturn would look like the Depression. The government has already responded more aggressively than it did in Herbert Hoover's day. So a Depression-like contraction -- a 30 percent drop in economic activity -- is highly unlikely. The country is also far richer today, which means that a much smaller portion of the population is living on the edge of despair. No matter what happens, you're not likely to see shantytowns.
But the Depression is still relevant, because the basic mechanics of how the economy might fall into a severe recession look quite similar to those that caused the Depression. In both cases, a credit crisis is at the center of the story.
At the start of the 1930s, despite everything that had happened on Wall Street, the American economy had not yet collapsed. Consumer spending and business investment were down, but not horribly so.
In late 1930, however, a rolling series of bank panics began. Investments made by the banks were going bad -- or, in some cases, were rumored to be going bad -- and nervous customers besieged bank branches to demand their money back. Hundreds of banks eventually closed.
Once a bank in a given town shut its doors, all the knowledge accumulated by the bank officers there effectively disappeared. Other banks weren't nearly as willing to lend money to local businesses and residents because the loan officers at those banks didn't know which borrowers were less reliable than they looked. Credit dried up.
''If a guy has a good investment opportunity and he can't get the funding, he won't do it,'' Mr. Mishkin, who's now an economics professor at Columbia, notes. ''And that's when the economy collapses.'' Or, as Adam Posen, another economist, puts it, ''That's when the Depression became the Great Depression.'' By 1932, consumption and investment had both collapsed, and stocks had fallen more than 80 percent from their peak.
As a young academic economist in the 1980s, Mr. Bernanke largely developed the theory that the loan officers' lost knowledge was a crucial cause of the Depression. He referred to this lost knowledge as ''informational capital.'' In plain English, it means that trust vanished from the banking sector.
The same thing is happening now. Financial markets are global, not local, today, so the problem isn't that the failure of any single bank locks individuals or businesses out of the credit markets. Instead, the nasty surprises of the last 13 months -- the sort of turmoil that once would have been unthinkable -- have caused an effective breakdown in informational capital. Bankers now look at longtime customers and think of that old refrain from a failed marriage: I feel like I don't even know you.
Bear Stearns, for example, was supposed to have solid, tangible collateral standing behind some of its debts, so that certain lenders would be paid off no matter what. It didn't, and they weren't.
The current, more serious stage of the crisis began two weeks ago today, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the Fed's takeover of the American International Group. Those events created a new level of fear. Banks cut back on making loans and instead poured money into Treasury bills, which paid almost no interest but also came with almost no risk. On the loans they did make, banks demanded higher interest rates. Over the past two weeks, rates have generally continued to rise -- and these rates, not the stock market, are really what you should be watching.
The current fears can certainly seem irrational. Most households and businesses are still in fine shape, after all. So why aren't some banks stepping into the void and taking advantage of the newly high interest rates to earn some profit?
There are two chief reasons. One is fairly basic: bankers are nervous that borrowers who look solid today may not turn out to be so solid. Think back to 1930, when the American economy seemed to be weathering the storm.
The second reason is a bit more complex. Banks own a lot of long-term assets (like your mortgage) and hold a lot of short-term debt (which is cheaper than long-term debt). To pay off this debt, they need to take out short-term loans.
In the current environment, bankers are nervous that other banks might shut them out, out of fear, and stop extending that short-term credit. This, in a nutshell, brought about Monday's collapse of Wachovia and Glitnir Bank in Iceland. To avoid their fate, other banks are hoarding capital, instead of making seemingly profitable loans. And when capital is hoarded, further bank failures become all the more likely.
The crucial point is that a modern economy can't function when people can't easily get credit. It takes a while for this to become obvious, since most companies and households don't take out big new loans every day. But it will eventually become obvious, and painfully so. Already, a lack of car loans has caused vehicle sales to fall further.
Could the current crisis lift -- could banks decide they really are missing out on profitable investing opportunities -- without a $700 billion government fund to relieve Wall Street of its scariest holdings? Sure. And is Congress right to fight for a workable program that's as inexpensive and as tough on Wall Street as possible? Absolutely.
But in the end, this really isn't about Wall Street. It's about reducing the risk that something really bad happens. It's about limiting the damage from the past decade's financial excesses. Unfortunately, there is no way to accomplish that without also extending a helping hand to Wall Street. That is where our credit markets are, and we need them to start working again.
''We are facing a major national crisis,'' as Meyer Mishkin's grandson says. ''To do nothing right now is to do what was done during the Great Depression.''

HEADLINE: Black and Hispanic Caucuses Resisted Pelosi on Bailout

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD; Rebecca Cathcart contributed reporting.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Speaker Nancy Pelosi normally enjoys warm relations with members of the House's black and Hispanic caucuses, but a large number of them revolted Monday against legislation, which she supported, to rescue the financial industry.
 Class differences were laid bare by the vote. Several members of the two all-Democratic caucuses, who are now working among themselves and with the House leadership to put forward a compromise, characterized the defeated bill as one that would have provided assistance to the rich at the expense of middle- and lower-income voters. And it is to those voters that the lawmakers must answer.
 Representative Xavier Becerra, whose district includes some of Los Angeles's poorer precincts, said, ''The last thing I need to do is go back home and tell people I voted for $700 billion, some of which will touch the same people that caused the problem, and I can't guarantee taxpayers will recoup those costs.'' 
 The Congressional Hispanic Caucus, 40 percent of whose members are fellow Californians of Ms. Pelosi, voted 12 to 8 against the bailout, while the Congressional Black Caucus rejected it by 21 to 18. The overall vote was 228 to 205, meaning that a shift of 12 votes from nay to aye would have brought passage.
 While two-thirds of House Republicans wound up opposing the bill, Ms. Pelosi, as promised, delivered votes from half the Democratic members (actually a bit more). But her inability to corral more votes from two often reliable blocs spoke to deep misgivings about the bill's particulars, the notion among the members' constituents that a vote in favor would mean alignment with Republicans to help Wall Street, and a degree of confusion and uncertainty about the depth of the financial crisis.
 Mr. Becerra, Ms. Pelosi's assistant speaker, defended her Tuesday, saying that while she had never pressured him, she had done all she could to gain support for the measure. He attributed its failure to a refusal by President Bush and House Republicans to include protections for people who had gone bankrupt or were losing their homes.
 Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. of Chicago put it more starkly.
 ''We need to bail out the country, not the country club,'' Mr. Jackson said, speaking by phone Tuesday from Washington as he prepared to participate in a meeting intended to revive some version of the legislation.
 Two years ago, expressing support for Ms. Pelosi's nomination as speaker, Mr. Jackson invoked Rosa Parks, Harriet Tubman and Jesus. But on Tuesday he said that despite the turmoil in the markets, he could not have sold the bill to his constituents.
 ''I would hope greater homeowner protections would not be seen as unreasonable,'' he said, ''since the foundation of the economy is homeownership, where the crisis began.''
 Representative Jose E. Serrano of the Bronx, too, presented his position as one of looking after the little guy.
 ''I represent the poorest district in the nation, located in the richest city on earth, in walking distance of the wealthiest district, on the Upper East Side,'' Mr. Serrano said. ''People on Wall Street, without regulation of the financial services industry, they created a false economy based on inflated home values. The middle class and the poor didn't reap any benefits from that. Whether or not we bail them out, we cannot put this on the backs of the poor and working class.''
 Members of the caucuses who did support the bill agreed with the leadership that it was a difficult but necessary step at a time of predictions that the economy might crumble without it.
 Representative Dennis Cardoza of California, a self-styled fiscal conservative whose Central Valley district has experienced some of the largest numbers of mortgage defaults, said voting for the bill ''makes you want to vomit.'' But he agreed that it was needed to avoid economic collapse.
 ''Not enough members understand the economics of both the situation and what is in the bill,'' Mr. Cardoza said. ''There are some who let ideological purity get in the way.''
 Among those opposing the measure was the chairman of the Hispanic caucus, Representative Joe Baca, who represents a Los Angeles-area district. Mr. Baca made clear Tuesday that he would push hard to include in a compromise bill the creation of a new government agency, the Family Foreclosure Rescue Corporation, which would finance loans to people in foreclosure or serious default.
 The idea, backed by several members of both caucuses who voted no on Monday, would allow families to refinance their mortgages through a government-administered loan with a set interest rate.
 ''Now we have the opportunity to submit our own proposal,'' Mr. Baca said, ''and make this better.''

HEADLINE: Adding Sweeteners, Senate Pushes Bailout Plan

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE and ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Senate leaders scheduled a Wednesday vote on a $700 billion financial bailout package after accepting tax breaks and a higher limit for insured bank deposits in a bid to win House approval and send legislation to President Bush by the end of the week.
 Top lawmakers said the Senate proposal, worked out after a day of behind the scenes maneuvering, would include tax breaks for businesses and alternative energy and higher government insurance for bank deposits.
 ''It has been determined, in our judgment, this is the best thing to move forward,'' said Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada and the majority leader, in announcing the surprise move. 
 The senators issued no details of their proposal and said none would be available until Wednesday. The lawmakers were gambling that the tax package would appeal to lawmakers who helped sink the measure in the House on Monday, without driving off Democrats who have opposed extending the tax incentives without offsetting spending cuts elsewhere. 
 House Democratic leaders reacted cautiously to the new approach, with Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader and a chief advocate of paying for the tax breaks, saying, ''I am talking with my House colleagues about the Senate action and how to best proceed.''
 But House Republican leaders, who said they had been advised about the Senate plan, said the new elements would appeal to their rank-and-file, which voted strongly against the legislation Monday. A spokesman for Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader, said that ''Mr. Boehner was consulted and gave the green light.'' 
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the Senate banking committee, said the Senate decided to move quickly, citing signs of regret from some House members after the markets plunged in response to their initial vote.
 ''I think their will is coming back having heard from their constituents,'' Mr. Dodd said.
 Lawmakers said the stock market response to the rejection was a sobering experience that could enhance prospects for a revised plan. Some anxiety lifted on Tuesday, as the Dow Jones industrial average rose 485 points, regaining more than half of the 778 points it lost on Monday.
 Still, deep concern remained about credit markets, as the rate that banks charge one another shot higher -- to a record high by one widely used measure -- making borrowing more difficult.
 President Bush joined the two major presidential candidates, Senators John McCain and Barack Obama, in calling for quick action to stabilize the markets and avoid what Mr. Bush characterized as the threat of ''painful and lasting'' damage to the economy.
 Both presidential candidates and the Bush administration also endorsed the increase in bank deposit insurance.
 On the morning after the sell-off on Wall Street, Congressional offices reported a shift in angry calls from constituents, with some now demanding that lawmakers take some corrective action -- a distinct change from the outpouring of public opposition that contributed to the defeat of the plan.
 ''I started hearing from a lot of people who lost money on their investments thanks to the big drop on Wall Street yesterday,'' said Representative Steven C. LaTourette, Republican of Ohio, who voted against the plan.
 As they explored ways to tinker with the proposal in consultation with the Bush administration, all sides agreed any revisions would not change the underlying concept of granting the Treasury Department access to up to $700 billion to purchase -- and eventually resell -- troubled securities that were clogging the financial system.
 It was a delicate balancing act for the architects of the proposal who had to be careful that in adding elements to entice new support they did not lose the support they already had.
 ''Obviously you don't want to do something to lose votes,'' said Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, who was among Senate Democrats who huddled Tuesday to discuss possible alterations in the proposal.
 Speaker Nancy Pelosi was noncommital about the new Senate plan Tuesday night, but other Democrats said it might be difficult to reject given the crisis and the array of tax breaks. ''The Senate will vote tomorrow night, and the Congress will work its will,'' Ms. Pelosi said. . 
 House officials spent much of Tuesday considering their own changes, including an extension of unemployment pay and a $1,000 tax credit for less affluent homeowners. 
 But those plans are not likely to advance given the Senate decision. While the Senate left the door open slightly to other additions to the bill, such revisions would need the agreement of the full Senate, and the House proposals were likely to be blocked by Senate Republicans.
 ''Opening this up all over again to other things may doom it,'' Mr. Dodd cautioned.
 The Senate proposal would cost more than $100 billion and extend and expand many individual and business tax breaks, including tax credits for the production and use of renewable energy sources, like solar energy and wind power.
 The bill would also extend the business tax credit for research and development, expand the child tax credit, protect millions of families from the alternative minimum tax and provide tax relief to victims of recent floods, tornadoes and severe storms.
 Members of the House and the Senate said the bill would create tens of thousands of jobs and reduce the nations' dependence on foreign oil. But the two chambers have been at odds over whether and how to offset the cost of extending the many tax breaks covered by the legislation. The major obstacle has been Representative Hoyer of Maryland and other centrist Democrats.
 Senate and House leaders had been debating whether the Senate, where support for the proposal runs deep, should vote first to provide some momentum for a second vote across the Capital Rotunda. Some senators were leery of going on the record if the legislation could not prevail in the House, but others backed the idea of the Senate taking the lead.
 ''I would support the Senate going first, which we would be willing to do as early as tomorrow if that would make this process successful,'' Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, said in a conference call on Tuesday.
 With no new vote in the House even possible before lawmakers reconvene Thursday at noon, strategists for both parties spent Tuesday poring over tally sheets from Monday afternoon's 228-to-205 outcome, trying to identify lawmakers who could be persuaded to switch their votes.
 But winning over some determined opponents was not going to be easy.
 ''It was one of the best votes of my career,'' said Representative Peter A. DeFazio of Oregon, leader of a group of liberal Democratic opponents of the Treasury plan who on Tuesday proposed a series of regulatory and legislative alternatives to the bailout. 
 But those Democratic opponents did say that they would be willing to back an increase to $250,000 from $100,000 in the amount of a bank deposit that would be insured by the federal government -- an idea that on Tuesday gained fast currency as a consensus change in the initial plan.
 Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain embraced the deposit insurance proposal early Tuesday, setting off a bit of a political tiff over who deserved credit for initiating it. House Republicans claimed to have offered the insurance increase in weekend negotiations over the plan only to have it rejected.
 Democrats said they had no recollection of that provision being brought up in the chaotic talks, but top Democratic Congressional aides said the leadership was willing to add it to the bill and knew of no opposition. The chief uncertainty was whether it would significantly enhance the outlook for the legislation.
 ''Everybody is on board,'' said one top House aide who spoke on condition of not being identified when talking about internal deliberations. ''The question is, how many votes does it bring?''
 With the House in recess for the observance of Jewish religious holidays, lawmakers consulted via conference call on their ideas for improving the legislation. 
 ''Some will feel very virtuous about having voted against Wall Street and then turn around and find their constituents, generally, paid a huge price for that vote,'' said Senator Robert Bennett, Republican of Utah, in exhorting his colleagues to ''rise to the occasion'' and pass the bill. 
 ''I have faith that the members of the House and the members of the Senate will ultimately recognize their responsibility and do the right thing.''
 Trying to calm the markets, Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Reid, the majority leader, released a letter to Mr. Bush, saying, ''Working together, we are confident we will pass a responsible bill in the very near future.'' 
 Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, was even more emphatic. ''This financial crisis is going to be dealt with by Congress, and it's going to be dealt with by Congress this week,'' Mr. McConnell told reporters.

HEADLINE: Europe Moves to Calm Ripple Effect of Crisis

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY and KATRIN BENNHOLD; Carter Dougherty reported from Frankfurt and Katrin Bennhold from Paris. Landon Thomas Jr. contributed reporting from London.

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
Several European governments went on the offensive Tuesday, bailing out a second Belgian bank in two days and promising to protect all bank depositors in Ireland, as they seek to blunt the effects of the global financial crisis in their countries. 
 The actions, which reflected the range of financial troubles rippling across the Continent, were accompanied by promises of further action from leaders in four capitals -- as well as a continued resistance to adopting an American-style rescue plan for Europe's financial system. 
 The governments of France and Belgium threw a 6.4 billion euro, or $9 billion, lifeline to Dexia, a French-Belgian lender that has suffered huge losses in its American operations, just a day after Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands announced a partial nationalization of the financial conglomerate Fortis. In return, the governments demanded that Dexia sharply improve its corporate governance. The bank's chief executive and chairman also resigned. 
 In Ireland, where a record plunge in the stock market Monday and rumors of bank withdrawals have spooked investors, the government announced a blanket guarantee for all depositors and creditors of six Irish banks. Previously, deposits were insured up to 100,000 euros, recently raised from 20,000 euros. The decision commits the Irish government to backing $400 billion in liabilities, an amount twice the country's annual economic output.
 Brian Lenihan Jr., Ireland's finance minister, traced the decision to the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, saying American authorities ''were mistaken in permitting that bank to go to the wall because it has had very serious consequences for the world financial system.'' He urged other European Union governments to consider the Irish solution.
 The biggest fear is that one of Europe's most prominent cross-border banks might find itself in trouble. ''We just don't know what's next,'' said one French official close to talks with banks, who declined to be identified because of market sensitivities. ''Even if many European banks are more diversified than some American banks that got into trouble, in this business everything is linked.''
 Most analysts said that prospect remained remote. But they warned that European regulators had no common tools to deal with a major bank failure, and the multigovernment approach taken in the Fortis bailout would be hard to duplicate on a larger scale. 
 ''Could you replicate that in the case of a Deutsche Bank where the Germans bail out Deutsche Germany and the British bail out Deutsche U.K.?'' asked Daniel Gros, director of the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels. ''That is the logic of the Fortis bailout.''
 The European Central Bank also redoubled on Tuesday its efforts to keep money markets supplied with cash so that lending would not dry up, taking that action hard on the heels of similar steps taken by the Federal Reserve to pump hundreds of billions of dollars into money markets. 
 The global financial crisis has entered a potentially dangerous phase in which many credit markets have stopped working normally. These markets suffered further gridlock Tuesday, a day after the House of Representatives rejected a plan to bail out the American financial industry, a problem that risks pushing more lenders toward insolvency. 
 The credit squeeze has taken an especially hard toll on Iceland, whose sovereign debt rating was cut by Fitch ratings for the second time in two days and placed on review for a downgrade by Moody's after the government bailed out one of the country's three largest banks, Glitnir, on Monday. 
 As President Bush and Senate leaders of both parties vowed to work toward quick approval of a financial bailout plan, European officials sounded a note of urgency. 
 ''The German government expects, and I expect, that the rescue package in the United States of America be approved this week,'' Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said in Berlin. She added that the bailout was ''the precondition for creating new confidence in the markets and that is of incredibly great significance.''
 At the same time, other European leaders pointed to efforts under way to shelter Europe from the storm.
 Spanish officials cited their regulatory approach, which has kept their banks generally well capitalized despite a real estate meltdown there that rivals the one in the United States.
 In Britain, Alistair Darling, the chancellor of the Exchequer, promised to outline the government's plans in a speech next week even as David Cameron, the Conservative Party leader, struck a rare bipartisan note by saying he would work with the governing Labor Party to solve the crisis.
 President Nicolas Sarkozy of France huddled with senior bankers at the Elysee Palace on Tuesday morning. Mr. Sarkozy is organizing a meeting of some European leaders for as early as Friday in Paris.
 Jean-Claude Juncker, Luxembourg's prime minister and finance minister, is expected to attend the meeting in his role as chairman of finance chiefs from the euro area, as is Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank. Mr. Juncker said that the 27-nation European Union needed to work together more closely, but the outlines of a common strategy remained hazy at best.
 ''We all agree that the method by which everyone comes up with ad hoc solutions in his corner the moment a crisis starts in a financial company isn't a systematic enough method,'' he said.
 But a senior French official said the idea was not to devise ''a European version of the Paulson plan.'' European governments have neither the fiscal leeway to borrow enough money, nor a joint treasury. Instead, one measure under discussion is to suspend strict E.U. antitrust rules in the case of an emergency nationalization; another would link the pay of traders to long-term performance rather than short-term gains.
 Dexia, which was created in the 1990s from a network of Belgian and French municipal lenders, came under pressure after it extended credit this summer to a New York bond insurer that has suffered alongside similar American companies. Dexia's shares lost nearly a third of their value Monday, rebounding on Tuesday after the bailout was announced.
 The Belgian authorities and shareholders agreed to split 6 billion euros of the bailout with the French government and its state-owned bank, Caisse des Depots, leaving the French faction with more than 25 percent of the lender -- a blocking minority for key decisions. The Luxembourg government put in 376 million euros via convertible notes.
 ''The management of the crisis has at times been a little chaotic, and the markets just don't accept that,'' said Axel Miller, Dexia's chief executive, who is leaving the bank. ''It's time for regulators globally to get together to find some kind of global solution.''

HEADLINE: MAYOR EXPECTED TO SEEK 3RD TERM, REJECTING LIMITS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO and DAVID W. CHEN; Charles V. Bagli, Jim Dwyer and Jonathan P. Hicks contributed reporting.

 BODY:
In an act that promises to upend New York City's political world, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg plans to announce Thursday that he will seek a third term as mayor, according to four people who have been told of his intentions. 
 Mr. Bloomberg, whose second term ends in 2009, is barred by law from running for re-election. So he will propose revising the city's 15-year-old term limits law, which restricts him and dozens of other elected leaders to two four-year terms, those people said. 
 In his appearance on Thursday, they said, Mr. Bloomberg, a former Wall Street trader and the founder of a billion-dollar financial data firm, will argue that the worldwide financial crisis -- with its potentially severe impact on New York City -- demands his steady hand and business experience.
 The decision to challenge the term limits law, which was twice approved by New York voters, represents a remarkable about-face for Mr. Bloomberg. He has repeatedly said he supports such constraints on elected leaders, dismissed the idea that anyone is indispensable, and once called an effort to revise the limits ''disgusting.'' 
 People briefed on the matter said Mr. Bloomberg, 66, would seek to change the law through legislation in the City Council. His staff is envisioning an unusual bill that would apply only to those currently in office, allowing them to serve three terms instead of two. A permanent change would require voter approval, these people said.
 Mr. Bloomberg's strategy carries significant political risk. Several polls, conducted over the last few months, show widespread support for keeping the law in place. City voters passed term limits by overwhelming margins in 1993, and reaffirmed their support in 1996. 
 ''A backdoor deal undermines the will of New Yorkers,'' said the New York City comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., who plans to run for mayor next year. ''Democracy,'' he added, ''is bigger than any one person.''
 Yet it remains unclear who can stop the popular Mr. Bloomberg from changing the law and coasting to an election victory next year. The concept of a third term has broad support among City Council members, business leaders and newspaper editorial boards, all of whom Mr. Bloomberg has assiduously courted behind the scenes. On Wednesday, The New York Times will call in an editorial for abolishing term limits. The New York Post and The Daily News have already endorsed Mr. Bloomberg's bid for a third term.
 And, according to a person who has advised the mayor in the past, he ''does not care what it costs'' to win a third term. In 2005, Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire, spent more than $70 million and won nearly 60 percent of the vote.
 Mr. Bloomberg was observing the Jewish New Year on Tuesday and his press aides did not return several e-mail messages and telephone calls. 
 During marathon telephone conversations in recent weeks, Mr. Bloomberg has debated with his friends and advisers the pros and cons of running again. 
 ''This has been thoroughly thought out by the mayor,'' said the person who has advised the mayor in the past. ''It's not like he just woke up one morning and decided to do it.''
 With his decision, Mr. Bloomberg is overruling the advice of his top three assistants at City Hall -- Deputy Mayors Edward Skyler, Patricia E. Harris and Kevin Sheekey -- who have expressed opposition to a third term. 
 Those aides have told the mayor -- at times forcefully -- that any campaign to challenge the term-limits law would look like an end run around voters, and could sully his legacy as a reform-minded outsider. Others have told the mayor that they may not remain for a full third term.
 In the business community, however, the idea of a Bloomberg third term is popular. At charity balls and on golf courses, executives like the financier Steven Rattner, the developer Jerry I. Speyer and the media mogul Rupert Murdoch have encouraged him to seek a third term. 
 As the city's economy has become imperiled over the last two weeks, as Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and Merrill Lynch was sold, calls for a third term have multiplied. Mr. Bloomberg has taken pains to project an image of authority on the economy, trading telephone calls with chief executives of Wall Street firms, traveling to Washington to meet with federal regulators and appearing on ''Meet the Press'' to field questions about the financial crisis.
 Closer to home, he has warned of gaping budget deficits and said that he would probably raise property taxes by 7 percent as soon as January.
 ''He has the confidence of the business community and the executive ability to run the city,'' said Stephen Ross, the chief executive of the Related Companies, a major developer in the city. ''This is a good time for him to do this. People are scared.''
 Even Ronald S. Lauder, the billionaire cosmetics heir who waged the successful 1993 campaign to create term limits in the city, has signed onto a Bloomberg third term, citing the tumultuous economy. ''I saw what was happening with the economy and with prospects for the city,'' Mr. Lauder said in an interview on Tuesday. Now, he added, ''I could support the idea of a third term.'' Mr. Lauder's change of heart was reported on Tuesday in The Post.
 According to a timetable outlined by those who have been told of the mayor's plan, legislation calling for the extension would probably be introduced within the next few weeks to the Council, which has already signaled its support for the change
 A New York Times survey of City Council members in early September found that a majority were willing to amend the term-limits law, in order to allow Mr. Bloomberg and the Council -- two-thirds of whom are scheduled to be forced out of office in 2009 -- to seek a third term. 
 The Council committee that must first approve such a bill is run by Councilman Simcha Felder, a strong Bloomberg ally. Over the last seven years, the mayor has directed millions of dollars in city money to community groups supported by Mr. Felder, according to city records. 
 Mr. Bloomberg's reversal is certain to cause chaos in the city's political class. For months, or even years, many of the more than 40 elected leaders scheduled to leave office next year have been raising millions of dollars and lining up support for their next campaigns, whether for the State Legislature in September, or races for mayor, comptroller and borough president in 2009. But if the mayor succeeds in revising the law, all of those candidates could seek a third term in their current offices. 
 Mr. Bloomberg's plan would have an especially deep impact on the next mayor's race. As the law now stands, two candidates for mayor next year, Mr. Thompson, the comptroller, and Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn, would be forced from office under term limits. Given Mr. Bloomberg's popularity and significant financial advantage, they may choose to sit out the mayoral campaign once he enters the race, political analysts said. 
 ''I believe that most of those candidates who were thinking of running will probably wait for the next round,'' said former Mayor Edward I. Koch. ''While Mike Bloomberg will undoubtedly have some opposition -- there will be somebody -- I expect him to be overwhelming re-elected.''
 A person close to Mr. Bloomberg, who is a Democrat turned Republican turned independent, said the mayor was leaning toward running as an independent for a third term. To do so, he would need to collect just 7,500 signatures: a requirement that even the subway vigilante Bernard Goetz met in 2001.
 Representative Anthony D. Weiner, a likely mayoral candidate, said through a spokesman, ''It's illegal to run for a third term.'' Ms. Quinn, through a spokesman, declined to comment.
 Mr. Bloomberg's decision to modify the law is all but certain to be used against him in the next mayoral campaign. 
 ''The mayor has carefully crafted an image of always acting in the public interest, but this act of circumventing the will of the voters now calls that into question,'' said Dick Dadey, the executive director of Citizens Union, a government watchdog group.

A chart on Oct. 1 with the continuation of a front-page article about Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's expected announcement that he would seek a third term misstated the time in office of two previous mayors, George B. McClellan and James J. Walker. McClellan served six years as mayor, not more than seven, and Walker served six years and eight months, not just six.

HEADLINE: Reconsidering Deposit Insurance

BYLINE: By BREAKINGVIEWS.COM

 BODY:
If the French and Irish can do it, why can't Americans? Both European nations have tried to avert financial panic by promising full guarantees of bank deposits.
 Astonishingly, the United States government still insures only the same level of savings -- $100,000 per individual account -- it did when Ronald Reagan occupied the White House and Blondie topped the pop charts. Britain, meanwhile, has spent a year since the run on the mortgage lender Northern Rock dithering over whether to lift the guarantee from the current $:35,000 ($62,300). 
 Both countries now appear poised to lift their existing limits. They should go a step further and follow the French and Irish examples by guaranteeing all citizens' deposits until the current credit crisis has passed and then return to new, higher limits when the dust settles. 
 The worry is not just that individual depositors, scared by plunging stock prices and headlines about the perilous state of the banking system, will withdraw their money -- even though that did happen when Washington Mutual's customers withdrew about $17 billion of deposits, sending the country's largest savings and loan into the arms of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and then JPMorgan Chase.
 Equally concerning is the response that businesses might have to perceptions -- real or imagined -- that the financial institutions they work with may not be safe and sound. After all, companies large and small keep their cash tied up in bank accounts so they can meet their payrolls and pay suppliers. Any disruption could hurt an economy already on the ropes and further disrupt a financial system struggling to find stability.
 True, the existing limits in America and Britain do cover the bulk of individual accounts. The F.D.I.C. says its insurance covered 62 percent of all deposits as of September last year. But that has declined steadily since peaking at 82 percent in 1992. The British Bankers' Association points out that Britain's cap covers 96 percent of all accounts. But many of those accounts are tiny. The really big accounts -- including corporate deposits -- don't have much protection. 
 When the lender Bradford & Bingley went under earlier this week, only 80 percent of its deposit base was covered, and Bradford & Bingley wasn't known as a bank that took mega-deposits from companies. 
 At the end of the day, all the Bradford & Bingley depositors were saved -- as were virtually all of those of IndyMac, the largest bank to have passed into the F.D.I.C.'s hands without the type of quick transfer that occurred with WaMu's supervised sale to JPMorgan Chase.
 But right now, authorities on both sides of the Atlantic need to avoid even the whiff of a suggestion that deposits aren't rock solid. The wholesale markets that provide most of the rest of the banking industry's funds put their money away at the first hint that depositors are wobbling. And then the game can all too quickly be up. 
 So what kind of longer-term limit should the United States government set? Both presidential candidates and the F.D.I.C. have called for an increase to $250,000 per account and it looks likely that they will get it. That is probably the bare minimum. If the limit that has been in effect since 1980 was adjusted for inflation, it would guarantee deposits to the tune of about $262,000. 
 The right longer-term solution is probably to move the deposit insurance limit up to this higher level and then increase it annually to account for inflation. Given that we are in the midst of a crisis, however, there is a strong case for insuring all of America's consumer deposits for the time being. 
 Of course, government guarantees at any level are not cost-free -- even if the banking industry pays an insurance premium for the privilege, as it should. If depositors are totally protected, they will have no incentive to put their money with the safest institutions and some will chase the highest-yielding accounts on offer. That means reckless banks can effectively get bailed out by more conservative ones. 
 That said, there are ways of mitigating this so-called moral hazard. Calculating insurance fees to provide the right incentives is one. Putting a limit on the insurance, at least once markets have stabilized, is another. There will be time enough to consider the long-term rules for the banking system. Right now, policy makers should just get on with making sure worries over deposits don't start the next bank failure.

HEADLINE: New State Panel to Study Privatizing Public Assets

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
Facing a recession, Gov. David A. Paterson's administration said on Tuesday that it would set up a commission to explore ways to privatize public assets, including the lottery system and bridges like the Tappan Zee.
 Administration officials said that the governor was not seeking to plug holes in the budget by selling off the state's assets. Still, any money raised could be used to make capital investments that the state otherwise would be unable to make in a financial downturn, they said. 
 The commission's chairwoman is to be one of the governor's aides, Charlotte Hitchcock, deputy secretary for labor and financial regulation, making it somewhat less independent than many other study commissions in New York. Of the 11 members, 6 will be appointed by the governor, 4 will be recommended by the leaders of the Assembly and Senate, the attorney general and the state comptroller, and one will come from organized labor. 
 ''Public-private partnerships are not the only answer, but we need to honestly assess whether they can be part of the solution,'' the governor said in a statement. 
 Sean Patrick Maloney, a top aide to Mr. Paterson, said the governor ''is not interested in a quick fix for the budget deficit,'' adding, ''He does want to understand what is the best way to partner, if any, with the private sector.'' 
 Investment banks have long advocated privatization deals to state governments. Typically, they are structured as long-term leases, like the deal Chicago struck in 2005 to lease a toll road, the Skyway, to a foreign consortium for the next century in exchange for $1.8 billion. 
 Such ideas have been met with skepticism by the New York Legislature, which rejected an effort earlier this year by Eliot Spitzer, the governor at the time, to privatize the state's lottery system. The Paterson administration said last week that it would consider some kind of private partnership in a multibillion-dollar project to replace the Tappan Zee Bridge. 
 ''There's never anything wrong with looking at an idea, but it's got to be balanced and not predetermined,'' said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat who is the chairman of the Assembly committee that oversees the public authorities that manage much of the state's infrastructure. ''It's a very hard week to extol the virtues of private financing deals and a very hard week to rely on Wall Street's advice.''
 Stephen J. Acquario, executive director of the New York State Association of Counties, said, ''At this time of fiscal distress and uncertainty, all available options should be explored by the state.''
 Ms. Hitchcock has a legal background. Before joining the Paterson administration in May, she served as deputy counsel to Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, and for 15 years before that was a senior staff lawyer with the Legal Aid Society in Manhattan.
 Asked about her expertise in examining privatizations of major public assets, she pointed to her close ties to organized labor and her role as one of the officials involved in the state's recent move to allow the American International Group access to $20 billion of capital from its subsidiaries, a day before the embattled insurer received a federal bailout.
 Elizabeth Lynam, a deputy research director at the Citizens Budget Commission, called the Hitchcock selection ''an interesting choice.''
 ''Part of the idea of these is that the private sector can extract better value than the government can, and some of that has to do with labor costs,'' she said, suggesting that since Ms. Hitchcock's role as the administration's top labor adviser could undercut cost-cutting efforts. 
 But Ms. Lynam added that the recent turmoil on Wall Street suggested that even ''titans of industry are not necessarily the best people to talk to about leveraging capital.''

HEADLINE: Amid the Wall Street Chaos: Confusion, Anger and Shifting Opinions

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON; Reporting was contributed by Robbie Brown from Atlanta; Ana Facio Contreras from Inglewood, Calif.; Karen Ann Cullotta from Arlington Heights, Ill.; Steve Friess from Henderson, Nev.; Christopher Maag from Mentor, Ohio; and Katie Zezima from Providence, R.I.

DATELINE: BOULDER, Colo. 

 BODY:
Molly Winter, a longtime supporter of Mark Udall, the Democratic congressman for this liberal-leaning city nestled up against the Rocky Mountains, got up Tuesday, looked at the shambles of her 401(k) retirement plan, and dashed off an e-mail message to Mr. Udall. It was laced, she said, with some very pointed questions.
 ''I asked him what his plan is now to reinstate the value in my 401(k),'' said Ms. Winter, 58, who works for the city and identified herself as a Democrat. ''He needs to be accountable and say what his long-term strategy is.''
 In interviews across the country, in the districts of six members of Congress -- three Republicans and three Democrats, three who voted for the bailout and three, including Mr. Udall, who voted against it -- voters and members of Congress alike said they were grappling Tuesday with a cold, harsh newfound reality. 
 What had been perhaps been a philosophical or ideological debate -- about the role of government in the financial markets or the wisdom of sending billion-dollar checks to Wall Street, or the political calculus of voting yes or no for a plan that most people assumed would pass anyway -- had become in the course of one day suddenly, frighteningly concrete.
 ''Reality is here,'' said Ms. Winter, who said she still planned to vote for Mr. Udall, who is running for the Senate, but that the pressure is now on him to deliver. ''How do we move forward?''
 Some Congressional offices reported a shift in tone and tenor. Strong opposition to the plan in predominantly Democratic districts like Mr. Udall's and Republican-leaning ones like Representative Steven C. LaTourette's near Cleveland melted into an anxious babble, with lots of support for the idea of doing something -- anything -- that would end the crisis. 
 ''Before yesterday, they were about 200-to-1 against the bailout,'' said Mr. LaTourette, who voted against the package. ''Now I'd say it's balanced 50-50 between those who favor a bailout and those who oppose it. I know people who are taking out cash from their savings accounts and literally hiding it under their mattresses.''
 Still, some people here in Colorado and in the other districts said they were standing pat. They had hated the bailout plan before, some for conservative reasons, some for liberal ones, and were thoroughly glad it was dead. Something better would arise from the ashes, they predicted. 
 But many others were just shaken and shocked and afraid and not at all sure what Congress, or individuals in taking stock of their finances and futures, should do next to reinstate some sense of stability. Everywhere, sometimes in the same sentence, beliefs and fears -- what should happen and what might happen -- were in collision, and a deep well of anger was, for almost everyone, just beneath the surface. 
 ''The thing is that I don't think I got a call from her office to ask our opinion; they didn't call to say, 'Do you want to fill out a survey or what do you think about this?' '' said Verona Burks, 56, of Los Angeles, referring to her congresswoman, Maxine Waters, a Democrat who voted for the bailout package. ''When they want your vote, they call and keep calling.''
 Ms. Burks, a Democrat who lost a retailing job after 22 years when the company went bankrupt in 2004, now works as an administrative assistant in a restaurant in Inglewood, Calif., said Ms. Waters and the rest of Congress needed to get back to work, and fast. 
 ''I'm of the opinion today, after hearing everything, that she -- they -- need to go back to the table and figure out a solution that thinks of taxpayers first,'' Ms. Burks said.
 Some voters said they sympathized with their elected representatives, facing situations that were unpalatable on either side.
 ''It's hard to know whether Congressman Lewis was right or not,'' said Larry Phillips, 28, a management consultant in Atlanta who identified himself as a Democrat, referring to his representative, John Lewis, a Democrat who voted against the bailout. ''There doesn't seem to be any easy solution,'' Mr. Phillips added. ''If he supports the bailout, people will say he's helping Wall Street companies. If he doesn't, they'll say he made the economy even worse.'' 
 The pressure was clearly flowing both ways.
 ''I checked online to see if Kirk voted in favor of the bailout,'' said John McLaughlin, 52, a consultant from Arlington Heights, Ill., who said he applauded Representative Mark Steven Kirk's decision -- as one of just 65 Republicans in the House -- to support the bailout. 
 ''I was going to send him an angry e-mail if he voted no,'' added Mr. McLaughlin, who has a ''Kirk for U.S. Congress'' sign on his front lawn. ''I don't like the bailout, but unfortunately, we have no other choice.'' 
 Indeed, some members of Congress actually seemed to have found a winning position through the political fallout after the vote, even as the markets reeled on Monday and the public perception of Congress, many people said, sank another notch.
 Representative Jon Porter, a Republican from the Las Vegas suburbs who voted for the package, said calls and e-mail had been heavily against the bailout, but he voted for it because of the economy's dire circumstances.
 That surprised and impressed Julianna Hendrickson, 34, of Henderson, Nev., who said it showed an independence in Mr. Porter that she had not seen before.
 ''I will admit I am thinking again about voting for him because of this, and he never did much for me before,'' said Ms. Hendrickson, a Democrat and mother of five whose bank recently reassessed her home and yanked her equity line of credit because of its dwindled value. 
 A spokesman for Mr. Porter said calls and e-mail running strongly against the bailout before Monday's vote had shifted since then to support it. 
 Some people said the intense level of public input on the bailout plan, in pressuring members of Congress to vote one way or another, was an expression of democracy at its worst.
 ''I think that the mob shot it down,'' said Phil Schmidt, 44, an aerospace engineer from Longmont, Colo., in Mr. Udall's district. ''People calling their congressman and saying I'm not going to vote for you if you don't do this, and them fearing for their jobs, they voted no even though it was the smart thing to do.''
 Added Mr. Schmidt, who identified himself as a Republican: ''Never underestimate the stupidity of a mob.''
 Mr. Udall, who said on the television program ''Meet the Press'' on Sunday that his mail was divided between ''people who say no and people who say hell no,'' said in an interview on Tuesday that he was ''moderately surprised'' when the bailout package failed. But he said he had known all along that more work needed to be done.
 ''I knew it wouldn't be the end either way,'' he said. ''That was the point of my vote: let's go fix it.''
 But what needs fixing, and how to do it, were questions that left many voters scratching their heads on Tuesday. 
 ''I'm really not understanding all that's involved in this bailout and why this is such a problem all of a sudden,'' said Edna Ivery, 63, a retiree who lives with her husband, Jerry, in Warrensville Heights, Ohio, and was shopping in Mentor, in Mr. LaTourette's district.
 ''I worked in the central office of a bank for 35 years, and things were good; the bank was solid,'' Ms. Ivery, a Democrat, said. ''How did the banks fail so bad, so quickly?'' 
 A common thread most everywhere was that the pain and damage, financial and psychological, was running deep. Ted Walker, an 87-year-old retired professor of geology from the University of Colorado, said he had lost 10 percent of his life savings in the last week. Even with that, Mr. Walker, a Democrat, said he supported Mr. Udall's decision to vote no and would hold firm and vote again for the congressman in his Senate race.
 But even as people debated and discussed the consequences and the best way forward, some said they were more confused than ever about what to believe.
 Alisa Arnold, 42, a flight attendant from Jacksonville Beach, Fla., was having pizza on a layover in Providence, R.I., on Tuesday (and brought her own Diet Coke with her to save money), said she was afraid that the government was not telling Americans just how bad things could get.
 But Ms. Arnold also thought it was possible she was being manipulated by that very sense of fear.
 ''I hope I'm not being scared into supporting the bailout,'' she said.

HEADLINE: ...While Obama Discusses His Tax Plans

BYLINE: By MICHAEL FALCONE

 BODY:
This two-minute advertisement by Senator Barack Obama's media team features him speaking directly into the camera.
 THE SCRIPT Mr. Obama says: ''For eight years, we've been told that the way to a stronger economy was to give huge tax breaks to corporations and the wealthiest Americans, and somehow prosperity would trickle down. Well, now we know the truth. It didn't work. Instead of prosperity trickling down, pain has trickled up. Working-family incomes have fallen by $2,000 a year. 
We're losing jobs. Deficits are exploding. Our economy's in turmoil. I know that we can steer ourselves out of this crisis. But not by driving down the very same path. And that's what this election's all about. On taxes, John McCain and I have very different ideas. Instead of giving hundreds of billions in new tax breaks to big corporations and oil companies, I'll cut taxes for small and startup businesses that are the backbone of our economy. Instead of more tax breaks for corporations that outsource American jobs, I'll give them to companies who create jobs here. Instead of extending the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest, I'll focus on you. My plan offers three times as much tax relief to the middle class as Senator McCain's. If you make less than a quarter- million a year, you won't see your taxes raised one penny under my plan. And seniors making less than 50,000, who are struggling with the rising costs of food and drugs on fixed incomes, won't pay income taxes at all. The tax code we have today is over 10,000 pages long. Almost every bit of it was shaped by some lobbyist taking care of some special interest. Well, it's time we had a president who puts you first. I hope you'll log on to BarackObama.com and read my full plan. It will help jump-start our economy, create millions of jobs and bring back our Main Streets all across America. The old trickle-down theory has failed us. We can't afford four more years like the last eight. I'm Barack Obama, and I approved this message because I know that with a new direction and new policies focused on jobs and the middle class, we can lift our economy and our country.''
 ON THE SCREEN Mr. Obama delivers a two-minute monologue on fiscal issues, outlining what he says are the key differences between his economic proposals and those of Senator John McCain, the Republican nominee.
 ACCURACY The advertisement correctly points out that the incomes of working American families have fallen during the Bush administration. The commercial accuses the McCain campaign of ''giving hundreds of billions in new tax breaks to big corporations and oil companies'' and ''extending the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest.'' While it is true that Mr. McCain has proposed lowering the corporate income tax rate, that reduction applies across the board and is not aimed specifically at oil companies. Mr. Obama has proposed eliminating capital gains taxes on startup and small businesses. The spot's assertion that the Obama plan ''offers three times as much tax relief to the middle class as Senator McCain's'' is backed up by data from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Mr. Obama also points out that American households earning less $250,000 a year will not be subject to an income tax increase. Although that is true for a vast majority of families in that income bracket, some could still see their taxes go up.
 SCORECARD This spot is part of the Obama campaign's attempt to reframe the economic narrative by rebuking a main critique from the McCain campaign: that Mr. Obama is a tax-and-spend liberal. The Obama campaign stretches some facts, but it does a compelling job of tying Mr. McCain to President Bush's economic policies. MICHAEL FALCONE

HEADLINE: Culture of Outsize Pay for Bankers, Born on Wall Street, Has Europe Fuming

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
The governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, gave a speech last spring denouncing the hubris of bankers. That same day, the British bank Barclays, despite a $:1.6 billion write-down in 2007, disclosed a bonus of $:21 million, or about $38 million, to its president, Robert Diamond Jr., for that year. 
 Mr. King followed up his criticism of the excesses of the City of London, as the financial district is known, by choosing not to accept an increase in his salary of $:290,000, or $516,000.
 By comparison, the outsize personality and bonuses of Mr. Diamond, the American-born chief of Barclays' investment banking business, have made him a visible symbol of a Wall Street ethos that has taken root in the financial district. 
 Such contrasts have fueled a growing uproar -- led by Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain and joined by union leaders and theologians -- over how best to curb a culture of escalating pay packages that some believe pushed bankers to take excessive risks. 
 On Monday, the government's announcement of the nationalization of the mortgage lender Bradford & Bingley and an industry estimate that 12,000 finance jobs would be lost in the coming months only added to an angry reaction against the City's financiers and a sense that they have led the country astray.
 Dissatisfaction over high pay, business failures and American-style laissez-faire capitalism has been sweeping across Europe for some time, but it has been given new impetus as investors and politicians struggle to make sense of a credit vise that tightens by the day.
 Even before the latest tumult, steps were taken in the Netherlands and France to limit excessive compensation, and the issue is back on the agenda when European finance ministers meet Oct. 6 in Luxembourg. 
 In the United States, outrage among many voters over the prospect of bailing out Wall Street executives played a role in the surprising rejection Monday of a $700 billion financial rescue plan in the House of Representatives.
 But the vitriol has been particularly bitter in Britain, which before the arrival of Margaret Thatcher as prime minister in 1979 was led by Labor and Conservative governments that sought to rein in capitalism rather than unleash it.
 It seems touched as well by a sense of schadenfreude as bankers who once lived so high are being brought low.
 ''It is in our psyche -- we always knock success,'' said Vic Daniels, a former banker who runs a Web site, hereisthecity.com, that tracks the foibles, appetites and bonuses of London's financial elite. ''Who are the most hated football teams? Manchester United and Chelsea. Why? Because they are the most successful. The Brits just don't like the in-your-face winners.'' 
 At his party conference on Sunday, the Conservative Party leader, David Cameron, noted the public mood by expressing support for a closer examination of how bankers are paid. But mindful of the party's base, Mr. Cameron also warned against excessive bashing.
 As it is, the pay of top bankers in Britain and across the Continent does not approach that of chief executives in the United States. Fred Goodwin, chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, was paid $:4 million for 2007. By comparison, Richard S. Fuld Jr., chief executive of Lehman Brothers, was paid more than $40 million last year just months before his company collapsed.
 Now Mr. Diamond, who took a pay cut in 2007 and is leading Barclay's purchase of some of the best parts of Lehman, is preparing to open an office in Lehman's former headquarters in New York. 
 The economic benefits of the long boom in the City of London are clear: The financial sector contributes 10 percent to Britain's gross domestic product. But the conspicuous displays of consumption -- $:44,000 wine tabs for bankers in their 20s and $:25 million homes bought by hedge fund executives -- stick more firmly in the collective craw as mortgage companies collapse and short-sellers circle.
 ''We have all gone to this temple called money,'' decreed the archbishop of York at a dinner last week put on by an aptly named trade group, the Worshipful Company of International Bankers. ''We have all worshiped at it. No one is guiltless.''
 Indeed, resistance to the brazen ways of financiers dates back more than 100 years, to the late 19th century, when the landed English gentry expressed their revulsion at the spendthrift ways of plutocrats from abroad who suddenly appeared at the dinner tables of British country homes.
 ''There might as well have been a Goddess of Gold erected for overt worship,'' one hostess was quoted as saying in ''The Decline and Fall of the British Aristocracy,'' by David Cannadine (Vintage, 1999).
 Some peg the rise of the bonus culture to 1986 when fixed commissions were abolished and the doors opened for American brokerage houses to set up shop in London. Subsequently, the idea of banks' taking on more risk, and getting paid for it, became widespread.
 ''There was none of this frantic trading and multimillion payoffs,'' said George Blakey, who worked as a stock broker in the City from 1966 to 1990 and has recently written a history of the London stock market. ''The function of a stock market was to raise capital for industry. But then our old companies were taken over by these big pushy banks and it all became a crazy capitalist casino.''
 Still, even with the outcry over bonuses, the British financial scene remains devoid of a human symbol to define the public distaste. While Mr. Diamond may come across as more assertive than most on the City's stage, his habits and attitudes pale in comparison with major figures on the other side of the Atlantic. He has not thrown himself a $3 million 60th-birthday party, as did the buyout king Stephen A. Schwarzman, chairman of the private equity firm Blackstone Group. That event in February 2007 that came to epitomize an era of excess.
 ''We have a prudish attitude toward people making too much money,'' said Stuart Fraser, a top official at the City of London. ''But our financial services industry has to remain competitive. We can't have heavy-handed regulation.''
 Such a view was echoed more forcefully by Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, who said recently that the reaction against bankers might jeopardize the London's competitive position with New York as a destination for international capital.
 ''The last thing we want to do now is throw the baby out with the bath water with some form of excessive regulation,'' Mr. Johnson said.
 Nevertheless, as house prices sink and a recession looms, the depth of the anti-banker mood has been powerful enough to affect even the bankers themselves.
 Late last week, an investment banker posted an anonymous letter on hereisthecity.com, which has a readership of about 154,000, most of whom work in London's financial district.
 ''Quite frankly, most of us more senior (and so-called 'experienced') bankers who work in the markets don't deserve a bonus,'' he wrote. ''We are not worthy.''
 The letter drew a nod of agreement from Derek Simpson, the joint general secretary of Unite, Britain's largest union.
 ''Even President Bush has said that the irresponsibility of the few have threatened the stability of many,'' Mr. Simpson said. 
 ''When President Bush, the archbishop of York and Derek Simpson line up together, the financial system should be trembling in its shoes.''

HEADLINE: Massachusetts Wins Waiver, Preserving Health Plan

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
Massachusetts received the Bush administration's seal of approval for its universal health care plan on Tuesday when it reached agreement with federal officials on financing a three-year continuation of the landmark experiment.
Gov. Deval Patrick announced in Boston that the state and the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had negotiated the extension of a waiver that enables federal financial support for the state's subsidized coverage plan. The agreement will allow the state to spend up to $21.2 billion on the program over the next three years, an increase of $4.3 billion over the initial three-year period.
''This is an exceptional outcome under any circumstances, but especially now,'' Mr. Patrick said. ''The American economy is in turmoil and the future is uncertain, but even in tough times we cannot afford to abandon our commitment to affordable, accessible, high-quality health care for every man, woman and child in the commonwealth.'' 
The federal government shares Medicaid costs with the states, and though the states largely set coverage limits and eligibility levels, approval from Washington is required for many elements.
The state's existing Medicaid waiver had expired on June 30, but the federal government granted a number of extensions as negotiations proceeded. State leaders had worried that failure to reach a deal would spell premature death for the health plan, which has lifted Massachusetts' rate of insurance coverage to the highest in the country. Only 5 percent of the state's residents were uninsured in 2007, compared with 15 percent nationally, according to the Census Bureau.
The original waiver, granted when Massachusetts enacted its plan in 2006, allowed the state to take federal money intended to compensate hospitals for charity care and use it to subsidize coverage for low-income uninsured residents.
To reach its goal of covering everyone, the state has offered subsidies on a sliding scale to anyone earning less than three times the federal poverty level, meaning less than $63,600 for a family of four. The Medicaid waiver allows the state to provide financial assistance to families at that level, which is significantly higher than the eligibility cutoff allowed for most states.
Dr. JudyAnn Bigby, the state's secretary of health and human services, said that federal negotiators had expressed interest in lowering the eligibility cutoff to twice the poverty level but that the state's ability to quantify the plan's early successes helped preserve the program in its current form.
The Massachusetts plan, which inspired similar proposals by governors in other states and by Democratic presidential candidates, requires all residents to have health insurance or face financial penalties. Among their options is a subsidized state plan, called Commonwealth Care, for low-income residents who make too much to qualify for Medicaid.
The law prohibits insurers from denying coverage because of a consumer's age or health status, and it requires businesses to either contribute toward their employees' health benefits or pay penalties into a fund to support the insurance subsidies.
The state reported in August that 439,000 of its estimated 650,000 uninsured had gained coverage. About 44 percent had bought private insurance, while 40 percent had enrolled in the new subsidized public plan and 16 percent had joined the state's Medicaid program. As more people gained insurance, the state's payments for uncompensated care dropped by 40 percent.
The plan's rapid growth has generated fiscal pressures. The legislature and Mr. Patrick filled a health care spending gap that approached $200 million for this fiscal year by increasing the tobacco tax by $1 a pack, levying one-time assessments on insurers and hospitals, and raising more money from businesses that do not contribute to their employees' insurance. The state expects to spend $869 million on subsidized coverage this year.

HEADLINE: An Unwelcome Guest Intrudes on a Worry-Free Zone for the Rich

BYLINE: By ROBBIE BROWN

 BODY:
SEA ISLAND, Ga. -- Four years ago, when President Bush was the host of a summit meeting of world leaders on this tiny, privately owned resort island, bestowing prestige and bringing increased tourism, Sea Island seemed recession proof.
So confident in the future were the owners of the high-priced resort here that they poured $350 million into renovations. They opened upscale restaurants. They built waterfront suites costing $5,000 a night. They installed a 100-seat movie theater, a spa, a wine cellar, equestrian facilities and three new pools.
Business boomed, and superlatives accumulated: Conde Nast Traveler named Sea Island among the ''World's Best Places to Stay,'' and Golf Digest called it the best golf resort in North America. 
But those days seemed ancient last month when the resort's owner, the Sea Island Company, fired about 500 employees, nearly 25 percent of the workforce, to stanch its financial losses amid the national downturns in tourism and real estate. Those who were dismissed ranged from cabana waiters to senior executives.
To many local residents, the island has become a cautionary tale. If a falling tide lowers all boats, they say, then Sea Island's woes reveal the faltering economy's toll on even the wealthiest, best-protected regions of America.
''Now we know how Detroit feels,'' said Harry Aiken Jr., a bar operator on neighboring St. Simons Island. ''Everybody knew Sea Island was overextended, but we thought they could always just sell more property.''
In many ways, Sea Island still seems a breezy, worry-free Old South getaway. The cost of the islands' homes averages $3.2 million, according to the Sea Island Company. Brooks Brothers could stock its catalog with Sea Island's bronzed, shapely (and almost exclusively white) bodies. And politicians, professional athletes and C.E.O.'s still dream of retiring to Sea Island's manicured, oak-studded mansions, understatedly called cottages.
But the island has attracted fewer business conferences than usual this year, said Brian Young, the resort's general manager, although personal travel has remained relatively steady. And while houses are selling, including one for more than $4 million this month, C. Allen Brown, the company's vice president for real estate, said he had ''never seen this many potential buyers waiting on the sidelines.''
Fifty of Sea Island's 600 houses are for sale, Mr. Brown said, compared with fewer than 35 this time last year.
In the sun-baked towns that surround Sea Island and rely on its high-spending clientele, people have noticed a slump in business and want to know what caused it: the national economy, natural cycles in the life of a resort or poor financial decisions?
The economy was only one reason for the cutbacks, said the chief executive of the Sea Island Company, Bill Jones III. Seasonal employees were dismissed as summer crowds died down and many people hired during the renovation were no longer necessary, he said. But he acknowledged the economy's significant role.
''Folks are waiting for the market to bottom out,'' Mr. Jones said. ''They say, 'Until we find out where this economy is going, we can't move down here,' and I don't blame them.''
But some residents say local miscalculations, not the national economy, caused the layoffs. (Fired employees signed agreements with Sea Island not to publicly discuss the causes or conditions of their dismissals, several former employees said.)
From 1998 to 2006, Sea Island underwent a sweeping renovation, updating three golf courses and adding a 65,000-square-foot spa and fitness center, a 2,000-bottle wine cellar and other costly accommodations. Then the economy turned sour.
''Rich as they were, there was a real naivete about money,'' Nancy Thomason, the longtime owner of a St. Simons second-hand bookstore, said of the Sea Island Company. ''They were used to being millionaires and playing that game, but they didn't have the money.''
Since its development in the 1920s, Sea Island has attracted a well-heeled and powerful clientele, including visits from six United States presidents. In recent years, home owners have included former Attorney General Griffin B. Bell, the Atlanta Braves pitcher John Smoltz and the CBS News anchor Bob Schieffer.
So the For Sale signs and staff cuts cabled a frightening message to other resort owners: If it can happen here, it can happen anywhere.
''I think everyone is tightening their belts,'' said Jim Sprouse, the executive director of the Georgia Hotel and Lodging Association. ''It's an industry-wide issue as people slow down their travel.''
The greatest slump has been in real estate. In the areas surrounding Sea Island, the average home this year sold for $17,000 less than it did last year and took three weeks longer to sell, said R. Frederick Stroud, a broker at Georgia Coast Realty.
The problem is not a lack of interest in buying houses on the Golden Isles, Mr. Stroud said. Instead, banks that normally issue loans for second homes are tightening their standards amid the national financial crises. With fewer people qualifying for loans, only the wealthiest buyers can afford Sea Island homes.
Sea Island's defenders say the company deserves the community's support. The Jones family, which has owned the resort for 80 years, is ''the backbone of the hospitality industry,'' said Woody Woodside, president of the local chamber of commerce.
''The jobs they've created, the taxes they've created, that's one thing,'' he said. ''But the indirect impact -- it reaches every corner of this island. The whole island is in support of a rally by Sea Island.''
But the firings have worsened class rivalries in a region of great extremes of wealth.
''Down here, it's really rich people and it's poor people,'' Mr. Aiken, the bar operator on St. Simons, said, gesturing toward Sea Island. ''A lot of people over here are envious of people over there. And now Sea Island employees, who don't live there, are paying the price.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Commercial Focuses on the Bailout...

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
The Republican National Committee began running this advertisement Monday in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin. It was produced and distributed by the party's ''independent expenditure'' unit, which is prohibited from planning its advertising in coordination with the party's direct leadership or that of the campaign of Senator John McCain. 
 PRODUCER OnMessage Inc. 
 THE SCRIPT A male announcer says: ''Meltdown. Wall Street squanders our money, and Washington is forced to bail them out with -- you guessed it -- our money. Can it get any worse? Under Barack Obama's plan, the government would spend a trillion dollars more, even after the bailout. A trillion dollars. Who pays? You do. New taxes. New spending. New debt. Barack Obama's plan: It will make the problem worse. The Republican National Committee is responsible for the content of this advertisement.''
 ON THE SCREEN A ''Wall Street'' street sign melts and morphs into the facade of the New York Stock Exchange, the image wobbling as if reflected in a fun house mirror before melting away to reveal the words ''Bailout with our money.'' The spot switches to a gauze-filtered image of a man and a woman apparently going over their household finances. It then shows a shadowy image of Senator Barack Obama walking in slow motion before a large crowd as a series of headlines flashes across the screen: ''Obama's Spending Plan: One trillion more after the bailout. You pay''; ''New taxes. New spending. New debt''; ''It'll make the problem worse.''
 ACCURACY This spot's assertion that Mr. Obama will increase spending by $1 trillion ''after the bailout'' is not entirely accurate. Mr. Obama has said the current financial crisis means that he would probably have to reorder his budget priorities and delay some spending. But the initial figure is in dispute and was based upon a McCain campaign formulation that Mr. Obama's spending plans will add roughly $900 billion in new federal spending. The formula ignores Mr. Obama's envisioned cuts and tax policy changes. In fact, the most recent, comprehensive analysis of the candidates' spending and taxation plans, by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan group, found that the costs of Mr. Obama's plans were not necessarily that much higher than those of Mr. McCain's. If Mr. Obama's pre-crisis proposals were fully enacted, the group reported, they would add $286 billion to the annual deficit by the last budget of the next presidential term, that of 2013. If fully enacted, Mr. McCain's pre-crisis proposals would add a maximum of $246 billion to the annual deficit in 2013 and a minimum of $180 billion, according to the group. The spot is somewhat accurate in saying Mr. Obama would impose ''new taxes''; he is proposing an increase for those making more than $250,000 a year, and a tax cut for all those making less than that.
 SCORECARD Voters who see this advertisement during their regular newscasts may be confused by its content: it comes as Mr. McCain is publicly advocating for the very bailout plan that is portrayed so negatively here. It is also running in markets where Mr. Obama is telling viewers, in a two-minute spot, that he intends to lower taxes for most Americans. So, all in all, it remains to be seen just how effective the commercial will be in hurting Mr. Obama, or, for that matter, in helping Mr. McCain. JIM RUTENBERG

HEADLINE: Newspaper in Minneapolis Halts Its Debt Payments

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
The Star Tribune of Minneapolis said on Wednesday that it had stopped making payments on its debts, the latest evidence of the trouble the newspaper industry is having with debt loads it took on in 2006 and 2007. 
 The Star Tribune skipped a $9 million quarterly payment to its senior creditors that was due on Tuesday, said Chris Harte, the publisher and chairman. The paper has been in default since June, when it began missing payments on its smaller junior debt.
 With advice from the Blackstone Group, The Star Tribune has been trying to negotiate new terms with its lenders, a consortium of banks, insurance companies, hedge funds and others. 
 The paper has cut its staff and reduced other operating costs, while trying to obtain wage and work rule concessions from its unions.
 The default means that lenders could force a bankruptcy, but they have been reluctant to take that step with battered newspaper companies as long as there appeared to be a chance of agreeing on new repayment terms.
 ''In this market, trying to liquidate newspaper assets might not produce the same recovery,'' said Mike Simonton, a media analyst and senior director at Fitch Ratings.
 Mr. Harte said, ''Any of the stakeholders that have the capability of forcing us into bankruptcy, it would not benefit them at all, and I believe they see it that way.''
 Avista Capital Partners, a private equity group, bought The Star Tribune last year for $530 million, and the paper still has $432 million in debt from that deal.
 Executives say the paper generates an operating profit, but will not say how much.
 The Star Tribune is one of several newspaper companies that, despite multiple rounds of job cuts, are struggling to meet payments or covenants on debt. 
 Nearly every major newspaper company has been through multiple credit downgrades, and several are below investment grade.
 The companies took on most of that debt in just the last few years to finance a wave of newspaper takeovers at prices that, even at the time, analysts said were unreasonably high -- and that came just before advertising revenue began to plummet.
 The McClatchy Company bought the Knight Ridder chain in 2006 and then sold some former Knight Ridder papers, including The Star Tribune and The Philadelphia Inquirer and Daily News.
 McClatchy still has ample cash flow to pay its debts, but was in danger of not having enough to comply with its bond covenants, a condition that would have meant a technical default. 
 On Friday, McClatchy said it had negotiated new terms with its lenders that would prevent a default, but would carry higher interest rates. Days earlier, the company announced that it would cut its dividend in half.
 In June, Philadelphia Media Holdings, owner of the papers in that city, fell out of compliance with its bond covenants, though it continued to make payments.
 In July, the Journal Register Company, owner of The New Haven Register and a group of smaller papers, entered into a forbearance agreement with lenders, allowing it to skip some payments.
 Several analysts have warned that two of the largest newspaper companies, the Tribune Company, which tripled its debt in going private last year, and the MediaNews Group, which bought a string of papers in recent years, are at high risk of default.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 3, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about the debt problems of The Star Tribune of Minneapolis misstated its ownership history. Before being owned by the McClatchy Company, it was owned by the Cowles Media Company -- not by Knight Ridder.

HEADLINE: Renovation Deal for Bus Station at Bridge

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has worked out a deal for a $152 million renovation of the George Washington Bridge Bus Station that will increase fourfold the amount of retail space in the Upper Manhattan terminal. The authority said on Wednesday that it expected the deal to go ahead despite the economic turmoil on Wall Street and the downturn in the real estate market. 
 The Port Authority has spent two years negotiating with the developer, a joint venture of Acadia Realty Trust and P. A. Associates, to reach a preliminary agreement that is to be voted on by the authority's board on Thursday. 
 ''We're hopeful that within the next year or so, things will calm down a bit and they'll be able to proceed with the financing,'' said Michael B. Francois, the chief of real estate and development for the authority. ''We continue to ask them, 'Are you still good with this because of the economy?' And they're very comfortable.'' 
 Under the terms, the developer will pay the authority $1 million once the deal is approved. The two sides will then have about 18 months to complete plans for the site and a leasing agreement. Plans call for a 49-year lease with a minimum rent over that time of $53 million. 
 The developer has agreed to spend $102 million to renovate the station and increase the retail space to 120,000 square feet, from 30,000 square feet. In addition, the Port Authority has agreed to spend $49.5 million to renovate the station's bus facilities. 
 The station now has about a dozen tenants, Mr. Francois said, including an Off-Track Betting parlor, a credit union and newsstands. Those tenants will have to move out to make way for the renovation. ''We're looking to transform that into more of a Class A retail space, with national anchor tenants that can better serve the needs of the community,'' he said. 
 Kenneth F. Bernstein, the chief executive of Acadia, could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.
 The project will also increase the number of buses that can use the site. The authority's chairman, Anthony R. Coscia, said in a statement that enlarging the capacity of the bus station would help ease congestion on the Hudson River crossings. 
 The station opened in 1963 and received an award that year for its use of concrete in construction, according to the authority's Web site. It was designed by the Italian architect Pier Luigi Nervi. It sits on both sides of Broadway between 178th and 179th Streets, near the entrance to the George Washington Bridge. 
 About 20,000 people a day get on and off buses there, Mr. Francois said. It is a hub for New Jersey Transit and for buses from Rockland and Orange Counties, Atlantic City and the airports. 
 The renovation is different from a larger project planned for the Port Authority Bus Terminal on Eighth Avenue in Midtown. 
 In November, the authority announced plans for a development team that includes Vornado Realty Trust to erect an office tower atop that terminal. But in July, the authority said it was extending by up to a year the time needed to complete negotiations with Vornado. 
 ''All real estate deals are difficult today,'' Mr. Francois said. ''Vornado has not expressed any unwillingness to proceed. Obviously they're as concerned about the financing as anybody else, and since it does include a 1.3 million-square-foot office building, their ability to get financing will be tied to the credit markets. We're a little ways down the road on that.''

HEADLINE: State Discount Mortgage Unit Moves to Increase Interest Rate

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Squeezed by the tightening credit markets, a New York State agency that provides subsidized mortgages to first-time home buyers stopped offering discounted interest rates this week and started looking for new sources of funds.
 Officials at the State of New York Mortgage Agency said on Wednesday that they had decided this week to raise their interest rates because they were struggling to borrow money to finance the purchase of mortgages. The agency postponed the sale of $250 million in bonds this week because of turmoil in the credit markets, said Priscilla Almodovar, the president and chief executive of the mortgage agency. 
 ''We just have had to wait,'' she said. She added that the agency hoped to be able to sell bonds again, before the end of the month. ''We're not desperate,'' she said. 
 The cancellation of the bond sale underscores how the instability in the worldwide credit market is beginning to cause significant problems for state and local governments that depend on bond sales to finance programs. 
 Ms. Almodovar said the agency had enough money to continue its operations and expected to be able to offer discounted rates again. But she said agency officials were anxiously watching Wall Street for signs of a renewed appetite for their bonds soon ''so that we can continue to fund our purchases of mortgages.'' 
 The agency encourages banks to give mortgages to people of low and moderate income by pledging to buy those mortgages after they are issued. It assists only first-time homeowners who are buying in New York. 
 So far this year, it has purchased 2,629 mortgages with a total value of $341 million, an increase of 65 percent from last year. About one-fourth of the mortgages were on homes in New York City and its suburbs.
 With credit drying up, many banks have begun demanding larger down payments and requiring higher credit scores for borrowers, said Shelia S. Martin, director of program operations for the Housing Partnership Development Corporation, which builds subsidized housing in New York City. That trend has increased the need for the state mortgage agency's program, she said.
 ''They were the go-to people, because you could qualify people who had good credit but not enough income'' to receive market-rate mortgages, Ms. Martin said. ''That half a point to a point made a difference,'' she said, explaining that the lower interest rates meant lower monthly costs for people of modest incomes. 
 The state agency traditionally has made home-buying more affordable by subsidizing interest rates that were lower than market rates by half a percentage point or more. Ms. Almodovar said the agency decided this week to switch to offering market rates rather than raise the minimum for down payments or make other changes to its requirements to qualify for the loans. She said the agency's lending standards were already stringent enough. 
 The agency's current fixed rate on a 30-year mortgage is 6.25 percent. By contrast, M&T Bank, a Buffalo-based bank that lends to home buyers statewide, was offering 30-year fixed-rate mortgages at 6.55 percent, said Michael Todaro, M&T's senior vice president for mortgage and consumer lending operations.
 Mr. Todaro said that gap was narrower than it had been, but he added that he did not think it would make the agency's mortgage program significantly less attractive. He said he expected his bank to have about 25 percent more business through the mortgage agency's program this year than last year.
 The bigger concern for Ms. Almodovar was the current lack of a market for the agency's bonds. She said that the agency had not stopped ''taking reservations'' for new mortgages and that its officials were searching for financing alternatives to enable it to continue its work. She declined to say how long the agency could continue buying mortgages without selling bonds or raising money from another source.
 ''We're not offering a rate advantage,'' Ms. Almodovar said, ''but we are still providing access to mortgages.'' 
 Regarding the canceled bond sale, Ms. Almodovar said that even if the bonds could have been sold, the returns that buyers would have demanded would have been prohibitively high. The average rate on the mortgages the agency has made this year is about 5.25 percent, but buyers would have demanded a significantly higher return than that, she said.
 Ms. Martin said banks had been allowing borrowers' monthly mortgage costs to equal half their gross incomes. But she said that in recent months that limit had dropped as low as one-third of monthly income before taxes. The stricter standards and rising rates have discouraged people from buying the apartments and multi-family houses the housing partnership is building in the Bronx and elsewhere in the city, she said.
 ''People are just nervous and not as eager to buy,'' she said. 
 Mr. Todaro said M&T and other banks were still making mortgages to ''well qualified'' first-time buyers, but he said lenders had tightened their standards. The days of buying a home with down payments of 3 percent or less are over, he said.
 ''There is still adequate mortgage credit available,'' Mr. Todaro said. ''We're doing less business today than we were doing a year ago. But it has not fallen off remarkably.''

HEADLINE: In a Fairy-Tale Village, Russian Orphans Thrive

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ

DATELINE: KALUGA REGION, Russia 

 BODY:
Standing in a row, sweating in the bright sun, a group of boys hammered on the outer wall of a partially built log cabin. Nearby, two others painted a picnic table while another pack of children scurried by dressed in green tunics, wooden swords drawn for a play battle. 
 Work and play often commingle in Kitezh, an experimental orphan community about 190 miles southwest of Moscow that combines features of an orphanage with those of foster care. With its colorful wooden cottages, Kitezh appears as distant from the cruelty of the children's frequently alcoholic and abusive parents as it is from the stale, often crowded government institutions where many Russian orphans still live. 
 ''If we can, we try to create the atmosphere of a fairy tale,'' said Mikhail S. Shchurav, who has lived at Kitezh for three years and has an adopted son. ''Fairy tales help these kids forget what they've been through.''
 The founders of Kitezh hope that their village can be a model of reform for Russia's decrepit child welfare system, little changed since Soviet days. Though perhaps hard to replicate on a large scale, Kitezh still stands as one of the few largely successful alternatives here to institutional care for orphans. 
 Russia's orphan problem stretches back for most of the last century: wars, revolution, Stalin's purges, famine and disease all thinned the adult population. Even now, as Russian wealth accumulates, alcoholism and social decay prompted by the Soviet collapse continue to plague the countryside, destroying families.
 Russia's Education Ministry has classified about 750,000 children today as orphans. Most have been abandoned or taken from their parents because of neglect or abuse. Thousands more are homeless, living in the dank, freezing train stations and fetid stairwells of Russia's cities.
 Foster care, widespread in the United States and Europe, has been slow in coming to Russia. About 510,000 children cycled through foster care in the United States in 2006, and it took an average of 28 months for them to be adopted, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. While increasing numbers of orphaned Russian children are entering foster care, 200,000 are still housed in orphanages -- often living there until age 18 -- and thousands more enter the institutions each year. 
 Kitezh was named for a mythical Russian city that escaped decimation by an invading army by disappearing, leaving only the peal of church bells behind. 
 Dmitri Morozov, a former radio talk-show host, founded Kitezh in 1992 as a kind of orphan collective, building it with the help of volunteers and adoptive parents on a rural plot donated by the Kaluga Region government. Today, there are about half a dozen houses built in Russian-folk style, a school, a communal dining hall and a small Orthodox church. 
 The 30 or so children who live there study, work and eat together, and live in private homes with their adoptive parents, who are also trained teachers, psychologists and medical personnel. 
 ''We are trying out the latest methods in psychological therapies: play therapy, art therapy, drama therapy,'' Mr. Shchurav said. ''We even play economic games. No one in Russia has tried what we are doing with these children.'' 
 The experiment has yielded notable results. Of the 40 or so children who have graduated from Kitezh, about 60 percent have gone on to higher education and all have found good jobs, parents in the village said.
 Vasily V. Burdin spent four years in an orphanage after his parents died from complications related to alcohol abuse when he was 4. He said he was treated fairly well there, but gained ''an understanding of the world'' only when he moved to Kitezh. 
 With almost fluent English picked up from British students who at times volunteer in the village, Mr. Burdin, now 18 and enrolled in a Moscow law university, described his struggle to overcome his past, and -- something few Russian orphans have -- his hopes for the future. 
 ''I will proceed with law for my business, for my career,'' he said. ''But after I have stability, I will do something with music -- maybe open my studio. It's a dream.'' 
 Maxim Tarasenko, 7, the village's youngest resident, described his life before Kitezh as ''very bad.'' 
 ''My parents were very drunk, and didn't understand anything,'' he said. ''They didn't understand that you're not allowed to drink only vodka and that you're not allowed to smoke.''
 At first he was antisocial and picked fights, said Tamara B. Pichugina, his adoptive mother. But after a year in Kitezh, he has become something of a social butterfly, fluttering about and chatting with whoever will listen.
 Despite the successes, few have been able or willing to follow Kitezh's example. 
 ''Our experience is not being put to use because it requires that adults receive a significant amount of training,'' said Mr. Morozov, the founder. It also requires a strict allegiance to the collective that can be at odds with Russia's new materialistic and individualistic ethos. 
 But the government has begun to revamp child welfare services, promoting adoption to ease the strain on orphanages. 
 Government funds allotted to adoptive families, including the parents at Kitezh, increased by 28.2 percent in 2007, and about 120,000 orphans left state institutions to join foster families, an increase of 7,000 over 2006, according to the Education Ministry. 
 Still, those removed from orphanages were replaced by some 120,000 new orphans registered by the ministry last year. Adoptive parents also give back thousands of children each year. 
 Most of the adults and children at Kitezh said they hoped their project could be replicated throughout the country. Mr. Morozov collected enough donations this year to begin building a new orphan village about two hours from the original. 
 During a lunch break from his internship in Moscow at the American law firm Baker Botts, a large Kitezh sponsor, Mr. Burdin said he was considering starting a business with Mr. Morozov, his adopted father, to help finance Kitezh's development. 
 ''I think Kitezh is like a fairy tale,'' he said, adding, ''You need to work to hold this beauty.''

HEADLINE: Bank Limits Fund Access By Colleges, Inciting Fears

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON and KATIE ZEZIMA

 BODY:
In a move suggesting how the credit crisis could disrupt American higher education, Wachovia Bank has limited the access of nearly 1,000 colleges to $9.3 billion the bank has held for them in a short-term investment fund, raising worries on some campuses about meeting payrolls and other obligations.
 Wachovia, the North Carolina bank that agreed this week to sell its banking operations to Citigroup, has held the money in its role as trustee for a fund used by colleges and universities and managed by a Connecticut nonprofit, Commonfund. 
 On Monday, Wachovia announced that it would resign its role as trustee of the fund, and would limit access to the fund to 10 percent of each college's account value. On Tuesday, Commonfund said that by selling some government bonds and other assets held in the fund, it had succeeded in raising its liquidity to 26 percent.
 Still, Wachovia's announcement sent shock waves through higher education, sending hundreds of college presidents rushing to check their financial vulnerability on every front.
 Some smaller colleges that had not previously arranged lines of credit were feverishly seeking to negotiate those on Wednesday. And some large institutions said they were facing, at the least, a major financial inconvenience as a result of Wachovia's action.
 The University of Vermont, for instance, said that about half of its liquid operating assets -- $79 million -- were invested in the fund.
 ''It appears that the asset is secure,'' said Richard H. Cate, vice president for finance and administration at the University of Vermont, because, he said, much of the $9.3 billion is held in securities that will become available when they mature. ''But we're not real thrilled with the fact that we can't access all of our money when we want it.''
 Wachovia's action was perhaps the most tangible signal yet that the credit crisis could have a powerful impact on higher education. Another sign came on Tuesday as Boston University, saying it needed to respond to the financial crisis with cautionary steps, announced an immediate hiring freeze and a moratorium on new construction projects. That decision was unrelated to the action by Wachovia, where Boston University was not an investor.
 On Tuesday, officers of Commonfund held a lengthy conference call to provide details of Wachovia's action to representatives of more than 900 colleges and universities, many of whom were upset, said W. Judson Koss, a spokesman for Commonfund. 
 ''The whole issue is liquidity,'' Mr. Koss said. ''This is a fund that has been in operation for over 35 years, and is invested in nothing but Triple-A government and corporate paper, all top-notch equities. 
 ''We've been going along just fine, but Wachovia had a liquidity concern. They asked, 'What if there's a run on the bank and we can't redeem these securities?' So they were the ones who pulled the pin on the grenade.''
 Colleges have used the fund, formally called the Commonfund Short Term Fund, almost like a checking account, depositing revenues including tuition payments and withdrawing funds daily to finance payrolls, maintenance expenses, small construction projects and other short-term needs, college officials said.
 Nearly 60 percent of the securities in the fund are scheduled to mature by Dec. 31, and thereafter would be available to investors, Commonfund said in a statement. When the remaining funds would become available was unclear. The fund said it was seeking a trustee to succeed Wachovia. 
 To date, none of the securities have defaulted, and all were continuing to pay timely principal and interest, the statement said. 
 But for the time being, some institutions that have relied on the fund were scrambling to secure money for operating expenses. 
 Augsburg College in Minneapolis is one of more than a dozen Minnesota colleges with investments in the fund. Augsburg was fortunate, its president, Paul C. Pribbenow, said, because its holdings were just $13,392.
 ''But this certainly raises the specter that we can no longer take anything for granted,'' Dr. Pribbenow said. ''It shows just how vigilant we need to become about every financial relation we have.''
 The University of Akron had $800,000 invested in the fund, a small part of the university's total portfolio of operating funds, which typically range from $100 million to $150 million in a semester, said John Case, the university's chief financial officer. Shortly before Wachovia's announcement, the university withdrew $80,000, but has since been unable to withdraw any of its remaining money, Mr. Case said.
 Matthew Hamill, senior vice president of the National Association of College and University Business Officers, said, ''This is a pretty significant event, in the short run, because it's going to cause dislocation and uncertainty.'' Mr. Hamill added: ''My estimate is that in the long run, investors will wind up with their money back. But they don't have access to cash in the short run, so it's going to cause significant financial and operational changes.''
 Molly Broad, president of the American Council on Education, which represents 1,600 colleges and universities, said: ''A widespread credit crisis will affect a large number of our institutions very quickly. Those folks who've been saying that the economy could be seized by a liquidity crisis, well, it's unfolding before our eyes, and it's having an impact on colleges and nonprofits.''
 At Boston University, President Robert A. Brown sent an e-mail message to faculty and staff members on Tuesday saying that the university would temporarily freeze hiring, with the exception of public safety employees and professors whose hiring process was under way, and that it would postpone all capital projects that had not begun.
 Joseph Mercurio, the university's executive vice president who oversees its budget, called the steps pre-emptive.
 ''We have a lot of economic uncertainties that have to do with the national economy,'' Mr. Mercurio said, ''and in light of those conditions we're going to take some prudent steps right now.''

HEADLINE: Suits Claim Wide Reach Of Cigarettes From Tribes

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE SAUL

 BODY:
He emerged from the No. 2 subway at 125th Street wearing a bright orange shirt and aviator sunglasses, with a small backpack concealing his stock in trade -- tax-free Newport cigarettes.
Like a Yankee Stadium hawker, but in voice closer to a stage whisper, he kept repeating his pitch: ''Newports. Loosies. Shorts. Longs.''
His name is Paco, but on the streets of Harlem he is known simply as a ''$5 man,'' the nickname for a highly visible network of peddlers who sell bootleg cigarettes. His illegal traffic in Newports -- $5 a pack or a single ''loosie'' cigarette for 50 cents -- can bring him $100 or more a day.
Paco will not reveal his last name or the source of his Newports, the menthol brand widely popular in urban communities. But legal authorities say the trail of the $5 men leads to American Indian reservations in New York State, a path they contend is smoothed by the tacit cooperation of some cigarette makers and distributors. 
In New York City, where state and city excise taxes total $4.25 a pack, often pushing the retail price above $9, tax-free cigarettes from the reservations fuel a particularly active underground tobacco economy, law enforcement officials say.
Combined, the city and state are losing more than $1 billion a year in tax revenue as a result of bootleg cigarettes distributed through New York's reservations, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's office said on Monday. The losses to the city alone would pay the annual salaries and benefits for more than 3,000 schoolteachers, the mayor's office said.
With the financial crisis placing pressure on the city's budget, the Bloomberg administration placed blame for most of the lost revenue on the tiny Poospatuck Indian reservation on eastern Long Island. The city filed a civil suit on Monday against eight smoke shops on the reservation. The suit accuses those shops of fostering the illegal trade by ''structuring and concealing bulk sales, assisting in the packing of vans destined for New York City and even making their own bulk deliveries off the reservation.''
Still pending is a separate civil suit the Bloomberg administration filed in 2006 against seven tobacco wholesalers it accuses of violating federal contraband law by supplying untaxed cigarettes to reservations.
Under federal and state law, the state has no right to assess taxes as long as the cigarettes are for the use of Native American inhabitants. But fewer than 20,000 Indians live on reservations in New York. And last year more than 30 million cartons -- six billion cigarettes with a retail value of nearly $2 billion -- were sold on the Indian lands.
According to the State Department of Taxation and Finance, those cigarettes amounted to nearly one-third of all the cigarettes sold in the state of New York, where cigarette excise taxes are the highest in the nation.
The bulk of wholesale shipments to New York reservations last year went to two tribes -- the Poospatucks, on Long Island, and the Senecas of western New York.
The president of the Seneca nation, Maurice A. John Sr., declined to comment through a spokesman. In court papers, the Seneca tribe has argued that sales of untaxed cigarettes to non-Indians for personal consumption are not unlawful.
On Tuesday, Harry Wallace, the chief of the Poospatucks, accused the city of politicizing the issue to benefit convenience store owners, who object to competition from tribal sales. ''You have a whole host of people who are using this as a political tool to gain favor with an electorate to gain political power,'' Mr. Wallace said.
Philip Morris USA, whose Marlboro brand is widely bootlegged, has contended in federal court filings that shipments by one wholesaler to the Poospatuck reservation went to addresses amounting to little more than signs on sheds or trees.
A reporter who recently visited the Poospatuck reservation saw a sign for Wolf Pack Smoke Shop on a storage shed and a sign, Justin's Smokes, on a tree outside a residential trailer. An occupant of the trailer ordered the reporter off the property, telling her it was not a cigarette shop. ''That's just a sign on a tree,'' the woman yelled.
Law enforcement authorities say New York Indians also operate five of the Internet's top 10 Web sites that sell cheap cigarettes. And they say reservations are the primary sources of cigarettes for smuggling rings that place counterfeit tax stamps on cigarettes and sell them in retail stores as if taxes had been paid.
Many states have entered agreements with Indian tribes that either establish quota systems for cigarette shipments or provide for collecting taxes on off-reservation sales. But ever since a 1997 Seneca protest briefly shut down the New York Thruway, it has been state policy not to curb Indian cigarette sales in New York. Since that policy, known as forbearance, went into effect, wholesale shipments of cigarettes to New York reservations have soared.
The New York State Legislature recently passed a bill that would resume enforcement of cigarette taxes on the reservations. The bill is awaiting the signature or veto of Gov. David A. Paterson, who has not indicated which way he is leaning and has said he wants to negotiate with the tribes.
Antismoking advocates say the issue goes beyond lost tax revenue. Dr. Donna Shelley, a New York University professor in public health who has studied the $5 men, says the bootlegging of cheap cigarettes to low-income neighborhoods -- where rates of smoking and smoking-related diseases have been high historically -- ''undermines the smokers' ability to quit and their motivation to quit.''
Most cigarette makers, which ship to wholesalers and not directly to the tribes, generally disavow any responsibility for the bootleg trade. But experts say that New York's Indian tobacco trade is a boon to cigarette companies and that they have little incentive to limit supply to tribes.
''There's no question that keeping the Indians selling these enormous quantities of cigarettes benefits the manufacturer,'' said Steve Rosenthal, a former New York cigarette distributor and now an industry consultant.
A Congressional report in April characterized New York as a safe haven for cigarette smuggling. The report partly blamed the manufacturers and wholesalers that supply tribes, saying that ''smuggling actually increases market share and boosts the industry's bottom line.''
Lorillard Tobacco Company, maker of Newports, derives more than 5 percent of its national volume from cigarettes that end up on New York Indian reservations, according to figures released by the state. Records show that the reservations received more than 10 million cartons of Lorillard cigarettes -- mainly Newports -- last year, more than from any other manufacturer.
Tobacco companies say that as long as New York state officials are not generally enforcing the law, the companies risk lawsuits if they cut off wholesalers without evidence of wrongdoing. Tobacco companies have cited a 2006 court case in Erie County in which wholesalers got a restraining order blocking enforcement of the law on Indian reservations.
''Cigarette manufacturers should not be expected to police the trade in untaxed cigarettes -- that is the responsibility of the state and law enforcement,'' a Lorillard spokesman, Michael Robinson, said in a statement.
Steve Kottak, a spokesman for Reynolds American, said the company complied with all New York laws. More than 4.2 million cartons of the company's brands, including Camel and Kool, were shipped to New York reservations last year, according to the State Department of Taxation and Finance.
It was pressure from legitimate retailers that prompted Philip Morris to try curbing supplies to New York's Indian reservations, which received 7.2 million cartons of Philip Morris cigarettes last year, according to the Department of Taxation and Finance. The company has recently cut off supplies to two distributors that were the primary sources of shipments to the Poospatuck reservation, where more than 10 million cartons of various brands were sold last year.
The 52-acre Poospatuck reservation, near Mastic, N.Y., is the Indian cigarette outlet that is closest to New York City. Until a few years ago, the reservation was a quiet area of small houses and trailers occupied by 279 descendants of the Poospatuck tribe. The group has not received official recognition from the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs but is recognized by the state as a tribe.
In 1996, only 406,000 cartons of cigarettes were delivered to the Poospatucks. By last year, that figure had grown to 11.3 million cartons, according to the state tax department, and the reservation, which is open to the public, has turned into a busy retail center of about a dozen smoke shops, located on a narrow and often congested street, where a member of the tribe directs traffic and parking.
The traffic and congestion have increased since June, when the State of New York raised cigarette taxes by $12.50 a carton. Some of the smoke shops are in one-room trailers with a single sales clerk working behind a Formica counter. Others are much larger operations in newly constructed frame buildings that have floor-to-ceiling shelves of cigarettes and also offer groceries, deli sandwiches and replica Indian artifacts.
In recent years cigarette sales originating from the Poospatuck reservation have been the focus of several law enforcement actions. The most notorious case involved charges against Rodney Morrison, the owner of the Peace Pipe Smoke Shop on the Poospatuck reservation. Philip Morris last year said it would discontinue business with Mr. Morrison after he was federally indicted, and it subsequently cut off a wholesaler who continued shipments to Mr. Morrison. A federal jury in May acquitted Mr. Morrison of the most serious charge -- that he ordered the slaying of a onetime protege who had opened a rival shop on the reservation. But the jury found that Mr. Morrison sold millions of contraband cigarettes without the required state tax stamps, which could carry a prison term of up to 20 years.
Mr. Morrison, who married into the Poospatuck tribe, is appealing the conviction. The Congressional report said that Mr. Morrison's wealth, built from cigarette profits, had become so vast that he offered $54 million in assets to secure his bond.
A reporter who visited Mr. Morrison's shop was referred to a lawyer, Peter Smith, who declined to comment. Pointing to the city lawsuit, Mr. Wallace, the Poospatuck chief, said on Tuesday that the entire tribe was being penalized as a result of Mr. Morrison's actions.
Early this month, Philip Morris cut supply of its products to another Long Island wholesaler, Mauro Pennisi Inc., of Lindenhurst, N.Y., which supplies smoke shops on the Poospatuck reservation. Mauro Pennisi is also one of the seven wholesalers that New York City has named in its civil case.
In federal court documents, Philip Morris contended that some of Mauro Pennisi's Poospatuck shipments did not go to actual smoke shops.
But Sal Pennisi, an owner of the wholesaler, said the Poospatuck tribal council had given his company a list of addresses that the tribe had certified as smoke shops authorized to receive shipments. ''In a sovereign nation, who's to say what's a store?'' Mr. Pennisi said. ''Some people just sell out of their trailers.''

HEADLINE: Thinking Like a Student

BYLINE: By JOYCE WADLER

 BODY:
CONSIDER, in these economically difficult times, that inspiring model of creative home design, the college student.
 No, we are not kidding.
 Yes, we understand that you already know how to throw all your clothes in a pile on the floor. 
 But there is still much that can be learned from students who've managed to put together great looking places on what a grown-up might pay for a one-way ticket to Paris.
 First and foremost is fearlessness. You'd be embarrassed if your friends knew you'd gotten a piece of furniture off the street. College kids call up their friends to get their help carrying furniture home from the street, and brag about it. Many are genuinely concerned about recycling and the environment, and delighted when they can turn construction cast-offs into the trappings of home. 
 Where others see garbage, students see potential: a wooden futon frame, less the futon, becomes a towel rack. An old-fashioned school desk and bench that might well have come out of a one-room schoolhouse upstate? Use it as a bedside table. 
 Nor do they have a fear of strong color or pattern: They'll paint a dorm room a dark green, or stencil blue and white polka dots on the wall beside a 19th-century fireplace. They'll find somebody's tired old bedside stand that faintly recalls Versailles, paint it a pale robin's-egg blue, shellac it, top it with a bare branch in a found glass vase, and put it in the living room, where it will look smart and playful. 
 Sure, you can argue, it's easy for them to paint a bedroom green; they don't own the place. 
 But that's not giving their creativity its due. Their thinking can be so far outside the box that the box is forgotten. Kayt Brumder, a fifth-year architecture student at the Cooper Union, was strolling along New York's Bowery four years ago with her boyfriend, Jorge Pereira, then an architecture student at Columbia and now an architect, when they saw a stack of dresser drawers on the sidewalk. It was not a perfect find; the dresser itself was missing. But that made it kind of interesting. The couple threw the drawers into a taxi, took them up to their apartment in East Harlem and turned them into wall-mounted storage.
 Craigslist is a basic resource for students, as are the low-cost, big box stores. But these sources are often merely starting points. Tyler Velten, a student at the Yale School of Architecture, transformed his $35 Billy bookcases from Ikea into artful cabinets with the addition of plywood doors he made and a few $3 hinges. 
 You don't have a woodworking studio? Do as Mr. Velten did: Set up the equipment on the street and plug it into a 50-foot extension cord tossed out the window. And when you find a knot in the plywood, don't panic; make it part of the design.

HEADLINE: After Two Days of Whiplash, a Small Decline for Stocks

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM; Matthew Saltmarsh contributed reporting from Paris.

 BODY:
Tension mounted in the money markets on Wednesday as the Senate prepared to vote on the government's bailout plan.
Many companies and banks had trouble borrowing money. Where credit was available, it was typically only on an overnight basis, rather than for weeks or months. Stocks fell moderately.
On Wall Street, the credit markets remained at the fore. Since Sept. 15, more than 80 percent of new commercial paper -- short-term i.o.u.'s that corporations and banks use to finance day-to-day operations -- has carried terms of four days or fewer, underscoring lenders' anxiety. Yields on Treasury bills fell again on Wednesday, as investors swallowed tiny returns for the safety of government notes. Measures of anxiety stayed elevated. 
''Money is available, but it's only available to people with good credit and it is being rationed,'' said Thomas H. Atteberry, a partner at First Pacific Advisors. ''The guy with weak credit has lost it. The guy with good credit is paying more.''
Concern is growing that even if Congress acts, it will take weeks to break the logjam in the credit markets. Even so, borrowing rates fell from their highs on Monday, and shares of financial firms rose sharply, extending their gains from Tuesday's strong session. Investors appeared to be betting that a successful vote on the bailout package would shore up confidence in banks.
National City, the troubled regional bank, jumped more than 60 percent on speculation that it could be acquired, leading the gains in the financial sector. Other regional banks, including KeyCorp and Fifth Third Bancorp, rose about 15 percent.
The Dow Jones industrials, which fell nearly 200 points after the opening bell, gained back most of that in the afternoon and ended down 20 points at 10,831.07. A broader measure of the market, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, lost 0.5 percent. The Nasdaq composite index fell 1.1 percent.
After two days of wild swings -- including the worst single-day loss in two decades -- anxiety still lingered among investors who are worried about credit problems and the fate of the bailout package.
Shares of General Electric lost a dollar to close at $24.50, down nearly 4 percent, even after the investor Warren E. Buffett said he would take a $3 billion stake in the company.
The Dow fell more than 100 points earlier in the day after a report showed serious problems facing American manufacturers. The manufacturing index of the Institute for Supply Management, a private group, unexpectedly plunged in September to 43.5 from 49.9 in August, on a scale where readings below 50 indicate a contraction of activity. It was the lowest reading since 2001, and economists had expected the index to only fall slightly.
Foreign orders for manufacturing goods dropped sharply, as well, a troubling sign for an industry that has been increasingly dependent on exports to make up for slackening domestic demand. ''There is no silver lining to this cloud,'' Joshua Shapiro, chief domestic economist at the research firm MFR, wrote in a note.
Oil prices fell $2.11 to $98.53 a barrel, after falling as low as $96 overnight. A government report showed an increase in gasoline supplies and a larger-than-expected jump in oil stockpiles.
Stock markets in Asia rose early Wednesday morning in anticipation of Senate passage of the legislation, only to fall soon after the Senate had finished voting in what market analysts described as a classic case of investors buying on the expectation of good news and then selling on confirmation of the news.
Many investors in Asia are uncertain about whether the final details of the legislation will be enough to help American financial institutions with their heavy losses or to prevent the United States economy from slowing significantly, said Thomas Lam, the senior treasury economist at the United Overseas Bank in Singapore. ''The situation in the U.S. is still pretty hairy,'' he said.
By mid-morning on Wednesday, the Hang Seng Index was down 2 percent in Hong Kong, the Nikkei 225 had fallen 1.1 percent in Tokyo, the Kospi Index had dropped 0.7 percent in Seoul and the Standard and Poor's/Australian Stock Exchange 200 Index had dipped 0.5 percent.
Following are the results of Wednesday's auction of 42-day cash management bills:

HEADLINE: Editors' Note: More Fun Than Root Canals? It's the Dental Vacation

 BODY:
The Skin Deep column on Feb. 7 reported that the number of Americans traveling abroad for medical care in 2006 had increased to 500,000 from 150,000 in 2004, and that of those half a million, 200,000 were seeking dental care. The 2006 figures were attributed to the National Coalition of Health Care, an alliance of more than 70 organizations. 
 A reader challenged the statistics in an e-mail message on Aug. 26, saying that the health care alliance told him it had not studied the issue and had no such information. The reporter, who received the statistics secondhand, said she had left a message for officials at the alliance asking for confirmation, but that her call was not returned.
 The article did report many actual cases of medical tourism for dental care, but it should never have tried to support an assertion that medical tourism had become increasingly popular over the last two decades with unverified numbers from what turned out to be a nonexistent study.

HEADLINE: Small Businesses Feeling the Chill

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Some small companies say they are no longer able to get loans from newly cautious banks as credit tightens across the country, and even those who do qualify are increasingly reluctant to borrow and expand, fearful of overextending themselves in the midst of the financial crisis.
 Alan Petrucci, whose small factory near Chicago makes metal molds that other manufacturers buy to form plastic parts, says his bank recently offered him an additional loan. Though orders for his molds are still plentiful, Mr. Petrucci says he will borrow only to upgrade existing machinery, not to expand.
 ''We are bracing for the downturn that is coming,'' Mr. Petrucci said. ''It is coming; there is no question about that.''
 Mark Snyder, another businessman, is more optimistic, but his bank refused two weeks ago to grant another loan to his fledgling medical supply company near Denver. So he turned to a commercial lender, which has offered credit -- at 30 percent a year. Mr. Snyder does not want to borrow much at that rate. ''We desperately need more capital to grow our sales,'' he said. 
 Small businesses in America -- the 27 million companies employing fewer than 500 people and in most cases fewer than 20 people -- account for half of the nation's output. A downward swing, whether caused by expensive borrowing or pessimism, could weaken the economy and shrink employment. Small businesses employ 40 percent of the work force, the Census Bureau reports, and they outpace large companies in generating new jobs. 
 ''Small businesses are sitting on their hands,'' said Chad Moutray, chief economist of the Small Business Administration. ''Either they can't get the capital or they don't want the capital. They read what is happening, and frankly they are scared.''
 Even with the current turmoil in the credit markets, big established businesses generally have far greater access to credit than their smaller cousins. For borrowing, small businesses often rely on banks, credit cards and small-business loans. Big businesses have substantial bank lines of credit that they can draw down as needed if they have trouble issuing new debt, usually a less expensive option. While the markets remain cool to financial companies and those with any hint of debt problems, many corporations have been able to sustain their financing, often by selling commercial paper, a form of short-term financing, albeit at higher rates than a month ago.
 At Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway, a giant freight line with 40,000 employees and $20 billion in annual revenue, the biggest concern is the rising cost of all its credit, said Thomas N. Hund, the chief financial officer. ''We will continue to borrow to fund maintenance,'' Mr. Hund said, ''and if we saw growth in the economy next year, we would have an appetite for a greater expansion plan. But we don't see growth, and we are going to be extremely cautious in our investments.'' 
 That sense of bracing for harder times is evident in little ways, at companies large and small. George Wendt, the owner of Chicago Metal Rolled Products, which forms steel into supports for stadium roofs, school gymnasiums, large canopies and the like, has reduced the steel he keeps in inventory over the last month, buying only what is immediately used. 
 That decision, multiplied across many companies, means suppliers will make less and stockpiles will shrink. There will be less production to drive the economy. 
 Chicago Metal is saving money, and so far its customers, mainly commercial construction companies, continue to buy the curved steel supports. ''When you just watch the news, everything sounds pretty gloomy,'' said Mr. Wendt, who employs 85 people at a plant in Southwest Chicago. ''But so far our market is still relatively strong.''
 Mr. Petrucci, who owns B A Die Mold in Aurora, Ill., employing 17 people to make his metal molds, also says the financial crisis has not touched him. What is more, the banks, having shed what they consider risky borrowers, are actively selling loans to those they consider creditworthy, and that includes Mr. Petrucci's company. With $2 million in annual revenue, almost no debt and enough orders to keep busy through January, Mr. Petrucci's lenders are coming to him, he says.
 The rate they offer has risen to 7 percent, a percentage point more than in mid-September, but the lenders are persuasive. Mr. Petrucci says he will soon borrow $200,000 to replace an aging computer-controlled lathe and to acquire the latest in electrical cutting gear.
 ''We are not going to increase capacity; we are buying this equipment only because we want to do things better,'' he said. ''We are gambling that this financial disaster is going to have a controlled solution, and hopefully it won't impact us too greatly.''
 Die Mold's trial by fire came in the 2001 recession. Half of Mr. Petrucci's roughly 140 competitors in the Chicago area went under, and Die Mold's staff shrank to 17, the present number, from 28. Orders picked up by middecade, but Mr. Petrucci, a mechanical engineer who founded Die Mold in 1968, says he resisted the temptation to expand his operation to its former size and risk going under in the next downturn.
 ''It would have to be very severe to hurt us now,'' he said, adding, for example, that his automated grinding machines operate unattended at night, and if orders were to shrink substantially, he would turn off the machines overnight as a first step. 
 Superior Medical Supply, which Mr. Snyder, who is 30, and two relatives founded in 2004, buys all sorts of medical equipment and supplies from manufacturers, and resells them to nursing and ambulatory care facilities, private doctors and surgical centers. The customers normally pay within 60 days, Mr. Snyder said, but he must pay his suppliers in 30, which means he needs credit to bridge the gap -- and more so than ever as sales rise toward the $6 million mark.
 Early on, a community bank gave Superior a $100,000 line of credit. Last year it raised that to $175,000. But when Mr. Snyder sought another increase late last month, he was turned down. 
 ''We are being told that the company does not appear strong enough to take on additional financing,'' Mr. Snyder said. To qualify for more credit, he said, Superior would have to increase the $500,000 the partners now have invested in their company. 
 So they turned to the Liquid Capital Corporation, which lends against ''receivables.'' That means Superior gives Liquid Capital the right to collect the money owed by Superior's customers, and Superior, in return, gets a line of credit. Mr. Snyder would like to draw down $240,000 to keep his company's expansion on track, and Liquid Capital says it is ready to lend that amount. 
 But Mr. Snyder is reluctant to borrow so much, at 30 percent annual interest, so he will draw down only $150,000. ''We don't want to expand at a rate that causes instability for our company, and borrowing $240,000 at 30 percent would do that,'' he said.
 The growing reluctance by conventional banks to lend is reflected in Liquid Capital's loan activity, which has increased 40 percent since August, to $200 million, the company says. The National Federation of Independent Business, in its monthly survey of 600 members, found in August that 10 percent were having more difficulty getting bank loans than three months earlier. That was the highest level since the 1990-91 recession. 
 ''In late summer, conditions did get tougher,'' said William Dennis Jr., the federation's director of research. ''Our members are nervous about going to their banks.'' 
 Some are also nervous about their sales. Michael Frome, 40, a partner in Fromeco Scale Avionics, says they are way off. He and a partner lease space in a hangar in Sandy, Ore., where they and three employees build parts for remote-controlled model airplanes -- not the balsa wood variety, but steel planes with wing spans up to 10 feet. Hobbyists buy them for $5,000 to $10,000 and often race them.
 A month ago, Mr. Frome realized that the hobbyists, most of them men over 50 with six-figure incomes, had all but stopped buying the planes and replacement parts -- including a new electronic device, developed by Fromeco, that logs flight data. Sales plummeted from a $1 million annual rate to half that level, and they are still falling. 
 Mr. Frome attributes the sudden drop-off to the sophistication of the hobbyists, whom he describes as conversant with Wall Street, investors themselves and shocked more than most by the current debacle. 
 ''I think my customers are quickly reducing their discretionary spending to near zero and squirreling away money,'' Mr. Frome said. ''Fear and uncertainty grip them.''

HEADLINE: Rabbi Has Message. So Does Cellphone.

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON; Reporting was contributed by Michael Barbaro, C. J. Hughes, Colin Moynihan and Karen Zraick.

 BODY:
Standing on the sidewalk outside the Park Avenue Synagogue after attending a service on Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, Joel Beeler said, ''I feel troubled.''
 Mr. Beeler is a real estate investor who has been trying to line up financing for a shopping center project. He said that an hour on the phone with a banker before the service had been fruitless. But he said he was not just thinking about the deal.
 ''I'm praying for the whole world and the country,'' he said as he headed to his office. 
 Escaping the worries of a chaotic world is often difficult in New York -- a single ringing iPhone can spoil the quietest moments of a concert at Lincoln Center; a vibrating BlackBerry can deliver a message upsetting enough to make someone climb over a row of people and leave a Broadway show to go back to the office. 
 But this week, perhaps more than most, it was hard to check one's worries at the door, hard to concentrate on what it means to mark a religious holiday during a financial crisis. 
 Some worshipers arrived at Rosh Hashana services carrying The Wall Street Journal and The Financial Times. Others slipped out from time to time to check their voice mail and e-mail messages. 
 ''I would never do this inside synagogue, but I needed to put my mind to rest,'' said Gary Herman, a hedge fund manager who stepped out of the Tuesday morning service at Temple Emanu-El on Fifth Avenue at 65th Street and switched on his BlackBerry to see how the market was doing.
 Mr. Herman said it was trying to sit through a three-hour service on a nerve-wracking day for the markets. ''Every time a person asks you, 'How are you?' what they are really eliciting are your thoughts about the market,'' he said. 
 Some said they heard a low hum from cellphones, carefully set for vibrate mode, buzzing like bees swarming around a far-off rhododendron. Robert N. Levine, the senior rabbi at Congregation Rodeph Sholom, at 7 West 83rd Street, said he had begun his Tuesday sermon by saying that he was well aware that people attending the service were in ''BlackBerry withdrawal.'' 
 He said in an interview later that he was concerned about the economy, in part because a deepening downturn could affect the congregation's social service work, in part because some members of the congregation had already lost jobs. ''I think people are feeling both fragile and humble this year,'' he said, ''but every crisis is also an opportunity to assess your blessings.''
 Rabbi Levine said that he had not seen people checking their hand-held phones during the services. But at the Park Avenue Synagogue, on Madison Avenue and 87th Street, cellphone signals apparently caused problems for the public-address system on Tuesday. The speakers crackled, a security guard at the synagogue said. 
 So on Wednesday, the guards at the entrance told people to turn their cellphones off as they entered the sanctuary. That forced those who could not let calls and messages go unanswered -- or, at least, unmonitored -- to go outside.
 One investment banker who did so yelled into his phone during a 15-minute call. ''I felt that I shouldn't have come here today, but I needed to,'' he said, refusing to give his name because his firm does not permit employees to talk to reporters. 
 The senior rabbi, Elliot J. Cosgrove, had mentioned economic worries on Tuesday, the day after the House of Representatives voted down the $700 billion bailout plan and the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 777 points. Rabbi Cosgrove had counseled the congregation not to be upset by the financial problems of the last few weeks.
 ''Let go of your white-knuckled grip on reality, and let a new reality present itself,'' he told the congregation.
 For some, that was easier said than done. One man in a gray suit spoke on his cellphone for nearly an hour before going into Central Synagogue, on Lexington Avenue at 55th Street, on Tuesday. When he emerged after the service, he was again on the phone.
 Outside the Park Avenue Synagogue, a man with a BlackBerry in his hand complained about ''a dysfunctional government and a dysfunctional Congress.''
 ''They don't get it,'' he said. He refused to give his name, saying he considered it inappropriate to talk business so close to his place of worship.
 Joe Zicherman, who left Morgan Stanley in the late 1990s and now works as a private money manager and consultant, prayed at Congregation Rodeph Sholom.
 ''I felt it was more important to be here than it was to be at the office,'' he said, ''especially because being in the office doesn't seem to be doing anyone any good these days.'' He said that at the office, he tried to manage risk, but ''the only thing you can manage is your blood pressure.'' 
 Rob Blum, who sells medical equipment and lives on the Upper East Side, said that one message of the service he attended at Central Synagogue on Tuesday was, ''Realize that you are blessed with the life you have.''
 He said that the New Year is generally thought of as a happy time, but that this year, so much seemed overshadowed by uncertainty. ''My wife works on Wall Street,'' he said. ''Who knows what will happen with her job?''
 Joshua Levin, a manager at an athletic fitness company, said as he left Central Synagogue on Wednesday that just being inside had been an escape. ''Outside,'' he said, ''we're bombarded with all sorts of troubling news.''

HEADLINE: Save The Fat Cats

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
Gail Collins is off today.

 BODY:
In the early 1990s, when I was a foreign correspondent looking for my next overseas posting with The Times, I sought Japan. At the time, Tokyo was an awe-inspiring economic titan, arguably the most important capital outside the United States.
 Then Japanese politicians, acting with the same sublime ineptitude that our own House of Representatives displayed this week, ignored a growing banking crisis and dithered on a bailout. And so I watched from Tokyo as a mighty economy melted like an iceberg in the Caribbean. 
 Japan's failure to respond urgently and decisively to its banking mess caused the country to endure a ''lost decade'' of economic stagnation. If America wants to avoid Japan's decline, the House should follow the Senate's lead and approve the bailout -- immediately.
 Just as in the U.S. today, most Japanese did not initially appreciate how devastating a banking crisis could be to the real economy. Banks and real estate tycoons in Japan were corrupt, profligate and unsympathetic figures, and no one wanted to help them. On corporate expense accounts, they sipped coffee with gold leaf and patronized ''no-panties shabu-shabu'' restaurants, which had mirrored floors and miniskirted waitresses.
 In short, the businessmen involved were jerks. And, whether in Japan or the U.S., it's challenging for politicians to frame a bailout with the slogan: Save the jerks!
 Japanese politicians didn't want to rescue such unpopular fat cats and didn't see any emergency. So Japan's economy slowly lost air, and the biggest losers were the small futon makers who couldn't get credit and the farmers on remote islands who lost ferry service when the government eventually had to cut back on spending.
 For those of you accustomed to bull markets, who think we're sure to come out of this quickly, remember this: Japan's main stock index is still less than one-third of its level of 19 years ago. 
 In 1993, after Japanese stocks had already tumbled for several years, an American friend told me that he was going to invest in Japanese stocks. ''I don't know what they're going to do for the next couple of years,'' he said, ''but we all know that over five years they'll recover and do better than American stocks.'' Since then, Japanese stocks have lost another 40 percent of their value.
 The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, is an expert on Japan's lost decade, and the president of the New York Fed, Timothy Geithner, lived in Tokyo during that debacle, and their experience no doubt is one reason for the urgency of Washington's response. The lesson from Japan is pretty clear: Hold your nose and support a bailout, in particular to clean up banking assets.
 All this said, critics of the bailout have reason to be furious. It is profoundly unfair that working-class American families lose their homes, their jobs, their savings, while plutocrats who caused the problem get rescued.
 If the Congressional critics of the bailout want to do some lasting good, they should come back in January -- after approving the bailout now -- with a series of tough measures to improve governance and inject more fairness in the economy. 
 A starting point would be to remove tax subsidies on executive pay and allow courts to restructure mortgages as they do other kinds of debt. The Institute for Policy Studies in Washington estimates that U.S. taxpayers every year provide more than $20 billion in tax subsidies for executive pay.
 Among the strongest critics of inflated executive pay have been Warren Buffett and the late management guru, Peter Drucker, who argued that C.E.O. salaries should peak at no more than 20 or 25 times those of the average worker. (Last year, C.E.O.'s got an average of 344 times the wages of the typical worker.)
 The truth is that with the complicity of boards of directors, C.E.O.'s hijack shareholder wealth in ways that are unconscionable. As The Wall Street Journal reported in June, if Eugene Isenberg, the 78-year-old C.E.O. of Nabors Industries, were to drop dead one of these days, his estate would be entitled to a ''severance payment'' of at least $263 million -- more than the firm's first-quarter net earnings.
 With such greed oozing out of the corporate suite, and with financial companies enjoying the confidence of only 10 percent of Americans today (down from 36 percent in 2000), it's no wonder that voters are repulsed by the idea of helping banks. Wall Street urgently needs to undertake its own housecleaning, for the public revulsion toward it undermines its own long-term interests.
 But, for now, the priority is to get credit flowing again in the arteries of commerce, even if that means saving the jerks. Otherwise, we risk becoming Japan.

HEADLINE: Show Us the Hope

 BODY:
Falling house prices are driving the collapse of the financial system. But the bailout bill, even the ''sweetened'' version that was approved by the Senate Wednesday night, does little to avert the defaults and foreclosures that are pushing house values ever downward. 
 At last count, six million people were expected to default on their mortgages this year and next, putting them at risk of losing their homes unless they can catch up in their payments or catch a break on their loan terms. And they're not the only ones at risk. As prices drop, millions of people who have never missed a mortgage payment stand to lose their home equity.
 Leaving these Americans out of the bailout bill is unwise and unfair, but neither Congress nor the Bush administration has ever shown anywhere near the sense of urgency to rescue homeowners at the bottom of the collapse as they have for the financiers at the top of it. 
 Take, for example, a new government program that took effect on Wednesday with the aim of helping as many as 400,000 struggling homeowners keep their homes. Even before it got started, the program -- called Hope for Homeowners -- was looking like a lead balloon. 
 Under the program, the government will insure up to $300 billion in new, more affordable loans for troubled borrowers. For the insurance to kick in, however, lenders must first voluntarily refinance the delinquent mortgages by reducing the loan balances to 90 percent of the home's current market value. 
 In exchange, lenders would avoid the expense of foreclosure and uncertainty about being repaid. The government would stem the social and economic damage of more foreclosures, at presumably little risk to taxpayers.
 There's just one problem. At a Congressional hearing in September, lenders were lukewarm about participating in the new program -- reluctant, it seems, to take the loss that comes with reducing loan balances.
 The lenders, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and CitiMortgage, a unit of Citigroup, all said they were taking other steps to help troubled borrowers, like reducing a loan's interest rate or extending its term. That's helpful, but the industry's efforts don't go far enough: defaults and foreclosures continue to outstrip efforts to rework bad loans. 
 As home prices fall, the most effective modification is to reduce the loan balance; otherwise, borrowers are in the position of repaying a loan higher than the value of the property. That burden can become unbearable when combined with unemployment or reduced work hours or unexpected expenses like medical bills.
 There are two sides to the mortgage mess. The mortgage industry, in pursuit of upfront fees, deliberately made loans to people who could not afford the payments over time. They justified their actions on the self-serving and unsound basis that rising home values would forever postpone a day of reckoning. 
 Many borrowers -- naively, foolishly or selfishly -- took on those loans. Yet well over a year into the housing bust, the mortgage industry still calls the shots, as if it is a victim of the borrowers.
 Congress could change that dynamic, by amending the bankruptcy code to allow the court to modify troubled mortgages. But lawmakers still are afraid to hold the industry accountable. Instead, they are offering Hope for Homeowners that looks to be anything but.

HEADLINE: In Paris, Frayed Nerves

BYLINE: By ERIC WILSON

DATELINE: Paris 

 BODY:
 IF it seems bizarre to be reading about the fashion shows taking place in Paris this week while the United States economy is in a crisis, just imagine how surreal it is for the retailers and editors who are spending thousands of dollars apiece to sit around looking at new collections while the old ones are sitting around on a sales floor unsold. 
 One executive from a major retailer said privately that ever since the spring shows began in New York in September, sales have been at a near standstill. Another buyer, from a specialty store, said the situation was ''tentative, at best.'' To say that the audience has been spooked by the potential of a deep recession is an understatement when three editors from Vogue were glued to their BlackBerrys at the Yohji Yamamoto show as the Dow plunged 777 points.
 ''Of course we're concerned,'' said Pete Nordstrom, the president of Nordstrom, as he left the Jean Paul Gaultier show on Tuesday. ''It's interesting being here and seeing it play out through the European media. It's kind of a helpless feeling.'' 
 And yet, the shows go on, each a production costing the designers hundreds of thousands of dollars, because for designers, they have to. Bulgari opened a store Tuesday on the Avenue George V. Sonia Rykiel was planning an elaborate dinner show on the outskirts of Paris Wednesday night, and Pierre Cardin has offered to fly editors to the Palais Bulles in Nice on a private jet to see his newest designs.
 Nevertheless, the world's top designers have chosen a very bad moment to emphatically get behind see-through clothes, a terribly sexy trend that stores have acknowledged would be a hard sell even in flush times. Just who is going to be buying a five-figure transparent dress when the inescapable feeling is that the party's over?
 If there's one bright spot, Stephanie Solomon, the fashion director of Bloomingdale's, said that some stores are placing orders with new, smaller designers to differentiate themselves. ''I believe that will be compelling and will bring customers into Bloomingdale's to see what's new,'' she said. ''We're on a discovery tour.''
 Still, the prevailing mood was caution. 
 ''Risk-taking can have its rewards right now,'' Mr. Nordstrom said. ''But it's risky.''

HEADLINE: Monitors in Georgia Enter South Ossetia Buffer Zone

BYLINE: By ELLEN BARRY

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
European civilian monitors entered the Georgian buffer zone outside the separatist enclave of South Ossetia on Wednesday, despite a warning from a Russian military official a day earlier that the monitors would not be allowed access to the buffer zone. 
 At the same time, Russia's president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, said that Russia would fulfill its commitment to withdraw its troops to the boundaries of South Ossetia and the other breakaway enclave, Abkhazia, by Oct. 10. 
 ''We will do everything on time,'' he said at a news conference in St. Petersburg, Russia, where he traveled for talks with Spain's prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero.
 Mr. Medvedev also said that there was no ideological basis for hostility between Russia and the West, and that he hoped to resume cooperative partnerships with NATO that were suspended in the aftermath of the war in Georgia. ''Today, we don't have the kinds of ideological differences which could spark off a cold war or, for that matter, any other war,'' he said, noting that whoever won the United States presidential elections in November would probably have to focus on the financial crisis.
 ''It requires a lot of attention,'' he said. ''It's much simpler to analyze international questions than to make the necessary economic decisions on time.'' 
 Of NATO, he said that ''the cooperation is no less important for them than for us.''
 ''Ultimately,'' he said, ''everything will be restored in full.'' 
 Russian frustration with NATO's expansion into Eastern Europe, which includes discussing possible membership for Georgia and Ukraine, has contributed to soured relations with the West. 
 In an interview published Thursday in the newspaper Izvestia, Nikolai Patrushev, the chairman of Russia's Security Council, said he believed that NATO might deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Georgia and Ukraine if they were admitted to the alliance. From those positions, strikes could be aimed at targets in ''the European part of Russia, including elements of government and military control.''
 ''That kind of American action could lead to the strengthening of mutual distrust and a buildup of an arms race, which we, I would note, do not seek,'' Mr. Patrushev said, according to text on the newspaper's Web site. ''We are interested in sustaining normal neighborly relationships.''
 The patrols in Georgia were a provision of the cease-fire agreement brokered by the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, and agreed to by Russia on Sept. 8. By midafternoon Wednesday, 14 patrols had been deployed, including some that crossed into the buffer zone near South Ossetia at three Russian checkpoints, according to Hansjorg Haber, the European Union's mission director in Georgia. A patrol also made contact with Russian troops at a checkpoint on the boundary of Abkhazia, but did not cross in, he said. 
 Fighting broke out between Georgia and Russia in early August, after Georgia's president, Mikheil Saakashvili, ordered an attack on Russian positions in the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali. Russian troops poured across the border in response and drove deep into Georgian territory. 
 On Aug. 26, Moscow recognized South Ossetia and Abkhazia as sovereign nations. Russia plans to keep troops there as its military withdraws from the rest of Georgia.

HEADLINE: Hazardous Conditions

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC and NICK BUNKLEY; Bill Vlasic contributed reporting.

 BODY:
DETROIT -- For the first time since 1993, automakers sold fewer than a million new cars and trucks in a single month in the United States, as a reeling economy scared people away from showrooms in September, and many eager buyers were unable to get loans.
With industry sales dropping 26.6 percent over all compared with a year ago, car companies are likely to cut more production and jobs to compensate for falling revenues.
The credit crisis contributed heavily to the steep decline -- analysts estimated that it cost the industry up to 100,000 vehicle sales in the final week of the month, on top of lost sales because of high gas prices and the shaky economy.
Auto executives said Wednesday that the industry faced more misery ahead until a bailout package was passed in Washington. 
''We feel it is critical,'' said Michael C. DiGiovanni, chief sales analyst for General Motors. ''If it doesn't happen, it's going to set off a continuing downward spiral in the economy.''
Nearly every automaker posted double-digit declines. Sales were down 34.5 percent at the Ford Motor Company, 32.8 percent at Chrysler, 32.3 percent at Toyota and 24 percent at Honda.
G.M. bucked the trend somewhat with only a 15.6 percent drop in sales. But it was helped by employee pricing deals offered to all consumers and an increase in sales to rental car fleets.
Over all, the industry sold about 964,000 vehicles in September compared with 1.31 million in the same month a year earlier, according to the research firm Autodata. There were 24 selling days this September compared with 25 a year ago.
''This is the worst point we have seen in 15 years,'' said Jesse Toprak, head of industry analysis for the automotive Web site Edmunds.com. ''And it is likely to be even worse in the month of October.''
Mr. Toprak said that sales for the entire year were projected to about 14 million vehicles, by far the lowest figure in more than a decade.
''There's no question this is an automotive recession,'' said Erich Merkle, an analyst at the accounting and consulting firm Crowe Horwath in Grand Rapids, Mich. ''It's going to take us a long time before we get back to that 16 million mark.''
Automakers said that tighter lending practices by banks had prevented countless consumers from getting financing deals for new vehicles. Moreover, they say the paralysis in Washington on a bailout bill and the startling failures of Wall Street investment banks have frightened away even creditworthy consumers.
At Toyota, the year-to-year sales drop was the worst the Japanese automaker has experienced in the United States in 20 years.
''There is a lack of consumer confidence,'' said Donald V. Esmond, senior vice president for Toyota's North American sales operations. ''They've got their hand on their wallet, and they're not spending their disposable income.''
The drop-off in sales across the industry occurred despite a nearly 19 percent increase in incentives from a year earlier. The average automaker incentive during the month was $2,801, compared with $2,357 in September of 2007, according to Edmunds.com.
Automakers said there had been a drastic decline in dealership traffic toward the end of the month, when the troubles on Wall Street caused a full-blown economic crisis.
''During the last 10 days of the month it was extremely weak,'' said George Pipas, a market analyst at Ford. ''It was tantamount, really, to a natural disaster.''
Executives at the Detroit automakers declined to say whether they were planning further production cuts in the fourth quarter to balance the shrinking demand.
But analysts said further cuts and reorganization moves appeared inevitable.
''We believe we will see an increase in promotional activity to stimulate demand, as well as a reduction in production volumes,'' Mr. Toprak said.
Detroit has already cut tens of thousands of jobs since 2006. Many of its assembly plants have been idled for weeks at a time this year to reduce production of slow-selling pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles.
G.M., Ford and Chrysler are also burning through billions of dollars in cash reserves to finance new products, even as their businesses falter. G.M. lost $15.5 billion in its second quarter, and Ford lost $7.8 billion.
The credit squeeze is also hitting dealers hard. Ford, for example, is increasing the cost of loans to dealers to pay for new-vehicle inventories.
Nearly 600 of the nation's 20,770 franchised new-car dealerships have closed their doors this year, according to the National Auto Dealers Association.
And the view from the showroom floor is getting gloomier each day that the financial crisis goes unresolved in Washington.
Michael Futrell, general manager of Champion Chevrolet in Tallahassee, Fla., said car shoppers seemed overwhelmed by the weak economy, tight credit, the Wall Street crisis and uncertainty surrounding the presidential election.
''People want to buy, but they just don't want to pull the trigger until they know who's going to be in office and what this economy is going to do,'' Mr. Futrell said. ''What the consumer doesn't understand is that there's probably not a better time to buy a car. The deals are out there, but I think everybody's so skeptical that they're trying to hold off.''
When gasoline prices hit $4 a gallon this year, consumers mostly backed away from buying larger vehicles in favor of more fuel-efficient passenger cars.
But vehicles of all sizes went begging in September -- sales of light trucks dropped 31 percent, while cars fell 21 percent, according to Autodata.
''We don't anticipate seeing recovery in the industry until we can get some recovery in housing,'' said Rebecca Lindland, an analyst with the consulting firm Global Insight in Lexington, Mass. ''The consumer has gone from being nervous and uncertain to just downright scared.''
The steady slide in sales has left automakers wondering whether the worst is yet to come.
''We are looking at a very fragile economy,'' said Emily Kolinski-Morris, Ford's chief economist. ''I don't think anyone can say where the bottom might be.''

HEADLINE: Manufacturing Index Shows Sharp Decline

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
A measure of American manufacturing activity contracted more than expected in September as new orders slowed sharply.
 The reading of 43.5 from the Institute for Supply Management was down from 49.9 in August. It also was worse than economists' prediction of 49.5, according to the consensus estimate of Wall Street economists surveyed by Thomson/IFR. 
 A reading above 50 signals growth.
 ''The headline I.S.M. has plunged into recession territory,'' Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, said Wednesday.
 The index has been hovering on what economists call ''the boom-bust'' line for most of the year, but this is the first time it has dropped significantly. One component of the reading, the purchasing managers' index, fell to its lowest level since October 2001, soon after the Sept. 11 attacks.
 The survey of purchasing managers found that new orders fell to 38.8 in September from a reading of 48.3 in August. Employment, deliveries, inventories and manufacturers' order backlogs also fell.
 Industries reporting contraction include apparel, furniture, machinery, transportation equipment and appliances. High prices for commodities, along with tight credit conditions, have begun to squeeze companies. 
 In another economic report released Wednesday, the Commerce Department said that construction activity was unchanged in August even though spending for residential projects posted the first increase in 17 months, good news in the midst of the worst housing downturn in decades.
 The report said that construction activity was flat in August, an outcome better than the 0.5 percent fall that economists had expected.
 The big surprise was a 0.3 percent rise in residential activity, the first increase in housing activity since March 2007.
 It was only the second monthly rise for housing in the last 29 months, a prolonged period of distress when the industry has been battered by slumping sales, falling prices and soaring mortgage defaults.
 The performance in August for overall construction was better than the decline analysts had expected. However, the government revised July activity to show a much bigger drop of 1.4 percent, in contrast to the 0.6 percent decline initially reported.
 The 0.3 percent increase in housing left spending in this area at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $343.6 billion. The gain was offset by a 0.8 percent drop in spending on nonresidential projects, which fell to $415.95 billion.
 Spending on government projects rose 0.8 percent to a record $312.5 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, with state, local and federal projects at record highs.
 In another report, ADP Employer Services said private companies cut 8,000 employees in September. The service also revised its figure for job cuts in August to 37,000, from 33,000.

HEADLINE: Word Reaches Congress: As the Market Goes, So Goes the Electorate

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Reporting was contributed by Karen Ann Cullotta from Willowbrook, Ill.; Sarah Abruzzese from Washington; Gretel C. Kovach from Dallas; Nate Schweber from Morristown, N.J., and John M. Hubbell from Memphis.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
What Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas, has heard from constituents this week about the Bush administration's $700 billion economic bailout plan has fluctuated as wildly as the stock markets.
 Before the House rejected the bailout on Monday, 90 percent of those who called and sent e-mail messages opposed the bailout, said a spokesman, Sean Brown. ''One guy called me yesterday and said, 'I paid off two mortgages on my own, and I don't want to see us bail out people who got in over their heads. I was responsible enough to make the right decisions. They should do the same thing,' '' Mr. Brown said. 
 Then the markets took a nosedive, and the tone changed, as frantic investors, including retirees, called to complain about what the House had done. 
 Mr. Barton, who voted against the bailout on Monday, has said he remains opposed. But with another House vote looming at week's end, and the markets still unsettled, he and colleagues in both parties face one of the toughest votes of their careers. 
 Lawmakers say the House vote and the subsequent gyrations of the stock market have captured the attention of constituents in a way that they had not witnessed in years. Adding to the pressure is the blare of commentary on television and on radio, where Rush Limbaugh, for instance, continued to rail against the bailout plan on Wednesday. 
 ''People had never heard of mark-to-market accounting, all of a sudden this is a household word,'' said Representative Michele Bachmann, Republican of Minnesota, who voted against the bailout and said most of her constituents were calling to say she did the right thing.
 As the Senate prepared on Wednesday night to approve the $700 billion rescue plan, lawmakers in the House said they were studying the additions and changes to the bill to decide whether to change their view. In interviews, several said they were also keenly aware that voter sentiment seemed to have shifted in the last few days, with supporters of the bailout plan turning more vocal after Monday's market declines. 
 The lawmakers pointed to a drumbeat of warnings that worse times could lie ahead, including what they said had been a flurry of fresh interest in local news coverage about how the credit crisis could hurt average families. Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, pointed to a report in The Tennessean in Nashville about new difficulties in obtaining car loans. 
 With every member of the House up for re-election in less than five weeks, there are potentially steep political risks on both sides of the bailout vote. One aide to a House member considering a change in position said the intensity of divisions could mean that ''there's no real way to win with the voters on this bill.''
 ''My calls are still running 10 to 1 against the bailout, which sounds like a lot and is a lot,'' said Representative Jason Altmire, Democrat of Pennsylvania, who voted no on Monday. ''But before the vote, it was 30 to 1. After the vote, especially that afternoon as the market fell, our calls were about 50-50.''
 Mr. Altmire said many of his constituents were outraged that tax dollars would be put at risk to stabilize financial firms run by wealthy executives. He said he had not yet decided whether to switch his vote to yes when the House votes again on Friday, though he does support a provision added by the Senate to increase to $250,000 the limit for bank deposits that are federally insured. 
 His Republican opponent, Melissa Hart, whom Mr. Altmire beat by 4 percentage points two years ago, said she would criticize his stance on the bailout either way -- if he remains opposed he is pandering to voters in a tough election year; if he switches his vote, he is flipping to help pass a bad plan. 
 ''Certainly it was very unpopular with the electorate, he even mentioned that his constituent calls were running very much against it,'' she said. ''But he has not mentioned anything as far as I know of an alternative or a plan of his own.'' 
 Representative John Yarmuth, Democrat of Kentucky, says he does not need to watch television or check the Internet to know how the stock market is faring these days. All he has to do is check in with his office and ask if the phones are ringing.
 Since Monday afternoon, when Mr. Yarmuth voted against the plan, the constituents calling his office have swung from almost universal opposition to the bill to evenly split. 
 ''Before the vote on Monday, I think our count was 965 to 60,'' Mr. Yarmuth said, describing the wave of sentiment against the plan. ''On Tuesday, after the market dropped,'' he said, ''the calls started out in the morning saying, 'why don't you do something.' Once the market came back, they started evening out again. Now they are running about 50-50.''
 Mr. Yarmuth said that several of the new provisions could potentially sway his vote. He checked in with his staff on Wednesday morning and learned that constituent feedback was closely tracking the stock markets, he said.
 ''This morning when the market was off a couple of hundred points, they said the calls were coming in saying do something, and when the market was up they stopped,'' Mr. Yarmuth said. ''So people are following the market pretty closely.''
 The rush of calls and e-mail to Representative Judy Biggert, Republican of Illinois, reached its peak on Tuesday, with hundreds of constituents evenly split over the bailout proposal. 
 Zachary Cikanek, Ms. Biggert's spokesman, said most constituents opposed the bailout until Monday, but since then sentiments were running about even. On Wednesday morning, Mr. Cikanek said he had handed his boss a binder of printouts of hundreds of e-mail messages from constituents, as well as transcripts of phone messages. 
 With so many new provisions being added to the bailout legislation by the Senate, Mr. Cikanek said that calls to inquire about the congresswoman's position were all being told: ''She's still reviewing it.''

HEADLINE: G.M. Aims for International Appeal

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER and BILL VLASIC; Bill Vlasic reported from Detroit, and Eric Pfanner from Paris.

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Accompanied by break dancers, executives at Chevrolet unveiled a car on Wednesday that the company hoped would lure American consumers out of Toyota and Honda showrooms and broaden the American carmaker's appeal in international markets.
 General Motors' decision to show the car here, on the eve of the Paris auto show, reflected its increasing dependency on its international markets for its sales and car development.
 With fuel prices hovering near record levels, G.M. and its Detroit rivals, Ford and Chrysler, have been struggling to respond to a shift in demand from consumers, who are abandoning gas-guzzling trucks and sport utility vehicles in favor of smaller, more fuel-efficient cars. To fill the gaps in their United States lineups, the Big Three American automakers are turning to their European and Asian operations or foreign partners. 
 ''As soon as the market went into a 180-degree turn over the last 18 months, it was unsurprising to learn that the Detroit carmakers had empty cupboards,'' said Peter Schmidt, managing director of Automotive Industry Data, a research firm in Britain. ''No carmaker can respond overnight to such a change in demand, so they had to turn elsewhere.''
 The Cruze, a compact car with an arched roofline, slanted headlights and a two-tier grille, was engineered and designed in Europe and Asia, with G.M. tapping resources from the former Daewoo Motor, which it acquired in 2001.
 The car will be built in South Korea as well as in St. Petersburg, Russia, and Lordstown, Ohio. Chevrolet plans to start selling the car in Europe next year, with other regions, including the United States, to follow in 2010.
 The Cruze will be the ''ambassador'' for Chevrolet's approach to globalization, Wayne Brannon, executive director of Chevrolet Europe, said. ''It's essential to be able to compete on a global basis.''
 Ford has taken a similar approach with a new version of the Fiesta, a subcompact car that was largely developed in Europe, on a platform shared with Mazda of Japan, in which Ford owns a strategic stake. Manufacturing has begun in Cologne, Italy; the Fiesta will also be built in Valencia, Spain, and in China, Thailand and Mexico. It is scheduled to be introduced in the United States in 2010.
 G.M., which lost $15.5 billion in the second quarter, is trying to turn Chevrolet, an iconic American brand, into a bigger global player. While Ford sells cars under its flagship brand everywhere, G.M. cars, including the Opel and the Vauxhall, are sold under different brands in different countries.
 But more important, American automakers expect to make a profit on the stylish new models -- something that has eluded them with other compacts, at least in North America.
 At an event in August at the Lordstown plant, Rick Wagoner, G.M.'s chairman, said the Cruze's fuel economy and stylish package should allow the company to charge a higher price than it had for previous compacts.
 Industry analysts also see the Cruze as a forerunner in the industry's shift to better-equipped, fuel-efficient small cars that can actually be profitable.
 Another American automaker, Chrysler, has stopped short of its bigger rivals in global product development. Instead, Chrysler is looking to outside suppliers to try to compete in small cars. Chrysler has reached agreements with Nissan of Japan and Chery Automotive of China to export cars to the United States and sell them under Chrysler brand names.
 The Cruze and the Fiesta are not the first ''world cars'' from the Big Three. After the oil crises of the 1970s, Ford took a similar approach in the development of the Escort, a small car that was adapted for American consumers from a European model.
 But the idea fell out of favor in Detroit as global auto markets diverged, with Americans opting for minivans and other light trucks. A European-developed car from Ford, the Mondeo, had only limited success when it was sold in North America as the Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique in the 1990s. Moreover, the car cost $6 billion to develop and became a symbol of the fractured state of Ford's global operations.
 Another small sedan, the Focus, has done better globally: Ford executives project that the automaker will build two million cars off the platform by 2012, making it the largest volume for any single platform in the industry.
 The new Fiesta was originally intended primarily for European and Asian markets. But as oil prices rose and American started looking at smaller cars again, the high-mileage Fiesta was added to Ford's North American plans. The Fiesta will give Ford its first entry in the pint-size B-car segment in the United States, which Ford sees as an essential part of its worldwide growth. The company's product development chief, Derrick Kuzak, said recently that the global B-car segment would grow to 21 million vehicles by 2014, nearly double what it was five years ago.
 While Europeans have long paid far more than Americans to fill up their tanks, largely because of higher taxes on oil, European consumers have been moving toward more fuel-efficient models this year.
 In France, where the government imposed a tax on gas guzzlers on Jan. 1, sales of sport utility vehicles fell 28 percent in the first seven months, even as the overall market grew by nearly 4 percent, Mr. Schmidt said. Germany and other European countries are considering similar taxes, he added.
 ''The likelihood is that the patterns we are seeing in the French market today will be echoed elsewhere -- small cars!'' Mr. Schmidt said.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 3, 2008

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about efforts by General Motors and other American carmakers to appeal to international markets misidentified the location of a Ford plant in Europe that has begun manufacturing the subcompact Fiesta. It is in Cologne, Germany -- not Cologne, Italy.

HEADLINE: If Only the Cool Kids Could See Him Now (at Least Hear His Songs)

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER

 BODY:
He was never much of a student, but Jason Robert Brown was a precocious kid. Growing up in Monsey, N.Y., about an hour north of Manhattan, he became enthralled by music at age 4, was taking lessons at 5. At his first recital -- age 6 -- he not only outplayed his teacher's other students, he also supplied the verbal patter of a natural entertainer.
 ''He just started chatting with the audience,'' his mother, Deborah Brown, recalled. ''I was floored. Nobody knew where it came from.''
 Once, before he could write in script, he filched a checkbook from one of his parents, wrote out a check and sent it to a mail-order record club. Fortunately he didn't get all the particulars right, and the check was returned because it was unsigned. Teachers plucked him from third grade and plopped him into the fourth, not because of straight A's but because he wasn't paying attention. 
 ''He was good in everything, but if it wasn't music, he didn't do the work,'' said Mrs. Brown, a former English teacher.
 Her son is now a 38-year-old lyricist and composer with a Tony Award to his credit; he's married (for the second time) with a young daughter and a faculty position at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. He has written scores for shows about adult subjects like anti-Semitism and lynching (''Parade''), and the dissolution of a marriage (''The Last Five Years''). 
 But in a recent interview he made it clear that he remembered the acute alienation he felt as the newcomer in fourth grade. 
 ''It was horrible, really traumatic and not fun, and it took me the better part of 15 years to recover,'' Mr. Brown said over dinner near the Bernard B. Jacobs Theater in Manhattan, where his new show, ''13,'' opens on Broadway on Sunday. Adolescent anxiety is very much on Mr. Brown's mind again these days, for it is the subject of ''13.'' The title refers to the age of the musical's protagonist, Evan Goldman, a smart, smart-alecky, self-absorbed New York bar mitzvah boy scaling the heights of his postpubescent junior high school social set when his parents divorce and he undergoes a startling reversal: His mother moves with him from the Upper West Side of Manhattan to a small town in Indiana. 
 The shock to Evan's system unleashes his worst instincts before his best ones emerge, and one result is a character who reflects what a lot of people say about Mr. Brown himself: that once he engages he is bighearted and empathetic, but until then he can be impatient, self-involved and brash. 
 ''His social graces are not his best thing,'' said the playwright Alfred Uhry, who wrote the book for ''Parade.'' ''He's got his own light that he sees the world with, and I've seen him be highhanded with people. He comes on very strong, but if you can get past that, it really doesn't matter anymore. Underneath it all he's a sweet guy.''
 Mr. Brown wrote the music and lyrics for ''13,'' working with Dan Elish and Robert Horn, who wrote the book. His score is full of hormonally fueled rock songs and melodic, Billy Joel-esque ballads about early-teenage concerns like the meaning of friendship, the cliquish strata of junior high school and the terrors of French kissing, but it is especially notable for its focus on the burning earnestness of youthful feelings. 
 ''It's the same angst that comes out in all my stuff,'' Mr. Brown said. ''I've never been particularly good at explaining or even understanding what this sort of rage is that is so accessible to me. I'm not an out-of-control person, but I can access in my work very easily a feeling of real fury. Thank goodness I've channeled it into my work, I guess.'' 
 Lanky and dark haired with a jittery but forthright manner, Mr. Brown talks fast and doesn't shy from opinions, particularly when it comes to music. In the past 10 years, he said, there have been only four musical scores that have engaged his interest: Adam Guettel's ''Light in the Piazza'' and ''Floyd Collins''; David Yazbek's ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels''; and Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty's ''Once on This Island.''
 ''The problem I have with a lot of other musicals is that either the songs have nothing to do with character, or the music is just lousy,'' he said. 
 He paused as though considering whether to go on.
 ''I know I'm really good at writing for the theater,'' he continued. ''I can deny it all I want. Other people can fight me on it. It doesn't really matter. It's the thing I happen to know is my gift. And I am probably not one of those artists who is really comfortable with sacrifices and compromises that commercial success entails.''
 In ''13'' he brought his sense of musical integrity to a defense of what might well be perceived as the show's gimmick. There are 13 characters in the show, all of them 13, and they are played by teenage actors, many of whom are as young as 13. The musicians, as well -- two guitarists, a bass player and keyboardist and a drummer -- are teenagers. 
 Mr. Brown was something of a prodigy himself. After high school he spent two years at the Eastman School of Music at the University of Rochester, but never graduated. He lived in Miami for a while, then at 20 came to New York, where he began playing in Greenwich Village piano bars. 
 In one bar he was approached by a patron, Daisy Prince, daughter of the director Harold Prince and a director herself. She was attracted to the sophistication of his musical palette and to his story songs, a penchant Mr. Brown said comes from the singer-songwriters he admired as a boy: Joni Mitchell, Paul Simon, James Taylor, Billy Joel. 
 ''Jason plays for his life,'' Ms. Prince said. ''He's a notorious piano-string breaker. That was sort of the first thing I noticed. And I love that kind of playing.''
 With her Mr. Brown put together a revue of his compositions, ''Songs for a New World,'' which was presented in 1995 Off Broadway. Ms. Prince introduced Mr. Brown to her father, who gave him a job as a rehearsal pianist and later hired him to write the score for ''Parade.'' Set in Atlanta in 1913, the show told a dark historical tale based on events surrounding the lynching of Leo Frank, a Jewish factory manager convicted -- possibly wrongly -- of rape and murder. 
 Mr. Brown was 28 by the time the show opened on Broadway in 1998. It closed just two months later, a victim of lukewarm reviews and, probably even more so, of its grim story. Nonetheless Mr. Brown's nuanced and atmospheric score won a Tony award.
 ''Jason's work was courageous,'' Mr. Prince said. ''The big number in the show, the trial of Leo Frank, that's as complex a problem as a composer and a lyricist can be thrown, and he just knocked it out of the park.''
 That ''Parade'' was an economic flop and that Mr. Brown had begun to earn a reputation for elevated self-regard meant he did not have many job offers. ''I think I turned off a lot of people in my 20s,'' he said. 
 He went on tour with ''Parade'' as the conductor, where he met his second wife, Georgia Stitt, who was the assistant conductor. They eventually married in 2003, but in the meantime he began writing a song cycle that evolved into a show about his failed first marriage. 
 ''The Last Five Years,'' as the show was titled, is about an ambitious writer whose marriage to an aspiring actress falls apart as their paths diverge; he's successful, she isn't. Its story is told from two directions at once, with Jamie, the male character, singing songs that narrate events in chronological order, from courtship to collapse, and Cathy performing songs that travel backward in time, from the tragic end to the hopeful beginning. The two narrative paths cross only once -- at the wedding.
 Its particulars hewed so close to home that Mr. Brown's ex-wife sued to have certain details excised. Still, the show presents neither character in an especially favorable light, and Mr. Brown acknowledges that it contains an element of self-chastisement. 
 ''The writing felt like an attempt at an exorcism,'' he said. ''I wanted to not be angry about my marriage falling apart. I wanted to be able to have perspective on it without having to wait for 20 years to have some perspective on it.''
 ''The Last Five Years'' played for just two months Off Broadway in 2002, but has become a popular choice in small theaters around the country. 
 ''It gets done so often, and I get asked to go watch it all the time,'' Mr. Brown said. ''But the better the production, the less I want to see it. Because when the actors are really hitting it, it's like having a knife pushed into my eyeballs.''
 On its way to Broadway ''13'' has undergone substantial revisions, and the show has been a lot more work than Mr. Brown initially had in mind. ''I'm resistant to say it on the record, but '13' started in a very cynical way,'' he said. ''I really thought, 'Everybody loves a bunch of dancing kids onstage, so let's do a show with a bunch of dancing kids.' ''
 In any case, his nature took over the show.
 ''Every time I wrote what I was sure was the most obvious sellout thing in the world, and I'd pat myself on the back for it, it would turn out to be sufficiently quirky and weird that the whole show started getting more emotionally sophisticated,'' he said. ''I never even intended it to happen, but being in a room with the kids, as much as they enjoyed doing all the dancing around and the jumping, what I responded to was when they suddenly got vulnerable. It would just kill me. And I thought, any idiot can do what I was talking about doing, but I want to do that.''

NATO AIMS AT AFGHANS
Whose Drugs Aid Militants
NATO forces in Afghanistan will step up attacks on drug lords and narcotics traffickers who are supporting an insurgency that is responsible for rising violence, the top American commander in Afghanistan said. The comments by the commander, Gen. David D. McKiernan, drew a link between the narcotics trade and the insurgency, but he made clear that international troops were not going to eradicate crops. PAGE A10
ENVOY EXTENDS NORTH KOREA TRIP
The Bush administration's top envoy for North Korea, Christopher Hill, extended his trip to Pyongyang as negotiators from both sides searched for a way to salvage a nuclear disarmament deal that the White House had hoped to portray as a major achievement. PAGE A8 
SOMALI PIRATES SAID TO CUT RANSOM
Negotiations over the arms-laden freighter hijacked by Somali pirates intensified, and several people close to the talks said the standoff was over the price. The pirates, who seized the Ukrainian ship on Sept. 25, initially demanded a $35 million ransom, then dropped it to $20 million, and now seem willing to settle for much less. PAGE A14
IN BRITAIN, TORY SWAGGER WANES
Up against an unpopular prime minister and far ahead in the polls, Britain's Conservative Party was set to gloat its way through its annual conference. That was before banks failed and the stock market plunged, casting a sober mood over the event. Or, as one Tory member put it: ''They're not jumping up and down on a podium and whipping people up into a frenzy while yelling 'hurrah, hurrah.' '' PAGE A12
ALTERNATIVE FOR RUSSIA'S ORPHANS
Kitezh, a village 190 miles southwest of Moscow, is an experimental community that combines features of an orphanage with those of foster care. Thirty or so children live there in private homes with their adoptive parents, who are also trained teachers, psychologists and medical personnel. The community's founders hope it can be a model of reform for Russia's decrepit child welfare system. PAGE A6
RUSSIAN COURT REHABILITATES CZAR
Russia's Supreme Court ruled in favor of full rehabilitation for Russia's last czar, Nicholas II, or ''Bloody Nicholas,'' and his family, officially recognizing the Romanovs as victims of ''unfounded repression'' 90 years after they were executed. The ruling is the latest step in Russia's post-Soviet reinterpretation of history, which has seen a new embrace for a monarchy once castigated for its brutality. PAGE A5

BANK LIMITS ACCESS
To Money for Colleges
Wachovia Bank has limited the access of nearly 1,000 colleges to $9.3 billion that the bank has held for them in a short-term investment fund, raising worries on some campuses about meeting payrolls and other obligations. The announcement by Wachovia sent hundreds of college presidents rushing to check their financial vulnerability on every front. PAGE A16
JUSTICES LET RAPE RULING STAND
The Supreme Court amended but let stand its June decision striking down the death penalty for child rapists. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said an amendment in 2006 to the Uniform Code of Military Justice that specifically made child rape committed by military personnel a capital crime had been overlooked by the parties but did not alter the court's analysis. PAGE A21
ARRESTS IN GANG CRACKDOWN
A four-month nationwide crackdown on gangs has brought the arrest of 1,759 people -- gang members and their associates, other criminals and immigration violators -- from more than 20 countries, the federal authorities announced. The annual crackdowns began in February 2005 as a way to focus on the Salvadoran gang known as MS-13. PAGE A18

NEW YORK REPORT
TAX-FREE CIGARETTES CITED
As Fueling Underground Economy
Legal authorities say the trail of illegal, untaxed cigarettes sold on the streets of New York City leads to American Indian reservations in New York State, a path they contend is smoothed by the tacit cooperation of some cigarette makers and distributors. Those tax-free cigarettes fuel a particularly active underground tobacco economy, law enforcement officials say. PAGE A29
DISCOUNTED MORTGAGES STOPPED
Squeezed by the tightening credit markets, a New York State agency that provides subsidized mortgages to first-time home buyers stopped offering discounted interest rates this week and started looking for new sources of financing. Officials at the agency said they decided to raise their interest rates to market levels because they were struggling to borrow money to finance the purchase of mortgages. PAGE A29
SPORTS
RAYS JOIN BASEBALL RANKS
Entered by Only the Few
Having made the postseason for the first time in their history with this year's last-to-first finish, the Tampa Bay Rays have drawn comparisons to the few other teams with similar major turnarounds. Included are what was then the upstart Anaheim Angels of 2002, who improved by 24 games from 2001 and rode the magic of the Rally Monkey to a World Series title. PAGE C22
WHO ARE THOSE (2 EXTRA) GUYS?
Major League umpires spend years learning not just baseball's encyclopedic collection of rules, but how best to position themselves at each base, where to move depending on where the ball is hit, and how to find the best angle and proper distance to make the most accurate call. And then come the playoffs, with two extra umpires standing along the foul lines in the outfield, maybe for the first time in their lives. PAGE C18
RECRUITING GOES INTERNET
High school players, athletes and coaches have long sent videotapes to college recruiters, hoping to gain attention for performances that might otherwise have gone unnoticed. But online highlights have added ease and immediacy to the process. PAGE C20
CHINESE GYMNASTS RULED OF AGE
All six members of the Chinese women's gymnastics team at the Beijing Games were old enough to compete, officials from the International Gymnastics Federation said after a monthlong investigation. But the federation's inquiry into under-age gymnasts will continue: two members of China's squad from the 2000 Olympics are being scrutinized for possibly breaking age rules. PAGE C18
BUSINESS
AUTO SALES OFF 26.6 PERCENT;
Worst Numbers Since 1993
For the first time since 1993, automakers sold fewer than one million new cars and trucks in a month in the United States, as reeling consumer confidence kept people away from showrooms and a lack of available credit sent sales of new cars and trucks to a 15-year low. With industry sales dropping 26.6 percent in September, automakers are likely to cut more production and jobs to compensate for falling revenues. PAGE C1
LILLY COURTS IMCLONE
Eli Lilly is in talks to acquire ImClone Systems, the maker of the cancer drug Erbitux, for $6.1 billion, a person briefed on the matter said. The deal, at $70 a share, would be higher than the hostile $4.7 billion offer that Bristol-Myers Squibb has made for the 83 percent of ImClone that it does not already own. But Bristol-Myers has already raised its bid once and could do so again. PAGE C4
TEXT MONITORED IN CHINA
A group of Canadian human-rights activists and computer security researchers has discovered a huge surveillance system in China that monitors and archives certain Internet text conversations that use words that China considers politically charged, including those related to the religious group Falun Gong, Taiwan independence and the Chinese Communist Party, democracy and milk powder. (Chinese officials are facing criticism over chemicals' tainting milk powder.) PAGE C1
A CUT ABOVE IN MOVIES
A year after its debut, the Vudu movie box, which offers instant playback of 10,000 movies and TV shows, is still unknown to most people. Why hasn't it become more of a hit? David Pogue writes that it trumps services like CinemaNow and MovieLink, and has been quietly making its package better while its price is lowered. PAGE C1
WOMEN PUSH FOR FEDERAL CONTRACTS
The Women's Business Ownership Act laid the groundwork for women to participate in government contracting 20 years ago. Though the latest statistics show that women own almost half of small businesses nationwide, last year, female small-business owners were awarded only 3.4 percent of annual federal contracts. This week, the Small Business Administration posted the final version of the rule meant to increase the numbers. PAGE C4

His last art show sold out before the doors opened, with some of the pieces going for a hefty $85,000. But the street artist Shepard Fairey has not forgotten his roots, and despite 14 arrests, urban real estate remains his canvas of choice. Street artists say he's too mainstream. Critics call him watered down. But Mr. Fairey is still making art, and on his own terms. Page E1
FRIENDSHIP, IN A WORD
Dude. The word has moved beyond its cowboy roots and into the modern lexicon, and may now describe a genre.

Andre Benjamin, a k a Andre 3000 of the hip-hop duo Outkast, has long been known for his dapper style. Now he is marketing the aesthetic in a line of men's wear called Benjamin Bixby, inspired by Ivy League athletics of the 1930s. By designing under an assumed name, Mr. Benjamin is reflecting the latest trend in celebrity fashion, which is for celebrity designers to masquerade as nobody designers, and thereby appear to be more authentic than opportunistic.

READYING FOR A HOLIDAY
With Your Own Harvest Hut
Sukkot, a weeklong Jewish harvest holiday, carries with it the responsibility of constructing a sukkah, the temporary structure used for dining, entertaining and sometimes sleeping. Fortunately for those not inclined to handiwork, the holiday's increasing popularity has helped make it possible to go online and choose from a plethora of prefab sukkahs. PAGE F1

HEADLINE: As Governor, Palin Has Focused on Developing State's Resources

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: ANCHORAGE 

 BODY:
When Gov. Sarah Palin meets Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday in the vice-presidential debate, even her fellow Alaskans might hear for the first time some of her views on health care reform, education policy and other issues of state government. 
 In her 22 months in office, Ms. Palin has not addressed many of those matters in a significant way, pursuing a narrower agenda rooted in Alaska's resource-based economy. 
 Ms. Palin has approved increased spending for education and the elderly, sued the federal government for listing the polar bear as a threatened species, and pushed for a bill that would have reduced state regulation of new medical facilities. 
 But by and large, oil and gas issues have dominated her tenure. 
 ''You can't think of another area where there's been another drive or initiative coming out of the administration with the same level of intensity,'' said Scott Goldsmith, a professor of economics at the Institute of Social and Economic Research at the University of Alaska Anchorage.
 Well before she became the Republican vice-presidential nominee, Ms. Palin was positioning herself nationally on resource development and energy issues. She is the chairwoman of the natural resources committee of the National Governors Association, after serving as vice chairwoman until July. The committee has not yet taken action under Ms. Palin, but a spokeswoman for the association said committees usually did not take up business until later in the fall. 
 Ms. Palin's work on oil and gas issues was part of a wider effort at overturning the work of her predecessor, Gov. Frank H. Murkowski, also a Republican. She has pushed through measures to increase taxes on oil companies in addition to a $500 million subsidy to encourage construction of a pipeline that would tap trillions of cubic feet of natural gas beneath the North Slope.
 Ms. Palin has long said that a pipeline -- the construction of which remains uncertain -- would transform Alaska's image from that of a state known for receiving more federal money per capita than any other to one that is finding ways to meet the country's energy needs.
 A review of her public statements, signed and vetoed bills, and interviews with people in state government provide insight into Ms. Palin's positions on other statewide issues:
 HEALTH CARE Ms. Palin proposed eliminating a requirement that new medical facilities receive a ''certificate of need'' from the state before opening. She argued that the certificate program had the effect of driving health care costs up by not allowing more competition and potentially better health care in newer facilities. 
 In an op-ed piece in The Anchorage Daily News in February, Ms. Palin wrote that eliminating the certificate program, ''with certain exceptions, will allow free-market competition and reduce onerous government regulation.'' The bill, strongly opposed by hospitals, did not make it out of the Legislature.
 TRADE Ms. Palin does not appear to have made any trade missions since taking office, and former state officials said the state's trade staff had been reduced under her watch.
 Alaska has also sharply reduced its role in the Northern Forum, an association of state and regional governments from countries including Canada, Russia, Japan and China that works on common issues in northern regions like economic development, flooding and global warming. 
 Under Mr. Murkowski, Ms. Palin's predecessor, the state sent senior administration officials to the forum's meetings and contributed $60,000 to $100,000 to the forum each year, according to the forum's executive director, Priscilla Wohl.
 Under Ms. Palin, the state has reduced its spending to the base-level membership dues, $15,000, and the administration has not attended any forum meetings, including one last fall in Russia.
 ''Had she participated, in the last 18 months she would have met ambassadors, governors, heads of the European Union's programs, of United Nations programs,'' Ms. Wohl said.
 EDUCATION In March, Ms. Palin approved a widely praised legislative effort that would increase education spending by about $200 million over five years, an increase made possible by revenue surpluses from the rising price of oil.
 She largely took her education spending proposal from the recommendations of a special task force created by lawmakers to address an issue that had long divided the capital.
 The final product increased money for rural schools but also nearly tripled the per-student allocation for students with intensive special needs, in districts like Anchorage, where enrollment has increased from students moving in from rural Alaska for services.
 Ms. Palin's son Trig, born in April, has Down syndrome. The special-needs population served by the increase in spending includes students with Down syndrome, said Carol Comeau, superintendent of the Anchorage School District.
 Ms. Comeau was among several education experts who gave much of the credit for the increase in financing to the legislative task force but also praised Ms. Palin for approving the bill. She noted that Ms. Palin initially sought a larger per-student increase for the general student population than the Legislature approved.
 Some people close to the legislation noted that if Ms. Palin had opposed the increases she would have risked alienating Democratic lawmakers whose support she needed for the pipeline legislation.
 ENVIRONMENT Ms. Palin has taken positions that reflect her support for developing Alaska's natural resources. Her views are largely in line with those of voters in her state, but not with environmentalists. 
 Like most other Alaskans, Ms. Palin supports drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, while her running mate, Senator John McCain, is opposed. She has been ambiguous about whether she believes humans are causing climate change, while Mr. McCain has embraced science linking climate change to human activities.
 In August, Ms. Palin sued the federal government for listing the polar bear as a threatened species, saying climate models that showed that the bears would be affected by melting Arctic ice are unreliable. (Documents later revealed that state biologists disagreed with members of the Palin administration.) The governor and other state lawmakers opposed the listing because it could limit drilling for oil off Alaska's coast. 
 The most contentious environmental issue within Alaska recently has been the fight over the proposed Pebble Mine, one of the world's largest discoveries of gold and copper. The proposed mine would be at the headwaters of Bristol Bay, home to one of the world's largest runs of wild salmon. 
 In response to a candidate questionnaire two years ago, Ms. Palin told The Anchorage Daily News, ''As part of a Bristol Bay fishing family, I would not support any development that would endanger the most sensitive and productive fishery in the world.''
 This year, in August, a ballot initiative before state voters would have made it more difficult to open mines that could damage salmon streams. Ms. Palin came out against the measure just days before it was defeated.
 Supporters of the measure believe the governor's public opposition may have broken ethics laws prohibiting state officials from advocating for ballot initiatives. State ethics officials are reviewing the matter. 
 THE ELDERLY For many years, Alaska had a so-called longevity bonus, which paid up to $250 a month to elderly people who had lived in Alaska before statehood in 1959. The program was not based on financial need, however, and Mr. Murkowski ended it in 2003, when the state budget was tight.
 Ms. Palin promised in her 2006 campaign to restore the bonus. In 2007, however, lawmakers rejected her proposal and instead passed a bill that helped low-income elderly Alaskans. Ms. Palin signed the bill, which pays up to $250 a month to qualifying people over 65.
 BUDGET Even with the state enjoying a multibillion-dollar surplus because of high oil prices, Ms. Palin has vetoed about $500 million in capital spending projects requested by state lawmakers in two consecutive budgets. She also supported putting about $7 billion of surplus revenue into state savings over two years.
 A chunk of that surplus, about $2 billion, came from the governor's effort to increase taxes on the oil industry. Ms. Palin's initial proposal would have brought in about $600 million more in oil taxes, but when lawmakers raised oil taxes higher, Ms. Palin continued to support the measure. That angered many conservative Republicans, as did the governor's plan to use about $740 million of the surplus to give each Alaskan a $1,200 ''rebate'' to help pay for high energy costs. 
 Opponents of the oil tax increase, most of them conservative Republicans, say it ultimately may reduce exploration in the North Slope at a time when oil production is declining. Some also say the rebate money would have been better off saved or spent on long-term efforts to reduce energy costs. 
 ''Throwing money at people is what politicians do when they don't have a policy,'' said Representative Mike Hawker, Republican of Anchorage.
 SOCIAL ISSUES Ms. Palin has been open about her conservative views, which include opposition to same-sex marriage and the use of embryonic stem cells for research. 
 Even so, she has passed over chances as governor to take bold legislative stands on conservative social issues. She declined calls by abortion opponents this year to hold a special session to pass a measure requiring minors to get parental consent before having abortions. The governor chose instead to focus on passing the pipeline legislation. Mr. Hawker, the Republican lawmaker, said the decision reflected Ms. Palin's political pragmatism.
 ''She did not take on the Democrats whose support she needed,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Nixon, Bush, Palin

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
In 1970, in the midst of the longest bear market since World War II, President Richard Nixon declared: ''Frankly, if I had any money, I'd be buying stocks right now.''
 The market soared.
 Now, I've been asking myself, just for the heck of it, what would happen if President Bush tried his own jawboning of the market and said: ''Frankly, if I had any money, I'd be buying stocks right now.'' 
 My conclusion is: Mr. President, please, please do not say that! I reckon the market could tank in ways that would make this week's one-day 777 point plunge look paltry.
 I'm not about to write a paean to Nixon. I watched him quit in a bar in Bolinas, Calif.; I can still hear the cheer. But even his tortured, sleazy nature betrayed some essential seriousness about the fate of the United States. By contrast, the Bush crowd has gambled the future of this country with abandon.
 (And Nixon did resign as impeachment loomed. Whatever happened to the notion that someone -- a cabinet member, a Wall Street C.E.O., the inventor of credit-default swaps -- might actually fall on his or her sword? Shame has become a quaint chivalric notion, like honor, a thing of another American time.)
 A closer look at the Bush gamble is merited because the first person to reprice risk on the basis it no longer existed was the president. Now, that's leading by example.
 The gamble involved going to war in Iraq at an estimated cost to date of about $700 billion (does that figure sound familiar?), while opting not to raise taxes but to lower them. It involved going into that war, and another in Afghanistan, while asking not for shared sacrifice but a great collective maxing-out in the service of: shopping. 
 At the same time, Bush, who often seemed to need directions to the Treasury, opted to allow an opaque derivatives market to grow into the trillions without supervision, regulation or information. The market knew best. Turns out that what the market knew best was how to turn capitalism into a pyramid scheme for trading worthless paper.
 The cost is now clear. But we should be grateful for small mercies. Remember Bush wanted to throw Social Security into the casino, too, by privatizing it! 
 Market capitalism is a sophisticated thing that calls for transparency, ethics and rules. Bush and his crowd gambled that some ''new paradigm'' meant these things were passe. 
 They're not. We have to be careful now. Already the contagion of bank failures has spread to Europe. People are asking of the United States: what became of this country?
 The Chinese have been ready to treat U.S. Treasuries as a rock-hard store of value and loan us the dollars they accumulate at a very low interest rate. But what if they start to doubt the U.S. government will repay its debt?
 ''We are getting closer to a tipping-point,'' said Benn Steil, an economist. ''People are asking: can we really trust the dollar as a store of value?''
 The Bretton Woods system of monetary management collapsed in 1971, under Nixon. Since then the dollar's been the primary reserve currency. Now, we're reaching another point where a rethink of the foundations for a global economy is needed.
 Global trade and capital flows are essential to prosperity. But it's illogical to have a global system with no global reserve as insurance. Perhaps the trillions of Gulf and Chinese surpluses could be used to finance that. Or perhaps it's time for a return to the gold standard.
 I know one thing: this is no time for further gambling. John McCain rolled the dice on Sarah Palin. I'm grateful to Bob Rice of Tangent Capital for pointing out that the actuarial risk, based on mortality tables, of Palin becoming president if the Republican ticket wins the election is about 1 in 6 or 7.
 That's the same odds as your birthday falling on a Wednesday, or being delayed on two consecutive flights into Newark airport. Is America ready for that? 
 The lesson of the last eight years is this: when power is a passport to gamble, people can end up seriously broke or seriously dead.
 There is one capable, sober guy in the Bush administration: Defense Secretary Robert Gates. He recently said that U.S. forces in Iraq had to learn counterinsurgency on the job. ''But that came at a frightful human, financial and political cost,'' he noted.
 Gates warned that ''warfare is inevitably tragic, inefficient.'' He urged skepticism of any notion that ''adversaries can be cowed, shocked or awed into submission, instead of being tracked down, hilltop by hilltop, house by house, block by bloody block.''
 In short, he lambasted the Rumsfeld-Cheney-Bush war effort for its gambler's irresponsibility. The financial equivalent of reckless ''Shock and Awe'' has been ''Sub and Prime.''
 And people's houses across America really did go up in smoke.
 And fear stalked the land.

HEADLINE: An Everyman on the Trail, Biden Enjoys Senator's Perks at Home

BYLINE: By MIKE MCINTIRE and SERGE F. KOVALESKI

 BODY:
For the millions of voters getting to know him, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, portrays himself at times as an average guy who takes the train to work, frets about money and basically has led a middle-class life.
 ''Ladies and gentlemen, your kitchen table is like mine,'' Mr. Biden said when Senator Barack Obama introduced him as his running mate. ''You sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk, you talk about what you need. You talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills.''
 Mr. Biden certainly can trace his roots to the working-class neighborhoods of Scranton, Pa., and Claymont, Del., where he was raised. But these days, his kitchen table can be found in a 6,800-square-foot custom-built colonial-style house on four lakefront acres, a property worth close to $3 million. 
 Although he is among the least wealthy members of the millionaires club that is the United States Senate -- he and his wife, Jill, a college professor, earn about $250,000 a year -- Mr. Biden maintains a lifestyle that is more comfortable than the impression he may have given on the campaign trail. A review of his finances found that when it comes to some of his largest expenses, like the purchase and upkeep of his home and his use of Amtrak trains to get around, he has benefited from resources and relationships not available to average Americans.
 As a secure incumbent who has rarely faced serious competition during 35 years in the Senate, Mr. Biden has been able to dip into his campaign treasury to spend thousands of dollars on home landscaping and some of his Amtrak travel between Wilmington, Del., where he lives, and Washington. And the acquisition of his waterfront property a decade ago involved wealthy businessmen and campaign supporters, some of them bankers with an interest in legislation before the Senate, who bought his old house for top dollar, sold him four acres at cost and lent him $500,000 to build his new home.
 There is nothing to suggest Mr. Biden bent any rules in the sale, purchase and financing of his homes. Rather, he appears to have benefited at times from the simple fact of who he is: a United States senator, not just ''Amtrak Joe,'' the train-riding everyman that the Obama-Biden campaign has deployed to rally middle-class voters.
 ''He was a V.I.P., so he was treated accordingly by the bank,'' said Ronald Tennant, a former loan officer who handled the mortgages Mr. Biden used to build his house. The bank did not give him a below-market interest rate, a perk that has caused embarrassment for some other members of Congress. But, Mr. Tennant said, ''We paid particularly close attention to make sure everything came out right.''
 Mr. Biden's campaign said that he neither received special treatment nor offered any to the people he has dealt with in real estate and banking, and that he had not left a misleading impression of his wealth with voters. The senator, said David Wade, his spokesman, ''has never forgotten where he came from, or how he grew up, and those middle-class values motivate his work for the middle class.''
 ''He appreciates,'' Mr. Wade continued, ''that with his income as a senator he has been blessed to live comfortably, provide for his family, send his kids to college, and have the home his family dreamed of.''
 As for the payments by Mr. Biden's campaign committee, Citizens for Biden, his aides insisted they were not used to cover the senator's living expenses, which would be illegal. Election lawyers said that the law does not spell out all the ways an officeholder could benefit personally from the use of campaign money, and that regulators are generally reluctant to challenge the justifications campaign committees use.
 Mr. Biden's campaign said the payments to tree trimmers and lawn services, typically totaling a few thousand dollars a year, were permissible because they were tied to political events at his home. Jim Whittaker, co-owner of Grass Roots Inc., which was paid $4,345 in 2000, said the payment probably represented several visits to the senator's property, adding that Mr. Biden was ''late paying the bill one time.''
 ''We cut the grass and put sod down for him, did spring cleanups, mulching and knocked down vegetation,'' Mr. Whittaker said. ''One time we did a mulching job and he was having an event, but I don't know if it was political or just for friends.''
 Beyond landscaping costs, one of the Biden campaign's largest regular expenditures is for Amtrak tickets for the senator and his aides or consultants. Going back to 2001, those expenses typically ranged from $9,000 to $15,000 a year -- far exceeding that of his colleagues in Delaware's Congressional delegation, whose campaigns spent between $500 and $3,000, federal election records show. Like Mr. Biden, Delaware's other senator, Thomas R. Carper, and Representative Michael N. Castle commute daily to Washington, their offices said.
 Commuting on the train to and from Washington is an expensive proposition, $84 round trip from Wilmington or $1,062 for a monthly pass, although Amtrak offers a little-known discount for federal employees traveling on business. Senators cannot use their office travel allowance for commuting, according to a spokesman for the Senate Rules Committee.
 But Mr. Biden's aides acknowledged he sometimes uses campaign money to pay for trips if they ''involved a meeting or event related to his campaign.'' They could not explain why his campaign's Amtrak expenditures are relatively high, other than to point out that they would include travel by his staff and consultants, as do those of other politicians.
 The Biden campaign's Amtrak expenses have remained high even in years without elections, when he was not actively campaigning and his committee retained a handful of part-time staff members and almost no consultants. In 2003, for instance -- after he had just easily won re-election to another six-year term -- his committee spent $10,874 on Amtrak tickets; that same year, the campaigns of Senator Carper and Representative Castle spent $1,257 and $589, respectively.
 Mr. Biden's Amtrak travel is the stuff of Washington lore. He started making the 90-minute trips each day to be with his young sons after his first wife died in 1972, and he has continued ever since. On the stump, Mr. Biden cites his commute as a way to connect with voters; last month he brought reporters along to chronicle a ride.
 At least by Senate standards, Mr. Biden does not have to try too hard to underscore his relative lack of wealth. He has long shouldered a heavy debt load; he obtained or refinanced mortgages 29 times since he was elected in 1972, and currently owes $730,000 on two mortgages on his home. In addition, he has had several personal loans, including one for up to $50,000 secured by the cash value of six life insurance policies. 
 Mr. Biden supplements his $165,000 Senate salary with a stipend from teaching a college course. His biggest boost came a few years ago, when he collected $225,000 in advances for his best-selling memoir. The Bidens have several checking accounts with less than $15,000 each, and Jill Biden's retirement fund with between $15,000 to $50,000, according to their tax returns and Mr. Biden's Senate financial disclosure reports. The couple reported virtually no investment income last year, and their largest asset by far was their home.
 Mr. Biden previously lived for 21 years in a 10,000-square-foot former DuPont mansion in Greenville, which he bought in 1975 for $185,000 after learning it was slated for demolition. 
 Afterextensive renovations, he sold it in February 1996, through word of mouth, to John R. Cochran III, the vice chairman of MBNA, one of the nation's largest credit card companies. He agreed to pay Mr. Biden's full asking price, $1.2 million. MBNA reimbursed Mr. Cochran for a loss he took on the sale of his old home, according to a 1997 securities filing, which said the company requested that he move to Delaware from Maryland.
 Mr. Cochran, who still lives at the house, could not be reached for comment.
 The real estate deal was just one facet of a close relationship between Mr. Biden and MBNA, which donated more than $200,000 to his campaigns. The Delaware-based company gave a job to Mr. Biden's son Hunter; flew Senator Biden and his wife to the Maine coast, where Mr. Biden spoke at a company retreat; and its former chief executive, Charles M. Cawley, donated at least $22,500 to a nonprofit breast cancer fund started by Jill Biden.
 MBNA also was an aggressive advocate of bankruptcy reform legislation before the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Mr. Biden was a senior member and its former chairman. The legislation would make it harder for consumers to escape credit card debts.
 Mr. Wade said there was nothing improper in Mr. Biden's dealings with Mr. Cochran. He said the sale price was supported by an appraisal for the same amount, and that Mr. Biden never did MBNA any favors in the Senate.
 In acquiring a site for his new house, Mr. Biden bought the lakeside parcel in Wilmington in March 1996 from Keith D. Stoltz, a real estate executive who once lived adjacent to the property and sold it to the senator for $350,000, the same price he paid for it five years earlier. In an e-mail message, Mr. Stoltz said the price was reasonable because the real estate market was soft and he had paid a premium for the lot so he could keep it undeveloped.
 ''Joe initially offered me $300,000 for the lot and I declined his offer,'' he said.
 Mr. Stoltz and several of his relatives have since given a total of about $33,000 in campaign donations to Mr. Biden over the years. He said the senator has never done anything ''either formally or informally'' to help his company.
 To build his house, Mr. Biden turned to Beneficial National Bank. Its executives were active in state politics in Delaware, major campaign contributors to both parties nationally and advocates of changes to bankruptcy policy.
 Not long before Mr. Biden obtained his construction loan from Beneficial in July 1997, he had offered to nominate the bank's chairman, James H. Gilliam Jr., for a federal judge's post in Delaware, according to news accounts of Mr. Gilliam's death in 2003. Mr. Gilliam, a lawyer who also headed a state judiciary nomination panel and donated to Mr. Biden's campaigns, declined the offer and recommended someone else, whom Mr. Biden nominated in June 1997.
 Mr. Biden's campaign said that his dealings with Mr. Gilliam had nothing to do with the $634,000 in loans he received from Beneficial, adding that Mr. Biden had other reasons to consider Mr. Gilliam, who would have been Delaware's first African-American federal judge.
 Mr. Biden, who said in his book that he designed his house ''from the ground up,'' saw it finished it time to move in for Christmas 1998, although the work of maintaining it never seemed complete. Recounting how he was once interrupted by a presidential phone call while he was outside watering newly planted cypress trees, he lamented that ''even after a few years on the property, there was still landscaping to be done.''

HEADLINE: In Europe, Thoughts of a Coordinated Response to the Financial Crisis

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE and KATRIN BENNHOLD

DATELINE: BRUSSELS 

 BODY:
Caught off guard by their banks' exposure to the global financial crisis, European governments are considering redrawing the regulatory landscape. And with the financial crisis challenging some of the fundamentals of Anglo-American-dominated capitalism, France's competing vision of a Europe with greater economic coordination is gaining some momentum. 
 Proposals that only a week ago might have looked outlandish are suddenly being taken more seriously. 
 As the United States Senate moved toward a vote on a $700 billion rescue package for American banks, officials here began debating whether Europe needed a similar, though smaller, fund of its own, though European leaders had dismissed initial calls for their own bailout by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr.
 In Brussels, the European Commission proposed rules Wednesday aimed at toughening lender supervision, and approved the nationalization of the British lender Bradford & Bingley in a record 24 hours, brushing aside fears that the rescue might distort competition.
 France, which currently holds the presidency of the European Union, suggested going much further -- strengthening cross-border cooperation among regulators, unifying rules on bank deposit guarantees, altering accounting standards to no longer require banks to write-off losses immediately and possibly suspending government aid rules.
 The ideas are expected to be discussed at a meeting planned for Saturday in Paris, to be led by Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president. Late Wednesday, though, the timing was still up in the air, since Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain and Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, had not yet confirmed whether they would attend.
 While the major banks in Europe, including Deutsche Bank, Barclays and Societe Generale, appear to be weathering the financial storm fairly well, several others have been taken over through government-engineered consolidations or nationalizations. The stepped up pace of activity comes as yet another bank, the giant pan-European lender, UniCredit of Italy, came under pressure in the stock market.
 UniCredit declared Wednesday that it was well capitalized but was being damaged by stock speculators after its shares were temporarily suspended from trading in Milan.
 Talk of a European bailout fund of 300 billion euros ($420 billion) made waves late on Wednesday, after Christine Lagarde, France's finance minister, acknowledged that some sort of fund would be discussed at the weekend meeting.
 ''We are in agreement within the E.U. that we need to support the financial sector,'' Ms. Lagarde, who did not put a price tag on any such fund, told the German business daily Handelsblatt in an interview to be published Thursday. ''Then the question arises: Do we need a European rescue fund to save banks?''
 Mr. Sarkozy's office and the finance ministry were quick to deny that the fund was a French idea, and the German finance ministry attacked the notion as unwarranted. 
 One European official suggested that the plan had been floated by the Netherlands. Jan Peter Balkenende, the prime minister of the Netherlands, will meet with Mr. Sarkozy in Paris on Thursday. The fund might take the form of a reserve set aside for emergencies by each country, with each setting aside the same percentage of gross domestic product.
 Another idea, which is being offered by the French, is the creation of a European regulator of banks and insurers, a ''European policeman,'' as Jean-Pierre Jouyet, the French European affairs minister, called it Wednesday. That would most likely mean a significant tightening of coordination among national regulators.
 Officials are also looking at ways to standardize deposit insurance levels across Europe to avoid limits being ratcheted up haphazardly from one country to another in response to seeming panics. Ireland decided this week to provide unlimited protection for all deposits at six Irish banks.
 France would also like to see changes to European accounting rules, which stipulate that banks and insurers have to mark down their assets in line with short-term movements in the market. Changes to the ''mark to market'' rules are also being considered at the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 While France waits for those wide-ranging reforms to be discussed, both Paris and Berlin are expected to call for a systematic suspension of rules that limit government assistance to national banks. In the current climate, they seek greater latitude to rescue stricken institutions. Officials in Britain said they were generally behind such a proposal.
 Germany, meanwhile, is arguing that Brussels should ease up in its enforcement of strict rules against subsidies. Such a step would have immediate relevance for the German bank WestLB, as well as other German state-owned banks.
 WestLB won initial approval for a 5 billion euro ''risk shield'' financed by the German government, regional German governments and local savings banks, to avoid a fire sale of its mortgage-linked assets. But it still needs to complete a restructuring that will persuade Neelie Kroes, the European competition commissioner, that the bank -- after bailouts stretching back a decade -- is on sound footing.
 Ms. Kroes sought to pre-empt calls to abandon government aid limits by speeding through authorization of the Bradford & Bingley nationalization.
 At the same time, she made an indirect criticism of the Irish government, which, according to European officials, gave little notice before announcing its deposit guarantee for six Irish banks. Britain said it would increase its guarantee for depositors to $:50,000 ($88,700), from $:35,000.
 Ms. Kroes warned governments to consult before taking actions, and invoked the Great Depression. ''When Europe was confronted with a banking crisis in the 1930s, governments decided to go national, to retreat from the European markets and close their borders,'' she argued. ''I would like to plead to national governments today not to act unilaterally.''
 But Mr. Trichet cautioned against precipitous actions. Because Europe is not a ''fully-fledged federation,'' he said, a pan-European solution was unlikely.
 ''Each country has to mobilize its own efforts,'' he told Bloomberg Television in remarks released Wednesday. ''But of course there is a European spirit and that is the spirit of the single market.''
 Britain is trying to steer the debate toward a ''college'' of national regulators that would coordinate their decisions. Luigi Guiso, professor of economics and finance at the European University Institute, said that so far national governments had dealt reasonably effectively with the situation but that would be tested if there was a problem with a bank like UniCredit, which operates in 22 countries, including Italy and Germany and in Eastern Europe.
 In hopes of preventing the situation from worsening, the Italian securities market regulator, Consob, said Wednesday that it had banned short sales, or bets on declines of banking and insurance stocks, following similar measures by British, American, German and French authorities.

HEADLINE: SENATE APPROVES BAILOUT PROPOSAL BY A WIDE MARGIN

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE; Robert Pear contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Senate strongly endorsed the $700 billion economic bailout plan on Wednesday, leaving backers optimistic that the easy approval, coupled with an array of popular additions, would lead to House acceptance by Friday and end the legislative uncertainty that has rocked the markets.
 In stark contrast to the House rejection of the plan on Monday, a bipartisan coalition of senators -- including both presidential candidates -- showed no hesitation in backing a proposal that had drawn public scorn, though the outpouring eased somewhat after a market plunge followed the House defeat. The Senate margin was 74 to 25 in favor of the White House initiative to buy troubled securities in an effort to avoid an economic catastrophe. 
 Only Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who is being treated for brain cancer, did not vote.
 The two Senate leaders, Senators Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada and the majority leader, and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, strongly urged their colleagues to approve the plan despite the political risk given public resentment. 
 ''Supporting this legislation is the only way to make the best of a crisis and return our country to a path of economic stability, prosperity and growth,'' said Mr. Reid, who asked that senators vote formally from their desks. The presence in the Senate of both presidential candidates in the final weeks of the campaign also gave weight to the moment. The political tension was clear as Senator Barack Obama walked to the Republican side of the aisle to greet Senator John McCain, who offered a chilly look and a brief return handshake.
 Mr. McCain did not make remarks on the legislation. Mr. Obama, in his speech, said the bailout plan was regrettable but necessary and he referred to the stock market drop after the House vote. ''While that decline was devastating, the consequences of the credit crisis that caused it will be even worse if we do not act now,'' he said.
 President Bush issued a statement applauding the Senate for its vote in favor of a bill he called ''essential to the financial security of every American.'' He urged the House to follow suit.
 In the House, officials of both parties said they were increasingly confident that politically enticing provisions bootstrapped to the original bill -- including $150 billion in tax breaks for individuals and businesses -- would win over at least the dozen or so votes needed to reverse Monday's outcome and send the measure to President Bush.
 The stock market reflected nervous jitters over a vote that was to occur after it closed but that could affect the future of many Wall Street workers. The Dow Jones industrial average was off almost 220 points during the day, but recovered to close down just 19.6 points, or 0.2 percent, at 10,831.07.
 Besides the tax breaks, senators also made a change that had drawn widespread support in recent days -- a temporary increase in the amount of bank deposits covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to $250,000 from $100,000. And the entire package was attached to legislation requiring insurers to treat mental health conditions more like general health problems, a long-sought goal of many lawmakers who demanded such parity. 
 As the shape of the new bill became more clear Wednesday, some House Republicans and Democrats indicated that the changes were enough to get them to take another look at the measure and perhaps change their minds -- even though the new items being added would substantially increase the burden on taxpayers. 
 Representative John Yarmuth, a Kentucky Democrat who on Monday voted no, said he found the new proposal more acceptable, as did Representative Jim Ramstad, a retiring Republican from Minnesota who voted in opposition as well.
 ''The inclusion of parity, tax extenders and the F.D.I.C. increases has caused me to reconsider my position,'' Mr. Ramstad said. ''All three additions have greatly improved the bill.'' 
 Leaders of both parties in the House, who spent much of Wednesday on the phone taking the temperature of lawmakers not scheduled to return until Thursday, said they were identifying other potential converts as well, and were finding a more receptive audience for the revised measure because of the tax package and other changes. 
 Some conservative House Republicans and liberal Democrats remained adamantly opposed. ''The bailout legislation that the Senate is sending back to the House is a fraternal twin to the one I voted against on Monday -- meet the new bill, same as the old bill,'' said Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas.
 While popular, the tax breaks, which had been the center of a bitter dispute between House and Senate Democrats, caused problems as well. 
 A coalition of centrist Democrats led by Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader, had refused to back the tax benefits unless they were deficit neutral -- offset by tax increases or spending cuts elsewhere. The bill now includes the Senate version of the tax plan, which adds most of the cost to the deficit over the next decade. 
 But the Senate leaders decided to present the House with a take-it-or-leave-it choice, and it is possible some Democrats could desert the bill over the tactic. Mr. Reid said the Senate would remain in session this week to see how House members react and whether they might attempt to change the bill, forcing another Senate review.
 Mr. Hoyer said he was disappointed in the Senate's decision on the tax breaks and worried it could cost Democratic votes. ''Certainly there are people who are upset we are making the deficit worse as we are trying to stabilize the economy,'' Mr. Hoyer told reporters. But in a telephone conference call among the Democratic leadership Wednesday morning, he told his colleagues he would back the measure because the economic rescue needed to take priority, according to participants.
 In the end, Senate leaders decided to overcome some of the ideological and political resistance that doomed the measure in the House with the tried-and-true Congressional approach of stuffing the bill with provisions that would make it hard for many lawmakers to resist.
 ''All I'm trying to do is get this thing passed,'' said Mr. Reid, denying he was trying to jam the House by giving members no choice but to accept the tax proposal he favored or again reject the bailout.
 The multiple tax breaks, called extenders in the Capitol because they renew or extend expiring tax benefits, appeal to many lawmakers and could provide a political argument for backing a bill that has otherwise been very unpopular. 
 Instead of siding with a $700 billion bailout, lawmakers could now say they voted for increased protection for deposits at the neighborhood bank, income tax relief for middle-class taxpayers and aid for schools in rural areas where the federal government owns much of the land.
 ''This bill has been packaged with a lot of very popular things to give it even more momentum,'' said Senator Jeff Sessions, a Republican from Alabama, who is an opponent.
 The approximately $150 billion in new tax breaks, which offer incentives for the use of renewable energy and relieve 24 million households from an estimated $65 billion alternative-minimum tax scheduled to take effect this year, would be offset by only about $40 billion in spending cuts or tax increases elsewhere. 
 Moreover, the increase in federal deposit insurance will not be financed over the short term, as the insurance program now is, by assessing premiums on banks that benefit. Instead, banks will get an open-ended line of credit directly to the Treasury Department. But the Congressional Budget Office noted that federal law requires the banks to eventually make up any shortfall and any loans to be repaid, though not until at least 2010.
 The changes in the bill were measurable by volume. The initial proposal from the Treasury Department ran just three pages; the latest version exceeds 450.
 After receiving the proposal from Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. almost two weeks ago, Congress instituted a series of changes, including additional oversight, steps to limit home foreclosures and restrictions on the compensation of executives of institutions that take part in the Treasury program. 
 Under pressure to tighten the plan even more, Congressional and administration negotiators decided to parcel out the $700 billion in installments, starting with a first tranche of $350 billion. And during a weekend of negotiations, they added as a final backstop a requirement that in five years the president must present Congress with a plan to make up any losses of tax funds by looking to the financial community to make up the difference.

HEADLINE: Poll Finds Obama Gaining Support and McCain Weakened in Bailout Crisis

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and MEGAN THEE

 BODY:
With the first presidential debate completed and both candidates grappling with the turmoil on Wall Street and in Washington, Senator Barack Obama is showing signs of gaining significant support among voters with less than five weeks left until Election Day, while Senator John McCain's image has been damaged by his response to the financial crisis.
 A CBS News poll released Wednesday found that Mr. Obama's favorability rating, at 48 percent, is the highest it has ever been in polls conducted by CBS and The New York Times. At the same time, the number of voters who hold an unfavorable view of Mr. McCain -- 42 percent -- is as high as it has been since CBS News and The Times began asking the question about Mr. McCain in 1999, the first time he ran for president. 
 The CBS News poll showed that Mr. Obama had a nine-percentage-point lead over Mr. McCain -- 49 percent to 40 percent. It is the first time Mr. Obama has held a statistically significant lead over Mr. McCain this year in polls conducted by CBS or joint polls by CBS and The Times. And a series of polls taken in highly contested states released by other organizations on Tuesday suggested that Mr. Obama was building leads in states including Florida, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
 The CBS News poll found that President Bush had tied the presidential record for a low approval rating -- 22 percent, matching Harry S. Truman's Gallup approval rating in 1952, when the country was mired in the Korean War and struggling with a stagnant economy. That finding put a new premium on Mr. McCain's effort to distance himself from Mr. Bush, and suggests that Mr. Bush will continue to be a prominent figure in the Obama campaign's advertisements attacking Mr. McCain.
 The contest between Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama is far from over. It is being fought against the continued uncertainty over the turmoil on Wall Street and in the bailout negotiations in Washington. There are three potential turning points ahead -- a vice-presidential debate on Thursday night and two more debates between Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama -- and this election has regularly been shaken up by outside events that have tested both candidates and altered voters' views.
 Still, the trends signaled by this new wave of polls -- coming at what both sides view as a critical moment in the contest -- suggest that the contours of this race are taking form, and in a way that is not encouraging for Mr. McCain's prospects.
 The election cycle is entering a time when voters historically begin to make final judgments; this year, in fact, many of them are actually beginning early voting in states. What is more, the poll suggests voters have been guided by how Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama did in their debate last Friday, and also how they have responded to the crisis on Wall Street and the resulting deadlock in Washington about how to respond to it.
 In the CBS News poll, 54 percent of respondents said Mr. Obama had a plan for dealing with the economic crisis, compared with 48 percent who said Mr. McCain did. And 47 percent of respondents said they disapproved of the way Mr. McCain was handling the current economic crisis, compared with 33 percent who approved and 20 percent who said they had no opinion. For Mr. Obama, 32 percent of respondents said they disapproved of his response, compared with 43 percent of respondents who approved; the rest had no opinion.
 And two-thirds of respondents said the highest-profile action Mr. McCain has made in response to the crisis -- announcing that he was suspending his campaign to return to Washington and help negotiators strike a deal -- had made no difference in the outcome of the talks. 
 The CBS News poll suggested one sharp contrast in the view of voters of Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain that might have been fed by the different ways the two men responded to the crisis. Forty-five percent said Mr. McCain acted too quickly when he made a decision, compared with 29 percent who said he did not act quickly enough. For Mr. Obama, 23 percent said he acted too quickly, compared with 41 percent who said he did not act quickly enough.
 The national poll findings by CBS News were echoed in polls released Tuesday by Time magazine and the Pew Research Center. Perhaps more problematic for Mr. McCain were polls, also taken after the debate and in the midst of the financial crisis, suggesting problems for him in critical states, including Florida and Ohio, which President Bush won in 2004 and which Mr. McCain had been confident of holding, and Pennsylvania, a state that Democrats won last time and that Mr. McCain has put on the top of the list of states he has been trying to win. Complete results for all the polls are at nytimes.com/politics.
 Polls by Quinnipiac University, taken Saturday through Monday, showed Mr. Obama ahead in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania. The Time/CNN battleground polls also showed Mr. Obama with a lead in Minnesota and Virginia, a state that has been on the top of the pickup lists for Mr. Obama.
 The CBS News national survey suggested a toxic atmosphere for incumbents in general, but particularly for Republicans. The approval rating for Congress is down to 15 percent, another historic low for the Times/CBS News poll.
 The CBS News poll found economic anxiety among Americans as high as it has ever been in the history of the poll. Nine in 10 Americans said the economy was in very bad or fairly bad shape, the highest measure on that score since The Times and CBS News began asking the question in September 1986. (The percentage who said that the economy was in very good shape was less than 1 percent.) And the number of Americans who thought the economy was getting worse, 76 percent, set another record: the gloomiest Americans have been since the question was first asked in April 1974.
 The CBS News poll, of 1,257 adults, including 1,113 registered voters, was conducted Saturday through Tuesday and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. 
 The polling comes on the eve of the vice-presidential debate between Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, a Republican, and Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, and provides new evidence that Ms. Palin's standing among voters has declined since Mr. McCain chose her as his running mate in August.
 The Pew poll found that 51 percent of respondents said she was not qualified to be president, compared with 37 percent who said she was. That is a reversal from early last month, when 52 percent of respondents said Ms. Palin was qualified to be president.

HEADLINE: 36 Hours of Alarm and Action as Crisis Spiraled

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN, DIANA B. HENRIQUES, EDMUND L. ANDREWS, and JOE NOCERA; Additional reporting was by Jenny Anderson, Nelson D. Schwartz, Eric Dash, Louise Story, Michael M. Grynbaum, Carter Dougherty and Vikas Bajaj.

 BODY:
''Panic can cause a prudent person to do rational things that can contribute to the failure of an institution.'' -- William A. Ackman of the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management.
It was early on Wednesday, Sept. 17, when executives at Pershing Square, Bill Ackman's hedge fund, began getting nervous calls and e-mail messages from investors. Mr. Ackman, 42, has been a top Wall Street player for 15 years, making his clients -- and himself -- billions of dollars.
But now, Mr. Ackman and his colleagues were taken aback by what they were hearing. His big investors were worried about all of the Pershing assets held by Goldman Sachs, the blue-chip investment bank, whose stock had come under siege.
Never mind that Goldman kept Pershing's assets in a segregated account, and that the money was safe. And never mind that Mr. Ackman believed Goldman was the world's best-run investment bank and would come through the credit crisis unscathed. 
Pershing investors still feared their money might be exposed. Mr. Ackman advised Goldman executives to do something to restore confidence -- such as getting an infusion of capital from Warren E. Buffett, the billionaire investor. And while Mr. Ackman kept his assets at Goldman, he hurriedly set up accounts at three other institutions -- just in case things got much worse.
Pershing had more faith than most. Up and down Wall Street, hedge funds with billions of dollars at Goldman and Morgan Stanley, another storied investment bank, were frantically pulling money out and looking for safer havens.
Panic was spreading on two of the scariest days ever in financial markets, and the biggest investors -- not small investors -- were panicking the most. Nobody was sure how much damage it would cause before it ended.
This is what a credit crisis looks like. It's not like a stock market crisis, where the scary plunge of stocks is obvious to all. The credit crisis has played out in places most people can't see. It's banks refusing to lend to other banks -- even though that is one of the most essential functions of the banking system. It's a loss of confidence in seemingly healthy institutions like Morgan Stanley and Goldman -- both of which reported profits even as the pressure was mounting. It is panicked hedge funds pulling out cash. It is frightened investors protecting themselves by buying credit-default swaps -- a financial insurance policy against potential bankruptcy -- at prices 30 times what they normally would pay.
It was this 36-hour period two weeks ago -- from the morning of Wednesday, Sept. 17, to the afternoon of Thursday, Sept. 18 -- that spooked policy makers by opening fissures in the worldwide financial system.
In their rush to do something, and do it fast, the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. concluded the time had come to use the ''break the glass'' rescue plan they had been developing. But in their urgency, they bypassed a crucial step in Washington and fashioned their $700 billion bailout without political spadework, which led to a resounding rejection this past Monday in the House of Representatives.
That Thursday evening, however, time was of the essence. In a hastily convened meeting in the conference room of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, the two men presented, in the starkest terms imaginable, the outline of the $700 billion plan to Congressional leaders. ''If we don't do this,'' Mr. Bernanke said, according to several participants, ''we may not have an economy on Monday.''
Setting the Stage
Wall Street executives and federal officials had known since the previous weekend that it was likely to be a difficult week.
With the government refusing to offer the same financial guarantees that helped save Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, efforts on Saturday to find a buyer for Lehman Brothers had failed.
Sunday was spent preparing to deal with Lehman's bankruptcy, which was announced Monday morning. Merrill Lynch, fearing it would be next, had agreed to be bought by Bank of America. The American International Group was near collapse. (It would be rescued with an $85 billion loan from the Federal Reserve on Tuesday evening.)
With government policy makers appearing to careen from crisis to crisis, the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 504 points on Monday, Sept. 15. Panic was in the air.
At those weekend meetings, Wall Street executives and federal officials talked about the possibility of contagion -- that the Lehman bankruptcy might set off so much fear among investors that the market ''would pivot to the next weakest firm in the herd,'' as one federal official put it.
That firm, everyone knew, was likely to be Morgan Stanley, whose stock had been dropping since the previous Monday, Sept. 8. Within three hours on Tuesday, Sept. 16, Morgan Stanley shares fell another 28 percent, and the rising cost of its credit-default swaps suggested investors were predicting bankruptcy.
To allay the panic, the firm decided to report earnings a day early -- after the market closed Tuesday afternoon instead of Wednesday morning. The profit was terrific -- $1.425 billion, just a 3 percent decline from 2007 -- and the thinking was that would give investors the night to absorb the good news.
''I am hoping that this will generally help calm the market,'' Morgan Stanley's chief financial officer, Colm A. Kelleher, said in an interview late that afternoon. ''These markets are behaving irrationally. There's a lot of fear.''
The Spreading Contagion
But contagion was already spreading. The problem posed by the Lehman bankruptcy was not the losses suffered by hedge funds and other investors who traded stocks or bonds with the firms. As federal officials had predicted, that turned out to be manageable. (That was one reason the government did not step in to save the firm.)
The real problem was that a handful of hedge funds that used the firm's London office to handle their trades had billions of dollars in balances frozen in the bankruptcy.
Diamondback Capital Management, for instance, a $3 billion hedge fund, told its investors that 14.9 percent of its assets were locked up in the Lehman bankruptcy -- money it could not extract. A number of other hedge funds were in the same predicament. (When called for comment, Diamondback officials did not respond.)
As this news spread, every other hedge fund manager had to worry about whether the balances they had at other Wall Street firms might suffer a similar fate. And Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs were the two biggest firms left that served this back-office role. That is why Mr. Ackman's investors were calling him. And that is what caused hedge funds to pull money out of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, hedge their exposure by buying credit-default swaps that would cover losses if either firm couldn't pay money they owed -- or do both.
It was fear, not greed, that was driving everyone's actions.
Breaking the Buck
There was another piece of bad news spooking investors -- and government officials. On Tuesday, the Reserve Primary Fund, a $64 billion money market fund, and two smaller, related funds, revealed that they had ''broken the buck'' and would pay investors no more than 97 cents on the dollar.
Money market funds serve a critical role in greasing the wheels of commerce. They use investors' money to make short-term loans, known as commercial paper, to big corporations like General Motors, I.B.M. and Microsoft. Commercial paper is attractive to money market funds because it pays them a higher interest rate than, say, United States Treasury bills, but is still considered relatively safe.
A run on money funds could force fund managers to shy away from commercial paper, fearing the loans were no longer safe. One reason given by the Reserve Primary Fund for breaking the buck was that it had bought Lehman commercial paper with a face value of $785 million that was now worth little because of its bankruptcy. If money market funds became fearful of buying commercial paper, that would make it far more difficult for companies to raise the cash needed to pay employees, for instance. At that point, it would not just be the credit markets that were frozen, but commerce itself.
Just as important, in the eyes of federal officials, was that money market funds had long been viewed by investors as akin to bank accounts -- a safe place to store cash and earn interest on that money. Despite lacking federal deposit insurance, these funds held $3.4 trillion in assets.
''Breaking the buck was the Rubicon,'' said a federal official. ''This was the first time in the crisis that you could see stories talking about how it was affecting real people.''
Since that Monday, big institutional investors -- like pension funds and college endowments -- had been pulling money out of money funds. On Tuesday, individual investors joined the stampede.
At the Investment Company Institute, the trade group for the mutual fund industry, executives had organized a conference call that week with top-level fund executives and government officials.
''We were saying to Treasury and the Fed, at a very high level: Pay attention to this issue. This will have an impact,'' recalled Greg Ahern, the group's chief communication officer.
But government officials monitoring the crisis did not need the warning. They were already watching money fund outflows with alarm.
Surprisingly, stock investors -- feeling better because of the government's A.I.G. rescue plan -- either did not comprehend or ignored the growing chaos in credit markets; the Dow actually rose 141.51 points on Tuesday.
A Dark Day
The respite was brief. Wednesday, Sept. 17, was one of those dark, ugly market days that offers not even a glimmer of hope.
Fearing the worst, Alex Ehrlich, the global head of prime services at the Swiss bank UBS, arrived at work in New York at 5 a.m. and immediately started putting out fires. Because he ran the firm's prime brokerage unit, clients were calling to see whether their money was safe.
''We were being flooded with client requests to move positions, and the funding markets, which are critically important to prime brokers, were extremely volatile,'' he said.
Within seconds of the market opening, the Dow was down 160 points. Among the big losers was Morgan Stanley. Despite the strong earnings it had disclosed late Tuesday, its stock continued to plummet. By noon, the Dow was down 330 points. It rallied in the afternoon, but went into free fall in the last 45 minutes, closing down 449 points.
And that was just what investors could see. Behind the scenes, the credit markets had almost completely frozen up. Banks were refusing to lend to other banks, and spreads on credit default swaps on financial stocks -- the price of insuring against bankruptcy -- veered into uncharted waters.
Moreover, the drain on money funds continued. By the end of business on Wednesday, institutional investors had withdrawn more than $290 billion from money market funds. In what experts call a ''flight to safety,'' investors were taking money out of stocks and bonds and even money market funds and buying the safest investments in the world: Treasury bills. As a result, yields on short-term Treasury bills dropped close to zero. That was almost unheard of.
In the stock market, Mr. Ehrlich of UBS was horrified by the plunge of Morgan Stanley's shares, given the stellar earnings. ''It felt like there was no ground beneath your feet,'' he said. ''I didn't know where it was going to end.''
A Chief Executive's Anger
Neither did Morgan Stanley's chief executive, John J. Mack. A week before, his firm's stock was trading in the mid-40s. On Wednesday, it fell from $28.70 a share to $21.75 -- down about 50 percent over a week.
''There is no rational basis for the movements in our stock or credit default spreads,'' Mr. Mack wrote in a companywide memo on Wednesday. Mr. Mack lashed out at the people he felt were responsible for Morgan Stanley's woes: the short-sellers, who profit by betting that a stock will fall.
Like most Wall Street firms, Morgan Stanley over the years had handled transactions for short-sellers, despite complaints by other companies that short-sellers unfairly ganged up on their stock. Nevertheless, Mr. Mack called Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Christopher Cox, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, pressing them to ban short-selling.
He raged about what he viewed as a concerted effort to drive down the firm's stock. ''He got emotional,'' says one person who knows him well.
Meeting with staff members Thursday morning as the stock plunged further -- hitting a low of $11.70 midday -- Mr. Mack said: ''Listen. I know everybody is anxious about the stock price. I'm not selling any shares, and neither is my team. But I understand if you're nervous and want to sell some shares.'' Some did. (The company said fewer than one-third of employees sold stock that day.)
At the same time, Mr. Mack began talks to merge with Wachovia, and called other banks about possible combinations. He also called Mr. Buffett for advice, while aides in Tokyo contacted Mitsubishi UFJ, Japan's biggest lender, hoping to raise additional capital.
Run on a Fund
Even as stocks tanked, turmoil was worsening in money markets. On Wednesday evening, Paul Schott Stevens, the head of the Investment Company Institute, learned about a problem with another money fund. ''This time it was Putnam,'' recalled Mr. Stevens, referring to the Boston-based mutual fund company Putnam Investments.
Out of the blue, it seemed, there was a run on the $12.3 billion Putnam Prime Money Market Fund. That meant the money fund contagion was spreading. Because of huge withdrawals, Putnam decided it had to shut the fund, and distribute the cash to shareholders. If it did not, the first ones out the door would get a better deal than the laggards.
Executives of the Investment Company Institute and fund officials scrambled to find a solution that would keep Putnam from having to take that step, but they failed. On Thursday, Putnam shuttered the fund. (After the government rescue plan was announced, it sold the fund, intact, to another company, and investors did not lose a penny.)
The Fed Takes Action
Ben Bernanke had spent his career studying financial crises. His first important work as an economist had been a study of the events that led to the Great Depression. Along with several economists, he came up with a phrase, ''the financial accelerator,'' which described how deteriorating market conditions could speed until they became unmanageable.
To an alarming degree, the credit crisis had played out as his academic work predicted. But his research also led Mr. Bernanke to the view that ''situations where crises have really spiraled out of control are where the central bank has been on the sideline,'' according to Mark Gertler, a New York University economist who has collaborated with Mr. Bernanke on some papers.
Mr. Bernanke had no intention of keeping the Fed on the sidelines. As the crisis deepened, it took more aggressive steps. It added liquidity to the system. It opened the discount window -- the emergency lending facility that had been reserved for troubled banks -- to investment banks. It also agreed to absorb up to $29 billion in Bear Stearns losses and made an $85 billion loan to keep A.I.G. afloat.
Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who leads the House Financial Services Committee, asked Mr. Bernanke if the Fed had $85 billion to spare. ''We have $800 billion,'' Mr. Bernanke replied, according to Mr. Frank.
Since the Bear Stearns bailout, Treasury and Fed officials had discussed what a broad government intervention might look like. Although there were suggestions for a ''bank holiday'' -- a temporary, nationwide closing of banks, which had not been done since 1933, to stem panicky withdrawals -- Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Paulson dismissed the idea, fearing it would do far more harm than good by scaring people needlessly. They had both assembled teams to map out drastic rescue plans -- the ''break the glass'' plans.
Almost from the start, they concluded the best systemic solution was to buy hard-to-sell mortgage-backed securities.
On Wednesday morning, during a conference call with other top officials, including Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, Mr. Bernanke sounded them out on a big government bailout. The other officials sounded relieved; their main questions were about whether Congress could act quickly.
That evening, Mr. Bernanke told Mr. Paulson during a conference call: ''You have to go to Congress. This is pervasive.'' Mr. Paulson agreed.
A Sense of Urgency
By Thursday morning, the need for dramatic action had grown even more urgent.
In Asia, stocks had already closed lower. To quell fears before the opening of European markets, the Fed and other central banks announced they would make $180 billion available, in an effort to get banks to start lending to each other again. The Fed had agreed to open its discount window to make loans available to money market funds to prevent further runs.
But it was to little avail.
At 8:30 Thursday morning in the United States, when Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke reviewed the state of affairs, markets remained roiled. The crisis was not easing up.
One Bank's Solution
Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman Sachs's chief executive, had arrived at the firm's office on 85 Broad Street just before 7 a.m. Thursday, anticipating another bad day. The investment bank's stock had already been pummeled. From nearly $250 a share last October, it had fallen to $114.50 on Wednesday -- after hitting a low of $97.78 that day.
One idea he had been exploring was to transform Goldman into a bank holding company. Mr. Mack, meantime, was also considering such a move for Morgan Stanley, and both were in separate discussions with the Fed. There was safety in that notion -- they would become depository institutions regulated by the Fed and others -- though it also meant they would not be able to pile on as much debt as they had as investment banks. That would hurt profits. But now profits were less pressing than survival. Mr. Blankfein accelerated the planning.
By 1 p.m., the Dow had fallen another 150 points -- meaning that in a day and a half it was down nearly 600 points. Goldman's stock dropped to $85.88, its lowest in nearly six years.
Just then, a prankster piped ''The Star-Spangled Banner'' over the firm's loudspeaker system on the 50th floor. Fixed-income traders stopped and stood at attention, some with hands on their hearts. Oddly, it was at precisely that moment that the market -- and Goldman's shares -- started to rise.
The traders began to cheer.
Curbing Short-Selling
What happened? At 1 p.m. New York time, the Financial Services Authority in Britain, which regulates that nation's financial institutions, announced a ban on short-selling of 29 financial stocks that would last at least 30 days.
''When I saw that, I knew we were about to have the mother of all short squeezes,'' said one hedge fund manager. Realizing that the S.E.C. was likely to follow suit, hedge funds began ''covering their shorts'' -- that is, buying the stocks they had borrowed to short, even if it meant taking a loss.
That caused all kinds of stocks to begin rising. Sure enough, the S.E.C. followed suit the next day, placing a temporary short-selling ban on 799 financial stocks.
A few hours later came the second event. At 3:01 CNBC reported the Treasury and the Fed were planning a giant fund to buy toxic mortgage-backed assets from financial institutions. Though there had been hints of this earlier in the afternoon, and stocks had started rising around 2:30, the wide dissemination set off a huge rally. In a 45-minute burst, the Dow gained another 300 points, closing the day up 410 points.
Meeting on Capitol Hill
Two hours later, Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke trooped up to Capitol Hill for a somber session with Congressional leaders. ''That meeting was one of the most astounding experiences I've had in my 34 years in politics,'' Senator Schumer recalled.
As the members of Congress and their aides listened, the two laid out their plan. They would begin offering federal insurance to money market funds immediately, in order to stop the run on money funds.
In addition, the S.E.C. would institute a ban on short-selling of financial stocks. Although Treasury officials concede that the move was mostly symbolic -- investors can still buy put options that have the same effect as shorting stocks -- they did it mainly ''to scare the hell out of everybody,'' as one official put it.
After Mr. Bernanke made his remark about the possibility that there might not be an economy on Monday without this plan, you could hear a pin drop.
''I gulped,'' Mr. Schumer said.
Congressional leaders were nearly unanimous in saying that it needed to be done for the good of the country. Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio -- the Republican House leader who a week later would lead the revolt against the plan -- said it was time to put politics aside and move quickly, according to several participants. (An aide to Mr. Boehner denied that he voiced support for the plan, only that he made a plea for cooperation.)
Hearing that Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Paulson wanted legislation passed in a matter of days, the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, expressed astonishment. ''This is the United States Senate,'' he said. ''We can't do it in that time frame.'' His Republican counterpart, Senator Mitch McConnell, replied, ''This time we can.''
He was wrong. After a week of wrangling, political infighting and compromise, the House on Monday voted down the legislation. The Dow plunged nearly 778 points, and credit markets had worsened, with interest rates rising and loans becoming harder to obtain.
Two weeks after Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke made their appeal, the House is likely to try again.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg's Stewardship Is Mixed, Fiscal Experts Say

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN and MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
It promises to be the centerpiece of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's quest to revise term limits and seek a third term: the claim that the billionaire businessman is a skilled steward of New York City's $500 billion economy and the ideal leader to navigate it through the unfolding financial crisis.
In interviews, more than a dozen government officials and independent economic experts credit Mr. Bloomberg for deft short-term financial management, especially in times of crisis, and for possessing the courage to raise unpopular taxes to balance budgets
He entered office in 2002, only months after 9/11, and enforced an austere first budget, rejecting planned city projects and bluntly telling the public that there was little money to spend and many sacrifices to make. 
He raised property taxes when he felt he had to, enduring a beating in opinion polls as a result. And he scaled back the city's spending plans a year before the full dimensions of the damage done by Wall Street's current troubles became known.
Of course, managing the occasional budget shortfall is only one challenge among many for any mayor trying to responsibly oversee the economic life of a city of more than 8 million, one with a municipal workforce of 300,000.
And it is Mr. Bloomberg's handling of the city's bigger, longer-term financial issues that has provoked some disappointment among experts and others.
The mayor, they say, has failed to control the city's growing pension and health care costs, and has allowed overall city spending to increase significantly. Those costs, they argue, will contribute to gaping budget deficits starting next year.
So now, as Mr. Bloomberg prepares to announce on Thursday his plans to seek re-election, he may well be volunteering for the ultimate test of his financial skills -- managing New York City in the middle of a global financial crisis and in the face of some potential fiscal problems he may well have contributed to himself.
''I would say it's a bigger economic challenge for him than Sept. 11,'' said John Tepper Marlin, chief economist for the New York City comptroller's office from 1992 to 2006.
''It's not just New York City -- it's a whole system in trouble. Yet it's our residents and our workers who will be affected.''
Drawing conclusions about an elected official's true impact on the performance of a vast economy has always been difficult, and attempts to do so have given rise to endless debate (the credit to be given Bill Clinton for the country's economic health in the 1990s still provokes one of those debates.)
And it is clear the setbacks and successes of the New York economy under Mr. Bloomberg owe to much that is beyond his direct control.
For their part, members of Mr. Bloomberg's staff say the administration has successfully limited the growth of spending by city agencies to 4 percent a year, a figure that they said approximates the rate of inflation.
But they do acknowledge that costs for health care and pensions have risen at a faster rate, although they argue that they have little or no control over those kinds of costs.
For example, since 2002, the year Mr. Bloomberg took office, the city's pension costs have surged by 318 percent, health care costs by 46 percent and Medicaid costs by 55 percent, staff members said.
Edward Skyler, the deputy mayor for operations, said the administration has worked to hold down those costs where possible. He said Mr. Bloomberg has fought back efforts in the State Legislature to increase pension costs and is in negotiations with unions to contain health care costs.
''Since 2002, not only has Mayor Bloomberg restrained agency spending to essentially the rate of inflation, he has done what he can to rein in mandated costs for health insurance, Medicaid and pensions,'' Mr. Skyler said.
Budget experts, however, assert that Mr. Bloomberg has chosen not to forcefully confront the matter of pension costs.
The issue has bedeviled many New York mayors because, under New York State law, it is impossible to roll back the size of the pensions promised to current city employees. Yet Mr. Bloomberg could propose legislation allowing the city to cut back the pensions of new employees -- an approach he took in the first term but has largely abandoned in the second.
Aides to the mayor said there was no appetite for such a change in Albany, where lawmakers have tried repeatedly to increase pension spending rather than restrain it.
''The political climate over the last few years has forced us to spend whatever clout we have on preventing pension sweeteners that Albany passes and that we pay for instead of pushing for real pension reform,'' Mr. Skyler said.
Some budget experts said another aspect of Mr. Bloomberg's stewardship of the city's finances had caused concerns: the recent contracts he has negotiated with the city's teachers and police officers that could become problematic as the city enters tough economic times.
In 2007, the administration settled a retroactive contract with the police sergeants' union that increased their pay by 27.5 percent over six years. The administration also struck a deal to raise the wages of sanitation workers by 17 percent over four and a half years.
This year, it settled a contract with the city's largest police union that granted a 17 percent pay raise over four years.
Mr. Bloomberg has characterized these pay increases as smart investments that make city jobs competitive with those in surrounding suburbs.
But Jeffrey L. Sommer, the executive director of the New York State Financial Control Board, said that many of them represent ''missed opportunities'' to hold down or cut costs.
One area that has incensed fiscal conservatives is the city's growing debt.
Thanks to school construction and other projects requiring substantial borrowing, debt payments are projected to increase by more than $2 billion by 2012, according to the New York State Financial Control Board, an agency created by the state after the 1975 fiscal crisis to monitor the city's finances.
And a growing portion of that debt is variable rate, meaning that the city's costs could rise as the market fluctuates.
''One of the main challenges is the high and growing debt load,'' said Nicole Gelinas, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. ''It's clear that it's going up in an unsustainable fashion.''
The bond rating agencies are not perturbed, at least not yet. The city's bond rating is now at its highest level ever -- AA -- and the last time it was downgraded was 1995, said Robin Prunty, senior director in Standard & Poor's public finance department, who analyzes New York City's budget.
The mayor has elicited considerable praise for resisting calls by City Council members and special interest groups to spend surplus revenues during the boom years on new and existing programs.
Mr. Bloomberg has chosen instead to pay down some future debts.
Mr. Bloomberg has, for example, pumped $2 billion into an unusual trust fund to pay off future health care costs for city employees, earning praise from financial watchdog groups.
''The mayor has generally been a pragmatic, prudent fiscal manager, and non-ideological from the get-go,'' said Doug Turetsky, chief of staff at the city's nonpartisan Independent Budget Office, which receives city funding but does not report to the mayor.
But now that the economy is struggling, Mr. Sommer of the State Financial Control Board said it was becoming clear that the mayor's strategy of using surpluses to pay for future expenses helped ''mask structural deficits.''
Mr. Bloomberg's larger-than-life reputation in the business world -- he turned a $10 million severance check from Salomon Brothers into a multibillion-dollar financial data company -- has undoubtedly proved to be a benefit, too.
Mr. Tepper Marlin said that after Sept. 11, Mr. Bloomberg was able to persuade many businesses that had flirted with relocating to New Jersey to remain in New York City.
''It's good to have people as your ambassadors who are like the people you are trying to attract,'' he said. ''They speak Bloomberg's language. They want to hear it from somebody who has been there. That counts for a lot in the business world.''

HEADLINE: Senate Approves Indian Nuclear Deal

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The United States opened a new chapter of cooperation with India on Wednesday night as Congress gave final approval to a breakthrough agreement permitting civilian nuclear trade between the two countries for the first time in three decades.
 The Senate ratified the deal 86 to 13 a week after the House passed it, handing a rare foreign policy victory to President Bush in the twilight of his administration and culminating a three-year debate that raised alarms about a new arms race and nearly toppled the government of India.
 The agreement, in the view of its authors, will redefine relations between two countries often at odds during the cold war and build up India as a friendly counterweight to a rising China. But critics complain that it effectively scraps longstanding policies designed to curb the spread of nuclear weapons and that it could encourage nations like Pakistan, Iran and North Korea to accelerate their own programs outside international legal structures. 
 Under the terms of the deal, the United States will now be able to sell nuclear fuel, technology and reactors to India for peaceful energy use despite the fact that New Delhi tested bombs in 1974 and 1998 and never signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. In exchange, India agreed to open up 14 civilian nuclear facilities to international inspection, but would continue to shield eight military reactors from outside scrutiny.
 ''The national security and economic future of the United States will be enhanced by a strong and enduring partnership with India,'' Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, the ranking Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, said in the Senate debate on Wednesday. ''With a well-educated overall middle class that is larger than the entire United States population, India can be an anchor of stability in Asia and an engine of economic growth.''
 Senator Byron Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, called the deal a ''grievous mistake'' that would reward rogue behavior. ''We have said to India with this agreement: 'You can misuse American nuclear technology and secretly develop nuclear weapons.' That's what they did. 'You can test these weapons.' That's what they did,'' Mr. Dorgan said.
 He added: ''And after testing, 10 years later, all will be forgiven.''
 Mr. Dorgan and Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, tried to amend the agreement to explicitly require the United States to cut off nuclear trade if India conducted a new nuclear test. The agreement's backers defeated the proposal, arguing that it was unnecessary and that nuclear trade would be halted in such a situation.
 Mr. Bush has been pursuing the agreement since 2005 and his advisers have called closer relations between the United States and India a key part of his foreign policy legacy. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India, visiting Mr. Bush at the White House last week, endorsed that view. ''When history is written,'' he said, ''I think it will be recorded that President George W. Bush made an historic goal in bringing our two democracies closer to each other.''
 But the nuclear accord has proved even more controversial at home for Mr. Singh than for Mr. Bush. Opposition parties have tried to bring down Mr. Singh's government and the Communist Party dropped out of his governing coalition in protest of the deal, but he survived a confidence vote. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice heads this week to New Delhi to mark the success of their nuclear negotiations.
 For India, the pact signals the end of 34 years of isolation among nuclear powers -- what the New Delhi government calls ''nuclear apartheid.'' The United States last month convinced the Nuclear Suppliers Group, a consortium of 45 nations that Washington formed in response to the Indian test in 1974, to lift longstanding restrictions on nuclear trade with India. France and Russia are eager to bid for India's business.
 The United States-India Business Council, which promoted the deal, estimates that India may spend as much as $175 billion over the next quarter century expanding its nuclear industry to cope with rising energy demands. Companies like General Electric, Westinghouse and Bechtel will now be able to compete for contracts.
 ''This is one of those historic, important, tectonic shifts in relations with another country,'' said Ron Somers, the council's president. ''This is a country we need to be partnering with and I would argue will be shaping the destiny of the 21st century.'' Michael Krepon, co-founder of the Henry L. Stimson Center, a research organization in Washington, called the promise of big dollars and American jobs ''pure fantasy'' and predicted that the United States would regret further opening the nuclear door.
 ''There will be a reckoning for this agreement,'' he said. ''You can argue till you're blue in the face that India is a special case. But what happens in one country affects what happens in others.''

HEADLINE: At Issue: Bloomberg and Term Limits

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Mayor Expected to Seek 3rd Term, Rejecting Limits'' (front page, Oct. 1):
 I would like to see Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg serve a third term as much as the next fellow, especially since there seems to be a dearth of credible replacement candidates on the horizon.
 That said, there is the tricky issue concerning the ''rule of law.'' 
 Term limits were enacted by way of the ballot box. The repeal of term limits, perhaps only for the executive, should also rightly be decided at the ballot box. 
 Rather than try to shove the repeal of term limits down the throat of the citizenry through a back door by way of the City Council, what should done by proponents of this measure is to call for a special election only for this issue. Naturally, the cost for this special election will be borne by those who call for it. That seems fair and doable since the election is not for over a year. 
 Going the City Council route will certainly lead to litigation, resentment and accusations of imperiousness. It would be better to achieve this goal legitimately. Michael Goldman
 East Rockaway, N.Y., Oct. 1, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Re ''The Limits of Term Limits'' (editorial, Oct. 1):
 Your editorial about term limits was unconvincing in at least three ways:
 First, any such law would be obvious self-dealing by the mayor and the City Council. They are not disinterested parties acting only in the public interest since they are possibly extending their careers by enacting such a law. 
 It was the mayor himself who chose to ignore the far better solution of putting it on the ballot for a 2008 referendum.
 Second, Bloomberg allies are arguing that the current economic crisis justifies this extraordinary remedy. But isn't that more an after-the-fact alibi rather than a real argument? 
 This week's national ''crisis'' will largely be politically resolved by national legislation shortly. By 2010, the only serious issue for the next mayor will be budgetary -- and whoever serves in 2010-13 will have an Office of Management and Budget doing necessary belt-tightening. Neither Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg nor Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. are indispensable men.
 Third, your editorial doesn't mention why the election in 2009 is inadequate voter ratification. For Mr. Bloomberg's likely $100 million-plus campaign treasury would in reality mean that an undemocratic power grab in 2008 would be ratified by an undemocratic election in 2009.
 If the mayor insists on going ahead with a law vetoing voters, will he at least have the courage to opt in to the public finance system and run on his substantial record rather than on his bank account? Mark Green
 New York, Oct. 1, 2008
 The writer was public advocate for New York City, 1994-2001, and lost the mayoral election to Michael R. Bloomberg in 2001.
 To the Editor:
 I am a lifelong New Yorker who voted for term limits with enthusiasm. I am one of the majority who approved them. Nothing could be a clearer expression of the democratic will of the people.
 Reading your editorial, which supports nullification of our votes, you must imagine that we voters are children needing parental guidance. I often hear voters express that we have little real choice. We often vote for the ''lesser of two evils.'' The term limits issue is unusual in that it was broadly and enthusiastically supported by the people at the ballot box. It was a pleasure to vote for it.
 It would be disgusting to permit City Council members to overturn it because they are self-interested. Overturning term limits may permit Council members to keep their salaries and perks and power and broaden their personal opportunities.
 To quote Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in the past, any attempt by self-interested government officials to overturn our vote is ''disgusting.'' Your not liking our vote is your privilege; nullifying our vote should not be anyone's privilege. Michael Stepper
 New York, Oct. 1, 2008
 To the Editor: 
 I agree with you that term limits should be reconsidered, and I'd remind people that what we used to use for term limits we once called ''elections.'' 
 While incumbency confers some advantage, it can always be trumped in an election by the supporters of a more competent candidate.
 Term limits seem like a stereotyping problem: a given politician has been in office forever and repeatedly demonstrates how out of touch she or he is; therefore, they're all incompetent, so let's limit their terms to get that one out of office. 
 This does not seem like an intelligent way to run a railroad or anything else.
 Michael John Martin
 San Francisco, Oct. 1, 2008
 To the Editor: 
 I agree with everything you said about term limits, with one exception: to show how disinterested they are, the politicians now in office should repeal term limits but make the vote apply only to those not now serving.
 Bill Halsey
 New York, Oct. 1, 2008
 To the Editor:
 I was never in favor of the term limits law, and I am not in favor of it now. It is, however, the law.
 Bad laws should be changed, but only in a manner that is respectful of basic principles of law. Having the term limits law amended in the manner you suggest -- by the current members of the City Council, who will materially and personally benefit from the amendment -- does not meet that basic test.
 After 9/11, some people thought that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani was irreplaceable, that he should stay on as mayor beyond the end of his term despite the law. Mayor Giuliani was not irreplaceable after 9/11, and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is not irreplaceable now.
 What is irreplaceable is our commitment to our basic principles. If this bad law is amended in the manner you suggest, we will live to regret that departure from our principles.

HEADLINE: In San Francisco, Subtle Variations in Voters' Politics

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Looking out at the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge from his perch at the Ferry Terminal here, where he stood gossiping in the fading light with a colleague, Michael Stauckas explained how a lifelong Democrat living in the nation's most-easily-reduced-to-a-political-cartoon city comes to even consider voting for Senator John McCain, a Republican, for president.
''I am obviously not happy about my 401(k) being down 20 percent,'' said Mr. Stauckas, 37. ''I'm a Democrat and I've been for Obama but I do have to say with what is occurring with the economy, I'm a little worried now about his inexperience. I'm on the fence.'' 
Campaign consultants often reduce the country's electoral map to Big Mac eaters versus arugula lovers, ''Two and a Half Men'' viewers versus ''30 Rock'' watchers, hockey fans versus the sort of people who visit enotecas, but those conventions generally fail to hold up after conversations with voters, even those who identify strongly with one political party.
Nearly half of the American electoral map is up for grabs in November as many voters, often hailing from places that have been traditionally placed into ideological boxes, are sifting through a complicated set of regional, national and global issues, in a nation that in many ways looks very different from the one the presidential candidates traversed in 2004. While no one is predicting that San Francisco will do anything but vote overwhelmingly for Mr. McCain's Democratic opponent, Senator Barack Obama, demographic shifts since the last presidential election have altered the electoral ground in many parts of the country.
A number of previously reliably red states -- particularly in the West -- are shading more blue. Independent voters have gained in numbers over party loyalists in many states.
Young people and immigrants have replaced older, native-born voters in fast-growing regions -- sometimes in remarkable numbers -- and there are far more eligible voters among Hispanics than just four years ago. Middle-class blacks have returned to the South, and baby boomers are aging in large voting blocs throughout the Midwest.
The terrifying gyrations on Wall Street have made the inner conflict of many voters -- with no clear consensus on whether Mr. McCain, of Arizona, or Mr. Obama, of Illinois, would make things better -- all the more stark.
''We are a vastly different nation in some key states from the last election,'' said William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution.
Here in San Francisco, the western terminus of Interstate 80, is the edge of the continental United States, and, as many believe, the fringe of its professed values. Voters are long accustomed to serving as the bat with which many Republicans use their city to beat up on the Democratic Party. In large part, they wear with pride their reputation for being collectively unreasonable and unshaven.
But often invisible among the Silicon Valley fund-raisers, the Code Pink demonstrations and the seminude pageants -- did you catch last Sunday's ''leather/fetish'' street fair complete with acts of public sex? -- are voters who, while largely Democrats, represent the shades, ever so slightly, of political diversity.
A walk through the streets here, talking with people as they go about their daily routine, reveals an anxiety about the state of the economy that has gripped most of the nation. One axiom emerging from the first day of this exercise: Worrying about one's bank account -- and trashing elected officials -- in tumultuous times has no partisan claim.
Ideological lines are not always finely drawn along the road to social policy, either. There is the banker who embraces same-sex marriage but sides with Republicans when it comes to the subject of a federal bailout of banks. Or the restaurant owner who would gladly pay more taxes to put up green municipal buildings, but has complex reactions to universal health care for employees he can barely afford to pay. Or Joel Muchmore, a lawyer, who embraces this city's liberal social policies, but does not want them extended to national security.
''It's frustrating to live in a city where everyone assumes that because you share airspace you also share political views,'' Mr. Muchmore, 37, said. ''I believe that, socially, San Francisco is at the vanguard of where the country should be going. But it is impossible to have an intelligent conversation here that acknowledges the possibility that there are some good things that came out of the war with Iraq.''
Like those of their neighbors in some more conservative areas near this city, the political proclivities of San Franciscans stem as much from the city's historical role as a landing place for pioneers and Gold Rush fortune-seekers as they do from a natural proclivity to simply be wacky.
It is also true that the city's edgy policies of today often become the template for mainstream public policy of tomorrow. Its early acceptance of domestic partnership benefits has been extended to cities across the nation. San Francisco recently became the first city to ban plastic bags, something other cities are now emulating. Its citywide universal health care program is also under examination elsewhere.
''I think the identity for our city is that we are a place where ideas can be expressed,'' said Steve Rossi Jr., clutching his bags of bakery bread at the Ferry Terminal Market.
Next stop: about 500 miles east of here in rural Nevada.
Road to November: San Francisco: In the coming weeks, journalists for The New York Times will traverse the country from the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco to the George Washington Bridge in New York, chatting with voters about the presidential campaign. The 2,900-mile route will pass through hotly contested swing states, as well as places where the candidates have not set foot for months. The journey will be largely by car along Interstate 80, with a flight now and then. It will be recorded in articles in the newspaper, and online, on postings on the Caucus blog, Web videos and slide shows:

HEADLINE: Moderator's Planned Book Becomes a Topic of Debate

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
In mid-August, shortly after the Commission on Presidential Debates named Gwen Ifill of PBS as a moderator of the coming vice-presidential event, she wrote an essay in Time magazine that identified her as the author of a coming book, ''The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama.''
 A couple of weeks later, an article in The Washington Post about her moderating duties described the book as focusing on ''the Democratic nominee and such up-and-coming black politicians as Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and Newark Mayor Cory Booker.''
 But on the eve of the debate, Ms. Ifill and her book became the fresh object of outrage on conservative talk radio, blogs and cable news after a right-leaning Web site, WND.com, posted an article late Tuesday with the headline, ''VP debate moderator Ifill releasing pro-Obama book.'' 
 The expressions of shock that met the headline were almost instantaneous, starting with the Drudge Report, which devoted a huge two-line headline to the article: ''VP Debate Moderator Releasing 'Age Of Obama' Book On Inauguration Day.''
 ''Let's get real here. What would journalists say if in 2004 Jim Lehrer wrote a book called 'Breakthrough, the age of Bush?' '' Joe Scarborough, the former Republican congressman and now MSNBC host, asked rhetorically on Wednesday morning. 
 ''Nonpartisan my foot,'' Michelle Malkin, the syndicated conservative columnist, wrote online. 
 Bill Hemmer, the Fox News anchor, questioned how Ms. Ifill could fairly moderate the debate as the author of a book he described as including ''a glowing profile'' of Mr. Obama. In an online ''GretaWire,'' the Fox News host Greta Van Susteren wrote, ''I am stunned.'' She added, ''In law, this would create a mistrial.'' 
 Senator John McCain of Arizona chimed in himself on Wednesday, saying he was confident Ms. Ifill would do ''a totally objective job,'' though he added, ''Does this help that if she has written a book that's favorable to Senator Obama? Probably not.''
 Ms. Ifill's authorship of a book that delves into the career of Mr. Obama, of Illinois, has raised some concern among independent media analysts, who cited potential appearances of conflict of interest. 
 But some Democratic strategists -- and even one former adviser to Mr. McCain -- describe the right-wing criticism as an effort to warn Ms. Ifill away from tough questioning of Ms. Palin (or to pre-emptively undermine Ms. Ifill's credibility in the event Ms. Palin turns in a bad performance).
 In an interview, Ms. Ifill said that she began writing the book, about the new generation of post-civil-rights-era black leaders, in spring 2007, long before Mr. Obama seemed likely to win the Democratic nomination. She said she had yet to write the chapter she plans to devote to Mr. Obama and argued with descriptions of her book as ''pro-Obama.''
 ''Since I haven't finished the book, it's interesting people think they know what's in it,'' she said.
 With the criticism, Ms. Ifill joined legion with many of her fellow debate moderators this year, whose motives and views have been widely questioned before their events -- when they are formulating their questions -- and after them, when partisans on both sides seek to cast the results in the most favorable terms possible for their candidates. 
 Though moderators face questions over their personal views and motives in every campaign, this year's debate over the debate officiators has been unusually intense, perhaps a natural result of such a hard-fought and close election. Other moderators who have been excoriated by viewers and partisans include Tim Russert, Brian Williams and Chris Matthews of NBC News and George Stephanopoulos and Charles Gibson of ABC News.
 But the debate surrounding Ms. Ifill was heated, even by this year's standards, coming before what both sides have come to view as a crucial test for Governor Palin, who has turned in uneven performances in several highly watched interviews.
 Ms. Ifill came under scrutiny shortly after Mr. McCain named Ms. Palin as his running mate. Michael Getler, the PBS ombudsman, reported receiving letters from viewers who wrote they believed Ms. Ifill's facial expressions while reporting on Ms. Palin's convention speech betrayed ''disgust.'' 
 Noting that Ms. Ifill had, in fact, reported delegates ''exploded with excitement'' in reaction to her speech, and ''couldn't have been happier,'' Mr. Getler concluded that Ms. Ifill had turned in a ''solid'' performance. 
 The original article in World Net Daily highlighted the letters -- though not Mr. Getler's defense of Ms. Ifill -- as well as complaints from conservatives four years ago, when she was the moderator of the debate between Vice President Dick Cheney and John Edwards, the former North Carolina senator who was Senator John Kerry's running mate. 
 During that debate, when Mr. Cheney had told her that he would need more than his allotted 30 seconds to respond to an accusation from Mr. Edwards regarding his former company, Halliburton, Ms. Ifill had said, ''Well, that's all you've got.''
 In an interview on Wednesday, Mary Matalin, a longtime adviser to Mr. Cheney, said of Ms. Ifill, ''I do think she's fair.'' 
 But, she said, given what she said was the well-earned distrust of the news media, especially among conservatives, ''In this emotional climate, more care should have been taken to eliminate any aggravating factor.'' 
 Kelly McBride, head of the ethics department at Poynter Institute, a journalism training center in Florida, said, ''Obviously the book will be much more valuable to her if Obama is elected.'' Still, she said, ''I don't necessarily see an absolute conflict of interest, it's not like it's his biography.''
 Bob Shrum, a Democratic strategist, accused conservatives of pushing the issue to make Ms. Ifill think twice while addressing Ms. Palin during the debate. ''I just think they're trying to build every shield they can in case it doesn't go well,'' he said.
 Ms. Ifill, a former reporter for The New York Times, said she was tuning it out. ''I have to let people judge me by my work,'' she said.
 But she found a defender in John Weaver, a former adviser to Mr. McCain, who warned the senator's supporters away from focusing on Ms. Ifill. ''All of this hand-wringing, excuse-making and whining keeps McCain's economic recovery plan away from the public,'' he said. ''Gwen Ifill is as honorable and fair a journalist as there is, and all of us in our business know that.''

HEADLINE: Questions for the Next Vice President

BYLINE: By CRAIG FULLER, ANDREW SULLIVAN, RADLEY BALKO, MIKE DOOGAN, JEFFREY GOLDBERG, JACK F. MATLOCK Jr. , GENE HEALY, PETER MAASS, PETER W. GALBRAITH, ERIC WASSERSTROM, and RACHEL KLEINFELD

 BODY:
EDITORS' NOTE APPENDED
Tonight, Senator Joe Biden of Delaware and Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska will meet in the one and only vice presidential debate of the 2008 campaign. The Op-Ed editors asked people with knowledge of the vice presidency, the candidates and their records to suggest questions they'd like to hear answered from the stage at Washington University in St. Louis this evening.
It is 9 a.m., and the president is traveling abroad. A terrorist attack on the United States occurs. You have 10 minutes to prepare to move to the now famous bunker at the White House to deal with the incident. Whom will you take with you into the bunker? And, once there, what do you do in the first hour?
You hear all the arguments presented to the president concerning a decision he must make regarding spending for a major national program. The recommendation from the cabinet and staff is clear, but you disagree with them strongly. How and where do you express yourself, assuming you elect to share your views with the president? 
-- CRAIG FULLER, the chief of staff for Vice President George H. W. Bush from 1985 to 1988
Senator Biden, do you believe that continued withdrawal of American troops from Iraq will lead to a newly ignited civil war?
Governor Palin, since you were selected as a vice presidential candidate, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has given more press conferences to American reporters than you have. Why do you have less confidence in the American press and people than the president of Iran does? And when will you dare to face the press for real?
-- ANDREW SULLIVAN, a blogger for The Atlantic and the author of ''The Conservative Soul''
Senator Biden, you've been one of the Senate's most ardent drug warriors. You helped create the office of ''drug czar''; backed our failed eradication efforts in South America; encouraged the government to seize the assets of people merely suspected of drug crimes; pushed for the expanded use of racketeering and conspiracy laws against drug offenders; advocated the use of the military to fight the drug war; and sponsored a bill that holds venue owners and promoters criminally liable for drug use by people attending concerts and events.
Today, illicit drugs are as cheap and abundant as they were decades ago. Would you agree that the anti-drug policies you've championed have failed? If not, how have they succeeded?
-- RADLEY BALKO, a senior editor at Reason magazine
As governor of Alaska, you have worked with Democrats like me to achieve goals we both shared. Since becoming the vice presidential nominee of the Republican Party, you've done nothing but ridicule Democrats and our goals. How do you expect to be able to get help from Democrats -- either as governor or as vice president -- after your performance on the campaign trail?
-- MIKE DOOGAN, a member of the Alaska House of Representatives, a former columnist for The Anchorage Daily News and the author of the novel ''Skeleton Lake''
Senator Biden, you told me once that, shortly before the 2004 election, you advised John Kerry to respond harshly to a new Osama bin Laden videotape. You described the conversation this way: ''I'm on the phone, I e-mail, I say, 'John, please, say three things': 'How dare bin Laden speak of our president this way.' No. 2, 'I know how to deal with preventing another 9/11.' No. 3, 'Kill him.''' You then threw up your hands in disgust and said of Senator Kerry, ''He didn't make any of it. Let's get it straight. None of it.''
This story was entertaining, but it wasn't strictly accurate. It turned out that you did not, in fact, even speak with Senator Kerry until well after he had issued a vigorous denunciation of bin Laden. This episode is one of several in which you have appeared to exaggerate your importance. Recently, you spoke of being ''shot at'' in Iraq. This, too, turned out to be false. Why should voters trust you, after you have made so many provably embroidered assertions?
-- JEFFREY GOLDBERG, a national correspondent for The Atlantic and the author of ''Prisoners: A Story of Friendship and Terror''
Russia and the United States possess about 95 percent of the world's nuclear weapons. Governor Palin, do you favor negotiations that would continue reducing their numbers when our current agreements expire? If so, would you favor agreements that are subject to strict verification, like those negotiated by Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush during the cold war, or agreements without verification, like the one signed by Presidents Bush and Vladimir Putin?
Senator Biden, Russia has objected to the plan by the United States to station missile interceptors in Poland and associated radars in the Czech Republic and has offered instead to participate in a joint program of missile defense. Bearing in mind that Russian territory provides ideal locations for defenses against countries like North Korea and Iran, would you support a joint program instead of the one now planned?
-- JACK F. MATLOCK Jr.., the ambassador to the Soviet Union from 1987 to 1991 and the author of ''Reagan and Gorbachev: How the Cold War Ended''
The claim by Dick Cheney that he was exempt from certain disclosure requirements because the vice president was a ''legislative officer'' has been greeted with outrage. But the main power the Constitution grants the vice president is a legislative one -- breaking a tie vote in the Senate.
So, Governor Palin, Senator Biden, doesn't Mr. Cheney have a point?
But, then, if the vice president is a legislative officer, how can he wield the vast executive powers that Mr. Cheney has exercised, including orchestrating and supervising a warrantless wiretapping program?
Can the vice president shift between branches at his convenience? If not, what, in your view, is the constitutional status of the vice presidency?
-- GENE HEALY, the author of ''The Cult of the Presidency: America's Dangerous Devotion to Executive Power''
Governor Palin, in a February interview you told me that ''energy is a cause of war.'' You said, ''I personalize it, realizing my oldest child, my son, is in the Army now. He's going to be deployed in a matter of months.'' You added, ''We're fighting over, in some sense, energy sources.''
Governor, could you describe how, in general, energy is a cause of war, and how, specifically, it is a cause of war in Iraq?
-- PETER MAASS, a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine and the author of ''Love Thy Neighbor: A Story of War''
The Shiite religious parties that are Iran's closest allies in the Middle East dominate Iraq's central government and its oil-rich south. Meanwhile, the Bush administration has helped the Sunni militia known as the Awakening to take control of Iraq's Sunni center. The militia is led by Baathists, the very people we removed from power when we invaded Iraq in 2003. In Iraq's north, the Kurds run what is effectively an independent state. Senator McCain has said, ''Our goal is an Iraq that can stand on its own as a democratic ally and a responsible force for peace in its neighborhood.'' Governor Palin, how can an Iraq dominated by pro-Iranian theocrats, Baathists and Kurdish separatists become a democratic ally?
Senator Biden, the United States began to win the battle against the Sunni extremist group Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia only last year when it enlisted the Awakening movement. Is it realistic to expect the Awakening to loyally serve a Shiite-led Iraqi government that many Sunnis see as an Iranian proxy? Or to expect that Iraq's government will accept Sunni troops whom they believe are a Baathist fifth column?
You have espoused a plan for an Iraqi confederation in which Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds could have controlled their own security forces in separate self-governing regions. The Bush administration has created the Sunni army. Should we now encourage the Sunnis to form their own autonomous region, as allowed under Iraq's Constitution, and make the Awakening the army of that region?
-- PETER W. GALBRAITH, the author of ''Unintended Consequences: How War in Iraq Strengthened America's Enemies''
Senator Biden, in 2005 you supported legislation that altered the bankruptcy code in favor of lenders (including credit card companies, many of which are based in your home state, Delaware) and made the terms for consumers seeking to declare personal bankruptcy more stringent. Are you as pro-consumer as the Obama campaign's rhetoric suggests? Do you think the 2005 bankruptcy bill helped contribute to the unsustainable debt burden many consumers now face?
-- ERIC WASSERSTROM, a managing director at a hedge fund. Read more from Mr. Wasserstrom on the Campaign Stops blog.
Governor Palin, as we both know, Alaskans are a special breed. I grew up in Fairbanks, a few hundred miles north of Wasilla. I was proud to live on the frontier, far from civilization. Like many Alaskans, I lived in a log house on a dirt road, with no city water, sewer system or trash collection. We didn't get much from our government, and we didn't want much.
I love my frontier state, but the first thing I learned when I moved to the Lower 48 was how unlike the rest of the country Alaska is. How would you govern America when as mayor and governor, you hardly had to provide basic public services? In Wasilla, less than a tenth of the town is connected to the sewer system.
Alaska's economy runs on oil proceeds -- we don't even pay income tax. And despite our disdain for Washington, we are given hundreds of millions of dollars from the federal government each year. How would you handle our financial crisis when you've never had to balance a budget while tax revenue fell?
-- RACHEL KLEINFELD, the executive director of the Truman National Security Project. Read more from Ms. Kleinfeld on the Campaign Stops blog.
Editors' Note: November 13, 2009, Friday
On Thursday, a news article in The Times reported on the ties between Peter W. Galbraith, a former United States ambassador, and a Norwegian oil company that operates in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. According to the article, Mr. Galbraith ''received rights to an enormous stake in at least one of Kurdistan's oil fields in the spring of 2004.''
Since that time, Mr. Galbraith has written several opinion articles for the Op-Ed page in support of Kurdish independence and security. These articles should have disclosed to readers that Mr. Galbraith could benefit financially from an independent Kurdistan that would not have to share oil revenues with Iraq.
Like other writers for the Op-Ed page, Mr. Galbraith signed a contract that obligated him to disclose his financial interests in the subjects of his articles. Had editors been aware of Mr. Galbraith's financial stake, the Op-Ed page would have insisted on disclosure or not published his articles.

HEADLINE: In New York, a Willing Suspension of Term Limits

BYLINE: By RONALD S. LAUDER. 
Ronald S. Lauder, a former ambassador to Austria and the founder of New Yorkers for Term Limits, was a New York City mayoral candidate in 1989.

 BODY:
I AM passionately in favor of term limits. As many New Yorkers know, I helped advance the referendum for term limits not once but twice, in 1993 and again in 1996. 
 I did this because I thought it was vital to bring new blood into city government and avoid stagnation, corruption and the creation of imperial politicians. Serve your time in government and then go back home -- that's what our founders believed. If you want a good example of what can happen when politicians overstay their usefulness, look at Washington and the gridlock that has been a defining feature in our federal government over the last decade.
 My fellow New Yorkers agreed with this and voted overwhelmingly for term limits in both elections. And over 15 years, the concept has proved itself correct. Term limits gave us a more dynamic City Council. It also gave us Michael Bloomberg -- a smart, competent and popular mayor. So having said all that, why do I suddenly have a change of heart on something about which I feel so strongly? Why do I believe term limits should be lifted temporarily to allow Mr. Bloomberg to run for a third term? The answer is simple. 
 I lived and worked here in New York during the fiscal crisis in the early 1970s. I remember how close this city came to going under. I also remember how that financial crisis trickled down and depressed life not just on Wall Street, but on every street in every borough. Housing prices plummeted, storefronts remained empty for years, business stagnated and opportunity dried up. A corresponding rise in crime led to nightmare murders that became the stuff of horror movies. Visitors stayed away, further eroding the city's economy. Times Square in 1975 was not a place you wanted to bring your children. 
 I never want to see that happen again. During the last few weeks, we have seen an unprecedented rupture in our national economic system that rivals not 1975, but 1929. Ground zero for this financial meltdown is not Washington or California or small-town America, but New York. The sudden and shocking demise of major institutions like Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns only reinforces the comparison to the earlier and even darker time. 
 Certainly, there are able candidates for mayor in both parties; I know and admire many of them. But I believe that for a city poised on the brink of economic disaster (and experience tells us that economic disasters eventually become social disasters), a prosperous future depends in large measure on a mayor with a deep understanding of finance, governance and politics. (It's worth noting that three decades ago, another financier, Felix Rohatyn, stepped in and saved our city from the abyss. It's also worth noting that the mayor is in a better position to undertake a rescue mission from City Hall than he is from, say, an entity like the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which Mr. Rohatyn led to stave off the city's financial crisis.)
 I completely understand that the City Council would be rescinding the voice of the voters. I also understand that this is a dangerous precedent. Therefore, this should be strictly a one-time only event. Any new extension of term limits to 12 years should include a sunset clause that re-establishes the current eight-year, two-term limit once this crisis is resolved. Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. The voters will be heard. But let's get through this crisis first with the least amount of damage to our city. 
 We've all created something quite special here: New York is a wonderful and safe place to raise children. It's one of the top tourist destinations in the world. And it's still the greatest draw for every young person with a passion to succeed in every field. Let's keep it that way.

HEADLINE: Civilian Nuclear Trade Deal For India Is Backed by Senate

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The United States opened a new chapter of cooperation with India on Wednesday night as Congress gave final approval to a breakthrough agreement permitting civilian nuclear trade between the countries for the first time in three decades.
 The Senate ratified the deal 86 to 13 a week after the House passed it, handing a rare foreign policy victory to President Bush in the twilight of his administration and culminating a three-year debate that raised alarms about a new arms race and nearly toppled the government of India.
 The agreement, in the view of its authors, will redefine relations between two countries often at odds during the cold war and build up India as a friendly counterweight to a rising China. But critics complain that it effectively scraps longstanding policies intended to curb the spread of nuclear weapons and that it could encourage nations like Pakistan, Iran and North Korea to accelerate their own programs outside international legal structures. 
 Under the terms of the deal, the United States will now be able to sell nuclear fuel, technology and reactors to India for peaceful energy use despite the fact that New Delhi tested bombs in 1974 and 1998 and never signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. In exchange, India agreed to open up 14 civilian nuclear facilities to international inspection, but could continue to shield eight military reactors from outside scrutiny.
 ''The national security and economic future of the United States will be enhanced by a strong and enduring partnership with India,'' Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, the ranking Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, said in the Senate debate on Wednesday. 
 Senator Byron Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, called the deal a ''grievous mistake'' that would reward rogue behavior. Mr. Dorgan and Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, tried to amend the agreement to explicitly require the United States to cut off nuclear trade if India conducted a new nuclear test. The agreement's backers defeated the proposal, arguing that it was unnecessary and that nuclear trade would be halted in such a situation.
 Mr. Bush has been pursuing the agreement since 2005, and his advisers have called closer relations between the United States and India a key part of his foreign policy legacy. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India, visiting Mr. Bush at the White House last week, endorsed that view. ''When history is written,'' he said, ''I think it will be recorded that President George W. Bush made an historic goal in bringing our two democracies closer to each other.''
 But the nuclear accord has proved even more controversial at home for Mr. Singh than for Mr. Bush. Opposition parties have tried to bring down Mr. Singh's government and the Communist Party dropped out of his governing coalition in protest of the deal, but he survived a confidence vote. 
 For India, the pact signals the end of 34 years of isolation among nuclear powers -- what the government in New Delhi calls ''nuclear apartheid.'' The United States last month persuaded the Nuclear Suppliers Group, a consortium of 45 nations that Washington formed in response to India's 1974 test, to lift longstanding restrictions on nuclear trade with India. France and Russia are eager to bid for India's business.
 The United States-India Business Council, which promoted the deal, estimates that India may spend as much as $175 billion over the next quarter century expanding its nuclear industry to cope with rising energy demands. Companies like General Electric, Westinghouse and Bechtel will now be able to compete for contracts.
 ''This is one of those historic, important, tectonic shifts in relations with another country,'' said Ron Somers, the council's president. Michael Krepon, co-founder of the Henry L. Stimson Center, a research organization in Washington, called the promise of big dollars and American jobs ''pure fantasy'' and predicted that the United States would regret further opening the nuclear door.
 ''There will be a reckoning for this agreement,'' he said. ''You can argue till you're blue in the face that India is a special case. But what happens in one country affects what happens in others.''

HEADLINE: Falling Price Of Oil Offers Upbeat Note In a Crisis

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
For the last year, rising oil prices have taken a toll on the economy, driving up gasoline and food costs, punishing airlines and automakers, and ripping a large hole in people's pockets.
 But lately, nearly lost amid the chaos in the markets, oil prices have been dropping sharply from July's triple-digit peak. If that trend continues, as many analysts expect, it will put billions of dollars back into consumers' wallets and provide badly needed support for a battered economy. 
 Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, pointed to the drop in energy prices as ''a positive note'' in recent testimony to Congress, even as he warned of the many other stresses facing the economy. 
 Oil has been volatile in recent weeks, bobbing from $91 to $120 a barrel amid wild swings in the markets. 
 But with oil demand falling in most Western countries and growth weakening in some of Asia's booming economies, the trend is down. Crude oil futures closed at $93.97 a barrel, down $4.56, on Thursday and have lost 13 percent in the last week alone. 
 While consumers welcome the decline, which will reduce the nation's $1.3 billion daily oil import bill, oil producers are wary. Mexico said it might have to cut its budget next year as petroleum revenue dropped. Countries like Russia and Venezuela, which have been riding a wave of energy-fueled nationalism, could be forced to scale back their ambitions and energy projects that require enormous financing could be delayed.
 These difficulties could prompt the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to step in forcefully to stem the slide in prices, analysts said. Saudi Arabia, the oil cartel's most powerful member, has signaled it wants to see oil fall below $100 to bolster the world economy, but it is unclear how low the Saudis and other producers will let prices fall. 
 Whatever OPEC tries to do, a growing number of experts say that a combination of weaker global growth and slumping demand is likely to keep pushing oil prices down in coming months. 
 ''The fall in oil prices is equivalent to a new stimulus package for consumers,'' said Lawrence J. Goldstein, an energy analyst at the Energy Policy Research Foundation. He calculated that each drop of $10 a barrel in the price of oil lowered the nation's annual bill by about $70 billion. That is $230 for every American. 
 Gasoline now sells at $3.60 a gallon on average nationwide, according to AAA, down from its record of $4.11 a gallon in July, although prices are higher in some states because of lingering problems from Hurricane Ike. Experts say that if oil prices stayed from $75 to $100 a barrel for a while, that would likely push gasoline under $3.50 a gallon.
 A result of record energy costs is that Americans have drastically cut back on their driving this year, reducing their gasoline usage at the fastest pace since 1983. 
 As prices peaked, oil consumption fell by 6 percent in July to its lowest level in five years, while the number of miles driven dropped the most since 1979, according the latest statistics from the Federal Highway Administration. For industrialized countries, which account for about 60 percent of global oil demand, consumption could fall by 1.3 million barrels a day this year, the steepest decline since 1982, according to analysts at Bernstein Research. That would more than offset the growth in consumption from developing nations like China, the analysts said. 
 ''A study of the 1980s reaffirms our pessimism about oil demand in 2008 and 2009,'' the Bernstein analysts said in a recent research note. ''Recent data suggests we may finally be reaching the point of negative demand.''
 Many analysts agree. Merrill Lynch said on Thursday that oil prices could fall as low as $50 a barrel in a global recession. Lawrence Eagles, an oil analyst for JPMorgan Chase, said: ''This is the weakest fundamental situation we've had since 2002.'' 
 Oil prices are still high by historical standards. Many businesses had not managed to raise their prices enough to compensate for this summer's oil spike to more than $145 a barrel, and they say the high prices are still causing problems.
 ''We get excited when prices break below $100 a barrel, but we are still in a high feedstock and hydrocarbon environment,'' said Rich Wells, the vice president for energy at Dow Chemical.
 Automakers have appealed for government aid as consumers shun their gas guzzlers, a problem worsened lately by a credit squeeze for potential car buyers. The Ford Motor Company said this week that its United States sales had dropped 34 percent in September. Automakers like General Motors and Toyota, also reported sharp sales declines. 
 Oil costs are a big reason the global airline industry has lost money in all but one year since 2000. Fuel costs amounted to 14 percent of airlines' expenses in 2000 but are forecast to reach 40 percent next year, the International Air Transport Association says. 
 ''Our industry is like Sisyphus,'' Giovanni Bisignani, IATA's chairman, told an industry conference in Istanbul this summer. ''After a long uphill journey, a giant boulder of bad news is driving us back down.'' 
 A sustained drop in oil prices could lead to a new wave of mergers in the energy industry. Given the sharp increase in prices in recent years for everything from drill rigs to steel pipes, costs in the industry have risen sharply. The cost of adding production is now $70 to $90 a barrel, according to JPMorgan and other analysts. 
 Any drop below that range may curb investment in new oil supplies. Already, some producers are feeling the pinch. Petro-Canada, for example, signaled recently that the cost of developing oil sands in Canada would not be economical below $100 a barrel. 
 ''Prices are still searching for true value and no one is quite sure what that is,'' said Tom Bentz, an energy analyst at BNP Paribas in New York. ''A lot will depend on how the global economic picture will shape up. We still have a world that is a scary place to live in.''

HEADLINE: Persistent Anxiety Over Tight Credit Sends Stocks Plunging

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM; Vikas Bajaj and Matthew Saltmarsh contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stocks dropped sharply on Thursday as signs of the economy's worsening health and a continued choking of credit unnerved investors ahead of a crucial vote in Washington on a financial rescue plan. 
 While banks had been the focus for much of the week, their problems spread to insurance companies. The worst declines, however, came among companies in manufacturing, chemical production and mining, industries that are usually affected by economic troubles. 
 The declines suggested that the problems of the tight credit market, once mostly contained to Wall Street, were now spreading across the broader economy, a sentiment supported by weak reports on manufacturing activity released this week. 
 The strains in the credit markets, which were already severe, also worsened. On Thursday, Treasury yields fell and important borrowing rates rose, signaling that banks remained reluctant to lend to businesses and consumers. Reports of major businesses cutting dividends and scrambling for cash have underscored fears about the consequences of the logjam in global credit lines. 
 ''There is uncertainty on every front right now,'' said Richard Sparks, an analyst at Schaeffer's Investment Research. ''There is an inordinate amount of fear in the market.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average dropped at the opening bell and never looked back. A burst of selling in the last hour sent the index to a loss of 348.22 points, or 3.2 percent, ending the day at 10,482.85. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fared worse, dropping more than 4 percent, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 4.5 percent.
 Stocks are nearly back to where they were on Monday, when the Dow plummeted 777 points after the House of Representatives rejected a version of the bailout plan for the financial industry. The Senate passed a revised bill Wednesday. Many investors hoped the House would approve the plan when it votes again Friday, but uncertainty about the outcome had them unnerved. And many have already begun looking beyond the vote and back at the grim fundamentals of the broader economy. 
 ''This was a wait-and-see day,'' said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor's, referring to the apprehension among investors at the outcome of the vote in the House on Friday. 
 ''But while we were waiting, we were thumbing through the economic reports, and they weren't good.''
 New applications for unemployment benefits rose last week to a seven-year high, according to the Labor Department. Although the rise was partly attributable to the hurricanes that hit Texas last month, investors worried that an important gauge of unemployment due for release Friday would show the economy bled an additional 100,000 jobs in September. 
 A separate report said that orders for goods made at American factories in August slumped by 4 percent, the largest monthly decline in nearly two years, a problem exacerbated by strains on credit. 
 Treasury yields dropped again as investors sought safety in the government notes. A key three-month borrowing rate for banks, known as Libor, continued to rise. In a sign of severe stress, yields on junk bonds jumped to 17.72 percent, up from 16.69 percent on Wednesday, according to Bloomberg. And several companies reported problems finding buyers for their corporate debt, a critical source of financing that helps businesses stay afloat on a day-to-day basis.
 The Federal Reserve has stepped up its lending to financial firms in the last week in response to the credit crisis. Banks and securities firms had borrowed up to $348.2 billion from the central bank as of Wednesday, up from $217.8 billion a week earlier. But that has not greased the wheels of lending. 
 ''Banks as well as individuals just seem to be hoarding their cash at this point,'' Mr. Stovall said.
 A top executive at Marriott, the hotel chain, said the company was forced to borrow $900 million from its credit lines in the face of a weak commercial paper market. 
 Insurance companies had a particularly difficult day, which some analysts attributed to comments from Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, who warned at a press conference that a large insurer could be facing financial problems. A spokesman for the senator later said that Mr. Reid had been referring to the insurance industry as a whole and not a single company.
 Still, shares of The Hartford fell 32 percent, and shares of Principal Financial and MetLife each declined about 15 percent.
 Oil prices declined for a second day, falling $4.56 to $93.97 a barrel.
 European stocks, which had been in positive territory before trading opened in New York, gave up those gains and ended the day lower. The FTSE-100 index in London closed down 1.8 percent, and stocks in Frankfurt and Paris dropped more than 2 percent.
 The European Central Bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4.25 percent, and the euro fell again against the dollar.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury bill rose 29/32, to 103 2/32, and the yield, which moves opposite the price, was at 3.63 percent, down from 3.73 percent late Wednesday.
 Following are the results of Thursday's Treasury auction of 56-day cash management bills:

HEADLINE: Legal Immigration? Anybody?

 BODY:
One of the false pieties uttered by anti-immigration politicians is that they love immigrants. If that were true, Congress would not be having so much trouble passing a simple law to smooth out a serious kink in the legal immigration pipeline. 
 Every year Congress authorizes a certain number of permanent-resident visas, or green cards, for immigrants to come to work in the United States or to rejoin their families. And every year bureaucratic delays prevent a certain portion of those visas from being claimed. 
 The result? Every year thousands of potential green cards vanish, like unused cellphone minutes. The huge backlogs in legal immigration, which span years or even decades for applicants from some countries, continue to fester. The myth of Ellis Island becomes more mythical.
 Teachers, nurses, engineers, researchers and other aspiring immigrants who follow the rules, file their paperwork, pay their fees and wait -- and wait -- get the chilly message that they are not wanted. Some of them feel great pressure to go illegally around the immigration system, instead of through it, as their wait to rejoin their loved ones becomes intolerable.
 A House bill that could recapture an estimated 550,000 lost visas, sponsored by Representative Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat, has been moving slowly through the committee process despite the best efforts of members like Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, to sabotage it with ridiculously restrictive amendments. One would have granted green cards only to people younger than 40 with college degrees. Another would have eliminated an entire category of family visas, for siblings of citizens.
 In the Senate, Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, is insisting that a visa-recapturing amendment be added to a bill reauthorizing E-Verify, the federal database program to prevent the hiring of illegal immigrants. For this, he has endured an onslaught of criticism from nativist groups and colleagues, like Jeff Sessions of Alabama. They all have been raising an outcry about a coming flood of new foreigners. 
 That's a false alarm. Congress has already authorized these green cards, and many would go to highly skilled workers who have already lived here for years on temporary visas. The bill is as much about keeping workers as gaining them.
 It seems unlikely that a visa-recapture bill would make it through this year. But don't blame Congress's focus on the economic mess for that. Recapturing visas is a modest fix that should have been made a long time ago. The country needs to build a smoother path to legal entry and citizenship. The blame for its failure to do that lies squarely with the hard-liners who rage against illegal immigrants, but are strangely uninterested in helping people who ''play by the rules'' and ''wait in line.''

 ASIA SOCIETY AND MUSEUM: 'ART AND CHINA'S REVOLUTION,' through Jan. 11. The splashy party that was the 2008 Olympics is yesterday's news, but one-party rule in China remains. New China is still, in significant ways, Old China. The obvious question is: What comes next? To help answer it, Asia Society asks a different, equally timely post-Olympics question: What came before? This exhibition of paintings, drawings, posters and Maoist souvenirs produced in the years leading up to and during the Cultural Revolution gives complicated answers. It lays out the conflicted loyalties that have shaped contemporary China, and finds them in the work of artists who anticipated the current art boom and are part of it. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org. (Holland Cotter) 
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'JESPER JUST: ROMANTIC DELUSIONS,' through Jan. 4. An enchanting show of four short films exhibits most of the qualities for which Mr. Just has become known since completing his studies at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 2003. Melodramatic but never campy or over the top and made with Hollywood-quality production values, his brief musicals explore vulnerable, ordinarily well-armored zones of the masculine psyche, like grief, same-sex love, Oedipal conflict and spiritual desire. The singing is wonderful. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)
 BRONX MUSEUM OF THE ARTS: 'STREET ART STREET LIFE: FROM THE 1950S TO NOW,' through Jan. 25. If to you ''street life'' means noise-lights-action, you'll find this show a surprise. With its immaculate, stripped-down installation, the exhibition is clearly devoted not to recreating the feel of art on the street, but to recording it. History, not buzz, is the subject, and a fascinating history it is, from Robert Frank's unvarnished photographic views of post-World War II America, to a video of Joseph Beuys sweeping the streets of Berlin clean of trash and ideology in the 1970s, to digital montages by Fatimah Tuggar uniting today's streets of New York and Lagos, Nigeria. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Cotter)
 COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'HOUSE PROUD: 19-CENTURY WATERCOLOR INTERIORS FROM THE THAW COLLECTION,' through Jan. 25. The 70 or so jewel-like renderings of rooms and their furnishings here are delightful, mordantly signifying artifacts. They track the domestic effects of exoticism and nostalgia (chinoiserie, Gothic Revival); uncover glimmers of modernity (Biedermeier, smaller rooms); and witness the birth of the contemporary genre known as shelter porn. Accompanied by relevant examples of furniture, decorative objects and books, they also reveal that rooms seen whole, with light and space as well as decor carefully depicted, are among painting's most appealing subjects. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Roberta Smith)
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'CATHERINE OPIE: AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHER,' through Jan. 7. Catherine Opie is many artists in one. Best known in the 1990s for her striking portraits of gay, lesbian and transgendered men and women drawn from a circle of friends and intimates, she is also a photographer of landscapes, cityscapes, architecture, still lifes and lifestyles. She is an insider and an outsider: a documentarian and a provocateur, a classicist and a maverick; a trekker and a stay-at-home; a lesbian feminist mother who resists the gay mainstream; an American -- birthplace: Sandusky, Ohio -- who has serious arguments with her country and culture. It's all here in a fine retrospective. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Cotter) 
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'AMERICA AND THE TINTYPE,' through Jan. 4. This show about the tintype, an early form of photograph made by exposing a lacquered iron plate to light, includes some 200 examples from the museum's collection. Most of the artists, and subjects, are unidentified. These works form a group portrait of Americans, mostly working- and middle-class, struggling to adapt to the rapidly shifting social and economic conditions during the four decades after the Civil War. The exhibition makes the most of the tintype's range of subject matter and emotion, from postmortem shots to vaudevillian caricatures, freedmen to minstrels. It does not dispute the daguerreotype's superior potentials for artistry but simply asserts that tintypes have been unfairly overlooked because of their ubiquity, affordability and anonymity. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'SUSAN MEISELAS: IN HISTORY,' through Jan. 4. A certain moral quandary runs throughout this fascinatingly problematic exhibition: how do you reconcile the demands of professionalism and those of human compassion? To her credit, Ms. Meiselas -- whose coverage of the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua in 1978-79 made her one of the world's most celebrated and criticized war correspondents -- does not duck the question. Tension between opportunism and conscience emerges as the show's main interest -- to the point that it trumps its ostensible subjects, which include violence in Central America, strippers in traveling carnivals and forensic investigations of Saddam Hussein's campaign against the Kurds in northern Iraq. (See above.) (Johnson)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'EARLY BUDDHIST MANUSCRIPT PAINTING: THE PALM-LEAF TRADITION,' through March 22. Practical features like resilience and portability help explain why books written on dried palm leaves were popular with Buddhists in eastern India between the 10th and 13th centuries. But another factor, surely, was the quality of the illustrations that accompanied the texts: exquisite figures of divinities or scenes from the Buddha's life. And few of these are as finely done and pristinely preserved as the examples in this small selection. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
 THE MET: 'GIORGIO MORANDI, 1890-1964,' through Dec. 14. Aspirants to the role of painter as poet are many. Giorgio Morandi (1890-1964) was the real thing. And this Morandi retrospective at the Metropolitan Museum of Art is something that anyone who loves painting and its very specific poetry will want to see. Morandi's still lifes are beautiful, but with a distinctive kind of beauty. And despite their small size and plain components -- bottles, jars, boxes, pots, seashells, vases -- they are emotionally audacious. This isn't because of what they say outright, but because of what they don't say; because they are so evidently shaped by self-restraint, and the passions that produced it. (See above.) (Cotter)THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'JEFF KOONS ON THE ROOF,' through Oct. 26. Panoramic views of Central Park and the Manhattan skyline from the Cantor Roof Garden are distracting, but the three sculptures now on display there are well worth visiting. Each is a greatly enlarged, glossily lacquered, stainless-steel representation of something small: a toy dog made of twisted-together balloons; a Valentine heart wrapped in red foil; and the silhouette of Piglet from a Winnie the Pooh coloring book randomly colored, as if by a young child. (See above.) (Johnson) THE MET: 'LANDSCAPES CLEAR AND RADIANT: THE ART OF WANG HUI (1632-1717),' through Jan. 4. The Met's first solo show devoted to a Chinese master is gorgeous and revelatory; its focus is the landscape virtuoso Wang Hui, star of the 17th-century Chinese art scene. Wang could do anything and did, synthesizing and transforming disparate strands of almost a millennium of Chinese painting, but also making exact copies of earlier masterpieces. Distinguished by a Mozart-like ease and perfection, his work unsettles Western notions of copy, original and originality. It is aided in this by displays of works by 16 earlier artists dating to the 10th-century -- his mentors, his mentors' mentors and the artists they all revered -- which form a dazzling introduction to Chinese painting in general. (See above.) (Smith)
 THE MET: 'PHOTOGRAPHY ON PHOTOGRAPHY: REFLECTIONS ON THE MEDIUM SINCE 1960,' through Oct. 19. This second installation in the Met's new modern photography galleries is much better than the first, largely because of its variety of works (by artists male and female, young and old, American and European, famous and fledgling). Thomas Ruff and Hiroshi Sugimoto are here, but so are Janice Guy, an artist turned dealer who is benefiting from a sudden interest in her early self-portraits, and Mark Wyse, a young photographer who is also active as a curator. The show is also an excellent epilogue to the historical survey ''Framing a Century: Master Photographers 1840-1940,'' just across the hall in the Howard Gilman Gallery. If ''Framing a Century'' presents a hallowed history of photography, ''Photography on Photography'' gleefully violates that sanctity. (See above.) (Rosenberg)
 THE MET: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through fall 2009. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (See above.) (Rosenberg)
 MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'SECOND LIVES: REMIXING THE ORDINARY,' through Feb. 15. The inaugural show in the Museum of Arts and Design's jewel-box-like building continues its haphazard segue from a concentration on craft to a hipper, more wide-ranging program. Unfortunately, the focus is a strategy that is epidemic in the larger art world: the massing of something small (plastic spoons, ladies pumps, spools of thread, dangling eyeglasses) into something large (a pyramid, a loveseat, a view of the ''Mona Lisa,'' a chandelier). It is Surrealism 101, descended from Meret Oppenheim's beloved and far too influential fur-lined teacup. Basically, you see the thing. You see the things it is made of. Something in the way of a punch line follows. 2 Columbus Circle, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Smith)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'KIRCHNER AND THE BERLIN STREET,' through Nov. 10. Focusing on seven paintings produced between 1913 and 1915 by the German Expressionist Ernst Ludwig Kirchner (1880-1938), this exhibition delivers a terrific visual wallop at the start and then continues to reverberate. Vigorously realized in jagged brush strokes of lurid pinks, greens and yellows and shades of charcoal black, the paintings depict stylishly dressed female streetwalkers and furtive, darkly cloaked men on the nocturnal, vertiginously tilted streets of an infernal city on the brink of a world-destroying war. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'LOOKING AT MUSIC,' through Jan. 5. This exhibition of about 40 works from the museum's collection emphasizes the experimental nature of both art and music in the late 1960s and early '70s. The lines dividing art, music and film were blurry enough to allow Laurie Anderson, Bruce Nauman and Yoko Ono, among others, to shift from object making to performance and back again. The show, which includes audio recordings and small-press publications alongside more conventional mediums, is accompanied by an extensive film and video program. (See above.) (Rosenberg)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'NEW PHOTOGRAPHY 2008: JOSEPHINE MECKSEPER AND MIKHAEL SUBOTZKY,' through Jan. 5. Josephine Meckseper, a German-born artist in her 40s who was trained at the California Institute of the Arts, makes sleek-looking installations that mix photography and film -- often scenes of political protest -- with consumer objects. The South African artist Mikhael Subotzky, who at 26 is the youngest photographer to have been invited to join the Magnum Group, explores his country's prison system in vivid color and unflinching detail. If Ms. Meckseper finds glossy, consumerist fantasy infiltrating our political consciousness, Mr. Subotzky reminds us that some people don't yet have the luxury of fretting about the commodification of dissent. (See above.) (Rosenberg)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PIPE, GLASS, BOTTLE OF RUM: THE ART OF APPROPRIATION,' through Nov. 10. More than 100 works, mostly from the museum's drawing collection, represent many different ways of importing nontraditional images, materials, forms and techniques into the realm of art. The exhibition ranges from early Cubist collages by Picasso, Braques and Gris that have newsprint and faux-wood grain paper in them to the suave, agit-prop montages of Barbara Kruger printed on matchbooks and a shopping bag. Other artists include John Baldessari, Hannah Hoch, Sigmar Polke, Sherrie Levine and Richard Prince. (See above.) (Johnson)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'VAN GOGH AND THE COLORS OF THE NIGHT,' through Jan. 5. This small, anomalous exhibition is a Van Gogh antiblockbuster with a seemingly counterintuitive theme, given the importance of the brilliant light of southern France to his art. It explores Van Gogh's special relationship with darkness, where his interests in perception, color and symbolism fuse with unexpected intensity. And seeing a manageable number of Van Goghs -- including masterpieces like ''The Potato Eaters,'' ''The Starry Night'' and ''Night Cafe'' -- in intimate galleries is thrilling. (See above.) (Smith)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'WUNDERKAMMER: A CENTURY OF CURIOSITIES,' through Nov. 10. This exhibition of mostly prints and illustrated books gives too much space to artists in the Modern's pantheon or to predictable midmarket bench warmers. But it is inspired by a very un-Modern idea: the Renaissance wunderkammer, or cabinet of curiosities, a free-form collection of all things rare and marvelous, natural and man-made. Sensitively installed and rife with images of living, often grotesque creatures, it has the buzz of an aberrant ark and enough fresh material to sustain interest. The addition of a few objects from the museum's design collection is especially smart and effective; ignoring MoMA's departmental divisions is a good thing. (See above.) (Smith)
 SCHOMBURG CENTER FOR RESEARCH IN BLACK CULTURE: 'AARON DOUGLAS: AFRICAN-AMERICAN MODERNIST,' through Nov. 30. In 1920s New York a great flowering of black culture emerged that came to be known as the Harlem Renaissance. No visual artist expressed that movement's euphoric sense of possibility with greater verve than the subject of this valuable exhibition, the painter, illustrator and muralist Aaron Douglas. His major works feature semitransparent silhouettes of black people in heroic poses overlaid by concentric, circular bands of light. Rendered in muted, luminous colors, they project visionary romanticism in a suave, Art Deco-like style. 515 Malcolm X Boulevard, at 135th Street, Harlem, (212) 491-2200, nypl.org/research/sc. (Johnson)
 THE STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'NEW INTUITIONS: LESLIE HEWITT, TANEA RICHARDSON AND SAYA WOOLFALK,' through Oct. 26. The contrasting artistic sensibilities of the latest participants in the Studio Museum's artists-in-residence program maintain its impressive record. Leslie Hewitt, the most accomplished, extends the image-text combination of Conceptual Art in photographs and sculpture. Tanea Richardson, less mature but in some ways more complete, gives found fabrics and abstract form a special vehemence. Saya Woolfalk, a whiz in several mediums (starting with sewing), contributes a video, ''Ethnography of No Place,'' that drags a bit, but is a tour de force of performance, animation, born-again Pattern and Decoration, soft sculpture and anthropological satire. In each case race and ethnicity are among many other issues tackled. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Smith)
 THE STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'KEHINDE WILEY, THE WORLD STAGE: AFRICA, LAGOS-DAKAR,' through Oct. 26. In 10 recent works Kehinde Wiley shifts the focus of his big, flashy pictures of young African-American men recast as the kings, dandies, and saints of European painting to young African men in the poses of African sculpture. The show (which really belongs in a commercial gallery) reveals a young artist who, despite several years of hotness, is only now beginning to make paintings that don't feel mostly like campy, gaudy illustrations. The compositions are calmer, the details less fussy, and the figures are painted with a new solidity and emotional directness. It makes a big difference. (See above.) (Smith)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'PAUL MCCARTHY: CENTRAL SYMMETRICAL ROTATION MOVEMENT: THREE INSTALLATIONS, TWO FILMS,' through Oct. 12. Mr. McCarthy's fans are in for a shock. They will find almost nothing of what this Los Angeles master of transgressive provocation is famous for in this smart, tightly focused exhibition of works dating from 1966 to the present. No psychotic clowning, no pornographic vaudeville. Instead they will discover Mr. McCarthy's art stripped to its bare, abstract yet still metaphorically resonant essentials. The main attractions are two scarily mechanized rooms and a walk-in enclosure dizzyingly animated by feedback loops from four rotating video cameras. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Johnson)
 Galleries: 57th Street
 JOHN ALTOON Mr. Altoon (1925-1969), who made his name in the Los Angeles art scene of the 1950s and '60s and suffered a fatal heart attack shortly thereafter, is the latest West Coast artist to be exhumed by the contemporary market. In this exhibition of paintings and works on paper, organized by Klaus Kertess, Mr. Altoon's well-chronicled personal demons -- thrill seeking, womanizing, depression, paranoia -- are on full display. His drawings, in ink, watercolor, graphite and pastel on board, show men, women and animals engaged in explicitly violent and sexual interactions. Mary Boone, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 752-2929, maryboonegallery.com, through Oct. 25. (Rosenberg)
 Galleries: SoHo
 RIRKRIT TIRAVANIJA: 'DEMONSTRATION DRAWINGS' This ambitious conceptual show by Rirkrit Tiravanija is made up of some 200 small, highly detailed graphite drawings of political protests and demonstrations from around the world. Most of the images were derived from newspaper photographs and have the on-the-spot look of reportage. All were done by artists in Thailand working on generous commissions from Mr. Tiravanija, with proceeds from the sale of the pictures going to the Land Foundation, a sustainable housing community in Thailand. The results in the show: drawing, the sine qua non of ''real'' art, meets the real world, and paradoxes unroll. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org, through Nov. 6. (Cotter) 
 Galleries: Chelsea
 JERONIMO ELESPE This artist, based in Madrid, makes portraits, landscapes and interior scenes with an eye to the great Spanish painters. Gray, found in the backgrounds of paintings by Goya and Velazquez, is the dominant color and mood. Mannered portraiture remains Mr. Elespe's great strength, but several landscapes are noteworthy for their highly worked surfaces and nocturnal palette. The heavily impastoed ''Lower Garden'' (2006-7) and the nearly iridescent ''Untitled (Garden)'' (2005) have a cumulative beauty, a result of small adjustments made over many months. John Connelly Presents, 625 West 27th Street, (212) 337-9563, johnconnellypresents.com, through Oct. 11. (Rosenberg)
 N. S. HARSHA The first half of a two-part installation by an artist from Mysore, India, is made of two large pieces. One is a sculptural re-creation of a traditional Indian outdoor meal, with food served on palm leaves; the food in this case being hyper-realistic plastic versions of the real thing, like the sample dishes displayed outside Japanese restaurants. The absent guests are represented by footprints on the floor, but also appear in a large painting in which hundreds of figures sit down side by side in long rows to chat. Bodhi Art, 535 West 24th Street, (212) 352-2644, bodhiart.in, through Oct. 14. (Cotter)
 VIK MUNIZ: 'VERSO' The old paintings leaning face-first against the gallery walls -- including Seurat's ''Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte'' and Picasso's ''Desmoiselles D'Avignon'' -- are, in fact, replicas created by Mr. Muniz with the assistance of craftsmen who faithfully reproduced the back sides of the originals. To meditate on these trompe l'oeil sculptures is to wonder about our habits of seeing and believing. Sikkema Jenkins & Company, 530 West 22nd Street, (212) 929-2262, sikkemajenkinsco.com, through Oct. 11. (Johnson)
 LORRAINE O'GRADY: 'MISCEGENATED FAMILY ALBUM' An important and beautiful show by an important and influential artist examines race, class, history, family and love. The work has particular resonance in this election year. Alexander Gray Associates, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 1019, (212) 399-2636, alexandergray.com, through Oct. 11. (Cotter) 
 HANS SILVESTER: 'PAINTED PEOPLE' These large color photographs document the extraordinary body painting of the semi-nomadic, cattle-herding Surma and Mursi peoples of the Omo Valley in southern Ethiopia. A daily habit that is both expressive and functional, these vibrantly patterned ephemeral motifs reflect a sophisticated vocabulary of mark-making, finger-painting and hand-printing techniques while also sometimes serving as insect repellent. They are humbling, to say the least, and reveal both abstraction and painting as basic human traits, not Western or modernist peccadilloes. Marlborough, 545 West 25th Street, (212) 463-8634, marlboroughgallery.com, through Oct. 11. (Smith)
 IVAN WITENSTEIN Ivan Witenstein's satirical sculptures get more prepos terously grotesque every time out, a development entirely appropriate to the politics of the moment. The figurative work here is a head-on collision between Ralph Bakshi and Gian Lorenzo Bernini, with Daumier, Ronald Reagan and Mark Twain jammed in. Like the best apocalyptic art, the work is superb and awful, minutely controlled and ready to explode. Derek Eller, 615 West 27th Street, (212) 206-6411, derekeller.com, through Oct. 11. (Cotter)

 'ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM: A WORLD ELSEWHERE' A gallery chain based in London and owned by an auction house opens in New York in an overdone, chopped-up space with a shapeless, absurdly unnecessary exhibition of paintings and sculptures by those mythic market stalwarts, the leaders of the New York School. Under crowded (auction-house-like) conditions await exceptional works by Clyfford Still, Franz Kline, Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, David Smith and more, often lent by museums. That nothing is for sale is meant to impress, but it doesn't do much to reduce the aura of commercial savvy, or the sense that a history recounted often and better elsewhere is being told yet again for all the wrong reasons. Haunch of Venison, 1230 Avenue of the Americas, near 49th Street, Manhattan, (212) 636-2034, haunchofvenison.com, through Nov. 12. (Smith)
 'IMPLANT' Organized by a curator at the Horticultural Society of New York, ''Implant'' takes inspiration from Michael Pollan's 2001 book, ''The Botany of Desire,'' which suggests that plants are using us for evolutionary purposes just as much as we are using them. Musicians entertain the foliage in Peter Coffin's greenhouse; a tree in a digital animation by Hiraki Sawa trots on human legs through a Daliesque landscape. Roughly 100 works by 45 contemporary artists add to our sense of a gradual shift in the artist-plant relationship, from sublime awe in the face of nature to something more reciprocal. UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, between 51st and 52nd Streets; (212) 713-2885, hsny.org, through Oct. 31. (Rosenberg)
 'OUT NOW!' The artist Anton Vidokle organized this exhibition to protest both the war in Iraq and the tepid response of American art institutions to that war. The work is tightly installed, text-intensive and hot with information. Among the contributors are the Irish journalist Patrick Cockburn; the peace activist Kathy Kelly; the writer Jalal Toufic; the artists Natasha Sadr Haghighian, Trevor Paglen and Martha Rosler; and the artist collective Friends of William Blake. E-Flux, 41 Essex Street, Lower East Side, (212) 619-3356, e-flux.com, through Nov 8. (Cotter) 
 'SCRAWL' Some people become writers when they become crazed enough by the state of things, and collectors when they become crazy enough about a certain kind of artifact. The two extremes converge in ''Scrawl,'' an exhibition organized by Harley Spiller from his collection (one of 80) of homemade stickers, broadsides and other communiques culled from the streets of New York over the past 23 years. Among the 40 people represented here, handwriting, pen and paper vary; trigger points include the government, corporations, politicians and people unlike themselves. But their objections offer energetic evidence that the death of the author is greatly exaggerated. Apex Art, 291 Church Street, near White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 431-5270, apexart.org, through Oct. 11. (Smith)AGATHE SNOW: 'JUST SAY YES' Agathe Snow's talents as a mixed-media bricoleur are shown to incoherent effect in an installation of eight hanging sculptures based on Leonardo da Vinci's fables. Although each effort has points of interest in the use of materials, the body language or emotional resonance, the effect of extremely messy pinatas prevails over all. In the courtyard behind the gallery, the Swiss artist Roman Signer gets by without blowing anything up. James Fuentes LLC, 35 St. James Place, Chinatown, (212) 577-1201, jamesfuentes.com, through Oct. 12. (Smith)

 'THE NEW YORK CITY WATERFALLS'Walt Whitman would be pleased. The four waterfalls that the Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson has temporarily insinuated along Whitman's beloved East River (one on Manhattan, two in Brooklyn, a fourth on Governors Island) tweak the ecstatic experience of city life that is especially palpable at water's edge. Forming a mammoth yet oddly discreet work of shoreline land art, they are spectacular only in the cumulative sense, although the top level of Pier 17 at the South Street Seaport is a great place from which to pick out all four. Their scaffoldings and standard New York apartment riser pipes make them, strictly speaking, fountains. But they are also mirages that add uncanny signs of a primordial Eden that never was. Faking natural history with basic plumbing, they form little rips in the urban fabric through which you glimpse hints of a lost paradise, and sharpen your sense of Whitman's, the one you are already in. Pier 35 in Lower Manhattan, the eastern foot of the Brooklyn Bridge; between Piers 4 and 5 near the Brooklyn Heights Promenade; north shore of Governors Island; nycwaterfalls.org, through Oct. 13. (Smith) 
 Out of Town
 GUILD HALL MUSEUM: 'LARRY RIVERS: MAJOR EARLY WORKS,' through Oct. 19. Tracking Larry Rivers's rapid evolution from figurative realism at the start of his career in the early 1950s to Pop-style history painting in the mid-'60s, this show reveals a terrifically fertile, energetic and daring talent discovering itself and lunging into the future. His 1955 painting of his corpulent mother-in-law, Berdie Burger -- who appears in the painting twice, both times nude -- is one of the great miracles of 20th-century American art. 158 Main Street, East Hampton, Long Island, (631) 324-0806, guildhall.org. (Johnson)
 INSTITUTE OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'R. CRUMB'S UNDERGROUND,' through Dec. 7. The former underground comic artist R. Crumb has created some of the most memorable characters in cartoon history, including the irascible guru Mr. Natural; the suave, shamelessly randy Fritz the Cat; the angry Amazon Devil Girl; and R. Crumb himself, a figure comparable to the autobiographical alter-egos of Woody Allen and Philip Roth. He has been a fearlessly irreverent satirist and an intrepid explorer of his own twisted psyche. And he is excruciatingly funny. This enthralling show presents more than 100 works from all phases of his five-decade career. 118 South 36th Street, Philadelphia; (215) 898-7108, icaphila.org. (Johnson)
 Last Chance
 JOHN ASHBERY: 'COLLAGES: THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WANTED' The poet John Ashbery has been making small-scale collages from his college years to the present, and now, at 81, he is having his first gallery solo. The two earliest collages date from around 1948; most are from the 1970s, when he worked in after-dinner cut-and-paste sessions with the artist Joe Brainard. The resulting work, at once prosaic and personal, carries some of the free-associative strangeness and wit associated with Mr. Ashbery's poetry. Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Avenue, near 57th Street, (212) 262-5050, tibordenagy.com; closes on Saturday. (Cotter)
 NATHAN CARTER: 'RADIO TRANSMISSIONS CONTRAPTIONS' In this eyepopping show of sculptures, the artist gets at the playful drawing-in-space core of his work with greater simplicity, force and variety, and therefore seriousness. The constant is steel -- bent rods or wire or small cut-out shapes -- and bright color, provided variously by paint, ceramic, glass or lighting gel. Radio antennas, broadcast towers and airwaves inspire some works; others mingle modernist art, '50s design and tourist souvenir with a keen sense of scale. Casey Kaplan, 525 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 645-7335, caseykaplangallery.com; closes on Saturday. (Smith)
 'CRESWELL CRAGS' In this ecumenical group show of 10 mostly young, mostly promising artists, statements rarely overlap, but they do touch. Between Michael Bauer's elegant, genielike abstract painting and Alex Hubbard's hat-trick video abstraction, links are formed by the morphing geometries of Mark Barrow's painting and Frank Haines's sculpture; the opposing uses of representation deployed by Rashid Johnson and Alan Reid; the angular profiles and doublings of Erin Shirreff, J. Parker Valentine and Josh Faught; and Zak Prekop's supposed embrace of the all-white monochrome. Materials vary similarly. A quiet optimism that is nothing to sniff at accrues. Lisa Cooley, 34 Orchard Street, Lower East Side, (212) 680-0564, lisa-cooley.com; closes on Sunday. (Smith)
 ROE ETHRIDGE: 'ROCKAWAY REDUX' A Pop-Conceptualist with a canny eye for the visual cliches that photography trains us to find in the world, Mr. Ethridge creates exhibitions resembling displays by slick commercial photographers. This show includes travel-magazine-style photographs of a tropical sunset; a gourmet-magazine-style picture of a plate of oysters; and a ''poetic'' photograph of the Williamsburg Bridge and the East River, viewed, evidently, through a partly reflective window. Andrew Kreps Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea; (212) 741-8849, andrewkreps.com; closes on Saturday. (Johnson)
 THILO HEINZMANN: 'AN EMPTY STOMACH IS THE DEVIL'S PLAYGROUND' In his New York solo debut, another young German painter with an antipathy for conventional paint and canvas uses badger pelts, dry pigment, molten tin and chunks of Styrofoam -- all under Plexiglas box-frames that add a clinical air. The overall effect is smart, shallow and a little deja vu, as in Anselm Reyle. Bortolami, 510 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2050, bortolamigallery.com; closes on Saturday. (Smith)
 .KATHLEEN HENDERSON: 'WHAT IF I COULD DRAW A BIRD THAT COULD CHANGE THE WORLD?' This beautiful and chilling show of oil stick drawings is like a fairy tale version of Abu Ghraib as drawn by Ben Shahn. Torture is in progress; Hitler tries his wings; men with bags for heads hunt animals but may be animals themselves; a fat bird flies by, trailing the words, ''If I could draw a bird that could change the world? In a good way, I mean. In a good way.'' The Drawing Center, the Drawing Room, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org; closes on Thursday. (Cotter)
 DAMIAN LOEB: 'SYNESTHESIA, PARATAXIC DISTORTION, AND THE SHADOW' With its portentous, Damien Hirst-like title, this show promises something more spectacular than the conscientiously well-made, illustrative paintings that make up the exhibition. Mr. Loeb produces what you might call Photorealist Melodrama. There is not much action in his paintings, but he has a cinematographer's eye for suspenseful scenes. An autumnal landscape called ''Straw Dogs'' exudes a stirring romance, part Sam Peckinpah, part Thomas Hardy. Acquavella Galleries, 18 East 79th Street, (212) 734-6300, acquavellagalleries.com; closes on Tuesday.(Johnson)
 'MONSTERS' Selected by the artist Robert Longo, this diverse exhibition of 13 artists (all male) who were once his studio assistants reflects a healthy indifference to imitating or being imitated. Of particular interest are Nathan Spondike's luminous abstractions; Brock Enright's garrulous installation; Owen McAuley's small urban nocturnes; Colin Hunt's even smaller Surrealistic canvases; Garrick Imatani's photographs of off-the-grid dwellings; and Eric Schnell's patchwork of pale drawings, held together by clay. The most Longo-esque artist, William Latta, still manages to look like, well, his own man. Rental Gallery, 120 East Broadway, at Allen Street, Lower East Side, (212) 608-6002, rental-gallery.com; closes on Sunday.(Smith)
 NEW MUSEUM: 'AFTER NATURE' This strange, lugubrious, wildly uneven dream of an exhibition exudes a distinctly European mood of ruminative pessimism, relieved intermittently by moments of black humor and otherworldly fantasy. Meditating on a spiritual landscape of death and destruction, it lurches from transcendentally thrilling to portentous to kitschy. The best moment is on the fourth floor, where the elevator doors open on the stunning, tragicomic spectacle of Zoe Leonard's dead tree held up by cables and stanchions and Maurizio Cattelan's full-size horse hanging high in the air, with its head seemingly buried in the wall. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Johnson)
 ANDRES SERRANO Each of the 18 monumental photographs in this show -- whose title cannot be printed here -- pictures a heroically enlarged heap of excrement against a celestial background of glowing color. Attraction-repulsion is the main effect. You can talk about equating feces and money, but Freudian analysis seems beside the point when it comes to such blatantly attention-seeking work. Yvon Lambert, 550 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-3611, yvon-lambert.com; closes on Saturday. (Johnson)
 KEITH TYSON: 'FRACTAL DICE' As if to answer critics who have questioned the integrity of his wildly diversifying, technically showboating approach to sculpture, the British artist Keith Tyson offers an impressive, surprisingly unified set of works. They consist of Playskool-colored plastic boxes assembled into complex configurations of cubes, blocks and beams, whose colors and shapes were determined according to a simple, gamelike system of rules and rolls of a die. PaceWildenstein, 545 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-4258, pacewildenstein.com; closes on Saturday. (Johnson)
 XU ZHEN, FOLKERT DE JONG, MARTHA COLBURN Three good solo shows in one. The Chinese conceptual artist Xu Zhen recreates the interior of a convenience store in Shanghai, his hometown, using tightly packed shelves of empty containers with bright labels. Folkert de Jong's tableau of monstrous figures sculptured in candy-colored insulation foam calls on Goya, puppetry and World War I history to depict an execution in progress. Martha Colburn's ''Myth Labs,'' a stop-motion animation handmade from drawings and pop-culture collage, spins out a vivid stream-of-consciousness narrative about the effects of drug addiction and bad religion on the American frontier. James Cohan Gallery, 533 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 714-9500, jamescohan.com; closes on Saturday. (Cotter)

HEADLINE: With Election Near, a Populist Strain Tugs at the Republican Party

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
THE fact that Republicans in the Senate endorsed the financial rescue plan by more than two to one while those in the House opposed it by the same ratio cannot be explained simply by the tax-break sweeteners that the Senate added. Instead, the contrast says a lot about the modern Republican Party.
 House Republicans better reflect the party's grass roots in their districts than do senators, who represent entire states. Even though some Republicans are expected to switch sides in a second House vote scheduled for Friday, a majority of them are expected to remain opposed to the plan, evidence of a shift in the Republican Party's identity that has some leaders worried about the elections next month and perhaps for the future. 
 With just five weeks until Election Day, political survival now and in the future was a big reason that many House Republicans remain willing to defy the president, a Treasury secretary and a Federal Reserve chairman of their own party, all of whom argued that the rescue plan was vital to the national and global economies. Another factor is that President Bush, a lame duck with historically low approval ratings, had no sway with the naysayers.
 But nearly all of the Republican opponents insisted they were upholding the party's principles and its ''brand'' by opposing big-government intervention in what should be free markets. The bipartisan rescue plan would be ''the slippery slope to socialism,'' said Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas.
 Known for more than a century as the nation's party of business, rooted in the industrial North and its affluent communities, the Republican Party has evolved over the last generation as its base moved to the South after the civil-rights era into a party that is defined more by social conservatism than business issues. On the economy, it is increasingly populist. And populists do not favor bailouts of Wall Street. 
 That rigidly ideological stance at a time of economic crisis reflects the Republican Party now dominant in the House as well as in many state legislatures. But it is causing strains in the party with those voters who are more moderate or pragmatic, including lifelong Republicans who have long identified with the party's reputation for economic stewardship of business. 
 ''They're in the process of destroying the Republican brand as effective managers of the economy,'' said Vin Weber, a former congressman from Minnesota. 
 Defections of suburban Republicans and Republican-leaning independents helped Democrats recapture the House and Senate in the 2006 elections. In this campaign cycle, Republicans have continued to lose ground in voters' party affiliation, especially among upper-income voters and those who identify themselves as professionals and managers. Even more than in 2006, business contributions are favoring Democrats. Voters tell pollsters they believe the Democrats would do a better job with the economy -- reversing the longtime advantage of the Republicans.
 Senate Republicans -- including the party's presidential nominee, John McCain -- tend to reflect more diverse constituencies and points of view, because they are elected statewide and need only face the voters every six years. Mr. McCain frequently has battled Republicans in the House, so his outreach to them on the bailout was ironic as well as unsuccessful. But long before, to get the nomination, Mr. McCain made accommodations to the conservatives dominant in the party by his rightward turns on tax cuts and other issues.
 Most House Republicans are from districts packed by the political map makers with conservative voters to make them safe for Republicans, just as many Democrats' districts are safely liberal. 
 Especially in the South, Republican voters tend to be less affluent and less educated -- and suspicious of big business -- than mainstream Republicans of days past. The main fear of their representatives is a challenge from the party's far right. In the case of the financial bailout, the ''right'' position was to oppose it.
 Many House Republicans came of political age in President Reagan's time, and consider themselves protectors of his legacy. To approve the bailout would be ''a coffin on top of Ronald Reagan's coffin,'' said Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican from California who opposed it.
 But Republican figures from the Reagan years say these conservatives misread their idol's record of bipartisan compromises. Amid the current financial crisis, several recalled that after the 1987 market crash, Mr. Reagan and the Democratic leaders in Congress negotiated a budget compromise of spending cuts and revenue-raisers to signal to markets that the government was serious about reducing the deficits. 
 ''Ronald Reagan would not be comfortable as a House Republican today. Ronald Reagan was the ultimate pragmatist and fiscal conservative,'' said Kenneth M. Duberstein, a White House chief of staff to Mr. Reagan.
 The tension within the Republican Party is exacerbated by the fact that its popularity is the lowest in more than three decades, according to polls. In mid-August, the nonpartisan Pew Research Center found that Democrats had a 51 percent to 38 percent advantage in party affiliation among registered voters, up from a narrow 47 percent to 44 percent edge before the 2004 presidential election.
 Among those who have defected are moderate and conservative business types who once were the party's base. They have been disheartened in the Bush years, six of which had Republicans in control of Congress, by a record of mistakes in Iraq and after Hurricane Katrina, big spending and spiraling debt, and Congressional scandals. Among voters making more than $100,000 a year, typically a Republican-leaning group, the Republicans' held only a 35 percent to 31 percent advantage over Democrats, the Pew survey found. In 2004, the Republican edge was 40 percent to 29 percent. 
 Business-oriented Republicans favor low taxes but many oppose the party's hard-line antitax stand. They say they would support higher taxes to reduce deficits, fix the roads and bridges needed for commerce, or relieve corporations of some of the costs of employees' health insurance. Voters from families that have been Republican for generations complain that their party has been taken over by social conservatives, many of them former Democrats in the South, and they do not share the newcomers' agenda of opposition to abortion, gay rights and liberalized immigration policies.
 Republican strategists say the defection of the traditional business Republicans is especially worrisome if Senator Barack Obama succeeds in getting younger Americans to vote for him in greater numbers than their age group usually does. Some Republican Party leaders privately fear that if Mr. Obama is elected, he could usher in a pro-Democratic realignment much like Mr. Reagan did for Republicans after the economic stagnation and drift of the 1970s.

HEADLINE: Answers About Living Cheaply in New York

 BODY:
Q As a recent transplant to New York City, the price of groceries has shocked me the most. ($6-7 for a box of Mini-Wheats?) What tips do you have for finding decent prices on groceries? 
 -- Posted by Eric Ackerman
 A Price check, Aisle 7, Mini-Wheats! Yes, New York groceries do hurt the wallet. Trader Joe's can be an exception and the Park Slope Food Co-op has spectacular bargains, although you'll have to become a member and put in 2 hours and 45 minutes worth of work every four weeks to take advantage. East Village Cheese, on Third Avenue near Ninth Street, has prices low enough to make you think you've slipped through a time warp to 1985.
 Chinatown's economy seems to be functioning at a different exchange rate from the rest of the city. I do my shopping at the Shop Smart at 117 Ludlow Street. The price there for an 18-ounce box of Kellogg's Frosted Mini-Wheats? $4.79.
 Q Are there any classy bars where one can find inexpensive (like, $7) drinks below 34th Street during normal evening hours (like, after 8 p.m.)?
 -- Posted by Bob
 A Classy and inexpensive is a tough bill to fill, but I do know a place that'll fit your parameters. Verlaine, on Rivington Street, runs its happy hour seven days a week from 5 to 10 p.m. House martinis, basic cocktails and wine are just $5 a pop, and a Yuengling beer is $3. The space is a little generic, but it's stylish. If you're out boozing on a Wednesday, Blue Owl, on Second Avenue near 12th Street, extends its happy hour until midnight, with $6 drinks, served up in a swanky subterranean space. 
 Q Inexpensive, yet high quality (but I don't mean high budget) theater that doesn't require that I stand in line for hours on end?
 -- Posted by Jeff C.
 A Off and Off Off Broadway are your natural choices for affordable theater. (I assume TKTS isn't your speed.) Of course, quality varies wildly by production, so make sure you rifle through some reviews first. Good candidates include La Mama, the Theater for the New City, New York Theater Workshop (Sunday night performances go for $20), and Signature Theater Company (thanks to a grant, all regular seats are $20).

HEADLINE: Fewer People Are Entering U.S. Illegally, Report Says

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON

 BODY:
A report released Thursday by the Pew Hispanic Center indicates that fewer people are trying to enter the United States illegally and that there has been no growth over the last year in the number of illegal immigrants living here.
 The Pew center report, which is based on census data, showed that for the first time in nearly a decade, the number of people entering the country illegally was lower than the number arriving through legal channels. 
 Experts said the loss of low-wage jobs in the American economy, combined with intensified enforcement at the border and at workplaces across the country, had caused those who might be considering an illegal border crossing to think twice before risking what has become an increasingly dangerous journey. The result has been a significant reversal after a decade of rapid growth in illegal immigration. 
 Central banks from Mexico to Brazil have projected the biggest declines in remittances from the United States in more than 10 years.
 The Pew report found that illegal immigration to the United States had dropped to about 500,000 annually since 2005 from an average yearly rate of 800,000 from 2000 to 2004. Since 2000, the average number of legal immigrants entering the United States each year has remained steady at about 600,000 to 700,000.
 At a news conference on Thursday, the report's authors said some 58 percent of the illegal immigrants living in the United States are from Mexico, more than any other country by far. 
 Migrant flows from Mexico have been erratic over much of the past decade, said Jeffrey S. Passel of the Pew center, peaking in 2000, dropping in 2002, and surging strongly since 2004. 
 From 2007 to 2008, however, Mr. Passel said, census data showed the increase among illegal Mexicans was stagnant at about seven million people. 
 There was a marked decrease last year, Mr. Passel said, in the numbers of illegal immigrants from the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean, which make up about 22 percent of the illegal population. That population had also grown erratically in the past decade from 1.8 million in 2000 to 3 million in 2007. This year, according to the Pew report, the numbers dropped to 2.6 million. 
 Border Patrol officials and groups advocating tougher immigration controls attributed the trend to crackdowns that include record numbers of workplace raids and deportations.
 The Border Patrol's arrest figures give some substance to that conclusion. An agency spokesman, Jason Cilberti, said the latest arrest figures showed significant decreases in the numbers of arrests along the nation's southwest border, with apprehensions falling by 78 percent around Yuma, Ariz., and more than 60 percent around El Paso, Tex.
 Mr. Passel said the Pew study was not devised to explain why the inflows of illegal immigrants had declined. He speculated, however, that the trend was the result of a combination of factors, led primarily by a weakening economy and rising rates of unemployment in the construction and service industries, which rely heavily on immigrant labor. 
 Another report by the center also released Thursday studied household income and found that the median annual income for noncitizen households -- more than half of which are led by illegal immigrants -- fell 7.3 percent from 2006 to 2007, while rising by 1.3 percent for all households.
 Elaborating on the income report, its author, Rakesh Kochhar, said that noncitizen households showing the biggest income declines were households headed by Hispanics, immigrants from Mexico, those most recently arrived, men without a spouse, those without high school educations, and those in construction, production or service jobs.
 ''If the jobs are not there, then coming to the United States might be too big a risk,'' said Jeffrey Davidow, president of the Institute of the Americas, which is based in San Diego.
 Mr. Davidow and Mr. Passel agreed that a harsher political climate has also played a role in making the United States less attractive to illegal immigrants. 
 A Pew survey of 2,015 Latinos released in September showed that half reported their lives had worsened in the past year. One in 10 said the authorities had stopped and questioned them about their immigration status. One in seven of those surveyed said they had trouble finding or keeping a job because they were Latino; and one in 10 reported similar trouble finding housing.
 The central bank reports suggested that effects of those trends were being felt beyond America's border. A report released Wednesday by the Inter-American Development Bank, which is based in Washington, projected that the value of remittances from the United States to Latin America and the Caribbean would decrease this year for the first time since the bank began tracking the figures in 2000. 
 In Mexico, where remittances are the second-largest source of foreign income after oil, officials projected a 12 percent drop this year, the biggest on record.
 Paradoxically, Augusto de la Torre, a chief economist at the World Bank, said slight improvements in several Latin American economies, including those of Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Panama and Peru, might have compelled some people in the region to stay closer to home. ''For the first time in a decade, there are economies in Latin America that are doing better than in rich countries,'' Mr. de la Torre said. ''So people who were thinking of going to the United States, might now be migrating to other countries in the region.''

HEADLINE: Short-Selling On States Can Pay Off

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
While regulators were sprinting to save the financial system last month, someone was making a lot of money -- by betting against the State of New Jersey.
 It is not clear who. But trading records suggest that in the panicked days when exotic derivatives were bringing the American International Group to its knees, traders were using the same kinds of derivatives, called credit-default swaps, to profit from New Jersey's rising tide of red ink.
 Speculators have long been able to short-sell stocks, making money when share prices fall. But derivatives are now making it possible, in effect, to short municipal bonds. If you think you are the first to determine that New York's budget is going to suffer because of the financial crisis, then you, too, can wager on it.
 The world of municipal finance has many hidden weak spots -- the very playground of short traders -- because governments are required to disclose far less about their finances than companies are. 
 ''There are hedge funds that already, for at least a year, have been getting into this,'' said Douglas A. Love, an economist and a member of New Jersey's State Investment Council, which oversees the investment of that state's pension fund. ''It's a sophisticated game and it has risks. But that's the market.''
 This form of market betting could force local governments to face up to long-simmering problems instead of sweeping them under the rug. But it could also increase the cost of raising money or, in an extreme case, drive investors away entirely if a city's finances are perceived as shaky. Already, the housing slump has left some places struggling to balance their budgets as revenues dwindle and the credit crisis takes its toll.
 Credit-default swaps are essentially a form of insurance. Bond investors can buy the swaps to protect themselves in case the issuer fails to pay its debt. But the swaps can also be used to speculate on the creditworthiness of an issuer, whether a company, a state or some other body of government, like a turnpike authority. The weaker its finances become, the more the value of the swap rises. 
 Investors can now bet on the creditworthiness not just of New Jersey, but also of Illinois, Texas, New York City and dozens of local government bodies, including the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority and the Los Angeles Unified School District. The municipalities in play tend to be those that issue a large of number of bonds and are familiar to investors. 
 In the case of New Jersey, someone bought five years' worth of default protection on the state's debt in mid-July, on a day when the price edged to $41,000, from $40,000, for $10 million worth of bonds. (Traders do not have to own the bonds to buy the related swaps.) The price then floated up gently until mid-September, when suddenly Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy, Merrill Lynch was sold and A.I.G. had to be bailed out by the Federal Reserve, all in the space of a few days. 
 Instantly, investors everywhere were risk averse, and the price of a five-year swap on New Jersey's debt jumped to $84,000 for $10 million in bonds. For the buyer in mid-July, that is a jump in value of more than 100 percent in just two months.
 Suresh Sundaresan, a professor of finance and economics at Columbia, cautioned against reading too much into such market movements. The municipal swaps market is thinly traded, he said, making it hard to know what forces are driving its ups and downs. In some places, a single big trade can affect the market.
 Many traders are not speculators, he said, but insurance companies or other institutions buying protection for bonds they hold. 
 Still, he added, ''if you have a notion about the underlying health of a municipality, and you think that this is eventually going to reveal itself to the market, then the simplest thing for you to do is go and buy a credit-default swap.''
 Statistics on trading volume are not publicly available. But market sources said that swaps are traded to protect about $1 billion to $2 billion of municipal bonds each week, double the volume a year ago. 
 The municipal bond market, meanwhile, has been reduced to gridlock in the last couple of weeks by the financial crisis. Even when the market returns to more normal conditions, state and local governments could face additional scrutiny because they share some of the characteristics now clouding financial institutions.
 With great latitude in their accounting practices, poor enforcement of the rules and a big dose of actuarial science, some states and cities appear to be running big pension funds as opaque as the complex portfolios of mortgage-backed securities that now plague the nation's banks.
 ''This kind of nontransparency is precisely what has landed us here'' in the credit crisis, Mr. Sundaresan said. ''If you're not transparent, if you're opaque, then in some sense, you're borrowing money from the investing public without fully discharging your fiduciary duty. I'm very troubled by this.''
 Like some others, he thinks traders' exploiting the situation could do some good, in much the same way that short traders serve an important function by putting pressure on weak companies to strengthen themselves or be acquired. ''To some extent, the opaqueness might be mitigated,'' Mr. Sundaresan said.
 Market sources said it would be impossible for traders to ''blow up'' a city or a state with credit-default swaps because governments do not issue stock. When traders have helped drive companies to destruction in the last few weeks, they have generally used complex strategies that combined stock positions with credit-default swaps.
 In July, Lehman Brothers alerted clients that Illinois was ''a potential buy opportunity'' for short traders, because credit-default swaps on its debt were relatively cheap. 
 Illinois has a budget deficit and a sickly public pension fund, Lehman Brothers observed. But Standard & Poor's had rated it double A -- just like Texas, which has a budget surplus and copious oil and gas money. The discrepancy suggested that Illinois had been overrated and was ripe for speculation. 
 ''They're looking at Illinois and saying, 'the spreads are low because they've got bogus accounting,' '' said Mark Ruloff, an actuary and director of asset allocation for Watson Wyatt Investment Consulting. ''The market sees through some of the opaqueness.'' 
 As the market turned, though, a trader actually would have made a bigger profit with a credit-default swap on Texas. Amid the financial chaos of mid-September, when the value of swaps spiked, Texas was hit by Hurricane Ike. Hurricane insurance for property on its Gulf Coast was available only through a state-run pool. So the price of protection against a Texas default rose even more. 
 Lehman Brothers also suggested trades on places including Florida, which was on the hook for hurricane damage; Nevada, which was dependent on the gambling business; and New York City, because its fiscal health was closely linked to Wall Street. 
 Lehman, which declared bankruptcy last month, was one of the largest market makers in municipal credit-default swaps, along with Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch. The loss of trading capacity and expertise could crimp the municipal swaps market. But other factors are driving the market's growth.
 Municipal credit-default swaps, created in 2004, mostly gathered dust until 2007. After the insurance companies that specialized in municipal bonds became troubled, credit-default swaps emerged as an alternative form of insurance. Even though municipalities rarely default on their bonds, the insurance was popular because it made municipal bonds seem utterly foolproof. That sense of heightened security made the bonds easier to sell, lowering communities' borrowing costs. 
 In May, a municipal credit-default swap index, the MCDX, was introduced by Markit, a financial data company. The index allows traders to take positions on whether government creditworthiness overall is heading up or down. Its debut coincided with the bankruptcy filing of Vallejo, Calif. The city of 117,000 ran out of money after promising its police officers and firefighters much richer benefits than it could afford. 
 That filing created more interest in municipal credit-default swaps. It also cast a bright light on the possibility that some governments had promised benefits they could not pay, even though their financial statements and credit ratings seemed fine. 
 Mr. Love, of the New Jersey investment board, has recalculated the value of the pensions promised to the state's public workers, using the method that a bank would use to measure its book of business. He found a $56 billion deficit, more than three times the $18 billion that the state was disclosing in its bond offering statements. The state Legislature uses the lower number when approving new benefits and balancing the budget. 
 ''The thing you're sensing is that the capital markets are in one world, and the actuaries and bond counsels and the legislators are in another world,'' Mr. Love said. ''And that sounds like an arbitrage opportunity.''

HEADLINE: License to Abandon Children in a Law to Save Them

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

DATELINE: OMAHA 

 BODY:
The abandonments began on Sept. 1, when a mother left her 14-year-old son in a police station here. 
 By Sept. 23, two more boys and one girl, ages 11 to 14, had been abandoned in hospitals in Omaha and Lincoln. Then a 15-year-old boy and an 11-year-old girl were left. 
 The biggest shock to public officials came last week, when a single father walked into an Omaha hospital and surrendered nine of his 10 children, ages 1 to 17, saying that his wife had died and he could no longer cope with the burden of raising them. 
 In total last month, 15 older children in Nebraska were dropped off by a beleaguered parent or custodial aunt or grandmother who said the children were unmanageable. 
 Officials have called the abandonments a misuse of a new law that was mainly intended to prevent so-called Dumpster babies -- the abandonment of newborns by young, terrified mothers -- but instead has been used to hand off out-of-control teenagers or, in the case of the father of 10, to escape financial and personal despair. 
 The spate of abandonments has prompted an outcry about parental irresponsibility and pledges to change the state law, which allows care givers to drop off children without fear of prosecution. But it has also cast a spotlight on the hidden extent of family turmoil in the country and what many experts say is a shortage of respite care, counseling and especially psychiatric services to help parents in dire need. 
 Some who work with troubled children add that economic conditions, like stagnant low-end wages and the epidemic of foreclosures, may make the situation worse, adding layers of worry and conflict. 
 ''I have no doubt that there are additional stresses today on families who were already on the margin,'' said Gary Stangler, director of the Jim Casey Youth Opportunities Initiative in St. Louis, which aids foster children entering adulthood. 
 Mark Courtney, an expert on child welfare at the University of Washington, said that what happened in Nebraska ''would happen in any state.'' 
 ''These days there's a huge void in services for helping distressed families,'' Mr. Courtney said. 
 When children are abused or neglected, they can be taken by the child-welfare system, and possibly enter foster care. When they commit crimes, they enter the juvenile justice system. In both cases, children and parents are supposed to receive counseling and other aid. 
 But when troubled children do not fit those categories, they often fall through the cracks, Mr. Courtney said. Even middle-income families with health insurance often have only paltry coverage for psychiatric services and cannot afford intensive or residential treatment programs. The poorest, on Medicaid, often have trouble finding therapists who will take the low rates. And some parents are reluctant to seek whatever help does exist. 
 Jim Jenkins, a computer network manager in Lincoln, suffered through years with his teenage son, whom he described as ''out of control.'' 
 ''I can see some parents getting overwhelmed and deciding that giving up the child is the best thing,'' Mr. Jenkins said. 
 The boy's mother died when he was 8, and at age 13 he seemed to become a different person, Mr. Jenkins said, constantly in trouble at school, making threats that led to visits by the police. 
 ''It was just a living hell for years,'' Mr. Jenkins said. ''I didn't know where to turn, and I took it on myself that it was my fault.'' 
 Finally, the police made him put his son in a hospital for troubled youth for several days, then told him about a respite program at Cedars Home for Children, which took the boy for a week, giving Mr. Jenkins, his daughter and his new wife a break and starting therapy for the boy. 
 ''After a while, you realize this is not going to end today, there is no 30-minute solution,'' Mr. Jenkins said.
 But after years of therapy, his son turned a corner, has a diploma and plans to go to college. 
 ''I was lucky,'' Mr. Jenkins said, adding that a parent with more children, a less flexible employer and little money may just throw his hands up. 
 In July, Nebraska became the last state to enact a so-called safe-haven law. Such laws permit mothers to leave an infant at a facility with no fear of prosecution. Nationwide, more than 2,000 babies have been turned over since Texas enacted the first such law in 1999, according to the National Safe Haven Alliance in Virginia. 
 But Nebraska's version was far broader than all others, protecting not just infants but also children up to age 19. 
 State Senator Arnie Stuthman, sponsor of the Nebraska bill, said some legislators had said they wanted to protect all children. 
 ''The law in my opinion is being abused now,'' said Mr. Stuthman, who said he would push for a revision. ''There are family services out there, but some people may lack the resources to take advantage of them, and we've got to take a hard look at what more we can provide.'' 
 Todd A. Landry, the state director of children and family services, denied that the involved families had not had access to aid -- most of the children, for example, were in the state Medicaid program and some had received psychiatric care -- and he noted that well-publicized hot lines could direct families to help. 
 ''Some parents had accessed our services but weren't getting the results they wanted,'' Mr. Landry said. 
 ''The appropriate response is to reach out to family, friends and community resources,'' he said. ''What is not appropriate is just to say I'm tired of dealing with this and drop the child off at a hospital.'' 
 Mr. Landry said parents and guardians were mistaken if they thought they could walk away from their responsibilities. For now, such children will be placed in foster care or with relatives, but the courts could require parents to attend counseling and might even order them to pay child support. 
 He said economic distress was a major issue in only one case, that of Gary Staton, 34, the father of 10 whose wife had died. 
 Mr. Staton, who gave up all but his oldest child, an 18-year-old girl, remains something of a mystery. His wife died in February 2007 after giving birth to the 10th child. Both parents had sporadic employment. 
 For nine months, in 2004, the children were taken by child welfare officials because their home was filthy and disordered, and the gas and water had been turned off. The family has since received public aid with rent and utility bills while Mr. Staton, for unclear reasons, recently quit a factory job.
 Their rented yellow wooden house in a low-income area of north Omaha was vacant last weekend and showed signs of disrepair, with part of the roof crumbling and a broken window covered with a blanket. 
 In a telephone interview, with KETV in Omaha, Mr. Staton mentioned the loss of his wife of 17 years. 
 ''We raised them together,'' he said. ''I didn't think I could do it alone. I fell apart. I couldn't take care of them.'' 
 ''I was able to get the kids to a safe place before they were homeless,'' he said. ''I hope they know I love them. I hope their future is better without me around them.''
 Stunned relatives offered last week to take in the children, and officials said they would probably go to two family homes as soon as background checks were complete. 
 Joanne Manzner, the stepmother of the deceased wife, said relatives had frequent contact with Mr. Staton's family, sometimes taking children for a weekend to give him a rest, and were puzzled that he had not asked for help before taking such drastic action. 
 Officials and some private agencies differed this week about the adequacy of the state's family programs. 
 ''In Nebraska, as in a lot of states, we don't have sufficient funding to provide a really strong mental health system for kids,'' said Judy Kay, chief operating officer for the Child Saving Institute in Omaha, which helps families in crisis. ''But we do have resources that many parents are not aware of or are not using,'' including psychiatric counseling with fees tied to family income.
 Some who abandoned children last month were aunts, uncles or grandmothers who had taken custody when the parents were incapable of providing care. Several families had prior contact with social workers and psychologists, but the children remained violent and unmanageable. 
 Judy Lopez, 48, and her husband took charge of her grandsons here more than three years ago. Both boys had been neglected and physically abused; now, ages 7 and 9, they have severe behavioral problems involving fighting, stealing and lying. 
 ''Some days I just want to pull my hair out,'' Ms. Lopez said, adding that like many other families, they were slow to seek aid. 
 The school suggested a free program managed by the schools and the Child Saving Institute, a local nonprofit organization, that combined counseling for parents and for the children. The boys see a therapist, Ms. Lopez said, and the problems have eased somewhat. 
 ''Help is out there,'' she said, ''but people have to know how to find it.''

HEADLINE: Moscow Says U.S. Leadership Era Is Ending

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
Perhaps inevitably for a country often lectured by the United States about its own economy, Russia is using the occasion of the American financial crisis to do some lecturing of its own. 
 President Dmitri A. Medvedev has blamed what he called financial ''egoism'' for the crisis and said it should be taken as a sign that America's global economic leadership was drawing to a close. Along with some European leaders, Mr. Medvedev has called for greater multilateralism in financial regulation, echoing a Russian position on international relations generally.
 ''The times when one economy and one country dominated are gone for good,'' he said Thursday at St. Petersburg State University during the eighth annual Petersburger Dialog, a forum devoted to developing relations with Germany. After the American banking collapses, he said, the world does not want America as a ''megaregulator.''
 Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, in Russia for the forum, said Germany, too, would ''always support a multilateral approach'' to market regulation.
 Along with the Germans and others, Russian leaders contend that poorly regulated American markets caused the current crisis. While it is hardly a new sentiment, in Russia there is a gloating quality, as the American crisis deepens.
 There has been a drumbeat of pronouncements in recent days on this theme. Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin made a speech about what he called American financial ''irresponsibility'' on Wednesday, blaming non-Russian causes for Russia's stock plunge of more than 50 percent. Of the financial crisis, he said, ''This is not the irresponsibility of some people but the irresponsibility of the system, which as it is known, claimed to be the leader.''
 In contrast to the Europeans who have also criticized lax American regulation, however, Russians are facing a financial system that has been in such chaos that regulators suspended trading on the stock market three times last month. The global credit crisis could trim about 1 percent from Russian growth next year, said the finance minister, Aleksei L. Kudrin.
 As in other emerging markets, investors are pulling money out of Russia and depositing it in United States Treasury securities because they are considered the safest place to park money. By the time Mr. Medvedev spoke on Thursday, investors had pulled about $52 billion in net private capital out of Russia since the second week of August, when the war in Georgia and political tension with the West heightened concern about political risk here.
 The criticism of American finance coincided with a rise in Russian military bluster that has been viewed by some in the West as a resurgence of the Kremlin's cold-war mentality. On Thursday, Russian generals announced plans for the largest air force exercise since the collapse of the Soviet Union, called Stability 2008, to be held next week. Also on Thursday, the deputy commander of Russia's navy said the country would build eight new nuclear submarines before 2015.

HEADLINE: Mistakes Of the Past Live Again

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris's blog on finance and economics is at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
''Reality is bad enough. Why should I tell the truth?'' -- Patrick Sky, songwriter
 As the ideas fly for saving the financial system, it is amazing -- and appalling -- how many of them seem to be straight out of the playbook from the savings and loan crisis.
 Then, as now, Congress decided to reassure investors by more than doubling the amount of deposits that could be insured. Then, as now, legislators put pressure on regulators to change accounting rules to make the financial institutions look healthier than they were.
 ''It turned a $25 billion problem into a $350 billion problem,'' said Robert R. Glauber, who was under secretary of the Treasury from 1989 to 1993 and put together the Resolution Trust Corporation, which eventually sold off all the bad assets the government received from failed savings and loan associations. 
 The raising of the deposit guarantee limits in 1980 to $100,000, from $40,000, made depositors less concerned about the health of their institution, and made it easier for dying institutions to attract deposits. Raising the figure to $250,000 now could have the same effect.
 In 1981, regulators allowed troubled savings and loans to issue pieces of paper with the Orwellian name of ''income capital certificates.'' In fact, the thrifts had neither income nor capital, but the certificates allowed them to pretend they were solvent. That let them stay in business for years to come, during which time they could gamble, and lose, much more money.
 Now banks and legislators are pushing for a change in accounting rules to end mark-to-market accounting for financial assets. They are sure that market values are too low, so why not just assume they are really higher? 
 That illogic has caught on, particularly among Republicans. The bailout bill calls for a study of the damages caused by mark-to-market accounting, and invites the Securities and Exchange Commission to suspend the rule.
 Apparently in response to that pressure, Christopher Cox, the chairman of the S.E.C. and a former Republican congressman, put out a clarification of the rule that might have persuaded all sides that he stood with them. 
 The American Bankers Association concluded that he had slapped down auditors who were forcing banks to unreasonably reduce the value of assets no one was buying. Some accountants thought the statement would not change anything. Auditors cringed, awaiting appeals of clients to let them value assets as they please. They worried more when they learned that Mr. Cox wanted to meet with the heads of all the big accounting firms, something he will do on Friday.
 This may yet prove to be a brilliant move from the most political -- and least market-oriented -- S.E.C. chairman I can remember. It could persuade Congress not to make things worse, and not really give the banks new permission to fudge their books. But even if that happens, it has reinforced the impression that this S.E.C. responds to political pressure, and that is not good. Told that I was writing about political influence and the S.E.C., Mr. Cox declined to be interviewed for this column. 
 The accounting furor came only weeks after the S.E.C. hurriedly put limits on short-selling, and then increased them. The toughening of the rules came hours after Senator John McCain, the Republican nominee for president, said Mr. Cox should be fired because he had not done enough to protect companies from short-sellers.
 Whatever the virtue of those rules, the fact that few people, in or out of the S.E.C., were consulted before they were issued led to a series of amendments and made the commission appear disorganized.
 It was almost 8 p.m. Wednesday -- the evening before the short rules were to expire -- by the time the commission announced it would extend them. Now you cannot sell financial stocks short until Oct. 18, or three days after the bailout legislation is passed, whichever comes first.
 Mr. McCain chose to get involved in the accounting fight as well, but this time he praised the commission. ''John McCain is pleased to see that the S.E.C. has finally decided to permit alternative accounting methods to mark-to-market accounting for securities where no active market exists,'' his campaign said after the S.E.C. interpretation was issued, taking for granted that the bankers had prevailed.
 ''There is serious concern that these accounting rules are worsening the credit crunch, making it difficult for small businesses to stay afloat and squeezing family budgets,'' the statement, attributed to a McCain adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, continued. ''In March, John McCain called for a meeting of accounting professionals to discuss whether mark-to-market accounting was magnifying problems in the financial markets.'' 
 This is the same Mr. McCain whose Senate career was nearly derailed by his involvement in the savings and loan scandal, when he and other senators forced meetings with regulators in a successful effort to avoid the seizure of Lincoln Savings, a thrift controlled by Charles Keating, who was a major contributor to the senators. The argument then was that Lincoln was sound, despite the numbers.
 Lincoln's eventual failure cost the government $2 billion, far more than it would have cost had regulators acted sooner.
 Mr. McCain has said that the ''Keating Five'' scandal showed him the dangers of loose campaign financing laws. It evidently did not show him there was any danger in calling for lenient accounting rules to beautify bank balance sheets.
 It is possible, perhaps probable, that many mortgage securities are undervalued now, amid the kind of uncertainty and fear that caused investors to doubt whether AAA-rated General Electric was really safe. But the solution is not to give the banks a new license to print the numbers they choose. ''Sophisticated institutions are afraid to trade with each other,'' Mr. Glauber said, ''because they don't believe each other's balance sheets.''
 To get them to believe will require a lot of capital to be injected. The plan from Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary, calls for the government to buy securities from banks for more than current market value but less than the government hopes they will be worth someday. 
 Whether it will succeed depends in part on whether banks conclude that other banks are solvent after the money arrives and the dodgy securities depart.
 On Thursday, as the politicians considered whether to push for bad accounting, the International Monetary Fund issued a report on financial crises around the globe. One part had recommendations for government action:
 ''Speed is of the essence to minimize the impact on the real economy,'' wrote Luc Laeven, an I.M.F. economist. 
 ''Too often,'' he added in what could have been a description of how the S.&L. crisis was mishandled, ''regulatory forbearance and liquidity support have been used to help insolvent financial institutions recover -- only to have it become clear later that delaying decisive intervention increased the stress on the financial system and the economy.''
 To avoid that mistake, he said, ''policy makers should force the early recognition of losses and take steps to ensure that financial institutions are adequately capitalized.''
 Patrick Sky was one of my favorite singer-songwriters in the 1960s. I don't think the bankers have licensed the song quoted at the top of this column, but it would be an appropriate choice.
 Personally, I think it is foolish for the banks to mount this campaign. It will raise more questions about the value of their assets when many investors -- as well as the banks themselves -- already doubt the numbers.
 But these are the same banks that got into this mess by creating and buying the toxic securities that they now claim are worth more than they will pay for them. Foolish decisions from such institutions should not come as a surprise.

HEADLINE: Microsoft Unveils Plan For 3 Labs In Europe

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Microsoft said Thursday that it would set up research centers in Britain, France and Germany to improve its Internet search technology, describing the move as a vote of confidence in the European economy and in the company's ability to close the gap with Google. 
 The chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer, said at a news conference that the three ''centers of excellence'' -- near Paris, in London and in Munich -- would employ several hundred people.
 He declined to say how much the company would invest. But Microsoft, which has fought pitched battles with European regulators over its Windows operating system, said it was making a major financial commitment at a time when many companies were nervous about spending.
 ''Investing in anything at this time can be a tough sell,'' Mr. Ballmer said. ''But when economic times are tough, we have to keep our faith in the promise that technology holds to transform the future.''
 Microsoft has been pushing to improve its ability to run Internet searches and to attract the advertising revenue that comes with them, after its failed bid to acquire Yahoo. Instead, Yahoo struck a deal with the market leader, Google, to share some search capabilities. ''We are the challenger, not the leader, in search,'' Mr. Ballmer said. ''But search is in its infancy, and there is so much room for innovation.''
 Google accounts for nearly 80 percent of Internet searches in Europe, according to the research company comScore; its share is slightly more than 60 percent in the United States.
 Microsoft has barely 1 percent of the European search market, according to comScore, and in some countries it even trails local search engines.
 In addition to working on improvements to Microsoft's existing search technology, Mr. Ballmer said, the European centers would focus on new types of searches, including queries from mobile devices and searches involving pictures and video.
 Yahoo, which has also struggled with the search market in Europe, is stepping up its efforts to compete as well. Last month the company announced a research and development complex in Grenoble, France.
 Google, which has a large engineering center in Zurich and a substantial presence in several European countries, is also trying to improve search in Europe. Still, its dominance is not universal. In countries like Russia and the Czech Republic, it has trailed local players.
 Meanwhile, European governments are supporting separate efforts to develop search technology, including a project in France called Quaero, and one in Germany called Theseus.
 Spending on Internet search ads will generate $28.3 billion worldwide this year, 57 percent of the total spending on Internet advertising, according to eMarketer, a research company.
 Mr. Ballmer was joined at the news conference by the French finance minister, Christine Lagarde, who took a break from discussions with President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and other European officials about the financial crisis to hail Microsoft's plans.
 Microsoft's investment in France, Germany and Britain will receive tax breaks, Ms. Lagarde said, as France and other European governments move to strengthen the technology sector under a plan drawn up at a meeting in Lisbon eight years ago.

HEADLINE: Video-Game Executive Replaces Ueberroth

BYLINE: By JULIET MACUR

 BODY:
The United States Olympic Committee announced Thursday that Larry Probst, a longtime video-game company executive, has been elected as its new chairman. He will replace Peter Ueberroth, a former commissioner of Major League Baseball, later this month. 
 In a unanimous vote, the 10-member board chose Probst, who joined the U.S.O.C.'s board of directors last month, to lead the organization for the next four years. Some of his main tasks will include garnering much-needed financial support in an unstable economy and helping secure Chicago's bid to host the 2016 Summer Games.
 Probst, 58, of San Francisco, is the chairman of Electronic Arts, or EA, the world's most successful developer and publisher of interactive entertainment. He stepped down as chief executive in April 2007, after 23 years. With Probst in charge, the company's annual revenue grew from $175 million in 1992 to about $3 billion in 2006. 
 ''He brings to us a number of skills,'' Ueberroth said in a conference call. ''We need to shore up and expand our partnerships with major companies in the United States, and Larry walks those halls well, or better than I do.''
 The U.S.O.C. receives no direct government funding, so one of Probst's tasks will be to keep the cash flowing and maintain or develop relationships with sponsors. Another key task will be to help the organization branch out in various multimedia, including developing its own network.
 Probst said Ueberroth first contacted him about the position about six to seven months ago. Right away, he thought he would be a good fit. He might not have ever had a connection with the Olympic movement, but EA has a direct link to sports, albeit in the virtual world. 
 The company has developed some of the most recognizable sports video games around, like Madden NFL, and that gave Probst a high-profile connection to sports and sports fans.
 ''The EA Sports brand is one of the most recognized brands in the video games industry,'' Probst said Thursday. ''I've been doing that for 15-plus years. As a consequence of that, I have had a lot of exposure to commissioners, leaders in sports.''
 At EA, Probst said he has spent a lot of time dealing with sports leagues like the N.F.L., the N.B.A., Nascar, FIFA and the PGA Tour. About 35 to 40 percent of EA's video-game business is related to sports, he said. With the U.S.O.C. looking to boost interest in the Olympics among 18- to 35-year-olds, Probst is likely to show the organization the way.
 The U.S.O.C.'s chief executive, Jim Scherr, said Probst would immediately raise ''our ability to generate revenue and our ability to connect with the American public.''
 Probst, who made millions as an executive at EA, attended the University of Delaware, where he played intramural football and basketball. Now, he said, he is an avid golfer with a 14 handicap, a skier and a tennis player.
 ''I love sports and I am hugely inspired by what athletes do both on an off the field,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Concern for 2009 as Manhattan Real Estate Market Slows

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
Even though the national housing market is suffering and jobs on Wall Street are being lost every day, Manhattan real estate prices are higher now than they were a year ago.
 The average price of a Manhattan apartment rose slightly to $1.5 million in the third quarter of this year compared with the same period last year, propelled largely by a few purchases at the high end of the market, according to reports released yesterday by four large real estate brokerages. 
 But the average price has fallen from the first quarter, when it reached $1.7 million. And data tracked by the brokerages indicates that the market has slowed: there are fewer sales than in the last five years, there are more apartments for sale now than in the past eight years, and more sales contracts are being canceled. Even the pace of growth for luxury apartments, long the strongest segment of the Manhattan market, has slowed. 
 ''I have great concern about 2009,'' said Jonathan Miller, chief executive of Miller Samuel Incorporated, the real estate research company tracking these numbers for the brokerage Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''At some point, you're going to see prices erode.''
 The reports, which track deals made by buyers who went to contract before the national financial crisis of recent weeks, showed that the average sales price was 8 percent higher than at this time last year, according to data tracked by Miller Samuel. The increase was driven at least partly by closings in the last quarter on four Upper East Side co-ops for more than $30 million each.
 Brokers predict that real estate prices are unlikely to drop as much as they have in other parts of the nation because the market is filled with co-op owners who have more equity in their properties and because there is a limited supply of apartments in New York City.
 ''You will start to see a softening in prices over the next two quarters, but it's not going to be dramatic,'' said Pamela Liebman, chief executive of the Corcoran Group. ''The predictions of a full-scale drop in New York will not happen.'' 
 It is already a pretty drastic decline from the beginning of this year. At that time, the record was attributed to a large number of condo sales at buildings like 15 Central Park West and the Plaza.
 The number of multimillion-dollar closings has become smaller, but is still significant. The number of apartments that closed in those two buildings dropped to 34 in the third quarter from 81 in the second quarter, according to Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist for the brokerages Halstead Property and Brown Harris Stevens.
 But these numbers do not reflect the impact of the latest financial crisis, because they track deals that were in the works for many months. It is also too soon to know whether people facing financial trouble will have to sell their homes.
 ''It's going to be some time to process what happened,'' Mr. Heym said. ''It's not like 35,000 people were given pink slips and have to sell their apartments.''
 After the stock market crash of 1987, it took two years for Manhattan real estate prices to drop, according to Mr. Miller. 
 When they did drop, the market became more troubled because the slowdown coincided with developers taking advantage of tax incentives to build thousands of new apartments. At the same time, thousands of rentals were being converted into co-ops. Many builders had concentrated on building only smaller apartments that were attractive to investors looking to rent them out. All of this inventory meant that it took until the mid-1990s for prices to recover from overbuilding.
 Although the city has experienced a building boom in the last several years, brokers and data trackers say that the market is in better shape because fewer units have been built and developers have designed a greater mix of apartment sizes.
 ''We had a huge abundance of investor-type apartments,'' said Diane M. Ramirez, the president of Halstead Property. ''We don't have that now. Our inventory has been so well thought out.''
 Prices for apartments of certain sizes and in certain neighborhoods have held their value, and in some cases have thrived. Apartments along Park Avenue on the Upper East Side have had their median sales price jump by 57 percent, and the average price of an Upper East Side apartment with four or more bedrooms jumped by 95 percent, while other apartments in the neighborhood saw small price increases. 
 Sales prices for downtown apartments remained flat except for apartments with three bedrooms or more, which dropped by 19 percent. 
 Fewer apartments are selling than in the last five years. Data tracked by the Corcoran Group showed that the number of apartments that closed dropped to 2,982 sales in the third quarter, compared with nearly 4,976 at the same time last year. 
 The number of Manhattan apartments sitting on the market is higher than it has been in the past eight years, according to the Corcoran Group. By last month, the number of listings had grown to 10,761 from 8,444 in September 2007. At the same time, far fewer of those apartments actually sold. Just 727 listings were absorbed in September 2008 compared with 858 in September 2007. 
 Some buyers have grown so concerned that they started to back out of deals. In September, the number of New Yorkers who canceled contracts jumped by nearly 40 percent, affecting 130 contracts, according to the real estate Web site StreetEasy.com, which also released a report.
 According to Mr. Miller, the key indicator to watch in the coming months is Manhattan's inventory.
 ''When we're going into this weaker period of housing, we're going in at a relatively low level of inventory,'' Mr. Miller said. ''But inventory could rise fairly quickly if the level of sales continues to remain low.''

Film Series
 HOLLYWOOD ON THE HUDSON (Friday through Thursday) This week brings more titles of interest in the Museum of Modern Art's continuing survey of filmmaking in the New York area from 1920 to 1939. Friday's offerings include two independent films made for African-American audiences: Joseph Seiden's 1939 ''Paradise in Harlem'' and Oscar Micheaux's 1935 ''Murder in Harlem.'' ''The Middleton Family at the New York World's Fair'' (Saturday) is a fascinating semi-documentary financed by Westinghouse in which an all-American family tours the wonders of the future at the 1939 World's Fair -- a display impressive enough to silence the eldest daughter's vaguely ethnic, left-wing boyfriend. And Wednesday brings two rare early talkies: a 1929 satire on the emerging sound cinema, ''The Talk of Hollywood,'' directed by Mark Sandrich, and Harry d'Abbadie d'Arrast's dazzling 1930 ''Laughter,'' with Nancy Carroll as a stockbroker's wife attracted to a free-spirited pianist (Fredric March). Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Dave Kehr) 
 'SIX IN PARIS' ('PARIS VU PAR ...') (Friday through Thursday) The most famous of several compilation films created by the charter members of the French New Wave, this 1965 release, here in a new print, features segments directed by Jean-Luc Godard, Eric Rohmer, Claude Chabrol, Jean Douchet, Jean-Daniel Pollet and Jean Rouch. The most vivid may be Mr. Chabrol's episode, in which he stars with Stephane Audran as a bourgeois couple whose endless quarrels take a toll on their young son. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $11. (Kehr)
 TURKISH FILM FESTIVAL (Friday through Thursday) American audiences have become acquainted with Turkish cinema through the cool, formalist work of Nuri Bilge Ceylan (''Distant'') and the cross-cultural dramas of the Turkish-German director Fatih Akin (''The Edge of Heaven''), and here is a festival that suggests there is more to discover. The program opens on Friday with Erden Kiral's drama ''On Fertile Lands,'' about three friends from the Turkish hinterlands who migrate to a provincial capital in search of work; banned on its first release in 1980, it was revived with success at this year's Istanbul Film Festival. Several films on the schedule deal with the evolving conflict between Turkey's secular state and the resurgence of Islamic fundamentalism, including ''Adam and the Devil'' by Baris Pirhasan (Saturday) and ''Bliss,'' Abdullah Oguz's drama about a young woman sentenced to die in an honor killing (Sunday). In Panicos Chrysanthou's ''Akamas,'' a Turkish Cypriot boy falls in love with a girl from the other, Greek side of the island. The festival, sponsored by Moon and Stars Project, continues through Oct. 11. Anthology Film Archives, 32-34 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org; $8. (Kehr)
 MOVIES
 Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.
 'APPALOOSA' (R, 1:47) Ed Harris, who directed, stars with Viggo Mortensen, Renee Zellweger and Jeremy Irons in this sly, relaxed western, which is less concerned with gunfighting and law and order than with jealousy, friendship and the perils of frontier romance. It's a somber shoot-em-up with the mischievous soul of a sex comedy. (A. O. Scott) 
 'BATTLE IN SEATTLE' (R, 1:38) A visceral fictional account of the 1999 demonstrations in Seattle against the World Trade Organization, ''Battle in Seattle'' repeatedly plunges you into the melee of peaceful protest gone awry. But its characters are rhetorical mouthpieces, and its subplots manipulative. (Stephen Holden)
 'BOOGIE MAN: THE LEE ATWATER STORY' (No rating, 1:26) Generous in spirit and nimble in technique, this riveting documentary about the Republican operative (who died of a brain tumor in 1991) reveals a scrappy genius rife with contradictions. Assembling a wealth of found footage, the director, Stefan Forbes, deftly positions his subject as both the savior of the Republican Party and the Antichrist of American politics. (Jeannette Catsoulis)
 'BURN AFTER READING' (R, 1:36) A predictably self-amused comedy from Joel and Ethan Coen with a tricky plot, visual style, er, to burn, but so little heart as to warrant a Jarvik 8. With George Clooney, Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt. (Manohla Dargis)
 'CHOKE' (R, 1:32) Marinated in the aesthetic of cooler-than-thou irony and hip transgression, this absurdist comedy, adapted from a novel by the ''Fight Club'' author Chuck Palahniuk, is clever but not laugh-out-loud funny, except for a couple of hilarious riffs. (Holden) 
 'CHRISTMAS ON MARS' (No rating, 1:25) The Oklahoma band the Flaming Lips are the stars of this dreamy movie, which loosely concerns a remote, imperiled Red Planet outpost on Christmas Eve. The lead singer, Wayne Coyne, who directed, plays a horned alien who arrives in a glowing orb and dons a Santa suit. But forget plot; it's all about the black-and-white images, bursts of psychedelia and homemade-looking but sometimes lyrical effects. And the great soundtrack. (Andy Webster)
 'THE DARK KNIGHT' (PG-13, 2:32) Pitched at the divide between poetry and entertainment, Christopher Nolan's follow-up to ''Batman Begins'' goes darker and deeper than any Hollywood movie of its comic-book kind. With Christian Bale as the big bat and a spellbinding Heath Ledger as the smiler with the knives. (Dargis)
 'DISASTER MOVIE' (PG-13, 1:30) The latest disposable parody of disposable Hollywood movies has a shelf life of about five minutes, tops, which may be slightly longer than it took to come up with most of its gags. (Nathan Lee)
 'THE DUCHESS' (PG-13, 1:45) An overstuffed, underbaked portrait of the cosseted, tightly corseted late-18th-century life of Georgiana Spencer, the Duchess of Devonshire. Saul Dibbs directs, Keira Knightley stars, and Ralph Fiennes acts. (Dargis)
 'EAGLE EYE' (PG-13, 1:58) Shia LaBoeuf and Michelle Monaghan on the run from something. From what? A ticked-off government computer, apparently. Did I spoil it? Sorry. I mean, you're welcome. (Scott)
 'ELEGY' (R, 1:48) Ben Kingsley and a radiant Penelope Cruz star in Isabel Coixet's polite take on Philip Roth's insistently impolite short novel ''The Dying Animal.'' (Dargis)
 'FIREPROOF' (PG, 2:02) In this film aimed at the Christian market, Kirk Cameron plays a firefighter who tries to save his marriage by embarking on a faith-based regimen called the Love Dare, but his wife (Erin Bethea) seems unresponsive. It's a much better attempt to merge storytelling with faith than is usual for the genre, and the amateur cast is surprisingly good. (Neil Genzlinger)
 'FLY ME TO THE MOON' (G, 1:30) Three flies stow away on Apollo 11 in this animated feature created start to finish expressly for 3-D. But not, alas, for pleasure or art. (Lee)
 'FROZEN RIVER' (R, 1:37) Venturing deep into the trenches where hard-working Americans struggle to put food on the table, Courtney Hunt's powerful, somber film evokes a perfect storm of present-day economic and social woes. Playing an impoverished mother of two who smuggles illegal aliens across the Canadian border, Melissa Leo gives an awards-worthy performance. (Holden)
 'GHOST TOWN' (PG-13, 1:43) A misanthropic dentist (Ricky Gervais), a roguish ghost (Tea Leoni) and a zany Egyptologist (Greg Kinnear): as this unlikely threesome scamper around Manhattan in this fluffy latter-day hybrid of ''Topper'' and ''Blithe Spirit,'' they resurrect the spirits of classic '30s screwball characters in Woody Allen territory. (Holden)
 'A GIRL CUT IN TWO' (No rating, 1:50, in French) A rich, textured divertissement from Claude Chabrol, a sinister master of the art, who here returns to elegant, tight form with a beautifully directed story of a woman (Ludivine Sagnier) preyed upon by different men (Francois Berleand, Benoit Magimel) and her own warring desires. (Dargis)
 'GREETINGS FROM THE SHORE' (R, 1:56) Some of the actors, notably Paul Sorvino, are better than others in this delicate summer-at-the-beach tale set in New Jersey. A teenager named Jenny (Kim Shaw) gets a job teaching English to some mysterious foreigners who work at a yacht club. Love is in the air, and a high-stakes poker game is in the offing. Mr. Sorvino is admirable as a fisherman who befriends Jenny, but some other supporting roles are rendered as thudding cliches. (Genzlinger)
 'HOUNDDOG' (R, 1:33) Set in rural Alabama in the 1950s, this overripe tale of innocence lost follows an Elvis-loving preteen (Dakota Fanning) as she dodges an abusive daddy (David Morse) and a narrative that's all symbol and no substance. Notwithstanding the scandalized sound bites that accompanied its unveiling at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival, this sluggish dawdle never comes close to being salacious. (Catsoulis) 
 'THE HOUSE BUNNY' (PG-13, 1:37) Anna Faris proves herself a fake bimbo par excellence in this breezy, ditzy comedy about a Playboy bunny who goes back to school. (Lee)
 'IGOR' (PG, 1:26) An animated twist on the Frankenstein story that never sparks to life, ''Igor'' inhabits a cloud-covered kingdom where evil scientists are rewarded for diabolical inventions. John Cusack competently voices the hunchbacked servant who assembles a female monster, but kiddies will be undiverted by the humdrum animation and a palette that mirrors the film's moral and meteorological gloom. (Catsoulis)
 'I SERVED THE KING OF ENGLAND' (R, 1:58, in Czech) There is hardly a moment in this picaresque slapstick epic, directed by Jiri Menzel (''Closely Watched Trains'') and set mainly in 1930s and '40s Czechoslovakia that you are not aware that its absurdist view of the human condition was shaped by traumatic 20th-century events. (Holden)
 'LAKEVIEW TERRACE' (PG-13, 1:46) In this silly exercise in mock provocation, Samuel L. Jackson plays a Los Angeles police officer who terrorizes his new neighbors, a perfectly nice interracial couple played by Patrick Wilson and Kerry Washington. (Scott) 
 'LOINS OF PUNJAB PRESENTS' (No rating, 1:28) This winning, witty musical comedy about an ''American Idol''-style competition with Bollywood songs and South Asian immigrant contestants joins showtime antics to sociocultural commentary without reducing its characters to cartoons. (Nathan Lee) 
 'THE LUCKY ONES' (R, 1:53) A bittersweet comedy about three seemingly dissimilar American soldiers who embark on a road trip is the latest in a string of films inspired by the war in Iraq, though aside from the opening, the only combat scenes to be found here are strictly domestic, and, in terms of its lead characters, internal. The stars Rachel McAdams, Tim Robbins and Michael Pena work so well together, adding depth and levels of vulnerability to fairly underwritten roles, that the emotional consequences of the sense of displacement their characters must deal with always ring true. (Laura Kern)
 'MAN ON WIRE' (PG-13, 1:34) Philippe Petit's 1974 tightrope walk between the towers of the World Trade Center might have seemed, at the time, like a crazy stunt, but James Marsh's beautiful documentary understands it as a work of art. (Scott)
 'MIRACLE AT ST. ANNA' (PG-13, 2:40) Spike Lee's World War II drama about a squad of African-American soldiers fighting in Italy is overlong and ungainly, but it has enough moments of warmth and conviction to make it a worthy addition to the combat genre. (Scott)'MY BEST FRIEND'S GIRL' (R, 1:43) Kate Hudson's latest star vehicle is an uncharacteristically racy comedy in which she breaks it off with a legal associate (Jason Biggs). He then turns to his exceedingly crude roommate (Dane Cook), who makes extra cash taking girls on the worst dates of their lives to prompt them to race back to their exes. Guess whom she ends up falling for? (Kern)
 'NIGHTS IN RODANTHE' (PG-13, 1:37) Richard Gere and Diane Lane fumble like teenagers and mouth some pitiful, platitudinous, risible dialogue in a soggy romance directed by George C. Wolfe and based on a Nicholas Sparks book. (Dargis)
 'OBSCENE' (No rating, 1:37) This entertaining compendium of counterculture voices documents the colorful career of Barney Rosset, the pioneering founder of Grove Press and The Evergreen Review. Mr. Rosset's remorseless crusade against obscenity laws brought Allen Ginsberg and Henry Miller to American bookstores. It also brought death threats and near-penury to its indefatigable sponsor, a feisty octogenarian who follows his own drummer, usually with rum and Coke in hand. (Catsoulis)
 'PINEAPPLE EXPRESS' (R, 1:51) In the tradition of Cheech & Chong, Abbott and Costello, Hope and Crosby, Ricky and Lucy, Martin and Lewis, Rowan and Martin, Spicoli and Hand, Riggs and Murtaugh, dumb and dumber, right brain and left, peanut butter and jelly, bong hit and roach clip comes a stoner comedy that partakes of a gentle indie vibe before hitting the hard stuff. David Gordon Green directs; Seth Rogen and James Franco star. (Dargis)
 'RIGHTEOUS KILL' (R, 1:40) Robert De Niro and Al Pacino go macho-a-macho in a thrill-free B-movie thriller (more like C-minus) that probably sounded like a grand idea when their handlers whispered it in their ears. Jon Avnet directed. (Dargis)
 'A SECRET' (No rating, 1:45, in French) Claude Miller's adaptation of Philippe Grimbert's autobiographical novel is a subtle and moving exploration of intimacy and desire in a French Jewish family before and after World War II. (Scott)
 'TELL NO ONE' (No rating, 2:05, in French) In the shortcut language of a movie pitch, Guillaume Canet's delicious contemporary thriller is ''Vertigo'' meets ''The Fugitive'' by way of ''The Big Sleep.'' This French adaptation of Harlan Coben's 2001 best seller (same name) is the kind of conspiracy-minded mystery almost no one seems capable of creating anymore, except David Lynch in his surreal way. Beautifully written and acted, it is a labyrinth in which to get deliriously lost. (Holden)
 'A THOUSAND YEARS OF GOOD PRAYERS' (No rating, 1:23, in Mandarin, English and Farsi) This modest, middlebrow drama from the director Wayne Wang is a pleasantly unrushed study of the ties that bind a Chinese father to his American daughter, and the spaces -- emotional and cultural -- that keep them apart. (Lee)
 'TOWELHEAD' (R, 1:56) This provocative satire of a culture that is paradoxically hypersexual and puritanical is set during the first gulf war in a spanking-new upscale housing development on the outskirts of Houston. In its preoccupations, this crude but scathing portrait of suburban life might be described as ''Son of 'American Beauty.' '' (Holden)
 'TRANSSIBERIAN' (R, 1:50) This handsomely remodeled variation on a cherished genre you might call the mystery-train movie skillfully manipulates familiar tropes: innocents abroad; ominous, glowering foreigners; conspiracy and duplicity; erotic intrigue. Until it fizzles in an anticlimactic train crash, it is extremely entertaining. (Holden)
 'TROPIC THUNDER' (R, 1:47) A flashy, nasty, on-and-off funny and assaultive sendup of the film industry, directed by Ben Stiller, who stars alongside Robert Downey Jr. (in blackface) and Jack Black (in itty- bitty bikini underwear). (Dargis)
 'TROUBLE THE WATER' (No rating, 1:33) While making this superb documentary about that natural and unnatural disaster, Hurricane Katrina, the filmmakers Carl Deal and Tia Lessin hit the jackpot when they meet two New Orleans survivors, Kimberly and Scott Roberts, who rode out the storm with a video camera. (Dargis) 
 'TYLER PERRY'S THE FAMILY THAT PREYS' (PG-13, 1:51) The suds that cascade through Tyler Perry melodrama more than equal the cubic footage from nighttime soaps like ''Dallas,'' ''Dynasty'' and their offspring. (Holden)
 'VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA' (PG-13, 1:36) A rueful comedy from Woody Allen about two young American women (Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall) who, during a summertime European idyll, savor numerous Continental delicacies, some provided by the equally alluring Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz. (Dargis)
 'WALL-E' (G, 1:37) The latest Pixar movie is many things: a silent comedy, a robot love story, a cautionary science fiction parable. Also a masterpiece. (Scott)
 'WILD COMBINATION: A PORTRAIT OF ARTHUR RUSSELL' (No rating, 1:10) This exquisite documentary by Matt Wolf pays homage to the soulful sounds of Arthur Russell, an extravagantly gifted musician who died of AIDS in 1992. (Lee)
 'THE WOMEN' (PG-13, 1:54) ''What is this, some '30s movie?'' a character asks in this misbegotten remake of George Cukor's feline look at female friendship and rivalry. If only. (Scott)

HEADLINE: Honda Rolls Out a Hybrid to Challenge Toyota

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Honda issued its challenge to the Toyota Prius on Thursday, introducing the Insight hybrid at the Paris Motor Show.
 ''Honda is committed to taking a leadership role in hybrid technology,'' said Sage Marie, an American Honda spokesman here. 
 The Insight is the first of three dedicated hybrid models that Honda will introduce over the next four years. In addition to the Insight, which will go on sale in Europe, Japan and the United States next spring, the company plans a hybrid sports car derived from the CR-Z concept, also being shown here, and a hybrid version of the Fit and Jazz compacts.
 Honda executives said privately that the company had re-evaluated its strategy of producing hybrid versions of its existing models, like the Civic and Accord, and decided that dedicated models, like the Prius, were more likely to be successful in the marketplace. 
 That led to the Insight, one of the most highly anticipated introductions at this year's Paris show.
 Fuel-mileage figures were not announced, Mr. Marie said, because fuel economy testing has not been completed in the United States. But he said Insight, powered by the same gasoline engine with an electric motor that is in the Civic Hybrid, should have comparable fuel economy. The latest model Civic Hybrid gets about 40 miles a gallon in the city, compared with about 48 for the Prius.
 Insight is expected to clearly outperform Prius on price, although that was not announced here, either. Takeo Fukui, the chief executive of the Honda Motor Company, said Insight would be priced attractively enough to bring its ambitious annual worldwide sales goal of 200,000 units within reach.
 ''This new Insight will break new ground,'' Mr. Fukui said, ''by providing an affordable hybrid to an expanded number of customers craving great fuel economy and great value.''
 The Insight, while the size and shape of the Prius, borrows many styling cues from Honda's FCX Clarity hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle, which is already being leased to a select number of American customers. Honda's only other current hybrid vehicle, the Civic Hybrid, will receive a facelift next year to help differentiate it from the Insight.
 The Insight name was previously used by Honda for a 66-mile-per-gallon gasoline-hybrid electric vehicle introduced in 1999, but it was discontinued two years ago because of weak sales. That Insight had seating for only two people and no trunk. The new Insight comes in a five-door hatchback configuration with seating for five people.

HEADLINE: Asia Stocks Rise Early, Then Fall

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
Stock markets in Asia rose early Wednesday morning in anticipation of Senate passage of the $700 billion economic bailout legislation in Washington, only to fall soon after the Senate had endorsed the plan. 
 Money managers and market analysts described the drop as a classic case of investors buying on the expectation of good news and then selling on confirmation of the news.
 The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong, the Nikkei 225 Index in Tokyo and the Kospi Index in Seoul had each fallen about 1 percent by late morning.
 The Straits Times Index had declined 0.9 percent in Singapore and the Standard and Poor's/Australian Stock Exchange 200 Index had dipped 0.5 percent in Sydney.
 Many traders and money managers are more concerned about House passage of the legislation than they were about Senate passage, given that the House voted down a similar bill on Monday, said Henry Lee, the managing director of the Hendale Group, a Hong Kong-based investment advisory firm. The House is expected to vote again on the bill by Friday.
 He also questioned the effectiveness of the rescue plan in restoring confidence given continued weakness in the American housing market.
 ''It's a short-term Band-Aid, it doesn't solve the root of the issue,'' Mr. Lee said. 
 Investors in Asia are uncertain about whether the final details of the legislation will be enough to help American financial institutions with their heavy losses, or to prevent the United States economy from slowing significantly, said Thomas Lam, the senior treasury economist at the United Overseas Bank in Singapore.
 ''The situation in the U.S. is still pretty hairy,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Hike Pine Mountain, Channel Daniel Boone

BYLINE: By DAN WHITE

 BODY:
''THIS is all virgin trail,'' said Shad Baker, a connoisseur of hiking in the steeply slanted backwoods of eastern Kentucky, as he dropped me off at the start of my adventure there on the new Pine Mountain Trail. ''This is probably the most remote place you can get that exists out here. You are five miles even from the nearest house.'' 
 We said goodbye. He drove off. And then I slipped into woods so thick they looked like an American jungle. 
 It was only a year or two ago that the high-ridge forests of Pine Mountain, at the western edge of the Appalachians, were for all practical purposes sealed off by their own forbidding density and ruggedness -- impenetrable to everyone but ginseng harvesters and squirrel hunters. This is Daniel Boone country, and as I set out that morning it was easy to imagine Boone hacking his way through it with a homemade hatchet and a long flintlock firearm. But I had markers to follow -- squares of pale-yellow painted on trees at eye level. 
 Mr. Baker, 35, who had shuttled me out to the trailhead in his pickup en route to dropping off a large load of bees at a friend's house, is vice president of the Pine Mountain Trail Conference, the organization behind the placement of those markers and the clearing of a path beneath them. 
 The Pine Mountain Trail, constructed by more than 1,000 volunteers wielding shovels, pickaxes, and Ditch Witches, will eventually stretch 110 miles, starting in Virginia at the deep gorge in Breaks Interstate Park, pushing into Kentucky through one of the Southeast's largest stretches of contiguous wilderness, and ending in the Cumberland Gap. The trail opens up a hidden landscape of spectacular gorges, waterfalls, rhododendron tunnels and plants found nowhere else on earth.
 So far, 48 miles are complete and open to the public, including the 16-mile Highland portion I was setting out to hike, a section promising wildflowers, encounters with forest creatures and -- where the trees clear at the tops of rocky ridges -- some of the best 360-degree sunset views in Kentucky. 
 I was only an hour and a half by rental car from the Tri-Cities Regional Airport in Blountville, Tenn., but Mr. Baker had assured me that I would be traveling back to a wilderness world much as it was 240 years ago, when Boone first arrived here. And as I began my hike on the narrow trail into this land of ancient rock slides, mansion-sized boulders and knife-edge drops, I began to appreciate the patience and resolve of the pioneer adventurers. 
 I had started late in the afternoon, planning this first day to go only three-quarters of a mile to the place marked on my map as the Flamingo shelter. It turned out to be a three-sided cabin with welcoming twig wreaths on the walls, and one of the cleanest backcountry shelters anywhere. Even the latrine smelled like freshly cut pine sap. 
 Still, when the sun fell, there was no forgetting that this was wild Kentucky. At 1 a.m., the forest beyond the shelter was black and the whippoorwills were asking the same scary question over and over: ''Whip ... or wheel? Whip .. or wheel?'' (Campers should not bother fiddling with their BlackBerrys or cellphones. In many parts of the mountain, reception stops dead.)
 At first light, I was out on the trail where it passed through a colonnade of trees, and then onto boggy ground where water ticked beneath my feet. The place felt like a nature preserve. In a sense, it's true; the rocks around this land are so steep and forbidding that they protect native populations of deer and turkey, along with rare habitat for the rose pagonia. 
 While parts of Kentucky show the devastation of strip mining and mountain-top removal, Pine Mountain seemed to be mostly scar-free, although virtually all of the forest that I saw was second growth. The forest was logged long ago, and the mighty American chestnut, prominent here in Boone's time, is nearly gone, victim of a blight in the first half of the 20th century. 
 A surprise lay around every bend. When I was there it was early summer, and bright-yellow viburnum bushes, pale-blue lady-slippers and dark-pink mountain laurel were in bloom. Late in the morning I arrived at Eagle Arch rock, which looked, from above, like an enchanted boulder floating over the forest canopy. 
 At High Rock, three hours' walk from the shelter, I climbed up, peered over a mountain ledge and found myself staring into green. Down in the valley, the magnolias, basswoods, maples and hemlocks were pressed so tightly together that they looked like an undifferentiated clump. Out beyond them was the Cumberland Plateau, where I saw farms, roads and the community of Whitesburg. On clear days you can see for 70 miles from here. 
 The animals were another surprise. In overrun recreation areas, the deer are so tame they will eat Keebler Club Crackers from your hand. On Pine Mountain, white-tailed deer fled in terror from the sight of me, crashing through underbrush and scrambling over near-vertical hills to get away. 
 I stumbled into a parade of ladybugs, almost tripped over a three-foot-long snake, and interrupted a pair of amorous toads. I was momentarily engulfed in a cloud of spicebush swallowtail butterflies -- at first I thought they were falling leaves. 
 In rare moments when I wasn't meeting animals, I was seeing or hearing their signs: fresh raccoon prints in the mud, vast piles of mystery animal dung, the knock of a pileated woodpecker's beak on a tree. 
 Boone delighted in all these things, but he also spoke of melancholy, danger and ''inconveniences'' in the forest. If you want to channel that side of wild Kentucky -- and give yourself some authentic frontier shivers -- put your orienteering gear away in your pockets, leave the trail and walk a short distance into the dense woods. Allow yourself to feel disoriented for a moment.
 But don't let yourself get really lost. In a moment of carelessness -- and having broken every sensible woodsman's rules by traveling alone and without my GPS receiver -- I lost the path in a section where there were few blazes. The backwoods went from beguiling to menacing. I found myself in a welter of nettles, thorn bushes, slick rock beds with streams slipping down them, and ravines that seemed to have no bottoms. And acutely conscious of the ''huffa-huffa-squonk'' of a hidden black bear snorting at me from somewhere not far away. 
 I eventually found my way back (and Mr. Baker said recently that more markers had since been painted in that section of the trail). But in such moments of disorientation, it is easy to see why this lovely but confounding landscape was called ''the dark and bloody ground,'' a name of uncertain origin that goes back for centuries. 
 The name is appropriate, considering the area's past. The Highland section crosses a burial grounds at Indian Grave Gap and finally comes to a dead halt at Pound Gap, site of a somewhat bloody, half-hour-long Civil War skirmish in March 1862 involving Brig. Gen. James A. Garfield, later the president of the United States.
 Midway on the Highland section, there is another overnight shelter for those who are wise enough not to try to attempt the full 16 miles in one day, as I did. (''You missed a lot,'' Mr. Baker told me when I checked in with him later. ''You didn't give yourself enough time to smell the roses.'' And I knew he was right.) 
 When I emerged from the forest, I was ready for a good meal and a rest, and I found both of them in Whitesburg, a city of 3,000 people beneath Pine Mountain. There were few choices for a tired, hungry hiker, but all of them were sound. The stately Salyer House Bed and Breakfast had jaw-dropping views of the surrounding mountains. At the nearbyCourthouse Cafe, my rib-eye steak and Tanglewood pie -- a tasty, borderline-illegal combination of bananas, pie crust, whipped cream, blueberries and cream cheese -- cost less than $20. I also sampled a frothy bourbon-flavored beer, strictly for palates more adventurous than mine. 
 Whitesburg is a good place to meet people who have an unbreakable relationship with this landscape. 
 ''The mountains are so close on, they're almost hugging you,'' said Joel Beverly, 34, who co-owns Summit City Lounge, a cafe, bourbon-tasting-bar and Americana music spot downtown. ''When I go to areas that aren't so crammed in, I almost feel lost.'' 
 The next day, I took a ''Goodbye, Whitesburg'' hike with Mr. Beverly's wife and co-owner of Summit City, Amelia Kirby, 30. She's also a documentary and radio producer based at Appalshop, an arts and culture organization that operates out of a rambling barnlike building in Whitesburg. Appalshop celebrates the land and people of Appalachia without ignoring economic problems, environmental issues and social concerns.
 We walked up a road toward a reclaimed former strip mine, accompanied by Ms. Kirby's dog, Maysie. On a hilltop, a ladybug alighted on a coal lump. When viewed from above, through the fog, the stretch of Pine Mountain that I'd hiked looked like a green archipelago.
 Ms. Kirby compared our vista to her view from the plane when descending into the Virgin Islands. 
 ''Joel and I left as young people,'' she said, ''and didn't want to stay away. You get back into the mountains, and you have an 'ahhhh' feeling -- like you're nestled into it.'' 
 IF YOU GO
 The first 48 miles of the Pine Mountain Trail (www.pinemountaintrail.com), running along the thickly forested Pine Mountain ridge of eastern Kentucky, were opened to the public this year. The full trail will be 110 miles long, with primitive camping and backcountry shelters; completion is expected in 2012. The trail will also be incorporated into the Great Eastern Trail -- a counterpart of the more easterly Appalachian Trail -- that is being assembled from existing and new trails and is eventually to reach 2,000 miles, from Sylacauga, Ala., to the Finger Lakes region of New York. 
 Although the Pine Mountain Trail traverses some of the most rugged country east of the Mississippi River, it is only about an hour and a half by car from the Tri-Cities Regional Airport in Blountville, Tenn. Rental cars are available at the airport. 
 To begin hiking the 16-mile Highland section at its southern end, take Route 119 south from Whitesburg, Ky., for 25 miles and turn in at Kingdom Come State Park. The trailhead is across the road from the Kingdom Come parking lot. 
 Hikers can also arrange for a shuttle to the trail head, at a recommended donation of $15 to $25 per person, depending on the length of the drive. For information, call Shad Baker at (606) 633-2362.
 Here are some services in Whitesburg, the most convenient nearby town: 
 Salyer House/Whitesburg Bed and Breakfast, 6 Hayes Street, (606) 633-2261; doubles starting at $129. 
 Courthouse Cafe, 127 Main Street; (606) 633-5859. My rib-eye steak was $12.95. 
 Summit City Lounge, 214 Main Street; (606) 633-2715; www.summitcitylounge.com.

HEADLINE: Factory Orders Fell 4% in August

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Orders to American factories plunged by the largest amount in nearly two years in August as credit strains began to hit manufacturing with full force.
 The Commerce Department reported that orders for manufactured goods dropped 4 percent in August, compared with July. 
 That was a much worse performance than the 2.5 percent decline that economists had expected. It was the biggest setback since a 4.8 percent plunge in October 2006.
 The weakness was led by big declines in orders for aircraft, down 38.1 percent, and autos, which fell 10.6 percent, the worst performance in nearly six years.
 Orders for nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft, considered a good indication of business investment plans, fell 2.4 percent, the biggest setback in this category in 19 months. Businesses are slashing their investment plans in the weak economy, and growing credit strains are making it hard for companies to get loans to expand and modernize.
 The Senate approved on Wednesday an administration-backed bill to provide $700 billion to the Treasury Department to buy bad mortgage debt from the financial system as a way to get banks to resume more normal lending operations.
 Analysts are concerned that the economy is so stretched, however, that the country is headed for a recession even with the largest government market intervention since the Great Depression.
 An earlier report Thursday showed the number of newly laid-off workers filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose to 497,000 last week, an increase of 1,000 from the previous week. It was the highest level for jobless claims since just after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks seven years ago.
 The government is scheduled to release figures Friday on unemployment in September. The expectation is they will show layoffs rose by 100,000, the largest increase this year, with the unemployment rate holding at 6.1 percent.
 The report on manufactured goods showed that orders for durable goods, items expected to last three years, dropped by 4.8 percent in August. Orders for nondurable goods, like petroleum products, food and clothing, fell by 3.3 percent.
 The dismal report on orders for August followed a report on Wednesday from the Institute for Supply Management showing that manufacturing activity fell to the lowest level since the 2001 attacks.

 SUICIDE BOMBERS IN IRAQ
 Kill 20 During Religious Holiday
 Suicide bombers killed about two dozen people in attacks on two Shiite mosques in east Baghdad during Id al-Fitr, the holiday that marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan. It was the second attack this week during the holiday, which is celebrated at different times by different Sunni and Shiite congregations. PAGE A14
 RUSSIA FAULTS U.S. FOR CRISIS
 As the global credit crisis deepened, Russia sounded a gloating tone. President Dmitri A. Medvedev blamed what he called financial ''egoism'' for the turmoil in the markets. Mr. Medvedev said it should be taken as a sign that America's global economic leadership was drawing to a close. ''The times when one economy and one country dominated are gone for good,'' he said at a forum in Moscow. PAGE A6 
 BRITAIN'S TOP POLICE OFFICER RESIGNS
 Sir Ian Blair, above, Britain's most powerful police officer, stepped down from his post, and said he had been pushed out by the mayor of London. His tenure as the head of the Metropolitan Police has been a rocky one, and an accidental police shooting in the aftermath of the London bombings in 2005 only made things worse. Despite the mistakes the department made, no police officers resigned after the incident. Recently, Sir Ian has been feuding with two Asian officers, who have accused him of presiding over a force rife with racial discrimination. PAGE A14
 ALBANIANS ADJUST TO ITALIAN LIFE
 After Albania's Communist dictatorship collapsed in the 1990s, tens of thousands of Albanians arrived in Italy, and many became skilled vineyard workers. Many of them are slowly becoming part of the country's middle class, although there is culture clash: for starters, the observant Muslims among them must literally refrain from partaking in the fruits of their labor. PAGE A11
 ATTACKS UNMASK DISTRUST OF POLICE
 The wave of terrorist violence in India -- seven attacks in four months, in which about 150 people have been killed -- has placed pressure on the country's law enforcement authorities. The police have responded by embarking on an aggressive manhunt and have presented to the public a swiftly assembled portrait of a homegrown Islamist terrorism network. But the official account of events has divided the nation and revealed a general distrust of law enforcement. PAGE A8

 BORDER PATROL AND LOSS OF JOBS 
 Lower Illegal Entries to U.S.
 A report released by the Pew Hispanic Center indicated that fewer people were trying to enter the United States illegally and that the number living here illegally had declined. Experts said the loss of low-wage jobs in the American economy, combined with intensified enforcement at the border and at workplaces across the country, had caused those who might be considering an illegal border crossing to think twice before risking what has become an increasingly dangerous journey. PAGE A17
 POPULIST STRAIN TUGS G.O.P.
 The fact that Republicans in the Senate endorsed the financial rescue plan by more than two to one while those in the House opposed it by the same ratio cannot be explained simply by the tax-break sweeteners that the Senate added. Instead, the contrast says a lot about the modern Republican Party. House Republicans better reflect the party's grass roots in their districts than senators, who represent entire states, Jackie Calmes writes in a Political Memo. PAGE A22
 TORTURE CASE TESTS U.S. LAW
 Charles McArthur Emmanuel, the son of the former Liberian president Charles Taylor, is accused of commanding a military unit known as the Demon Forces, which prosecutors say tortured opponents of Mr. Taylor's regime. ''They would stab us with their weapons,'' said one of the seven witnessesat Mr. Emmanuel's trial in Miami, which marks the first test of a 1994 law that makes it a crime for United States citizens to commit torture overseas.

 A LITTLE TOO QUIET ON THE SUN
 The sun has been strangely unblemished this year. On more than 200 days so far this year, no sunspots were spotted. The sun goes through a regular 11-year cycle, and it is now emerging from the quietest part of the cycle, or solar minimum. But even for this phase it has been unusually quiet. Scientists are not sure why the minimum has been especially minimal this time around, and the episode is even playing into the global warming debate. PAGE A21
 AMTRAK DOES WELL IN CONGRESS
 Congress has given final approval to a bill that could nearly double Amtrak's annual subsidy, which in recent years has been just over $1 billion, and that will require new safety equipment on rail lines around the country to prevent collisions like the one that killed 25 people last month in Los Angeles.

 A BIG SHIP RETURNS HOME,
 Without a Hitch
 When the aircraft carrier Intrepid left its berth on the West Side of Manhattan two years ago for renovations on Staten Island, it promptly became stuck in the mud. The 65-year-old carrier, which serves as a military history museum, returned to its old home at Pier 86 off West 46th Street accompanied by tugboats, sightseeing craft and police vessels -- but far less drama. ''You couldn't have called it better,'' the museum's president said. ''The weather was just right.'' PAGE B2

 A ONCE TROUBLED LENDER 
 Is Now the Safest Bet
 Last year, the ailing British lender Northern Rock was nationalized. Skittish investors now see the lender as the safest place for savings because its deposits are guaranteed by the government. The demand for Northern Rock products has grown so great that it was forced to stop offering most of them to new customers in order to continue to comply with the country's competition rules. PAGE C7 
 IN OIL, ECONOMIC SILVER LINING
 The price of oil had become a drag on the economy for the last year. But one of the few bright spots in an otherwise bleak economic landscape has been the decline in oil prices, which have fallen sharply since their triple-digit peak in July. Many analysts expect that trend to continue, which will keep billions of dollars back in consumers' wallets and provide badly needed support for a battered economy. PAGE C1 
 A DARK CLOUD FALLS OVER THE VALLEY
 Silicon Valley has watched the turmoil in the financial world from a safe distance. But that may be about to change. Apple's stock price took a hit as investors expect consumers not to buy expensive gadgets during the holiday season, and a Microsoft executive said his company could be vulnerable as well. ''Everyone is worried about their budgets and everyone is worried about the economy,'' an executive at one start-up said. PAGE C1 
 A CABLE NETWORK'S UPHILL BATTLE
 On Monday -- a day in which the House of Representatives rejected a bailout bill and the Dow declined by 777 points -- the Fox Business Network garnered enough afternoon viewers for the first time in its history that the number of eyeballs could be reasonably estimated by Nielsen Media Research. It was a milestone for the year-old channel, albeit a relative, fleeting one: on the same day, CNBC drew an average of nearly 900,000 viewers, 10 times as many as Fox Business. PAGE C7

 NICK REYNOLDS, 75
 The smooth tenor with a gift for harmonizing was a founding member of the Kingston Trio, and helped propel the group to worldwide fame in the folk-music revival of the late 1950s and early '60s. Thirteen of the group's albums reached the Top 10, and in 1959 alone four of its albums placed in the Top 10, a record matched only by the Beatles. PAGE B7
 SIMON HANTAi, 85
 He was famously reclusive, and was known in particular for abstract, often huge canvases that crackled with bold, saturated color punctuated by unfilled areas of pure white. His work explored ideas of absence and silence -- and he took those ideas so seriously that he disappeared completely from view for 15 very productive years. PAGE B7

 TRAVELING THROUGH NEBRASKA,
 With a Paddle
 Ah, Nebraska. The endless prairies. The fields of corn. The white sand beaches? That surprising idyll is the Merritt reservoir, a deep emerald lake that is the starting point for thousands of float trips down the Niobrara River, which stretches for more than 400 miles through some of the country's most diverse environments before emptying into the Missouri River. The river's fall calm is perfect for the local empty nesters searching for some peace and solitude. PAGE F1
 A PRISTINE ISLAND FOR BEACH PURISTS
 Caladesi Island, just off the west coast of Florida near Clearwater, can be reached only by boat, and there are no overnight accommodations. That seclusion means the island has about 200 visitors on a busy day, and is relatively untouched. ''It's like a little hideaway,'' one tourist said. ''It's probably the nicest beach area in Florida.'' PAGE F7
 STARTING FROM SCRATCH
 Steve and Lisa Lepito bought their beloved vacation property on a pristine patch of Prudence Island, R.I., in Narragansett Bay. It's a bike ride from the beach, and there are hiking trails that run through protected land. Perhaps understandably, they spend as much time there as possible, taking in the scenery. So what if they haven't gotten around to building a house there yet? PAGE F1

 FRENCH TASTE ON A COLLISION COURSE
 With a New York State of Mind
 Falling in love with Paris is nothing new: sometimes the number of people reaches orgiastic levels. New York is no different and had its own extended romance with the city in the '20s and '30s, when French Art Deco was at its hottest. ''Paris/New York: Design Fashion Culture, 1925-1940'' is a compact, yet kaleidoscopic exhibition at the Museum of the City of New York, writes Roberta Smith. Page E31

 Imagine your view of the world filtered through an opaque whiteness. Here you have the view of the afflicted in ''Blindness,'' the film adaptation of the novel by Jose Saramago. While the film does not, in the end, give you much to think about, there is nonetheless a lot to see, writes A. O. Scott. Page E8 
 THE RETURN OF FADED LEGENDS
 Echo and the Bunnymen were contemporaries of U2 in the '80s pop music scene. But while one is still going strong, the other faded from sight. The group returned to the stage this year with its original members along for the ride. They played their entire album ''Ocean Rain,'' the one they claimed was the best record ever made, backed by a full orchestra, writes Ben Ratliff. Page E5

 IN CHICAGO, DOUBLING THE JOY,
 And Doubling the Anxiety
 It's been a while since both of Chicago's baseball teams were in the playoffs at the same time. That makes for a lot of good feeling, but also doubles the level of Chicago baseball neuroses on display. For White Sox fans, it is the frustration with their taking a back seat for to the Cubs. For Cubs fans, it is the inescapable dread that this will not be their year, for the 100th straight time. PAGE D1 
 N.B.A. REFEREES CLEARED
 An investigation by the National Basketball Association concluded that no referees, besides Tim Donaghy, bet on games or provided inside information to gamblers. The report did find that referees engaged in legal gambling in forms other than betting on N.B.A. games. League rules previously forbid referees to gamble at casinos, but were relaxed this year. PAGE D2 
 METS GIVE MINAYA A NEW CONTRACT
 Despite the team's late-season collapse, the Mets have extended the contract of General Manager Omar Minaya. But that announcement seemed to take a backseat be a lower priority than to some of the team's other pressing questions about the team, like what to do about their unhappy second baseman, Luis Castillo, and how to prevent yet another late-season collapse.

HEADLINE: The Wild Ride of the Bailout Plan

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Senate Approves Bailout Proposal by a Wide Margin'' (front page, Oct. 2):
 We are in a financial crisis as a result of financial mismanagement by the banking industry. Our elected representatives propose a solution to the problem that entails both a huge monetary outlay and a package of tax cuts.
 What better way to mismanage the federal budget in the face of a huge new spending program than to enact tax cuts that lessen the ability of the government to pay for it? Paul J. Brayer
 Sharpsburg, Pa., Oct. 2, 2008 
 To the Editor:
 The House of Representatives on Friday gets a rare ''do over'' -- or better put, the opportunity to retract the ''financial death sentence'' on big business, small business and citizens up and down Main Street it voted for earlier this week.
 Let's all hope that these representatives are big enough ladies and gentlemen to step from behind silly and nonsensical excuses to demonstrate the courage to do what is right for the financial crisis now in play. Any behavior less will confirm the perception many Americans have of them as arrogant, self-centered cowards who are more concerned about their own re-election than being leaders. Thomas R. DeGroff
 Scottsdale, Ariz., Oct. 2, 2008
 To the Editor:
 The problem with the bailout plan is that our leaders in Congress have not given themselves time to think. Egged on by an administration desperate for some positive accomplishment to add to its dismal record, lawmakers have set themselves the impossible task of solving in a matter of days a crisis that has been years in the making and, if not handled with the utmost care, will continue to hound us for decades. This is not, nor it cannot come to, good.
 The vertiginous speed of the bill's progress -- from 3 pages to 450 in the blink of an eye -- makes one suspect that not every aspect of the bill and its potential repercussions has been gone over with a fine-toothed comb: one wonders, in fact, how many of our representatives can even have read it through once in that amount of time. 
 Strangely, the added provisions that have given the bill new life in the Senate seem either unconnected to the matter at hand (the admirable but irrelevant rider on mental health care) or potentially an even greater burden on the nation's economic health (tax breaks that are not offset in any way).
 One thing this crisis should have taught us is that markets rise and fall at the drop of a hat -- but Congress must not react to those fluctuations with the same kind of volatility. 
 We need our leaders to take a steadier, more measured approach and formulate a responsible plan that takes into account the root causes of the disaster and every aspect of its fallout. Otherwise, in place of the silk purse they were hoping for, they will only be putting lipstick on a pig. Louise T. Guinther
 New York, Oct. 2, 2008
 To the Editor:
 David Leonhardt's primer on economic and monetary policy is well taken (''Lesson From a Credit Crisis: When Trust Vanishes, Worry,'' Economic Scene, front page, Oct. 1), but seems directed at a populace that does not understand its own best interests. Why not identify what the public got right? There are important lessons there, too.
 When bad judgment causes a national crisis, policies should change, the costs should be shared, and heads should roll. But Congress's remedy for the economic crisis is to bail out business as usual.
 The voters who are calling their representatives in overwhelming numbers against the $700 billion plan see the asymmetry of this response and smell a rat. They are right to hold out for credible and fair rescue legislation.
 Adam Auster
 Arlington, Mass., Oct. 1, 2008
 To the Editor:
 One thing has been widely overlooked in the discussion of the pending rescue package. If it is again defeated, and the economy and the stock market crash, Treasury tax revenues will also tumble. That would likely cost the Treasury more than $700 billion in lost revenues. On the other hand, if the package passes, the Treasury stands a good chance to recoup at least a part of the expenditure.
 Nicholas D. Kristof (''Save the Fat Cats,'' column, Oct. 2) is quite right that based on the dire experience of Japan, the result of inaction will be a sharp long-term decline in employment and incomes. Add to that a steep falloff in Treasury tax revenues. 
 William C. Freund
 Chatham, N.J., Oct. 2, 2008
 The writer is a former chief economist of the New York Stock Exchange and a professor of economics at Pace University. 
 To the Editor:
 Nicholas D. Kristof is among the few who have even mentioned what is probably the most important bailout issue: how do we ensure that this doesn't happen again? If the perpetrators escape now with their fortunes intact, the chance of Congress's enacting ''tough measures'' next year is probably nil.
 No wonder the Bush administration tried to rush this Band-Aid through. 
 Tom Martinson
 Minneapolis, Oct. 2, 2008
 To the Editor: 
 When Thomas L. Friedman states, ''It's all about confidence'' (''Rescue the Rescue,'' column, Oct. 1), he nails the problem on the head. But the confidence problem is bigger than the credit crisis. 
 The public is right to be skeptical of a president who lied us into a trillion-dollar war, to be skeptical of a Congress with an approval rating heading toward a single digit, and to be skeptical of a Treasury secretary who initially demanded total discretionary power to deal with the crisis. 
 The case to the public needs to be made more clearly. The program needs to be better explained. The government needs to build public confidence in its solution. Clearly, it doesn't have it now. 
 Patrick Bachler
 Wilmette, Ill., Oct. 1, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Thomas L. Friedman's column is right on the money, but it does reflect a sad situation that we have gotten into over the years. We have become so dependent on credit that we can't function without paying the banks ransom for more credit. All the banks have to do is hold up credit for some time, and the economy comes crashing down! 
 For long-term survival, perhaps a credit crunch is good for us; we may learn that we have to save for things.
 David J. Maki
 Breckenridge, Colo., Oct. 1, 2008
 To the Editor:
 I'd like to speak out for those of us who have managed our money sensibly.
 Perhaps you know us? We live within our means. When renting makes sense, we rent. We buy homes we can afford, with real down payments and mortgages we can comprehend and predict. We save our money. We invest what we can, in ways we understand. 
 We pay off credit card balances. We never take out a loan we can't repay. We don't assume that our paycheck will grow. We know the difference between a luxury and a necessity. We see our culture's materialism as a seductive distraction, an invitation to waste and an expensive folly.
 And now we have lost a lot of money through no fault of our own. And for years to come, we will be paying for problems caused by others. There are many of us. And we are angry.

HEADLINE: College Teams Are Feeling the Squeeze From Fuel Costs

BYLINE: By JONATHAN ABRAMS

 BODY:
It was agony added to misery.
 Shortly after Ohio State's football team returned from a walloping by Southern California, Ben Jay, the Buckeyes' senior associate athletic director for finance and operations, said he did a double take when he received a $346,000 bill for the group's two charter flights to Los Angeles for players, staff and boosters. The fuel surcharge, which in previous years added at most a couple of thousand dollars to the bill, tacked on another $24,200. 
 ''It's kind of one of those things that you knew was coming,'' Jay said of the cost. ''You just didn't know how much.''
 Collegiate sports programs throughout the nation, from powerhouses to pushovers, were facing increasing costs even before the current economic crisis. Athletic department administrators said that was one of the most serious issues confronting their programs, which are straining to find innovative ways to stay within their budgets. 
 In recent years, the cost of bus rides for shorter trips has also increased, as has the cost of feeding teams at home and on the road. Now, when teams take commercial flights, they are confronted with extra baggage fees at check-in, unbudgeted and considerable expenses for large teams with lots of equipment. 
 Administrators at Ohio State, with a $115 million annual athletic budget, are feeling the pinch. 
 ''For each and every one of these trips, you have to make a decision on whether it's cost efficient or not and whether it's worthy,'' Jay said. ''It can't be business as usual.''
 To compensate, some programs are starting to limit the number of student-athletes who travel, and some are contemplating shorter seasons. Several college administrators expressed concern that some nonrevenue sports might be eliminated.
 ''It's definitely gender neutral,'' said Rob Edson, senior associate athletic director for finance at Syracuse, adding that travel costs had risen 7 to 10 percent from a year ago. ''It's something that's affecting the entire enterprise of everything we do, and we are feeling it across the board.'' 
 Aiming to maintain a national presence while counting pennies is like walking a tightrope.
 ''We don't have a perfect solution for now,'' said Tom Larson, a senior associate athletic director for finance at Oregon, whose travel expenses increased to $3.2 million from $2.9 million in the 2006-7 academic year. ''But we need one in the future.''
 The problem is being researched by many conferences as well as by the N.C.A.A. The cost of travel to N.C.A.A. championship games climbed to $42.6 million in 2007-8 from $34.5 million in 2006-7, said Keith Martin, the managing director for finance and operations with the association, which reimburses the colleges. 
 ''We really started seeing a spike with our winter and spring championships,'' Martin said. ''It's a combination of things, the fuel prices and the airlines pulling back on seating capacities. There was kind of a double combination where it's a supply-and-demand scenario.''
 In response, the N.C.A.A. increased the minimum distance for plane travel to 400 miles from 350 for fall Division I championships. Division II recently approved a one-time allocation of $250,000 to be divided among institutions highly affected by rising travel costs. 
 Martin added that the N.C.A.A. was also looking into allotting more time between the announcement of the brackets and the competitions so teams could find less expensive transportation, designing software that will estimate costs in determining how far teams travel and considering rescheduling contests from heavy-volume travel times like holidays to reduce expenses. 
 But beyond the championships, athletic programs are being hit hard.
 At Wheaton College, a private institution near Chicago with Division III teams, Athletic Director Dr. Tony Ladd said his baseball team was contemplating taking a spring trip to Florida instead of a scheduled visit to Arizona because the cheapest flight to Phoenix would cost $600 a player. 
 Wheaton, with about 2,400 undergraduates, has increased its overall travel budget to $334,901 from $260,761 in 2007-8. Each of its 22 sports teams usually takes one major trip a season. 
 Ladd described several solutions.
 ''Thankfully, the men and women who have been in this program value it so much and give back,'' he said. ''And you look for other ways to save. Does that mean men's and women's basketball travels together in a chartered bus? Another would be to cut back on the number of sports events, meaning a basketball team would play 24 games instead of 25. But that would be one of the last things and one of the more dramatic changes.''
 Few colleges face the hurdles confronting the Seawolves from Alaska Anchorage, a public university known for its hockey team. Every road game requires a flight. Alaska Fairbanks, 310 miles away, is the closest opponent. The average athlete at Anchorage logs 25,000 miles each season, said Dr. Steve Cobb, the Seawolves' athletic director. 
 ''Nobody cares what it costs us to get there,'' Cobb said. ''We just have to be there for tip-off.''
 Cobb has had trouble finding nonconference opponents willing to travel to Alaska. The annual Great Alaska Shootout, a preseason basketball tournament that Anchorage hosts, is usually its top draw. But because of the increase of tournaments around the country and rising costs, Cobb has had trouble filling out the tournament brackets, featuring eight men's teams and four women's teams. 
 The university's travel budget rose to $1.7 million this year, up from $1.5 million a year ago. Cobb estimated that the hockey team could pay about $20,000 in additional airlines fees for checking equipment this season. In response, the athletic department petitioned the board of regents for a one-time allotment of $225,000.
 ''We don't have much flexibility,'' Cobb said. ''By the time school starts, things have been in blood for a long time. Our conference schedule is always made in advance. We don't have much room to adjust to current market prices.'' 
 So colleges are looking to cut costs elsewhere. Cobb said he was negotiating with airlines to have them waive extra-baggage fees. Some teams are taking cheaper flights at more inconvenient times.
 ''It's sort of swallow hard and try to find more money in the budget elsewhere,'' Wheaton's Ladd said. ''It's an adjustment that has to be made. We're just in the beginning framework of this. I think this is an issue that is going to explode in the next two to three years.''

HEADLINE: For Those on the Soup Line, No Rescue Plans

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
By the time the doors open to the soup kitchen at St. Benedict the Moor Neighborhood Center, the line is already snaking down St. Ann's Avenue.
 Old people sit on crates, children shuffle impatiently and adults avert their gaze. This happens every day of the year in Mott Haven, no matter the weather, as it did on Tuesday. 
 The people who run this Bronx soup kitchen and an adjoining food pantry do not need economic analyses to tell them things are rough. The growing line and increased demand for food packages and hot meals -- sometimes from people who thought they were middle class -- is a sure-fire indicator. 
 And while politicians debate a $700 billion bailout for Wall Street, they have long lived with the fact that there is no emergency rescue for East 139th Street.
 Anthony Jordan, the center's executive director, said that while Congress tried -- and failed -- to push the bailout bill in a matter of days, it took about a year to get a farm bill passed that helps food pantries like his meet increased demand. 
 ''We want to be open every day,'' Mr. Jordan said of the food pantry. ''But my fear is with the economy the way it is, we'll run out of food in a few days and just be open once a week.'' 
 He added: ''There is no bailout for us. There hasn't been one for years.'' 
 This bleak little strip lies eight and a half miles from Wall Street. It is a parallel universe invisible to those titans of finance and their fat bonuses. On St. Ann's Avenue, a small bowl of meatballs, greens and mashed potatoes and some free condoms are about the only things to salve the sting of bad times.
 While people wait for lunch, several community health groups set up tables. Andres Gonzalez, a volunteer with the Hispanic AIDS Forum, which encourages people to be tested on the spot, said he has seen little improvement.
 ''It's all just going down,'' he said. ''Now they're cutting money for H.I.V. prevention, even when there is one new infection every 10 minutes.''
 Next to his table, St. Ann's Corner of Harm Reduction, a nonprofit health group, distributes free hypodermic needles, alcohol swabs and condoms to heroin addicts and diabetics. Often, people ask for referrals to detox programs, soup kitchens and food pantries. Volunteers there said referrals for food had tripled since last year, to 150 a day.
 Carlos Flores has been coming to this street since he and his family had to move in to a shelter a few blocks away. He lost his apartment when he lost his truck-driving job -- an insurance problem left him with no driver's license for a while, which was enough to put him on the street.
 Although he has been accepted into a program that covers some of his rent as he starts to work again, he cannot find a landlord who will rent him a place. 
 ''I'm still at the shelter,'' he said, in line with his toddler, Sean Carter. ''We're trying. We're looking, but it's hard, no lie. Now they took away our food stamps when I missed a meeting with a caseworker.''
 Given how threadbare their existences had long been, the idea that Congress had to ease the plight of bankers as soon as possible struck many on St. Ann's Avenue as preposterous. 
 ''Why should we save a bank?'' said Frances Hernandez. ''Some people don't have cards to go to banks.''
 Edwin Avent stood near the head of the soup kitchen line. Mr. Avent just finished a training program for office jobs, but has not yet found work.
 ''What about the poor?'' Mr. Avent said. ''It's just heartbreaking what's going on.'' 
 Yet, even in this place of need, there are scenes of unexpected generosity. It comes not from the government, but from others who walk the same streets with tired feet and haggard faces. 
 Anthony Echevarria and his wife, Tracy Rosado, stopped at one of the tables asking when the food pantry would open. Mr. Echevarria, a barrel-chested man, used to be a construction worker until he hurt his spine. His 5-day-old infant son lay asleep in a harness on his chest.
 ''There are people dying in this neighborhood,'' Mr. Echevarria said. ''They could be giving $700 billion to drug programs, food pantries or housing.''
 He toted a small bag of clothes that his baby did not need, and gave it to a woman he saw leaving a church down the street. 
 On a gloriously sunny day, where the noonday light revealed every wrinkled face, grimy shirt and busted shoe, a man who had little helped someone who had even less.

HEADLINE: McCain Abandons His Efforts to Win Michigan

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER; Adam Nagourney and Michael Luo contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: DENVER 

 BODY:
Senator John McCain is giving up on his efforts to win the state of Michigan, his campaign said Thursday, in the latest sign that the faltering economy has reshaped the presidential race and cost Mr. McCain support in crucial states.
 Ceding Michigan is a major blow to the McCain campaign, which had spent heavily on television commercials there and where Mr. McCain had campaigned repeatedly in the hopes that he could appeal to enough blue-collar voters, so-called Reagan Democrats and independent voters, to bring the state back into the Republican column in November. 
 But as the rippling financial crisis shook up the presidential election, and Mr. McCain's somewhat unsteady response to it appeared to cost him support in a number of recent polls of battleground states, his campaign decided to pull out of Michigan and redirect its resources to other swing states where they felt Mr. McCain had a better chance.
 The McCain campaign has spent nearly $8 million on ads in Michigan, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group, a company that monitors political advertising, and now it has no more plans to advertise there, campaign officials said. And Mr. McCain canceled a visit he had planned to make to Michigan next week.
 Mr. McCain had long made it clear that the state was central to his presidential hopes, returning there to campaign again and again and bluntly telling a crowd at a factory in Belleville this July that ''the state of Michigan, as it has in many elections in the past, will determine who the next president of the United States is.'' His campaign announced its retreat on a day that the news of his ceding the state was almost sure to be drowned out by the buzz created by the much-anticipated vice-presidential debate.
 The McCain campaign's withdrawal will free the Democratic nominee, Senator Barack Obama, to redirect some of his resources from Michigan to several states that President Bush won in 2004 but where recent polls show Mr. Obama gaining ground, including Florida, Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia. 
 The McCain campaign still projected optimism in a conference call with reporters, as senior campaign officials argued that they were confident that the electoral map presented them with numerous paths to victory in November.
 Mike DuHaime, the McCain campaign's political director, said the campaign would send some of its Michigan workers and resources to other states that voted for Democrats in 2004 but that they hope to win in November. 
 He mentioned Pennsylvania, a state rich in electoral votes where Mr. Obama fared poorly in the Democratic primary; Wisconsin, which the Democrats have won narrowly in the last two presidential elections; and Maine, which divides its electoral votes. 
 And although the McCain campaign's decision to accept public financing means that it faces spending limits that the Obama campaign does not face, there were indications that the campaign continues to be in strong shape on the money front. The campaign announced that the Republican National Committee, which can augment the $84 million in public money that the campaign had to spend on itself, raised nearly $66 million in September -- well above what Republicans had initially said they hoped to raise.
 Greg Strimple, a senior McCain campaign adviser, held open the possibility that the R.N.C. might continue to run some advertisements in Michigan to keep the state in play. ''If we see a swing back in our favor, we will re-engage,'' he said in the conference call.
 The McCain campaign made the announcement as Mr. Obama campaigned in Michigan. 
 The Obama campaign reacted cautiously. ''We'll believe it when we see it,'' said David Plouffe, Mr. Obama's campaign manager, who noted that the McCain campaign could still return to the state, or that independent expenditure groups might step in to try to fill the vacuum. ''We're not going to take their word for it. We're going to fight for every vote.'' 
 But Mr. Plouffe said that if the McCain campaign really does withdraw from the state, it will make it more important for Mr. McCain to win all the states that President Bush carried in 2004, including some where they have seen an erosion of support in some recent polls. ''It just makes their path more narrow,'' he said.
 Mr. McCain's struggles in Michigan were clear at the campaign stop at a factory in Belleville in July, where he found himself peppered with questions about his support for free trade by workers who believe it has cost the state jobs.
 His campaign officials made it clear that they intend to open an aggressive new campaign highlighting what they described as Mr. Obama's liberal record.
 Here in Denver, Mr. McCain was asked at a town-hall-style meeting when he intended to take the gloves off. ''How about Tuesday night?'' Mr. McCain responded, in a nod to his next scheduled debate with Mr. Obama.

HEADLINE: Gloom in Silicon Valley

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE and CLAIRE CAIN MILLER; Ashlee Vance contributed reporting.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Since the credit crisis began gripping the financial world, Silicon Valley has watched from the sidelines, secure in the faith that it was insulated from the coming storm.
 That faith is now being seriously undermined. High-tech entrepreneurs, investors and executives now believe the question is when, not if, the financial chaos will hurt the country's cradle of innovation.
 From San Francisco to San Jose, the effects are already palpable. This week, Apple, one of the Valley's highfliers, lost 16.3 percent of its value as investors reasonably concluded that consumers would shun expensive gadgets over the holidays in favor of lower-ticket items -- or paying down their credit cards. Shares in Yahoo and eBay are at their lowest levels in years.
 Traveling in Europe on Monday, Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, conceded that financial problems would drag down business and consumer spending in the United States -- and that many technology companies, including Microsoft, were vulnerable. 
 Other ominous signs abound. Semiconductor makers, many of which finance their capital-intensive operations with debt, have been hit hard. Advanced Micro Devices, a dimming rival to Intel, was expected to spin off its chip manufacturing operations this year to focus on processor design. Analysts say they believe the company has had trouble raising the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to make the move.
 An A.M.D. spokesman, Drew Prairie, declined to comment on the status of the spinoff, saying that the company was in a mandatory quiet period ahead of an earnings release later this month.
 The main drivers of Silicon Valley's growth are start-up companies and the venture capitalists who back them. Many say that these engines of innovation are still chugging along, thanks in part to lessons learned and wisdom gained in the dot-com crash.
 Nevertheless, a pall of anxiety seems to be spreading over the land.
 ''Funding will tighten up. We are certainly going to see some ripple effects,'' said Ron Conway, a prominent venture capitalist who has invested in hundreds of Web start-ups over the last decade. 
 Start-ups that have less than six months of cash in the bank ''better reduce costs,'' Mr. Conway said. ''I will certainly be advising my companies to do that.'' 
 Silicon Valley has recited several calming mantras to itself during the prolonged economic turbulence. People are spending more and more time on the Internet -- and advertising will inevitably follow. Blue-chip tech firms like Google, eBay and Cisco have balance sheets loaded with cash, not debt.
 Yet nonstop economic gloom in other parts of the economy seems to have frayed the nerves of even the Valley's most sublimely confident. Discussions of the economic crisis dominate conversations. Technology blogs offer prescriptions for riding out the crisis and intense debates over what percentage of start-ups are destined to fail. 
 According to a quarterly survey by Mark V. Cannice, director of the University of San Francisco Entrepreneurship Program, the confidence of venture capitalists has plummeted to the lowest level since the survey began in 2004. 
 ''Everyone is worried about their budgets and everyone is worried about the economy,'' said Jayant Kadambi, founder of Yume, a three-year-old online video advertising firm. ''These are the conversations we have these days.'' 
 Though companies like Yume claim that their business is not slowing, Internet advertising -- the revenue model for an entire generation of Web start-ups -- is perhaps one of the industry's greatest vulnerabilities. In August, eMarketer, a digital marketing research firm, cited economic turbulence when it cut its projection for Internet ad dollars this year for a second time, to $24.9 billion, a 9 percent drop from its original projection. 
 In the hardest-hit sectors of the overall economy, companies appear to be putting the brakes on their Internet spending. General Motors said last month that it was cutting its digital ad spending, after saying earlier this year that it would dedicate $1.5 billion, half its annual budget, to online advertising. 
 Jeff Lanctot, chief strategy officer at Avenue A Razorfish, an interactive advertising agency, said financial services and auto firms in particular were pulling back. He worries that if the economic woes continue, online advertising will be severely hurt in 2009. ''The digital ad industry is clearly not immune from macroeconomic conditions,'' he said.
 One lingering problem in the Valley is a dearth of successful public offerings. Only six venture-backed technology and health care start-ups have gone public this year; only two are trading above their offering price. Last year, 86 such companies went public, according to the National Venture Capital Association. 
 That has plenty of people in the Valley worrying that venture capital -- the fuel for new start-ups -- might disappear as investors find themselves without a way to cash out. 
 ''Investment in venture firms could dry up if the drought continues and venture firms cannot show returns,'' said Ken Wilcox, chief executive of SVB Financial Group, the parent of Silicon Valley Bank. Mr. Wilcox said he was concerned that the investors, or limited partners, in venture funds might begin to pull back.
 ''I'm getting more and more concerned about the next two years for the V.C. industry,'' said Tom Crotty, a partner at Battery Ventures, who has noticed investors becoming increasingly wary of risky assets.
 Many Valley start-ups have still been reporting successful fund-raising. But an increasing number of those that have raised money say they feel as if they slipped through a rapidly closing door. In early September, Skydeck, a 10-employee start-up that allows people to use the Web to organize their mobile phone calls and text messages, raised $3 million in venture capital. The very next weekend, the government took over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy protection. 
 ''When I woke up on Monday morning I was pretty happy to have our fund-raising behind us,'' said Jason Devitt, the company's founder. ''This week, I received a slew of e-mail congratulating us on raising money in this economy. Clearly there's a real awareness of the impact.''
 Like other entrepreneurs, Mr. Devitt says the recent turmoil has changed his plans. Skydeck is now focusing on building features that it can charge for, instead of free services that attract users but not revenue. He also said he would not hire new people until the company hit ''certain revenue milestones.''
 But not everyone is confident that the Valley is doing enough to adjust to the fast-changing economic situation. Jonathan Abrams, who founded the social networking pioneer Friendster, now runs a party-planning start-up called Socializr, which has only six employees and is prepared to ''hunker down if things go bad,'' Mr. Abrams said.
 Mr. Abrams is unimpressed with the Valley's readiness in general, saying numerous uninspired, copy-cat entrepreneurs are obsessed with the internal gossip and minutiae of the industry. 
 ''The economy is tanking and people are arguing about whether they should go to Demo or TechCrunch,'' two technology conferences that coincided last month, Mr. Abrams said. ''Few companies sound like they are breaking new ground. It's like, 'Here is Twitter for dogs.' And people still think they are going to get rich by being a blogger.''
 ''It seems to me like the industry is still in denial,'' he said.

The European Central Bank on Thursday abandoned its long-held position that inflation is the main threat to the Continent's economy and hinted that an interest rate cut could come as early as November.
 The sharp pivot comes as European leaders grapple with a financial crisis that has destabilized one bank after another in recent days and could drag down economic growth even further.
 Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the E.C.B., who has firmly stuck to the bank's inflation-fighting mandate since the crisis began 14 months ago, said the drastic weakening of the European economy had sharply moderated the risks of a price surge in the future. ''They have diminished, but they have not disappeared,'' he said. 
 He said senior policy makers had decided unanimously to leave the benchmark rate at 4.25 percent. But, leaving no doubt about future intentions, Mr. Trichet added that they had discussed lowering rates as well.
 The stance creates a situation in which the bank and the Federal Reserve could cut borrowing costs at about the same time to help reassure jittery investors. Many politicians have accused the European bank of vastly underestimating the effect that seized-up credit markets would have on the region's economy. 
 Mr. Trichet's hints did little to ease pressures in credit markets, where the main gauges of confidence among banks edged up again Thursday. And the euro fell to a 13-month low against the dollar as the prospect of lower interest rates diminished the allure of euro-denominated assets. It bought $1.38 in late European trading, down from $1.40 on Wednesday, and $1.3824 in New York in late trading.
 The European bank's decision came two days before Mr. Trichet and top European leaders were scheduled to convene in Paris at the invitation of the French president, Nicholas Sarkozy, to adopt common approaches to the financial crisis.
 Though French and Dutch officials have suggested responses along the lines of the $700 billion bailout proposed in the United States, Mr. Sarkozy and Britain's prime minister, Gordon Brown, ruled out that idea Thursday.
 Referring to the immense infusions of cash that central banks have repeatedly made into the financial system and with the House of Representatives expected to reconsider a bailout package in the United States on Friday, Mr. Trichet called on political leaders to do their part as well.
 ''We do all we can,'' he said. ''But there are cases where we need decisions by governments.''
 The E.C.B. said its decision to keep rates unchanged was made in the light of an annual inflation rate that, at 3.6 percent, is running far above the bank's goal of less than 2 percent. But Mr. Trichet underscored the ''extraordinarily high level of uncertainty,'' suggesting that repeated bank failures in Europe had eased the way for the shift in the E.C.B.'s attitude.
 ''Suddenly, Europeans were thrust into the center of the furnace and had to take actions to prevent the European financial system from collapsing,'' said Julian Callow, chief Europe economist at Barclays Capital in London. ''That surely would have affected their thinking.''
 The bank's shift is positive for those who think that lower interest rates globally would reduce the effect of the financial crisis and contribute to business confidence.
 The Fed is scheduled to meet on Oct. 27, a short time before the E.C.B.'s next meeting in early November, and many analysts say they think they both may move to cut rates. The Bank of England will meet next week, when a rate cut is also possible.
 Mr. Trichet also stressed that the bank could act at any time, suggesting the top central banks could move in unison independent of any meeting. 
 The E.C.B.'s new willingness to consider lower interest rates opens the bank to criticism that it misjudged how weak the economy of the 15-nation euro area had become by midsummer and was acting erratically.
 The E.C.B. actually raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point in July to head off rising expectations of higher inflation.
 Paul de Grauwe, a professor at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, said the E.C.B.'s reluctance to ease credit even as the euro zone economy contracted in the summer showed a lack of the kind of flexibility that led the Federal Reserve to cut United States rates aggressively. ''They are risking being well behind the curve here,'' he said.
 ''Holding rates will lead to a situation in Europe where we are always in the defensive pose as opposed to an offensive approach,'' he added. ''It is very different from the United States.''

HEADLINE: Surviving One Test

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
Gov. Sarah Palin made it through the vice-presidential debate on Thursday without doing any obvious damage to the Republican presidential ticket. By surviving her encounter with Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. and quelling some of the talk about her basic qualifications for high office, she may even have done Senator John McCain a bit of good, freeing him to focus on the other troubles shadowing his campaign.
 It was not a tipping point for the embattled Republican presidential ticket, the bad night that many Republicans had feared. But neither did it constitute the turning point the McCain campaign was looking for after a stretch of several weeks in which Senator Barack Obama seemed to be gaining the upper hand in the race. Even if he no longer has to be on the defensive about Ms. Palin, Mr. McCain still faces a tough environment with barely a month until the election, as he acknowledged hours before the debate by effectively pulling his campaign out of Michigan, a Democratic state where Mr. McCain's advisers had once been optimistic of victory. 
 ''This is going to help stop the bleeding,'' said Todd Harris, a Republican consultant who worked for Mr. McCain in his first presidential campaign. ''But this alone won't change the trend line, particularly in some of the battleground states.''
 Short of a complete bravura performance that would have been tough for even the most experienced national politician to turn in -- or a devastating error by the mistake-prone Mr. Biden, who instead turned in an impressively sharp performance -- there might have been little Ms. 
 Palin could have done to help Mr. McCain.
 The McCain campaign has grimly confronted a series of polls since the presidential debate last week showing Mr. Obama gaining a lead not only nationally, but in swing states. The significance of Mr. Obama's huge financial advantage has become clear as he has forced Mr. McCain to fight in what should be Republican states, like Missouri, and thus make the kind of triage decisions like the one he made in Michigan.
 The economic problems on Wall Street have posed a severe problem for Mr. McCain, moving the presidential debate to precisely the ground that favors Democrats, and Mr. Biden sought repeatedly during the debate to lay the problem at the doorstep of the Republican Party. And even if a financial rescue plan is approved by Congress, there is no reason to think that the bad economic news is going to stop: with reports of bleak unemployment numbers, more gyrations of the stock market, and the prospect of bad economic reports on everything from job losses to automobile sales.
 ''For more than a year, people assumed that if Obama was the Democratic nominee, the campaign would be a referendum on him,'' Mr. Harris said. ''The economic crisis changed that: the campaign is now a referendum on who can get us out of this mess. One of the challenges for the McCain campaign is going to be turn the race back into an up-or-down referendum on Obama.''
 And through this period -- easily the worst one Mr. McCain has faced since he was forced to lay off most of his campaign staff more than a year ago when he ran out of money -- Mr. McCain has appeared off balance. He has been searching for a message and a way to make a case against Mr. Obama, and often publicly venting his frustration at the way the campaign is going, as he did this week in a contentious meeting with the editorial board of The Des Moines Register. 
 Ms. Palin can presumably claim two victories, though modest ones. She did not offer a reprise of the unsteady responses that marked her interviews with Katie Couric on CBS News, even if many of her answers were not always responsive to the question, particularly when contrasted with Mr. Biden. Her performance -- feisty and spirited -- also might have heartened conservatives, many of whom had gone from ecstasy to despair in the period from when she was named until this week.
 ''Her performance re-energizes the conservative base,'' said Nelson Warfield, a conservative Republican consultant. ''Palin pierced the media's low expectations.'' 
 Mr. McCain has had difficulty in recent weeks trying to make effective attacks on Mr. Obama.
 A more conventional vice-presidential candidate could have used the platform of the debate on Thursday to go after Mr. Obama and turn this night into a referendum on Mr. Obama. And Ms. Palin certainly tried, attacking Mr. Obama repeatedly for his views on national security, and taxes, prompting equally passionate rebuttals from Mr. Biden.
 But she had become such an outsized figure since her explosive introduction to the country by Mr. McCain that the story of this debate was always going to be about Ms. Palin, and not Mr. Obama. It seems fair to say that Americans who tuned in to this debate watched to get their impression of Ms. Palin, and not to hear what she had to say about Mr. Obama.
 Election Day is now just a month away, and if this presidential race follows typical patterns, people are now making decisions -- and, again if this election is true to form, they will be making their choice between the two people at the top of the ticket. Matthew Dowd, who was chief strategist for President Bush in 2004, recalled when he was working for Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate in 1988, when he -- by every account -- beat Dan Quayle in that vice-presidential debate.
 ''We were sitting in the audience, I was sitting between Al Gore and Dick Gephardt, and everyone was like 'Oh that's, great, great,' '' Mr. Dowd said. ''But it didn't matter anymore. You're 30 days or so out and people are stating to look at the presidential candidates. The race had formed.''
 ''You're in a race right now that is beginning to solidify into a five- or six-point Barack Obama lead,'' he said. ''And each day forward with lead holding is not a good day for McCain. It doesn't contribute to what they really need to do. They have just a little over 30 days to start to make up some serious ground, at a time when people are already starting to vote.''
 That, Mr. Dowd said, was why an adequate performance from Ms. Palin Thursday night fell short of what Mr. McCain needed and will probably be forgotten before the presidential candidates meet for their second debate next Tuesday in Nashville.

HEADLINE: Curious About a Newcomer, but Cheering for Biden

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
The guests, Obama supporters all, started settling into their sofa seats with chili and pumpkin soup when the MSNBC host Keith Olbermann announced that it was ''T minus 18 minutes'' to the vice-presidential debate being broadcast live on television.
 The small talk was about whether the Democratic contender, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., would be too longwinded, whether the format would favor sound bites and perhaps, as a result, his opponent, Gov. Sarah Palin, a Republican newcomer to the national stage. And -- of course! -- how funny it might all be, once parodied on ''Saturday Night Live'' this weekend. 
 But who could wait for that? 
 ''As soon as I found out when it was going to be, I knew I wanted to have people over,'' said one of the hosts, Paige Bennetts, 26, an accountant originally from Cleveland who lives with her boyfriend and another couple in a Wicker Park apartment. ''I thought, 'Oh, this is going to be a good party.' We're all pretty involved in following the campaigns, so we'd be talking about it anyway. Palin brings in the unexpected factor, the suspense.''
 The debate was projected on a wall under a homemade sign of paper plates: ''Obama 2008.'' Mr. Biden's appearance elicited cheers. The sight of Ms. Palin just seemed to stir curiosity.
 But when Ms. Palin mentioned ''soccer moms,'' suggesting they might be good barometers of the economy, the comment drew a full round of boisterous boos from Ms. Bennetts and her 10 friends. It is not that they do not like mothers or soccer, but ''broken record'' is how they referred to Ms. Palin's use of terms like ''soccer mom'' and ''maverick.''
 ''Listening to her, it was like talking points bombarding you,'' said Jake Knight, 26, another host.
 One guest said he appreciated that Mr. Biden and Ms. Palin were looking at each other, unlike their running mates, Senator Barack Obama and Senator John McCain, in the first presidential debate. 
 ''You know, they've low-balled her all week so she can put together two sentences that make semi-sense and people are going to say, 'Oh she's O.K.,' '' said Erik Knight, 23, Jake's brother and another of the hosts. ''I think it was a good plan on their part.''
 The group thought Mr. Biden scored a pithy point on the economy when he suggested that the Republican tax plan would be like ''the ultimate bridge to nowhere.''
 Erik Knight pounded his fist on a coffee table and said, ''Yeah! That's right. A bridge to nowhere!'' 
 They also loved it when Mr. Biden criticized the vice presidency of Dick Cheney and when Mr. Biden said he believed that global warming was a result of human activity. They jeered at Ms. Palin when she said she did not want to debate the causes, even though she repeatedly said she wanted to clean up the planet.
 ''What are you going to clean up if it's not man-made?'' Erik Knight asked. ''What?''
 They booed when Ms. Palin accused Mr. Biden of waving ''a white flag of surrender'' concerning the war in Iraq.
 ''Look at my flag!'' Mr. Knight teased, referring to the sparkly flag pin on Ms. Palin's lapel. ''Look how big it is!''
 Still, one of the guests thought Ms. Palin was holding up well against a veteran of national politics like Mr. Biden. ''I think she's doing pretty good; I'm amazed,'' said Tim Durnbaugh, 31, a nurse. ''I wouldn't say she's winning, but she's presenting herself better than in recent interviews.''
 Julie Kalsow, 29, added, ''She's clear and concise.''
 But Ms. Bennetts said, ''It's hard to listen to her, with all the ums.'' 
 Someone else said she seemed to be referring to notes too much. And they were outraged when she said, pejoratively, that she was obviously a Washington outsider -- a none-too-veiled smack at Mr. Biden.
 In describing Mr. Biden's overall performance, Ms. Bennetts borrowed a campaign theme from the Republicans. ''He was the straight-talk express,'' she said. 
 And, according to the group, the winner.

HEADLINE: After Financial Crisis, Uncertainty and Lectures From Washington Critics

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO and SIMON ROMERO

 BODY:
SAO PAULO, Brazil -- As America's financial crisis was gathering speed, Brazil's president seemed dismissive, almost gleeful, about the troubles up north.
''What crisis?'' said the president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, when asked last month about the financial maelstrom. ''Go ask Bush about that.''
Like a number of South American countries, Brazil had been flashing a newfound confidence, one born of a deliberate push to decrease political and economic reliance on the United States. But on Monday, shortly after Congress rejected a proposed $700 billion bailout package, Mr. da Silva struck a very different tone, saying in his weekly radio address that Brazil was not immune from the spreading woes after all.
''A recessionary crisis in a country like the United States,'' he explained to Brazilians, ''can bring problems to all countries.'' 
In only a few days, Latin American leaders have gone from schadenfreude to fear. Despite strong economic growth this decade and some aggressive efforts to break free of the American orbit, there is a growing nervousness that once again Latin America cannot escape the globalized connections in the financial sector that run through the United States.
After seeming to revel in the collapse of Lehman Brothers, Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's president, skipped the opening of the United NationsGeneral Assembly last week to visit China instead, saying that Beijing was now much more relevant than New York.
But by Tuesday, after the American stock market plunged nearly 778 points, dragging down Latin American exchanges with it, New York, and Wall Street in particular, had suddenly become relevant once more, with Mr. Chavez saying at a summit meeting in Brazil that the financial crisis would have the force of ''one hundred hurricanes.''
A number of governments in the region have been working for the past decade to reduce their dependence on the American economy. They have diversified trade with the rest of the world, while also making efforts to save tens, and sometimes hundreds, of billions of dollars for times when international conditions turn sour.
As their economies strengthened and their political cooperation took off, it seemed the United States was being rapidly pushed out of the picture. Latin American leaders were standing up to America with growing bravado.
In the past month, both Venezuela and Bolivia expelled the American ambassadors to their countries. Not only did Brazil, thought to be among America's strongest allies in the region, support the expulsion by Bolivia, a major source of natural gas, but Mr. da Silva also railed against an American naval presence in the region, warning that his nation needed to put its own warships on alert in response.
Such anti-American sentiment reflects a longstanding bitterness over Washington's economic prescriptions for Latin America, policies that some countries in the region blame for undercutting them. As Wall Street itself started to unravel, some leaders seemed to feel vindicated by the collapse.
''We are witnessing the First World, which at one point had been painted as a mecca we should strive to reach, popping like a bubble,'' Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, Argentina's president, said two weeks ago.
But the financial crisis has exploded far beyond Wall Street. Whipsawing global markets are already having a ripple effect across Latin America. As nervous investors pulled money out of emerging markets, Brazil's currency, the real, plunged 16 percent against the dollar last month, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in losses at large food and eucalyptus-pulp exporters that placed bad bets on the direction of the real.
In Mexico, falling remittances from the United States are also raising concern, with Finance Minister Augustin Carstens warning that money sent home from across the border could decline by $2.8 billion, or 8 percent, this year. In Venezuela, a sharp drop in the value of the country's bonds in the last two weeks reflects fears about plunging oil prices, especially since the United States remains by far the largest buyer of Venezuelan oil despite the deterioration of relations between the countries.
The issue, economists say, is largely about access to credit, which is needed to keep Latin America's export-oriented economies humming along. ''The credit crunch and the liquidity constraints we are seeing are going to affect everyone in the world,'' said Alfredo Coutino, a senior economist at Moody's, the credit-rating agency. ''That means that the cost for Latin American companies, particularly for those with the need for external funds, is going to be higher.''
Plummeting commodity prices could also hamper growth in countries like Argentina and Ecuador, while the psychological effect of a crash in the United States is already reverberating through Latin American stock exchanges. That could lead to a reining in of household spending, which has driven much of the recent growth in Brazil's economy, especially, economists said.
Some governments are also directly tied to the American institutions they have derided, as in Venezuela, where the government has lost about $300 million in Lehman-related investments.
Ricardo Sanguino, director of the finance committee in Venezuela's National Assembly, said the losses were minor compared with the Central Bank's reserves of more than $30 billion and previous decisions to shift some of those reserves into gold and out of American investment banks into Swiss banks.
''The crisis affects us because we're not a completely closed economy, but the impact won't be disastrous,'' Mr. Sanguino said.
With increased fiscal discipline, some countries have built up stabilization funds that should help them weather the fallout from the Wall Street mess, economists said. Brazil's government has directed its national development bank, the BNDES, to extend $2.5 billion in credit to agricultural exporters for the next harvest to try to prevent a major slowdown.
Other countries in the region may struggle more. Before the crisis, foreign investment had already dwindled in Bolivia and Ecuador, where governments flush with revenues before commodities prices began declining had nationalized foreign companies and clashed with multinationals.
Argentina, still weighed down by debt, saved much less than Brazil or Chile during its economic expansion. Now it faces declining commodity prices, especially for soybeans, its main export, and will have less flexibility to infuse cash into its industries, analysts said. In recent weeks, the Argentine government, realizing it may face a fiscal shortfall, has been focused on international investors to gain new funds, and has leaned on Venezuela to refinance billions of dollars in debts. But with oil prices plummeting, Venezuela may impose harsher conditions on lending to Argentina.
Even before the Wall Street meltdown, the region's Achilles' heel -- high inflation -- was rearing its head in several countries, notably in Venezuela, Bolivia and Argentina. Economists had been warning for months that Argentina could be headed toward a financial crisis of its own if it could not get rising inflation under control.
One silver lining for some countries could be China, which has become a strong export partner for South American soybeans, oil and other commodities. If China's growth remains robust, the country will continue to lean on Brazil and Argentina for the crop. By traveling to China last month to sign a deal aimed at tripling oil exports to the country, Mr. Chavez may end up reducing his country's dependence on the American market. ''The world will never be the same after this crisis,'' Mr. Chavez told reporters in Brazil. ''A new world has to emerge, and it is a multipolar world. We are decoupling from the wagon of death.''
Other leaders, like Mr. da Silva, have gone from being dismissive of the crisis to outright incensed at Wall Street and Washington for it.
''We did what we were supposed to do to get our house in order,'' an angry Mr. da Silva said Monday. ''They spent years telling us what to do and they themselves didn't do it.''

HEADLINE: Cordial but Pointed, Palin and Biden Face Off

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY; Michael Cooper contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Gov. Sarah Palin used a steady grin, folksy manner and carefully scripted talking points to punch politely and persist politically at the vice-presidential debate on Thursday night, turning in a performance that her rival, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., sought to undermine with cordially delivered but pointed criticism.
 If the issues and positions were familiar to many viewers -- on taxes and the economy, energy and oil, same-sex marriage, Iraq and Afghanistan -- it was Ms. Palin's debut in a nationally televised debate that made for unusual theater. And Ms. Palin, a former small-town mayor, was unlike any other running mate in recent memory, using phrases like ''heck of a lot'' and ''Main Streeters like me'' to appeal to working-class and middle-class voters who feel abandoned by Washington.
 Mr. Biden, a six-term senator who has twice sought the presidency, remained forceful and composed against an opponent who proved difficult to attack, given that she is a newcomer and a woman in an arena long dominated by men. 
 Focusing his attacks on the Republican presidential nominee, Senator John McCain, Mr. Biden only occasionally lost patience with Ms. Palin's debating tactics, as when she used Mr. Biden's words against him.
 In the only vice-presidential debate of the campaign, at Washington University in St. Louis, Ms. Palin exceeded expectations in this highly anticipated face-off, though those expectations were low after she had stumbled in recent television interviews. She succeeded by not failing in any obvious way. She mostly reverted to and repeated talking points, like referring to Mr. McCain as a ''maverick'' and the Republican ticket as a ''team of mavericks,'' while not necessarily quelling doubts among voters about her depth of knowledge.
 Instead Ms. Palin emphasized her down-home qualities and her membership in the middle class, a group that she and Mr. Biden sparred over repeatedly during their 90-minute encounter.
 ''Go to a kids' soccer game on Saturday and turn to any parent there on the sideline and ask them, 'How are you feeling about the economy?' '' Ms. Palin said. ''And I'll betcha you're going to hear some fear in that parent's voice, fear regarding the few investments that some of us have in the stock market -- did we just take a major hit with those investments?''
 Mr. Biden, standing at a lectern a few feet from Ms. Palin's, replied with one of his characteristic strategies in the debate: portraying Mr. McCain as unaware or unmoved by voters' problems and as an ally of the deeply unpopular President Bush.
 ''It was two Mondays ago John McCain said at 9 o'clock in the morning that the fundamentals of the economy were strong,'' Mr. Biden said. ''Eleven o'clock that same day, two Mondays ago, John McCain said that we have an economic crisis. That doesn't make John McCain a bad guy, but it does point out he's out of touch. Those folks on the sidelines knew that two months ago.''
 Rarely has a vice-presidential showdown been packed with such political importance. Ms. Palin's unsteady performances in recent interviews turned this debate into can't-miss television, but they have also raised questions -- from conservatives, among others -- about the soundness of Mr. McCain's judgment in picking a relative newcomer as his running mate. Recent polls have suggested that his shifting statements on the economic bailout talks in Washington have not reassured some of these conservatives, raising the stakes for Ms. Palin to deliver steady, informed answers and repartee in the debate.
 Mr. Biden's aides had their own concerns before the debate, worrying that a single gaffe by him could shift the onus off Ms. Palin. They worried that even the slightest miscalibration of his tone, body language and mien could imply condescension or worse toward Ms. Palin and become the story of the night.
 With both candidates keeping their cool and addressing each other politely with honorifics -- Mr. Biden said ''Sarah Palin'' at one point and then correct himself with ''Governor Palin'' -- there was a certain symmetry to the debate.
 Both candidates have a son preparing to serve in Iraq. Every time Mr. Biden seemed to criticize Mr. Bush, Ms. Palin would mention ''mavericks.'' And when Mr. Biden criticized the Bush administration at one point, Ms. Palin replied: ''Say it ain't so, Joe. There you go again, pointing backwards again.''
 The two candidates have both faced personal challenges, too: Ms. Palin's baby son has Down syndrome, while Mr. Biden, in the 1970s, lost his wife and daughter in a car accident. As he recalled that time and the near-death of one of his sons, Mr. Biden briefly choked up -- the one moment of raw emotion in an otherwise stable debate between two fairly disciplined candidates.
 ''The notion that, somehow, because I'm a man, I don't know what it's like to raise two kids alone, I don't know what it's like to have a child you're not sure is going to make it,'' Mr. Biden said. ''I understand as well as, with all due respect, the governor or anybody else, what it's like for those people sitting around that kitchen table. And guess what? They're looking for help.''
 The extraordinary interest in Ms. Palin's performance elevated the debate into nothing less than a cultural event. Viewers flocked to their Facebook and MySpace pages to critique her answers, her poise and even her hair; others lamented Senator Barack Obama's choice of Mr. Biden instead of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, an agile debater who could go gender-to-gender against Ms. Palin. Even a ''Palin Bingo'' card was in circulation on the Internet, with participants told to check off trademark words of Ms. Palin's when she uttered them, like ''bad guys,'' ''pro-life'' and ''mayor.''
 If Ms. Palin suffered in rapid-fire news media interviews in which she was the sole person in the spotlight, she fared much better at Thursday's debate, where half of the questions were posed first to Mr. Biden -- which, in turn, meant that Ms. Palin had 90 seconds to prepare her answer or riposte. Indeed, in her political campaigns in Alaska, Ms. Palin came across as confident and on point, as she did for the most part against Mr. Biden.
 ''I do respect your years in the U.S. Senate, but I think that Americans are craving something new and different and that new energy and that new commitment that's going to come with reform,'' Ms. Palin said. ''I think that's why we need to send the maverick from the Senate and put him in the White House, and I'm happy to join him there.''
 Although Ms. Palin name-dropped several times, presumably to show fluency in foreign affairs, she did not always drop the right name. At one point, she referred to the top American commander in Afghanistan, Gen. David D. McKiernan, as ''McClellan.''
 Ms. Palin also tended to seize on a single point or phrase of Mr. Biden or the moderator, Gwen Ifill of PBS, and veer off on her own direction in her 90-second answer. Asked whether the poor economy would cause Mr. McCain to cut his spending plans, Ms. Palin picked up on Mr. Biden's discussion of energy to criticize Mr. Obama's positions on energy and talk about her fights against oil companies in Alaska.
 In response to a question about her views on an exit strategy in Iraq, Ms. Palin championed Mr. McCain's support for the ''surge'' of American troops there; hailed ''a great American hero,'' Gen. David H. Petraeus; and attacked Mr. Obama's Senate vote against federal financing for troops in Iraq, which Mr. Biden also once criticized.
 After that, Mr. Biden turned to the moderator and said, ''Gwen, with all due respect, I didn't hear a plan.''
 ''Your plan is a white flag of surrender in Iraq,'' Ms. Palin shot back. ''You guys opposed the surge, the surge works, Barack Obama still can't admit that the surge works.'' (Mr. Obama has said in recent weeks that the surge had worked beyond most people's expectations.)
 Fifty-five minutes into the debate, Mr. Biden seemed to lose his patience after Ms. Palin recalled, as she had a couple of times before, that Mr. Biden had praised Mr. McCain's views or actions in the past and added, ''I respect you for acknowledging that.''
 Mr. Biden replied by linking Mr. McCain with Mr. Bush more crisply than he had done previously in the debate. 
 ''The issue is how different is John McCain's policy going to be than George Bush's,'' Mr. Biden said. ''I haven't heard how his policy is going to be different on Iran than George Bush's. I haven't heard how his policy is going to be different with Israel than George Bush's. I haven't heard how his policy in Afghanistan is going to be different than George Bush's. I haven't heard how his policy in Pakistan is going to be different than George Bush's.
 ''It may be, but so far it is the same as George Bush's.'' 
 Mr. Biden also turned tougher in the final half-hour after Ms. Palin had, several times, referred to Mr. McCain as a ''maverick.'' 
 ''He's not been a maverick when it comes to education -- he has not supported tax cuts and significant changes for people being able to send their kids to college,'' Mr. Biden said. ''He's not been a maverick on the war. He's not been a maverick on virtually anything that generally affects the things that people really talk about.''

HEADLINE: The Bloomberg Test Of the Democratic Process

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg scheduled no public events during Rosh Hashana, which ushered in a 10-day period of reflection for Jews. When it came to reflection, none appealed to Mr. Bloomberg more than his own. Much like the queen in ''Snow White,'' he looked in the mirror and saw the fairest of them all.
 And so on Thursday, with Rosh Hashana over and the reflection very much to his liking, the mayor formally announced what everyone already knew: 
 He will collaborate with leaders of the City Council to undermine the results of not one but two plebiscites so that they may all cling to office well after the existing law governing term limits would require them to go home. Understandably, some New Yorkers have begun describing the scheme with phrases like ''self-serving'' and ''power grab.''
 Twice in the 1990s, New Yorkers approved referendums that put a limit of two terms on the mayor and some other officeholders, including the Council's 51 members. There was nothing equivocal about those votes. Now, rather than go back to the voters once again to see if perhaps they have changed their minds, the mayor and the Council are maneuvering to give themselves third terms all on their own.
 Legally speaking, they probably can do it, though they can also surely expect lawsuits. But legal and proper are not necessarily one and the same. Many in New York are likely to agree with the New York Public Interest Research Group, a nonprofit advocacy organization, which said in a statement on Thursday that ''the move is worthy of 'democracy' in a banana republic.''
 Not surprisingly, the mayor cast himself on Thursday as a champion of the people. All that he wants is to expand their voting options next year, he said; if they don't like this ploy, they can always give him the heave-ho in November 2009. But ''this is not the time for fantasy,'' he said. We are trapped in a national economic crisis and ''may well be on the verge of a meltdown.'' All he wants is what's best for New Yorkers. It just so happens that he's sure that what's best for them is Michael Bloomberg.
 On that score, he has won over many of the city's oligarchs and editorialists. Some of them have done enough back flips on term limits to qualify for the United States gymnastics team in the next Summer Olympics. It has been argued that letting the politicians alter the rules on their own is somehow more democratic than asking the people directly what they think in a referendum early next year. It has been argued, too, that term limits as endorsed by voters are merely an ''abstract notion.''
 What's really at issue for many people are not term limits themselves. In fact, some who oppose this mayoral gambit are no fans of imposing any artificial limits. For them, the core issue is not whether but how the law should be changed: by the voters who brought it about in the first place or by the politicians who stand to benefit from their own back-room dealing.
 What's really at issue is the very nature of democracy. It is about the expressed will of the people and the rule of law, which in America are supposed to withstand any peril, whether it be war or terrorism or financial uncertainty.
 Mr. Bloomberg used to say as much himself. He once went so far as to call attempts to tinker with the law ''disgusting.'' Equally firm against undermining the people's will was the Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn. That was last December. Now she's gone all wobbly. After being practically invisible for days, Ms. Quinn surfaced on Thursday to say that the Council will seek to make permanent the sort of change that the mayor wants.
 MIND you, Mr. Bloomberg said on Thursday, he still favors term limits as a concept. ''It's not that anybody is indispensable,'' he said in a nod to Charles de Gaulle, who observed that ''the graveyards are full of indispensable men.'' It's just that he now believes -- mirabile dictu, as the end of his mayoralty looms -- that three terms are better than two.
 Who knows? Maybe he won't get his way. There might be enough democrats among all those Democrats in the City Council to defeat this scheme.
 But Mr. Bloomberg sounds like a man who expects to prevail. In recent months, with the clock ticking, he has often cited the exact number of days he has left at City Hall. At a news conference on Thursday, his language shifted subtly but noticeably. He referred instead to ''the 455 days I have left in this term.''
 Mr. Bloomberg was somber in manner. But he provided, unintentionally, one laugh line. Given his Kleenex approach to political parties -- for him, they are to be used and then discarded -- he was asked what party banner he would fly in a 2009 campaign.
 The mayor deflected the question. ''This is not the time for politics,'' he said.
 He actually kept a straight face as he said it.

HEADLINE: A Curious Coalition Opposed Bailout Bill

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Senators who voted against the $700 billion financial rescue plan make up one of the most curious coalitions of lawmakers ever to share common ground. 
 It included arch-conservative Republicans like Jim DeMint of South Carolina, liberal Democrats like Russ Feingold of Wisconsin and Bernard Sanders, independent of Vermont, who is regarded as the Senate's resident socialist. 
 Taken together, the speeches of the 25 senators who voted against the plan on Wednesday amount to the Congressional equivalent of a dissenting opinion by the Supreme Court -- impassioned, well reasoned, carefully articulated views on a landmark question of public policy that ultimately reflected the position of a minority of their fellow arbiters. If the bailout plan flops, they are the lawmakers who will be positioned to engage in a chorus of ''I told you sos.''
 Their concerns spanned a panorama of issues: frustration over the lack of long-term regulatory changes in the legislation; alarm that $700 billion in taxpayer money would be at risk; anger that the Treasury secretary would not be subject to more stringent oversight; skepticism that executives of firms that seek help would face limits on their pay; and dismay that such an important bill was being rushed through Congress. 
 And, perhaps most pointedly, they expressed skepticism that the bailout proposal would be able to restore liquidity to the credit markets, prevent the collapse of additional banks and safeguard the economy from a long recession. 
 ''This package is just a very costly Band-Aid for big banks that will do very little to help patients who need major surgery,'' Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming, said in his speech on the Senate floor. 
 ''Had Congress been able to use the regular committee process to craft a bipartisan and comprehensive legislation, the resulting bill may have gained my support,'' Mr. Enzi said. ''Unfortunately, Congress has been pressured into passing this bill in two weeks by Treasury and Wall Street. A rescue plan of this scale requires a clear plan of action with a substantial chance of success. This plan has neither.''
 Some of the harshest criticism was leveled by Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the Senate banking committee, who normally would have been his party's lead negotiator on the bailout bill but removed himself because he opposed the administration's proposal at its very core. 
 ''The choice we faced was between pursuing an informed response or panic,'' Mr. Shelby said. ''Unfortunately, we chose panic and are now about to spend $700 billion on something we have not examined closely. Yes, in the end, we will have 'done something.' At the same time, however, we will have done nothing to determine whether it will accomplish anything at all.'' 
 Mr. Shelby, in his speech, laid out a modern history of the American housing, mortgage and securitization markets, explaining how a bubble in home values was fueled by loose lending standards, exotic mortgage products and complex financial instruments, pushed by financial firms that were leveraged heavily to maximize profits. 
 And in many ways, he was already dishing out ''I told you sos.'' 
 ''We did not get to where we are today by accident, it was a path we chose,'' he said. ''My warnings about the risk of basing credit decisions on well-intended social mandates rather than sound, fact-based underwriting were dismissed. My concerns about the inadequacy of the regulatory structure put in place in the financial modernization legislation went unacknowledged. My efforts to ensure that bank capital standards were designed to ensure safety and soundness, rather than industry concerns, were conducted largely alone.'' 
 Mr. Sanders, the Vermont independent, complained that the bill did not put any limits on the types of distressed debt the Treasury could buy, that it did not provide enough oversight, that it did not include adequate provisions to limit home foreclosures, that it did not really limit executive pay at firms that seek help.
 ''Under this bill, the C.E.O.'s and the Wall Street insiders will still, with a little bit of imagination, continue to make out like bandits,'' Mr. Sanders said. 
 He said the bill also did not do anything to prevent financial institutions from becoming ''too big to fail,'' effectively leaving open the potential need for future bailouts. 
 Mr. Sanders also said he could not fathom giving Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. such broad authority over so much money. 
 ''Maybe I am the only person in America who thinks so, but I have a hard time understanding why we are giving $700 billion to the secretary of the Treasury, who is the former C.E.O. of Goldman Sachs, which, along with other financial institutions, actually got us into this problem,'' he said. ''Maybe I am the only person in America who thinks that is a little bit weird, but that is what I think.''
 He added: ''This bill does not address the major economic crises we face -- growing unemployment, low wages and the need to create decent-paying jobs, rebuilding our infrastructure and moving us to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.''
 In one of the more remarkable colloquies of the day's discourse, Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, and one of the most conservative members of Congress, took to the floor to express solidarity with Mr. Sanders. 
 ''I would like to say to Senator Sanders a couple things,'' Mr. Sessions said. ''First, I think it is indeed breathtaking that this Senate would authorize basically one person with very little real oversight, a Wall Street maven himself, and allocate $700 billion in America's wealth, which I would have to say would be the largest single authorization of expenditure in the history of the Republic.'' 
 Mr. Sessions added: ''So I have to say, fundamentally, I think we have not done a good enough job in creating an oversight mechanism that will work, so I am not going to vote for the bill; I am not.''
 Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, said he opposed the bill because it did not do enough to help average Americans. 
 ''This bill sends a message to Wall Street that if they play fast and loose in the name of short-term profits, the government will actually make up for their losses,'' Mr. Nelson said. ''And the bill does very little to help individual homeowners. Until we stabilize the housing market, which is the underlying ability to restructure the economy from this crisis -- until we stabilize the housing market, and until we stem the record number of foreclosures, our market simply is not going to improve.''
 Mr. Nelson continued: ''The bottom line is, ultimately, this bill forces taxpayers to bail out investment banks that caused the crisis in the first place, and it does nothing to address the real problem, which is home foreclosures.''

HEADLINE: Edge of the Abyss

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
As recently as three weeks ago it was still possible to argue that the state of the U.S. economy, while clearly not good, wasn't disastrous -- that the financial system, while under stress, wasn't in full meltdown and that Wall Street's troubles weren't having that much impact on Main Street. 
 But that was then. 
 The financial and economic news since the middle of last month has been really, really bad. And what's truly scary is that we're entering a period of severe crisis with weak, confused leadership.
 The wave of bad news began on Sept. 14. Henry Paulson, the Treasury secretary, thought he could get away with letting Lehman Brothers, the investment bank, fail; he was wrong. The plight of investors trapped by Lehman's collapse -- as an article in The Times put it, Lehman became ''the Roach Motel of Wall Street: They checked in, but they can't check out'' -- created panic in the financial markets, which has only grown worse as the days go by. Indicators of financial stress have soared to the equivalent of a 107-degree fever, and large parts of the financial system have simply shut down. 
 There's growing evidence that the financial crunch is spreading to Main Street, with small businesses having trouble raising money and seeing their credit lines cut. And leading indicators for both employment and industrial production have turned sharply worse, suggesting that even before Lehman's fall, the economy, which has been sagging since last year, was falling off a cliff.
 How bad is it? Normally sober people are sounding apocalyptic. On Thursday, the bond trader and blogger John Jansen declared that current conditions are ''the financial equivalent of the Reign of Terror during the French Revolution,'' while Joel Prakken of Macroeconomic Advisers says that the economy seems to be on ''the edge of the abyss.''
 And the people who should be steering us away from that abyss are out to lunch.
 The House will probably vote on Friday on the latest version of the $700 billion bailout plan -- originally the Paulson plan, then the Paulson-Dodd-Frank plan, and now, I guess, the Paulson-Dodd-Frank-Pork plan (it's been larded up since the House rejected it on Monday). I hope that it passes, simply because we're in the middle of a financial panic, and another no vote would make the panic even worse. But that's just another way of saying that the economy is now hostage to the Treasury Department's blunders.
 For the fact is that the plan on offer is a stinker -- and inexcusably so. The financial system has been under severe stress for more than a year, and there should have been carefully thought-out contingency plans ready to roll out in case the markets melted down. Obviously, there weren't: the Paulson plan was clearly drawn up in haste and confusion. And Treasury officials have yet to offer any clear explanation of how the plan is supposed to work, probably because they themselves have no idea what they're doing.
 Despite this, as I said, I hope the plan passes, because otherwise we'll probably see even worse panic in the markets. But at best, the plan will buy some time to seek a real solution to the crisis. 
 And that raises the question: Do we have that time?
 A solution to our economic woes will have to start with a much better-conceived rescue of the financial system -- one that will almost surely involve the U.S. government taking partial, temporary ownership of that system, the way Sweden's government did in the early 1990s. Yet it's hard to imagine the Bush administration taking that step.
 We also desperately need an economic stimulus plan to push back against the slump in spending and employment. And this time it had better be a serious plan that doesn't rely on the magic of tax cuts, but instead spends money where it's needed. (Aid to cash-strapped state and local governments, which are slashing spending at precisely the worst moment, is also a priority.) Yet it's hard to imagine the Bush administration, in its final months, overseeing the creation of a new Works Progress Administration. 
 So we probably have to wait for the next administration, which should be much more inclined to do the right thing -- although even that's by no means a sure thing, given the uncertainty of the election outcome. (I'm not a fan of Mr. Paulson's, but I'd rather have him at the Treasury than, say, Phil ''nation of whiners'' Gramm.) 
 And while the election is only 32 days away, it will be almost four months until the next administration takes office. A lot can -- and probably will -- go wrong in those four months.
 One thing's for sure: The next administration's economic team had better be ready to hit the ground running, because from day one it will find itself dealing with the worst financial and economic crisis since the Great Depression.

HEADLINE: Bill Paves Way For Third Term For Bloomberg

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN; Sewell Chan, Jonathan P. Hicks and Jennifer Medina contributed reporting.

 BODY:
City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn said on Thursday that legislation to alter the city's term limits law would be introduced on Tuesday, paving the way for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, Ms. Quinn and more than 40 other elected officials to stay in office four more years.
 The Council's vote on the measure -- which Mr. Bloomberg has pushed for behind the scenes -- could come later this month, Ms. Quinn told reporters at a news conference. And while she declined to reveal her position on the legislation, she said she would meet with other members of the Council to discuss the bill and ''move forward in the process after that.''
 Ms. Quinn's remarks came on a dramatic day at City Hall, as Mr. Bloomberg for the first time explained why he wanted to run for another term. Her comments, and the rapid timetable she described, immediately set off criticism that a deal had already been struck between the mayor and Ms. Quinn, who has been his close ally, to overhaul the term limits law, which restricts citywide elected officials to two four-year terms. 
 Voters have twice approved the term limits, and Ms. Quinn had previously said she was opposed to undoing the voters' will. 
 Representative Anthony D. Weiner, a Democrat who represents Brooklyn and Queens, and City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr., who both plan to run for mayor next year, denounced the plan to extend term limits as a subversion of democracy.
 ''This is fundamentally about a back-room deal, substituting the value and judgment of the citizens of New York City for their own,'' Mr. Weiner said during a news conference just outside the gates of City Hall. ''This is the quintessential inside deal between two ends of City Hall.''
 Mayor Bloomberg, at a formal news conference in the Blue Room at City Hall, said that the economic crisis facing the city presents challenges more grave than those New York confronted in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
 ''Given the events of recent weeks and given the enormous challenges we face, I don't want to walk away from a city I feel I can help lead through these tough times,'' said Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire businessman.
 Still, although the mayor repeatedly pointed to the Wall Street crisis as the driving reason for his decision to overhaul the law and seek another term, it was clear that he began considering the idea and reaching out to potential supporters well before the financial tumult began last month.
 Mr. Bloomberg said at the news conference that he was still a supporter of term limits, but that he had come to believe that three terms should be the limit. Later in the day, responding to a reporter's question, he said he would not seek any change in the future that would allow him to run for a fourth term.
 Mr. Bloomberg also spoke expansively about his love of a job he has long called the greatest in the world.
 ''I think that we have come a long ways and I think that we have more to do and that we can do it,'' he said. ''It's not that anybody is indispensable; it is that people have put so much into this, have taken us in the right direction -- schools, crime, the economy, cultural institutions, parks, openness and accountability -- and every time I look around, I think there's so much more we can do.''
 Since word leaked on Tuesday that Mr. Bloomberg had decided to pursue a third term, the city's political establishment has been struggling to gauge the potential ripple effects on civic life in general, and next year's citywide elections in particular.
 The legislation the mayor backs would extend term limits to three four-year terms from two for all citywide elected officials -- mayor, comptroller and public advocate -- as well as the five borough presidents and the 51-member City Council.
 But beyond that, supporters and opponents alike have been somewhat thrown by the lack of details about the bill. For example, while the cosmetics heir Ronald S. Lauder, a former champion of term limits who now backs another term for Mr. Bloomberg, has said that any extension of term limits should be temporary, Ms. Quinn said on Thursday that the Council would make the change permanent. 
 And while Mr. Bloomberg has insisted that city officials do not have time to hold a referendum on the issue, others say a special election could easily be scheduled to allow voters to be heard.
 Ms. Quinn, who had been expected to run for mayor next year, said she would instead run for re-election to her Council seat and the speakership if the term limit law was amended. She acknowledged that she had retreated from her previous -- and adamant -- opposition to any changes in the 15-year-old law.
 ''I did take a position last December that indicated I wasn't open to making a change in term limits, and obviously there is the potential that that might change,'' she said. ''If that does happen, that will be a change in position.''
 When asked whether she had been promised anything by Mr. Bloomberg in exchange for her support for extending term limits, Ms. Quinn looked incredulous and said: ''Promised by the mayor? Nothing.''
 While many council members say privately that the mayor has the votes to pass the bill, they caution that such support could erode -- especially if members hear from irate constituents. Indeed, some early public reaction in polls, on Web sites and in letters to newspapers has been negative, with some people comparing what they see as a power grab to moves by foreign leaders like Vladimir Putin of Russia and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe. Still, Mr. Bloomberg remains broadly popular, and his appeal may override public distaste with the way he and council members are moving to change the law.
 Another wild card is what the city's potent unions will do. Some labor leaders say privately that they are adopting a cautious attitude, uncomfortable with what they see as an undermining of voters' will, yet afraid of crossing a mayor who has enormous say over contracts and policies.
 One powerful union leader, Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, said she was uncertain about what steps, if any, the union would take to oppose the mayor's efforts to extend term limits.
 ''I am going to have a real discussion with our members, and I wish that there would be a real discussion in the city,'' Ms. Weingarten said. ''This is a significant policy change, and there has been no real public airing of the debate. We live in a unprecedented world right now, and we have to explore the pros and cons of changing, and of doing it in this kind of way, rather than putting it to the voters.''
 If re-elected, Mr. Bloomberg, a longtime Democrat who became a Republican to run for mayor in 2001 but declared himself an independent last year, would be only the fourth mayor in the city's modern history to serve a third term.
 He said it was too early to determine what party banner, if any, he would run under. 
 ''This is not the time for politics,'' he told reporters.
 But people close to the mayor say he is likely to run as an independent.
 During his 28-minute news conference, Mr. Bloomberg appeared more tense and rigid than usual, rarely offering his trademark wisecracks or playful banter with reporters. His top lieutenants, including three deputy mayors who had opposed a third term, stood off to the side, stone-faced. A few of Mr. Bloomberg's commissioners attended, also betraying little emotion.
 Mr. Bloomberg said he was not deterred by what people have long called the curse of the third term, in which popular mayors or governors stumble badly in their last stanza. In fact, he said that he relished a challenge, and suggested that if the first two terms were any indication, the third might be the most satisfying.
 ''The bottom line is, we face some tough times, and I'd be honored to run again, and if the voters want me again, I'd be honored to serve,'' he said. ''This is just giving them the option.''

In early 2008, Michael R. Bloomberg began calling his friends for career advice. His flirtation with a presidential bid had just ended, and New York City's term limits law would eventually force him from office. For the first time in years, he was at a loss for what to do next. 
 A longtime adviser suggested the ''Bill Gates type of life'' -- a state of semi-retirement filled with charitable works and worldwide travel. 
 But Mr. Bloomberg chafed at the idea. ''He wanted to be mayor much more,'' this person said. ''He is a linear guy. He likes a clear job description.'' 
 Mr. Bloomberg contends that an unexpected economic crisis motivated his quest to seek a third term as mayor and revise the city's term limits -- a position that reverses himself, the law, and to many people's minds, the will of the voters, who twice approved the restrictions. 
 But it is clear, from interviews with the mayor's friends and advisers, that there is another powerful force at play: Mr. Bloomberg's ego.
 Ego, of course, can be an animating, even necessary thing for any politician. And there were certainly people ready to feed Mr. Bloomberg's.
 Influential business leaders like Steven Rattner, the financier, and Richard D. Parsons, the former chief executive of Time Warner, strongly pressed Mr. Bloomberg to try to remain in office, telling him that the depth of the financial troubles required his talents and temperament.
 ''We are in an extraordinary period of time, which will be followed by economic consequences that are totally unpredictable,'' said the developer Jerry I. Speyer, when asked why he urged the mayor to run again. 
 And financial crisis aside, those close to Mr. Bloomberg have said that he has come to love almost every aspect of being mayor -- from the actual civic achievements, to the considerable celebrity.
 Two hours before he announced his third-term ambitions at City Hall on Thursday, Mr. Bloomberg attended a packed breakfast of small-business people in Queens, who crowned him the king of that borough. (In an apt moment of political theater, the event's organizers hired a trumpeter, dressed in full Renaissance costume, to play for his mock coronation.)
 At the event, Mr. Bloomberg smiled through 30 minutes of photographs with fellow award winners and then eagerly worked the room, telling jokes and slapping backs. (''People get more religion during a downturn,'' he told a minister.) 
 Mr. Bloomberg was rewarded with calls of ''Four more years!'' and ''Go for a third term!''
 The mayor's closest friends said that he so relishes his job, from the small-bore borough breakfasts to the billion-dollar development projects, that he finds the prospect of just about anything else wanting. 
 Most jobs ''would never fully engage him,'' said Mortimer Zuckerman, the owner of The Daily News and a friend of Mr. Bloomberg. He added, ''I think he would waste away if he were in a state of semi-activity.'' 
 ''The one thing you can say about the mayoralty of New York City is that it's a full-time job,'' Mr. Zuckerman said. 
 So, of course, is being president of the United States, and governor of New York, options that Mr. Bloomberg and his political advisers considered seriously over the last two years, as they gamed out a life after City Hall. 
 Mr. Bloomberg ultimately decided that a third-party candidacy would not be viable, or perhaps even necessary.
 And Mr. Bloomberg lacked enthusiasm for taking on the challenges of Albany's political culture -- let alone for commuting two hours each way to the capital several times a week.
 Overseeing the new Bloomberg charitable foundation loomed as an option, but Mr. Bloomberg had already said that role would fall to his deputy mayor, Patricia E. Harris. And, as one friend said, philanthropy is the final job Mr. Bloomberg wants in life, not the next one. ''It's a pretty sedate life,'' this person said. 
 That left a third term as mayor, which he debated with advisers for months. ''Everybody called it the mayor's Hamlet routine -- to run or not to run,'' said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, a business group whose board includes many of Mr. Bloomberg's friends in the business world. 
 Mr. Bloomberg was already leaning toward challenging term limits to remain in office when the full dimensions of the financial crisis erupted -- having started as a housing market downturn largely outside New York City, and then having snowballed into a meltdown that reached deep into the canyons of Lower Manhattan. 
 The city's business titans began to lean harder on him. And, those close to him say, he began to hear similar sentiments -- from dozens of voters on the subway and during his neighborhood tours. It was the affirmation, his aides said, that helped him make a decision to run again, which he characterized on Thursday in terms of public service.
 ''There is no greater honor than being able to make a difference in people's lives and for me that's what public service really is all about,'' he said at City Hall. 
 But those opposed to the move see plenty of pride -- and hubris. ''Democracy is bigger than any one person,'' said the city's comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., who has been planning a 2009 mayoral run.
 Mr. Speyer, the developer, said that regardless of the debate on term limits, the mayor's decision to run again should be viewed as an act of selflessness. ''He could go off and do anything he wants,'' Mr. Speyer said. ''He could go to the proverbial island and do nothing. He could run a foundation and gives tons of money away, become the head of a university, go back into business.'' 
 Instead, Mr. Speyer said, he wants to be mayor. 
 ''There isn't a person on the face of the earth that does not have some ego,'' he said. ''But if you look at the job of being mayor, especially at a time like the period we have entered, it's quite unusual for a person like Mike to be willing to say he would do this for another four years.''
 Whatever the exact balance of ego and obligation behind Mr. Bloomberg's decision to seek another term, he was not shy about his sense of what he could do.
 ''I think our second term was better than our first term, in terms of coming up with new things and really making a difference in this city,'' he said at the news conference announcing his plans. ''And if I get the opportunity to present myself to the voters a year from November, and if they want more of it, I see no reason why a third term couldn't even be better.''

HEADLINE: Teams With Deep Pockets Could Be In Too Deep

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON. 
E-mail: hjaraton@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The next president of the United States could serve consecutive terms, and when his eight-year administration concluded, Alex Rodriguez would still be a Yankee.
 He will in all likelihood be a Yankee through the next nine World Series and two Summer Olympics, and when today's 10-year-old is packing for college. He may also by the summer of 2017 be baseball's career home run leader, but a 42-year-old designated hitter and financial albatross for a high-roller franchise that fancifully took on long-term debt while assuming the market for professional sports would never plateau, much less plunge.
 No one can say if the business of baseball is flourishing inside a proverbial bubble, or outside the proposed bailout. But there are some signs of a sports reckoning, especially for those accustomed to living in a manner that some would call grotesquely and dangerously large. 
 ''This is a critical off-season for a team like the Yankees, in particular,'' Marc Ganis, a well-connected sports industry consultant, said in a telephone interview. ''They are opening a new stadium but at a time their fan base is going to have to be more prudent in how they spend. Meanwhile, the Yankees are in a position where they have to keep spending to improve their team because that's the deal they've made with their fans, but during a serious downturn that is having its greatest impact on the auto industry, which is by far the largest sponsor of pro sports.''
 To underscore that last point, General Motors recently announced that it would not purchase advertising time during the Super Bowl in February, with a spokeswoman explaining that the company is ''in the midst of cost cutting'' and ''scrutinizing all of our programs and all of our media spending.''
 Only a team or league executive asleep at the cash register would at this moment hold to the longtime belief that sports as live, unscripted entertainment must remain a growth product, immune to global instability. According to Ganis, no less an industry titan than N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell two months ago circulated a memo warning of revenue declines and suggesting teams tighten their belts.
 At the N.H.L. Board of Governors meeting late last month in Toronto, the group was briefed on the crisis. The commissioner, Gary Bettman, told The Canadian Press, ''Obviously nobody can predict how this is going to unfold and when there might be a recovery.'' 
 Pucks, balls, cars -- sports of all shapes and sounds are concerned, or should be. The Associated Press recently reported, ''The global financial crises likely will hit Formula One unless administrators start controlling costs, team owners and officials said.'' Time Magazine's Web site weighed in on how English Premier League soccer teams are facing the teetering of main sponsors like the American International Group (Manchester United) and Northern Rock (Newcastle). 
 ''For the teams counting on certain corporations to buy the most expensive luxury suites, well, some of those corporations are no longer there,'' Ganis said. 
 For his part, Ganis is of the opinion that New York's huge population and ultracompetitive business culture shrinks the likelihood of a major backlash as its teams embark on a price-gouging era under challenging circumstances. He said he believed that whatever cutbacks occurred in the short term, professional sports were well-positioned so the impact would not be lasting, or severe.
 ''That's assuming they avoid spending like drunken sailors,'' he said. ''But baseball above all does have a history of spending in irrational ways.''
 Led by those longtime practitioners of scorched-earth financial policies, the Bronx-based franchise informally known as the Bombers.
 The most common contemporary take on the Yankees is that their deep pockets do not guarantee championship success, just the ability to withstand expensive mistakes (Carl Pavano, Kei Igawa, Roger Clemens in 2007) that would level lesser-endowed clubs. But given higher stakes and increased risk, for how long? 
 With a personnel infrastructure almost as old as the stadium they are vacating, with an overhyped or underachieving farm system, how do the Yankees meet the terms of their aforementioned deal with their fans without sending the newly re-signed general manager, Brian Cashman, on a pressurized spending spree that would compromise the financial restraint he preached in passing on Johan Santana last winter?
 ''A $40 million mistake four years ago could be a $120 million mistake today, like Barry Zito and the Giants,'' Ganis said. ''And by the way, if you're the Yankees and you're paying the luxury tax, it's $175 million.''
 Yankee tax dollars subsidize smaller markets. The more the Yankees spend without optimum return, the greater the odds of a Tampa Bay rising up against them. The richer and longer a contract the Yankees hand out, the more they are stuck with the status quo, for better or worse.
 Take A-Rod. He's a force of nature now, but if his skills erode sooner than later, the Yankees may want to say, ''Take him, please.'' At the price they paid, good luck with that, and with selling those overpriced seats long term in their expensive new house if safer, smarter investments are not soon made.

HEADLINE: Revolutionary Hero, Relentless Heroine

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

 BODY:
Hollywood meets Havana as the 46th New York Film Festival glides and sometimes stumbles into its second week. In ''Che,''Benicio Del Toro, wearing a jaunty beret and wispy tufts of beard, wages war against Yankee-supported states in Steven Soderbergh's 257-minute (with a 30-minute bladder break) historical epic. Meanwhile in ''Changeling,'' Clint Eastwood's 141-minute period drama, Angelina Jolie, wearing a jaunty cloche and bloody slash of lipstick, does battle against the patriarchs of 1920s Los Angeles. 
 ''Che'' and ''Changeling'' were first shown in May at the Cannes Film Festival, where they were swaddled in hype and hysteria and anointed with tears of critical joy and fury. Other similarities: both were directed by men who have always maintained a distance from the studios for which they profitably work. Both also hinge on bankable Hollywood stars -- Mr. Del Toro as Che, Ms. Jolie as Christine Collins -- and feature recognizable faces in supporting roles. Lou Diamond Phillips plays a sissy Communist leader in ''Che,'' in which a distracting Matt Damon pops up as a man of peace. I didn't notice any pinkos in ''Changeling,'' but John Malkovich goes all righteous and solemn as a man of the cloth. 
 Divided into two sections -- once called ''The Argentine'' and ''Guerrilla'' -- the now monosyllabically titled ''Che'' tracks the guerrilla leader over mountains and through his tactical successes in Cuba before moving on to his catastrophic bid to bring revolutionary socialism to Bolivia. The movie has been described as dialectical, but two parts do not a dialectic make: something meaningful has to happen between those parts. Throughout the movie Mr. Soderbergh mixes the wild beauty of his landscapes with images of Che heroically engaged in battle, thoughtfully scribbling and reading, and tending to ailing peasants and soldiers. Che wins, Che loses, but Che remains the same in what plays like a procedural about a charismatic leader, impossible missions and the pleasures of work and camaraderie -- ''Ocean's Eleven'' with better cigars.
 Like that glossy, glistening bauble of a film, ''Che'' seems to me very much a self-reflexive endeavor, a movie not just about two revolutionary campaigns, but also about the struggles -- logistical, emotional, psychological -- of moviemaking itself. (To push this analogy further, Mr. Soderbergh's first feature, ''sex, lies, and videotape,'' is his Cuba -- an act of youthful will and the spark that ignited a movement -- while his second feature, a stubborn folly called ''Kafka,'' could have been his Bolivia.) Mr. Soderbergh cagily evades Che's ugly side, notably his increasing commitment to violence and seemingly endless war, but the movie is without question political -- even if it emphasizes romantic adventure over realpolitik -- because, like all films, it is predicated on getting, spending and making money. It opens in December. 
 I admire Mr. Soderbergh's filmmaking more than his movie, but ''Che'' is the kind of bold choice that should be included in a festival that needs to shake things up if it is to remain relevant. Alas, the selection of Mr. Eastwood's ''Changeling'' is nothing if not predictable and was, I'm guessing, either selected out of loyalty to a revered auteur or because it will provide a red-carpet thrill for the donors of the Film Society of Lincoln Center, which presents the festival. This fall movie season certainly looks thin, which suggests that programming pickings were slim. But ''Changeling,'' embalmed by Ms. Jolie's waxworks performance and a sepulchral production design, adds no luster to Mr. Eastwood's reputation or the festival's. It will doubtless earn Ms. Jolie another shot at an Oscar. 
 Programmer loyalty seems the only explanation for the inclusion of ''Night and Day,'' a meandering, bloated bore from the South Korean director Hong Sang-soo. Beginning in the mid-1990s, Mr. Hong began a terrific run with formally audacious, emotionally nuanced films like ''The Power of Kangwon Province,'' ''Virgin Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors'' and ''Woman Is the Future of Man.'' Though he stumbled a few years ago with ''Tale of Cinema,'' he returned to sturdy form with ''Woman on the Beach,'' which was shown in the 2006 New York festival. Set in Paris, ''Night and Day'' centers on a Korean roue and his (inexplicably) many women, and seems vaguely interested in the question of cultural difference, but is mostly about Mr. Hong playing tourist while fiddling with the zoom. 
 The exacting formalism and beauty of ''The Headless Woman,'' the latest from the Argentine filmmaker Lucrecia Martel -- last seen at the festival with ''The Holy Girl'' -- is undeniable. The film centers on Veronica (a mesmerizing, zomboid Maria Onetto), who, while reaching for her cellphone one day, runs over what she comes to think may have been a child. She doesn't report the accident, and it soon emerges that her greater crime is being bourgeois. The film's opener -- a series of glidingly crosscut images of children running and Veronica fussing with her girlfriends, capped by the haunting image of palm prints fading on a car window -- is a tour de force of economical storytelling that makes the next 80 or so minutes moot. 
 ''Afterschool'' is American art-house horror from Antonio Campos (a baby Michael Haneke) about privileged young things blankly staring into pulsing screens on their way to perdition. ''Four Nights With Anna,'' about a stalker and the nurse he loves, is the latest from the Polish director Jerzy Skolimowski, whose earlier films include ''Deep End.'' Just as dark in mood is Matteo Garrone's ''Gomorrah,'' a ferociously unsentimental and fictionalized look at the Neapolitan Mafia, which opens early next year. Also playing is ''The Windmill Movie,'' a video portrait that Alexander Olch patched together from autobiographical material shot by his (and my) former teacher, the filmmaker Richard P. Rogers, who died in 2001. Mr. Rogers's lovely 1970 short ''Quarry,'' which is showing with the feature, is the real find here. 
 Also screening this week are Max Ophuls's 1955 drama ''Lola Montes,'' about a 19th-century courtesan who becomes a circus attraction -- this is the third time the film has played in the festival -- and ''Ashes of Time Redux,'' Wong Kar-wai's rethink (or re-something) of his 1994 martial-arts marvel, ''Ashes of Time.'' Made during a long, difficult shoot -- so protracted that Mr. Wong shot ''Chungking Express'' during a hiatus -- the original ''Ashes of Time'' was a transitional work for the filmmaker, who came close to shaking off narrative entirely in favor of pure abstraction. An insanely beautiful swirl of Fauvist colors and glorious faces belonging to Leslie Cheung, Maggie Cheung and Brigitte Lin, among others, the redone film seems even more abstract and even more of a triumph. It opens in theaters next Friday.
 The 46th New York Film Festival, presented by the Film Society of Lincoln Center, continues through Oct. 12. Information and tickets: (212) 721-6500; filmlinc.com.

HEADLINE: As Economy Weakens, Federal Reserve Officials Consider Lowering Rates

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Even if Congress approves President Bush's $700 billion rescue plan for Wall Street, top officials at the Federal Reserve believe the economy will slow down more than they had expected as recently as July.
 As a result, Fed officials are considering yet another reduction in the central bank's benchmark interest rate. The matter is by no means settled, in part because some officials are skeptical that a reduction in the overnight federal funds rate would make much difference. 
 The biggest obstacle to economic activity right now is not the shortage of cash but the unwillingness of financial institutions to lend it out, even to each other. Overnight lending rates among banks remain far higher than the federal funds rate. The ''TED spread,'' the difference between overnight rates among banks and the yield on Treasury bills, hit a new record of 3.61 percentage points. 
 But Fed officials have been deluged with data suggesting that the underlying economy has slowed more than they had been expecting, and many private analysts contend the economy has already entered a recession. At the same time, inflation pressures have declined slightly, mainly because oil prices have declined from their record highs this year.
 The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has been trying to deal with the liquidity problems -- the difficulty of businesses to line up short-term financing for normal activities -- separately from the more basic problem of a possible recession. 
 For practical purposes, fears about potential insolvencies are so high that many corporate borrowers and institutional investors can get only overnight loans to finance their operations. Indeed, credit markets are more paralyzed now than they were in August 2007, when the markets seized up in fear over mortgage-backed securities.
 The Fed, along with central banks from around the world, has pumped hundreds of billions of dollars into the financial system in recent days to get banks lending again. So far, those efforts have had little discernible effect. But Fed and Treasury officials are hoping that the money markets will start to thaw more if Congress allows the government to buy as much as $700 billion in troubled mortgages and mortgage-backed securities.
 The decision to reduce interest rates will depend on whether policy makers decide that the economy is slowing more than they had already been expecting. Fed officials had already been predicting a slowdown in the second half of 2008.
 But Mr. Bernanke warned the Joint Economic Committee of Congress last week that the economy would grow at a pace ''appreciably below'' normal for the second half of the year and that the credit squeeze had damaged economic growth for the months ahead.
 ''I see the financial markets as already quite fragile,'' he told lawmakers. ''The credit markets aren't working. Corporations aren't able to finance themselves through commercial paper. Even if the situation stayed as it did today, that would be a significant drag on the economy.''
 Mr. Bernanke also warned that the two main reasons for the nation's fairly healthy growth in the second quarter -- tax rebates and rising exports -- would provide little help for the rest of the year. The tax rebates were finished by June, and global economic growth had slowed and reduced demand for American exports.
 That economic outlook was much darker than it was at the Fed's last policy meeting on Sept. 16, when policy makers held rates steady at 2 percent and declared that the ''downside'' risks to growth and the ''upside'' risks of higher inflation were both ''significant concerns.''
 Mr. Bernanke thus far has not predicted that the economy would actually slide into a recession, but Fed officials have received a stream of grim economic reports.
 On Thursday, a closely-watched survey of manufacturing activity plunged to a level that economists associated with a recession. The Institute for Supply Management reported that its monthly index of activity fell to 43.5 in September from 49.9 the month before. In general, a reading below 50 indicates that manufacturers are contracting rather than expanding.
 The United States has lost jobs every month since December, for a total of 770,000 through the end of August. On Thursday, the Labor Department reported 497,000 new claims for unemployment benefits in the previous week. Many economists estimate that if new claims run higher than 400,000 a week, as they have been for months now, the economy is losing more jobs than it is creating.
 On Friday, economists expect the Labor Department to report another net decline in the labor market of about 100,000 jobs.

HEADLINE: Brainy Brand Names Where They're Least Expected

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
A FINANCIAL crisis, two wars, a presidential election. ... When there is so much for readers to think about, how do magazines aimed at thoughtful readers attract their attention?
 One such magazine, The Economist, is spoofing the game Twister, distributing pizza boxes that improbably bear its name and sponsoring a performance of political satire by the Second City theatrical troupe.
 Another such magazine, The Atlantic, plans to advertise on the muffin displays in bodegas, restaurant menu boards and the shampoo shelves of drugstores. 
 The Atlantic is also producing video clips that show what happens when passers-by on city streets are invited to answer questions like ''Is Google making us stupid?'' and ''Why do presidents lie?'' -- questions that, to make them stand out, have also been reproduced as neon signs.
 In seeking readers and advertisers, publications like The Atlantic and The Economist, known as thought-leader magazines, have long tried to make up in cleverness what they lack in wallet power. Their ranks also include magazines like Harper's, Mother Jones, The Nation, The New Republic and The New Yorker.
 The campaign for The Atlantic, with a budget estimated at $1.5 million, even evokes its identity as a thought-leader title; it carries the theme ''Think. Again.'' The campaign, which will also include a section of the magazine's Web site (theatlantic.com/thinkagain) is to begin on Monday. 
 The campaign for The Economist is arriving this week in Philadelphia after stopping in eight other markets, including Boston and Washington. The campaign, with a budget estimated at $5 million, carries the theme ''Get a world view.''
 Both campaigns are indicative of the increasingly unusual efforts by the traditional media to catch the wandering eyes of younger readers as well as younger employees of media agencies who help decide where marketers buy ads.
 The theory is that they ''should be jolted,'' said Justin Smith, president for consumer media at the Atlantic Media Company in Washington.
 ''We felt there was a great opportunity, right now, to further inspire our readers and advertisers,'' he added.
 His counterpart at The Economist, Paul Rossi, who is based in New York, echoed Mr. Smith's decision to seize the moment, fraught as it might be with uncertainty.
 ''I think it's the best possible time'' for a campaign, said Mr. Rossi, executive vice president and managing director for the Americas at The Economist.
 ''What we have to say has never been more relevant,'' he added. ''We write about the world, about connections between business and politics.'' The media company Pearson owns a 50 percent stake in The Economist through The Financial Times.
 The questions appearing in the campaign for The Atlantic are from articles published in the magazine. Some have stimulated newsstand sales, Mr. Smith said, citing the issue with the article about Google, which sold about 82,000 copies versus the recent average of 42,000.
 The circulation that The Atlantic guarantees to advertisers, known as a rate base, is 400,000 this year and is to be increased to 450,000 in 2009. That includes newsstand sales and subscriptions.
 The ads for The Atlantic in unexpected locales like bodegas are meant to reach media buyers where they eat, buy takeout food and shop. Those are ''places where people's brains are most at rest,'' said Michael Fanuele, managing director for strategy at the magazine's creative agency, Euro RSCG Worldwide in New York, part of Havas.
 The video clips, aimed at readers as well as advertisers, will be available on the Think Again section of The Atlantic Web site, and plans call for additional content to be added monthly.
 Previews of the clips offer a wide variety of responses from the passers-by. On the question ''Why do presidents lie?,'' the replies ranged from ''Why do we let them?'' to ''There'd be more problems if we told the truth.''
 The neon signs, which also appear in print ads and posters, will decorate events sponsored by The Atlantic and eventually end up at the magazine's offices. ''We hope to keep one or two for ourselves,'' said Jose Cabaco, chief creative officer for North America at Euro RSCG.
 Other agencies working on the campaign for The Atlantic are Cleverworks, for media buying, and the Rosen Group, for public relations.
 There are several agencies working on the campaign for The Economist: BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group, for the creative content; PHD, also part of Omnicom, for media buying; Kinetic, a unit of the WPP Group, for outdoor ads; and Tentpole N.Y. for public relations and events like the Second City performance, part of a three-day program called Off the Page.
 ''It's always a good time to read The Economist,'' said Andrew Robertson, chief executive at BBDO, ''but if there ever was a good time to be reading The Economist, it's now.''
 Originally, the ads run by The Economist in this country were adapted from a popular campaign for the magazine created in London by the Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO unit of BBDO. Headlines from that campaign -- called the ''white-on-red campaign'' for its color scheme, borrowed from the logo of The Economist -- include ''Great minds like a think'' and Mr. Robertson's favorite, ''Would you like to sit next to you at dinner?''
 The idea behind the British campaign ''is that if you read it, you'd be better informed, and therefore more successful,'' he said, ''which evolved into, you'd be better informed, and therefore more interesting.''
 The new ads with the Twister parody and the like are from the BBDO office in New York so they will more directly address American sensibilities, Mr. Robertson said, and provide ''a more specific explanation of what you'll get from reading The Economist.''

HEADLINE: A Political Debate With Its Fair Share of Inaccuracies

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER, PETER BAKER, LARRY ROHTER and MICHAEL LUO; Kitty Bennett contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The vice-presidential debate on Thursday contained a fair share of distortions and misstatements. Here are some of them:
 Iraq and Afghanistan
 Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, and Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, the Republican, sharply disagreed on whether a rapid reinforcement of troops and the application of counterinsurgency strategy as developed in Iraq would work in neighboring Afghanistan.
 Mr. Biden said the American commanding general in Afghanistan had said Thursday (he actually spoke on Wednesday) that a ''surge'' in troops would not work there because of differences in military and civic challenges between Iraq and Afghanistan.
 Ms. Palin said the general had called for more troops -- in essence, a ''surge'' -- and said the counterinsurgency strategy that had reduced the violence in Iraq could also work in Afghanistan. 
 In citing the general's remarks, Mr. Biden did not name him. Ms. Palin referred to him as ''McClellan.'' The commander is Gen. David D. McKiernan of the Army. 
 Both Mr. Biden and Ms. Palin were partly right. General McKiernan declined to use the term ''surge,'' but also called for a quick infusion of troops to pursue counterinsurgency operations similar to those in Iraq but on a different scale and over a different politico-military landscape.
 General McKiernan said in a Pentagon briefing on Wednesday that he needed more troops quickly to accomplish his mission of defeating insurgents, drug lords and the Taliban.
 ''The word I don't use for Afghanistan is 'surge,' '' General McKiernan told reporters in Washington, where he was attending high-level meetings to review United States policy in Afghanistan. ''There needs to be a sustained commitment of a variety of military and nonmilitary resources, I believe. That's my advice to winning in Afghanistan. It won't be a short-term solution.''
 Mr. Biden and his Democratic running mate, Senator Barack Obama have called Afghanistan ''the central front in the war on terror'' and are calling for deployment of additional American combat brigades there. They do not call such an increase a ''surge,'' however, as that term has been applied in Iraq.
 Ms. Palin said the general ''did not say definitively that the surge principles would not work in Afghanistan.'' She went on to acknowledge that '' conditions are certainly different.'' 
 The general did say some aspects of the Iraq counterinsurgency strategy, like the effort to engage tribal leaders in political dialogue, could yield fruit in Afghanistan, which has long been dominated by regional and tribal warlords. He said there were significant differences between the two countries and the two conflicts, however.
 JOHN M. BRODER 
 Troop Withdrawals
 Mr. Biden described Mr. Obama's plan for withdrawing troops from Iraq as ''ironically, the same plan that Maliki, the prime minister of Iraq, and George Bush are now negotiating.'' He added, ''The only odd man here, the one left out, is John McCain.''
 Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama are closer today in their vision for Iraq than they used to be, but there are still important differences. Mr. Obama has promised to withdraw combat forces from Iraq within 16 months of taking office, which would mean mid-2010. Mr. Bush, after years of resisting timetables, has signaled willingness to set a goal for withdrawing by the end of 2011.
 Mr. Bush and Nouri al-Maliki, the Iraqi prime minister, are negotiating a strategic framework for American-Iraqi relations and a status of forces agreement that would govern the presence of American troops in Iraq after a United Nations mandate expires at the end of this year. Mr. Bush still maintains that any withdrawals would be ''aspirational'' and contingent on conditions on the ground. PETER BAKER 
 Troops Deployed
 Criticizing the Democratic candidates for their opposition to ''the surge'' in Iraq that has been one of the bedrocks of Mr. McCain's national security policy, Ms. Palin asserted that ''we're down to pre-surge numbers'' of troops in Iraq. 
 In reality, there are about 146,000 troops still serving in Iraq. That is roughly 11,000 more than the number deployed there before the start of the troop build-up early last year that came to be known as ''the surge.'' 
 It is true that President Bush last month announced he intended to withdraw some 8,000 combat and support troops over the next few months. But even that withdrawal, if it were to occur at the pace and in the amount the president wants, would still leave at least 138,000 troops in Iraq.
 LARRY ROHTER 
 Rebuilding Afghanistan
 Mr. Biden said, ''We spend more money in three weeks on combat in Iraq than we spent on the entirety of the last seven years that we have been in Afghanistan building that country.'' This appears to be exaggerated, although it is not exactly clear what Mr. Biden was including under ''building that country.'' 
 The Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, a nonpartisan group, estimates American spending in Iraq at $2.4 billion a week, based on a report this year by the Congressional Research Service. That would put a three-week total at $7.2 billion.
 In June the State Department said security and reconstruction assistance to Afghanistan from fiscal year 2001 to 2008 amounted to $26 billion, including $7.7 billion for economic and social development, $17.2 billion for security and $1.3 billion on ''governance, rule of law and human rights.'' 
 MICHAEL LUO 
 Health Care 
 Ms. Palin castigated Mr. Obama's health care plan as one that would mandate a ''universal government-run'' system in which health care is ''taken over'' by the federal government.
 This is inaccurate on several levels. Mr. Obama's proposal, which he hopes will result in ''universal'' coverage in which everyone has health insurance, includes an option for people to choose a new public plan with benefits similar to what members of Congress and other federal employees currently have. 
 It also includes an expansion of Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, but it is not at all exclusively government-run. It preserves the existing employer-based health insurance system, offering subsidies or tax credits to help those who cannot afford premiums. Mr. Obama's plan also mandates only that children, not adults, have coverage.
 MICHAEL LUO 
 Tax Increases
 In addressing the issues of taxes, Ms. Palin revived an accusation that he and Mr. Biden voted ''for the largest tax increases in U.S. history'' and also charged that he would raise taxes ''for those families making only $42,000 a year.'' 
 Mr. Obama voted twice this year in favor of a budget resolution that would have allowed the tax cuts that President Bush pushed through Congress in 2001 and 2003 to expire at the end of 2010, as the original law mandated. But that, by the definition of the Congressional Budget Office and other tax experts, does not constitute a tax increase.
 The resolution, if not accompanied by other tax changes, envisages an increase in taxes for an individual earning $42,000 a year who has no dependents and owns no real estate. It would not apply to a family. Estimates are that a family of four making $90,000 would not see a tax increase.
 In addition, the McCain campaign months ago abandoned its argument that Mr. Obama now favors a historic tax increase. It did so after tax analysts and other economists debunked the assertion, saying that nothing contemplated by either party comes anywhere near the tax increases put into effect to fight World War II. Ms. Palin, however, revived the accusation. LARRY ROHTER

HEADLINE: Excerpt From the Vice-Presidential Debate

 BODY:
An excerpt from the vice-presidential debate on Thursday night in St. Louis, between Gov. Sarah Palin and Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., as recorded by CQ Transcriptions. The moderator was Gwen Ifill of PBS. A full transcript and video: nytimes.com/politics.
 MR. BIDEN I'm not going to change. I have 35 years in public office. People can judge who I am. I haven't changed in that time. 
 And, by the way, a record of change -- I will place my record and Barack's record against John McCain's or anyone else in terms of fundamental accomplishments. 
 Wrote the crime bill, put 100,000 cops on the street, wrote the Violence Against Women Act, which John McCain voted against, both of them, was the catalyst to change the circumstance in Bosnia, led by President Clinton, obviously.
 Look, I understand what it's like to be a single parent. When my wife and daughter died and my two sons were gravely injured, I understand what it's like as a parent to wonder what it's like if your kid's going to make it.
 I understand what it's like to sit around the kitchen table with a father who says, ''I've got to leave, champ, because there's no jobs here. I got to head down to Wilmington. And when we get enough money, honey, we'll bring you down.''
 I understand what it's like. I'm much better off than almost all Americans now. I get a good salary with the United States Senate. I live in a beautiful house that's my total investment that I have. So I am much better off now.
 But the notion that somehow, because I'm a man, I don't know what it's like to raise two kids alone, I don't know what it's like to have a child you're not sure is going to make it -- I understand.
 I understand, as well as, with all due respect, the governor or anybody else, what it's like for those people sitting around that kitchen table. And guess what? They're looking for help. They're looking for help. They're not looking for more of the same.
 MS. IFILL Governor?
 MS. PALIN People aren't looking for more of the same. They are looking for change. And John McCain has been the consummate maverick in the Senate over all these years.
 He's taken shots left and right from the other party and from within his own party, because he's had to take on his own party when the time was right, when he recognized it was time to put partisanship aside and just do what was right for the American people. That's what I've done as governor, also, take on my own party, when I had to, and work with both sides of the aisle, in my cabinet, appointing those who would serve regardless of party, Democrats, independents, Republicans, whatever it took to get the job done.
 Also, John McCain's maverick position that he's in, that's really prompt up to and indicated by the supporters that he has. Look at Lieberman, and Giuliani, and Romney, and Lingle, and all of us who come from such a diverse background of policy and of partisanship, all coming together at this time, recognizing he is the man that we need to lead in these next four years, because these are tumultuous times.
 We have got to win the wars. We have got to get our economy back on track. We have got to not allow the greed and corruption on Wall Street anymore. And we have not got to allow the partisanship that has really been entrenched in Washington, D.C., no matter who's been in charge. 
 When the Republicans were in charge, I didn't see a lot of progress there, either. When the Democrats, either, though, this last go-around for the last two years.
 Change is coming. And John McCain is the leader of that reform.

HEADLINE: Signaling Confidence in Support, House to Vote on Rescue Proposal

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and ROBERT PEAR; David Stout contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
House Democrats said late Thursday night that they would bring the $700 billion economic bailout package to the floor for a vote on Friday, signaling confidence that they had enough support to pass the bill.
 The move came after Republican leaders struggled on Thursday to persuade some of their members to reverse course and support the package and after top Democrats said earlier that that they would not bring the bill to the floor unless they were certain of victory. 
 ''I'm hopeful that there will be bipartisan, majority support for this bill that is critical to stabilizing our nation's economy for all working Americans,'' said the majority leader, Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland, who said the House would consider the bill Friday morning.
 Earlier Thursday, the White House and Congressional leaders maneuvered to drum up support and several lawmakers in each party said they were prepared to switch their votes. 
 But others agonized amid a continuing deluge of calls from angry constituents. 
 The Senate approved the bailout plan on Wednesday night with a solid bipartisan majority, 74 to 25, after adding a thick portfolio of popular tax provisions. 
 The Senate action came after House members defied the leadership of both parties and rejected the plan on Monday. The House vote fell 12 votes short, with Republicans opposed by a two to one margin. It was opposed by 95 Democrats and 133 Republicans. 
 The Senate proposal included more than $150 billion in tax breaks, including incentives for solar, wind and other renewable energy sources, but it included offsets to pay for only $43 billion, infuriating fiscally conservative Democrats in the House. 
 ''We may lose people,'' Mr. Hoyer said earlier in the day. ''Because frankly, the things that were added on and the way they were added on essentially appeal to Republicans.''
 In response to Mr. Hoyer's announcement, Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri, the No. 2 House Republican and a chief negotiator of the bailout plan, said party leaders were optimistic but still pushing for support.
 ''While I believe we have increased support on both sides of the aisle for this economic rescue package, we are leaving nothing to chance,'' Mr. Blunt said in a statement. ''The stakes are simply too high. Leading up to the vote, we will continue to work with our members to get this critical piece across the finish line.''
 But apparently it was not overwhelmingly appealing because only a few Republicans stated publicly that they were prepared to switch their votes to yes. 
 One of them, Zach Wamp, Republican of Tennessee, said the economy was just in too precarious a state. 
 ''The time has come to act,'' Mr. Wamp said in an interview on Fox Television. ''If we do not go on the wall, it will be an ugly day in America.''
 Representative Jim Ramstad, Republican of Minnesota, said he also intended to switch and vote in favor because the Senate had added a provision requiring equivalence, or parity, in insurance coverage of mental and physical ailments. 
 ''The revised bill is a recovery bill for the economy and a recovery bill for millions of Americans suffering the ravages of mental illness and addiction,'' said Mr. Ramstad, who has been working for ''mental health parity'' for more than a decade. 
 There was also movement among some Democrats. Emanuel Cleaver II, Democrat of Missouri, announced that he would switch to yes from no. And John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, also planned to switch, Democratic aides said. 
 A small group of Republicans said they were still hoping to amend the bill, and to reduce the amount of money the Treasury could spend on troubled assets of ailing financial firms to $250 billion, from $700 billion. Democrats said they had no plans to allow amendments, which would require the Senate to vote again, further delaying the plan. 
 After last Monday's rejection of the bailout plan, which sent the Dow Jones industrial average down 778 points, vote-counters in both parties said they were leaving nothing to chance. 
 They were hunting for votes in precincts of Texas and Louisiana hurt by Hurricane Ike, and in storm-ravaged communities in the Midwest, pointing to $7.6 billion in disaster aid in the bill. 
 They were scouring districts in northern New Jersey and other affluent suburbs with promises of relief from the alternative minimum tax. And they were looking to rural areas in the West, with aid for schools and for loggers and other struggling industries. 
 All of these so-called sweeteners were part of a package of tax provisions, many of them related to the production and use of energy from renewable sources, that the Senate added to the bailout plan before easily approving the expanded package.
 Some House Democrats reacted furiously. They support many of the tax provisions and previously approved them, but had insisted they be offset by cuts in spending elsewhere. The Senate version added $107 billion in deficit spending. 
 Mr. Hoyer said that some Democrats also wanted to amend the bill to add an extension of unemployment benefits, but that change would also have required additional Senate action. ''I am not very sympathetic, necessarily, with making the Senate wait,'' he said. ''But I am sympathetic to making the economy wait. That is the problem.''
 To stave off another surprise defeat, House leaders were looking to build a comfortable cushion of votes before heading to the floor, and they enlisted the help of both presidential nominees, Senators John McCain of Arizona and Barack Obama of Illinois. 
 President Bush, at a meeting with business leaders, urged Americans to call their representatives in Congress and demand that they vote for the bailout plan, which would authorize the Treasury to buy up to $700 billion in troubled debt from financial firms. 
 ''The bill that came over from the Senate includes a series of pork-barrel projects that are simply unacceptable not only to me but to the American people,'' said Representative Spencer Bachus, Republican of Alabama. 
 Mr. Bachus voted for the bailout on Monday but did not say how he would vote on Friday, echoing many other lawmakers. 
 The phones were ringing nonstop in the office of Representative Steven R. Rothman, Democrat of New Jersey. Mr. Rothman voted against the bailout Monday, but many of his constituents would benefit from a provision to protect millions of middle-class families from paying the alternative minimum tax.
 A spokesman said Mr. Rothman had not decided whether to switch his vote. 
 Representative Steven C. LaTourette, Republican of Ohio, said he believed that 15 House members would shift from no to yes if the pork-barrel tax items were eliminated and if the bill put tighter restrictions on the secretary of the Treasury. 
 But other Republicans who voted no on Monday said they would hold firm. ''I am a firmer 'no,' '' said Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas, who party leaders had thought might flip. ''I don't want to see the debt ceiling increased on $1 trillion with no way to pay for it.''

HEADLINE: The Vice-Presidential Debate

 BODY:
We cannot recall when there were lower expectations for a candidate than the ones that preceded Sarah Palin's appearance in Thursday night's vice-presidential debate with Joseph Biden. After a series of stumbling interviews that raised serious doubts even among conservatives about her fitness to serve as vice president, Ms. Palin had to do little more than say one or two sensible things and avoid an election-defining gaffe.
 By that standard, but only by that standard, the governor of Alaska did well. But Ms. Palin never really got beyond her talking points in 90 minutes, mostly repeating cliches and tired attack lines and energetically refusing to answer far too many questions. 
 Senator Biden did well, avoiding one of his own infamous gaffes, while showing a clear grasp of the big picture and the details. He left Ms. Palin way behind on most issues, especially foreign policy and national security, where she just seemed lost. It was in those moments that her lack of experience -- two terms as mayor of a tiny Anchorage suburb and less than two years as governor -- was most painfully evident. 
 Asked about Israel, Ms. Palin reeled off her support for ''a two-state solution, building our embassy also in Jerusalem, those things that we look forward to being able to accomplish with this peace-seeking nation.'' Asked about the possible use of nuclear weapons, she declared ''nuclear weaponry, of course, would be the be-all, end-all of just too many people and too many parts of our planet.'' On Iraq, all she had to offer was the false accusation that Barack Obama wants to surrender. 
 Mr. Biden directly challenged Ms. Palin's debate prep on Afghanistan -- pointing out that the commander there had disagreed with Mr. McCain's call for an Iraq-style ''surge'' in Afghanistan. Ms. Palin tried to contradict him, but the most memorable part of her answer was that she got the general's name wrong. 
 One can argue (and her supporters will) that Ms. Palin is a newcomer and can't be expected to know all of the wonkish details, that what matters is the image she projects. Except, anyone who is running for vice president in these very dangerous times needs to have detailed knowledge. 
 When it came to domestic issues, Ms. Palin mainly relied on enthusiasm and humor, talking about hockey moms, soccer moms and Joe Sixpack almost as often as she used the word ''maverick'' to describe Mr. McCain or herself.
 But she offered virtually no detail -- beyond the Republican mantra of tax cuts -- for how she and Mr. McCain would address the financial crisis or help Americans avoid foreclosure or what programs they would cut because of the country's disastrous fiscal problems.
 Ms. Palin's primary tactic was simply to repeat the same thing over and over: John McCain is a maverick. So is she. To stay on that course, she had to indulge in some wildly circular logic: America does not want another Washington insider. They want Mr. McCain (who has been in Congress for nearly 26 years). Ms. Palin condemned Wall Street greed and said she and Mr. McCain would ''demand'' strict oversight. In virtually the next breath, she said government should ''get out of the way'' of American business.
 There were occasional, disturbing flashes of the old, pre-campaign Sarah Palin. Asked about the causes of global warming, Ms. Palin suggested that man had some role -- but she wasn't saying how much.
 In the end, the debate did not change the essential truth of Ms. Palin's candidacy: Mr. McCain made a wildly irresponsible choice that shattered the image he created for himself as the honest, seasoned, experienced man of principle and judgment. It was either an act of incredible cynicism or appallingly bad judgment.

HIGHLIGHT: In this lesson, students investigate the role and duties of the vice president of the United States; they then write persuasive essays in favor of one of this year's running mates using supporting evidence from The New York Times. ( for a companion lesson for Grades 3-5.) 

 BODY:
Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students investigate the role and duties of the vice president of the United States; then they write persuasive essays in favor of one of this year's running mates using supporting evidence from The New York Times. ( for a companion lesson for Grades 3-5.)
Author(s):
Annissa Hambouz, The New York Times Learning Network
Kristin McGinn Mahoney , The New York Times Learning Network
Suggested Time Allowance: 3-4 class periods
Objectives:
Students will:
1. Investigate the official role and duties of the vice president and discuss some of the responsibilities of vice presidents from past administrations.
2. Read and discuss the article "Palin and Biden Are Cordial but Pointed."
3. Delve further into the vice president's role in the Constitution and in history; evaluate the backgrounds and qualifications of, as well as the televised debate between, the Democratic and Republican vice presidential candidates.
4. Write a persuasive essay in support of one of this year's vice presidential candidates.
Activities / Procedures:
 for a companion lesson for Grades 3-5.
1. WARM-UP/DO NOW
Engage students in a brief discussion about the vice presidential debate. How many students watched the debate? How many have heard, read or seen news coverage about it? What are their impressions? Then ask: In general, how important do you think the role of vice president of the United States is? Why?
Next, have students take a brief True/False quiz on the roles of the vice president of the United States using the handout found at . (Answers are, in order: True, False, False, True, True, False, False.)
Allow students several minutes to work, and then share and discuss responses as a class. If students are unfamiliar with the vice president's constitutional duty to preside over the Senate, explain that they will be investigating this role and other issues related to the vice presidency in this lesson. You may also wish to briefly discuss the vice president's roles as "acting president" when the president is unable to perform his or her normal duties and as first in line of succession to the presidency.
2. As a class, read and discuss the article " Palin and Biden Are Cordial but Pointed" (), focusing on the following questions:
a. On what issues did the vice presidential candidates spar in this debate?
b. How, according to this article, did the candidates come across? What words does the article use to describe the overall tone of the debate?
c. What do you think were the most memorable moments of the evening? Why?
d. Why was this highly anticipated debate "packed with political importance" as well as a "cultural event," according to the article? Do you think it will significantly change either team's chances in the November election?
e. Which, if either, of the candidates do you feel "won" this debate? Why?
3. ACTIVITY
After you have read and discussed the article as a class, have students revisit the role and duties of the vice president, which were introduced in the initial activity.
Focus on either the constitutional role of the vice president and/or on the history of how various vice presidents have interpreted and performed in the position. In either case, encourage students to bring statements made by Gov. Sarah Palin and Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. from the debate and elsewhere to bear on their consideration of history, and vice versa.
Suggestion for a constitutional role focus:
Discuss with students how the vice president has been instrumental in United States history. Consider both the succession angle as well as the Senate presidency.
Questions to consider might include these: When has the vice president cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate? When has the very possibility that he could break a tie been decisive in Senate debates? Why do you think the framers of the Constitution granted the Senate presidency to the vice president? How many vice presidents have succeeded to the presidency mid-term? How many have been elected after the president with whom they served left office?
For more information on this topic, see the United States Senate Web site's page on the President of the Senate: .
Suggestion for a historical focus:
Discuss with students how the role of vice president has evolved throughout modern history. Provide John Nance Garner's oft-cited alleged quotation, "The vice presidency isn't worth a pitcher of warm spit," together with examples of modern vice presidents, such as Walter Mondale and Dick Cheney, who carved out more substantial roles in their administrations.
Questions to consider might include these: Based on the past eight years, with Mr. Cheney as vice president, what are your impressions of the office? What executive and advisory duties have vice presidents had in the past thirty or so years? What informal policy roles have recent vice presidents had? What do you imagine the relationships of presidents and vice presidents have been like over the years? Do you see an "active" vice president as a benefit to an administration or as a drawback? Why? Do you think the Constitution should be amended to provide the vice president with more explicit and expanded powers? Why or why not?
For more information on this topic, see the above Senate Web site as well as the following: The New York Times Multimedia Feature "When the Vice President Really Matters" (http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2008/09/07/weekinreview/20080907_VEEP_GRAPHIC.html); the New York Times book review "How the First Mate Shifted the Ship of State's Course" (http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/16/books/16kaku.html), and the Austin Statesman article "Throughout History, Vice Presidents Fumed as They Waited in the Wings" (http://www.statesman.com/opinion/content/editorial/stories/insight/08/03/0803veep.html). You may also play or have students listen to the NPR piece "The Evolving Role of the Vice President": http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92705080.
Before continuing to the next activity, ask students how, if at all, this information might influence the ticket they support. Why?
Next, have students work in pairs or small groups, using all available resources, to complete the handout "The Role of Vice President" found at . In addition, based on the New York Times coverage of the vice presidential debates and other New York Times resources, have students fill in the handout "Senator Biden and Governor Palin on the Issues" found at . You may wish to have students complete this during the class period or as an ongoing assignment, as they learn more information about each running mate.
5. FOR HOMEWORK OR FUTURE CLASSES
After students have compiled a substantial amount of information on each vice presidential candidate's position on the issues, have them synthesize their findings in a persuasive essay, in support of one of the candidates. You may wish to offer the following prompts to guide them:

        
How does what you know now about the vice presidency and vice presidential history affect your decision to support this candidate?
        
In your opinion, what is the most important issue in this year's election, and how does this candidate's position relate to or reflect your stance?
        
What professional experience do you think this candidate lends to the ticket, and why?
        
What makes this person qualified to serve as first in line of succession to the president and to serve as president of the Senate, and why?
Students should take part in a peer editing session after their first essay drafts, and be evaluated based on their final essay.

- Who do you think would make the ideal presidential and vice-presidential team? Support your answer.
- What personal qualities do you think should be important in considering the qualifications of a vice-presidential candidate? Consider marital status, family, race/ethnicity, religion, gender, age, professional and political experience, education, personality, personal history, etc. Why and how are these qualities important?
- How do you think you will be affected by the administration of whoever becomes vice president? Why?Vocabulary:
miscalibration, gaffe, quelling, sparred, repartee, onus, mien, condescension, maverick, symmetry, lamented, agile, riposte, veer.Extension Activities:
1. Write a memo to one of the presidential or vice-presidential candidates in which you provide constructive criticism on his or her debating strategy (based on this week's televised debate). Provide a thorough analysis of his or her presentation skills (including substance, oration, body language and tone), and make at least two recommendations.
2. Act as the moderator for a class debate on which ticket will make the better White House administration: Obama-Biden or McCain-Palin. Decide on the format and make a list of rules to govern the debate. You may want to consider the official debate format of the Commission on Presidential Debates (http://www.debates.org/pages/education.html#format). Then formulate 10 to 15 questions that cover the following five topics: the war in Iraq and Afghanistan; terrorism and national security; the economy; education; and the environment. If possible, stage the debate during a class period.
3. Choose a third-party vice-presidential candidate to research and write a biographical profile. Some third-party vice-presidential candidates include Matt Gonzalez (Independent), Darrell Castle (Constitution Party), Rosa Clemente (Green Party), Wayne Allyn Root (Libertarian Party), Frank McEnulty (Reform Party), Stewart Alexander (Socialist Party U.S.A.), Eugene Puryear (Party for Socialism and Liberation) and Alyson Kennedy (Socialist Workers Party).
4. Create a resume for your ideal candidate for the position of vice president of the United States. Be sure to include education, relevant experience and personal interests.Interdisciplinary Connections:
American History - Create a chart in which you compare the professional experience and campaign performance of vice presidents from the last five administrations. The chart should answer the following questions: How much political experience did each vice president have before taking office? What other kinds of experience did he or she have? Was the vice president initially running for president? Did he run for president after serving as vice president? If so, did he win? How did he perform in the vice presidential debate? Did he "win," "lose" or "tie"? Do experts believe he played a key role in the election?
        
Fine Arts- In recent times, presidential candidates have chosen campaign theme songs to reflect or represent their ideologies and plans for the future. Research the theme songs of the 2008 presidential candidates, and play clips of the songs for your class. Challenge your classmates to match the song to the candidate. Write a paragraph explaining whether the song reflects the party's election platform.
        
Journalism - Design and conduct a poll to gather information on the vice-presidential candidates in the 2008 election from classmates, neighbors and family members. Upon analyzing the results, which ticket do you feel has a better chance to win in your community? Report your findings in your school paper.Academic Content Standards:

HEADLINE: Pessimism About Jobs, Often a Recession Sign

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at norris.blogs.nytimes.com.

 BODY:
AMERICANS have concluded that it is tough to get a job. That fact, along with a host of other issues, ranging from high gasoline prices to falling home prices and the credit crisis, provides reason to expect consumer spending to be weak.
 The belief that work is hard to find has typically become as widespread as it is now only many months after a recession has begun. In 2001, in fact, the view did not get that negative until after the recession was already over. 
 Worries about jobs often continue well after recessions end, a sign that the current sour outlook could continue for some time, even if the economy is close to hitting bottom.
 The figures on job market psychology are collected every month as part of the Conference Board's consumer confidence survey. Individuals are asked if jobs are plentiful, not so plentiful or hard to get. 
 The accompanying chart shows the net percentage of those who think jobs are plentiful less those who think they are hard to get. A number above zero shows that more think the job market is good than believe it to be bad. To smooth the numbers, the figures shown are three-month moving averages.
 In the preliminary September results, released this week, 12.2 percent thought jobs were plentiful and 32.8 percent thought they were hard to get. The 20.6 percentage point difference constitutes the worst job market perspective since late 2003.
 That figure has been getting worse at a rapid rate, so the three-month average is just a negative 18.5 percent. But that is still very low by standards of the last quarter-century. The figure was, however, much worse in the 1970s and early 1980s, when a series of recessions led to concern about prospects for the American economy.
 On Friday, the government reported that the unemployment rate remained at 6.1 percent in September but that the number of jobs fell 159,000 in the month. The survey was taken in the week that ended Sept. 12, just before the credit crisis intensified.
 ''It's the last snapshot of the economy before the credit crunch really hit,'' said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG. He said the employment rate was likely to rise to 7 percent next year. 
 In the last two economic cycles, the recession was under way by the time more Americans thought jobs were hard to get than thought they were plentiful. This year, the figure turned negative in March, which would be consistent with a recession having started in late 2007.
 The other chart shows the percentage of respondents saying they expect to buy a car in the next six months. That figure, again on a three-month moving average, has fallen to 5 percent, the lowest figure since the Conference Board started asking the question in 1967.
 Detroit does not need to be told that polls show that auto buyers are reluctant; the carmakers reported very bad September sales this week.
 Typically, auto-buying intentions are slow to turn up until there is a better view of the job market, which implies a long period before revival.
 As the credit squeeze has intensified, many economic indicators have turned down. It now appears likely that the third quarter, which ended this week, will show a decline in gross domestic product, perhaps of 2 percent or even 3 percent at an annual rate. The government's first estimate of that figure will be released on Oct. 30, just five days before the presidential election, and it is unlikely to improve the outlook for auto sales or employment.

HEADLINE: STOCKS & BONDS Bailout Bill Fails to Reassure Investors

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Wall Street finally got what it had been demanding all week, a financial rescue package, but by the time the gavel fell in Washington on Friday, investors had turned their attention to other problems in the economy. 
 On Monday, the House of Representatives rejected a $700 billion bailout plan for the nation's financial system, causing the Dow Jones industrial average to fall 777 points. On Friday, after round-the-clock negotiations, the House passed the plan, sending the Dow down 157 points.
 It was a disappointing end to a cantankerous session. The Dow gained nearly 300 points in the morning in anticipation the bill would go through; when it passed, those gains were erased. But the afternoon swoon was less a judgment on the merits of the bailout than proof of a broader truth about the market: investors are always looking ahead. 
 ''We're dealing with the next situation,'' said Howard Silverblatt, the senior index analyst at Standard & Poor's.
 Investors were already pivoting their focus to growing evidence that the nation is embroiled in a recession. A report on Friday from the Labor Department said the economy lost 159,000 jobs in September, far more than economists had expected. Other reports this week revealed sudden collapses in the manufacturing sector. Some economists also are predicting the economy will contract in the months ahead.
 Those developments did not bode well for the corporate earnings that investors watch closely, creating a dour outlook that helped send stocks lower late in the day.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 15.05 points, or 1.35 percent, to close at 1,099.23, ending under 1,100 for the first time in four years -- a fitting end to the index's fourth-worst week in half a century. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average declined 157.47 points, or 1.5 percent, to 10,325.38. The Nasdaq composite index fell 29.33 points, or 1.45 percent, to 1,947.39.
 ''Investors still have to face some significant challenges in the broad economy that can't be magically removed by a group of our Congressional leaders,'' said Marc D. Stern, the chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust. ''Investors have to confront a series of unknowns in the weeks ahead that can be disconcerting.''
 Also weighing on investors were the strains on the flow of credit, which the bailout bill was intended to relieve. 
 Analysts said it might take several days before the effect of the bill's approval could be seen on the credit markets. On Friday afternoon, the signals were mixed: high-yield bonds and junk bonds eased slightly, but Treasury bills moved against expectations, becoming more expensive as investors remained nervous about emerging from the safety of government notes.
 It was too soon to tell whether interest rates that banks charge each other for overnight loans -- a crucial measure of the flow of credit to businesses and consumers -- would fall.
 Investors and analysts interviewed Friday said they were glad to see the bailout package approved, but they warned that credit would not immediately loosen.
 ''It is not a panacea,'' said Douglas M. Peta, a market strategist at J.& W. Seligman. ''Credit is the lifeblood of the economy. Until the short-term funding markets start behaving regularly, and until banks are willing to play their role in the system, the direction in stocks is going to be down.''
 Mr. Peta said Friday's stock sell-off ''was a rational response when the credit markets are almost practically not functioning.''
 A few other factors may have been at play. On Friday morning, Wells Fargo, the San Francisco-based bank, said it had made a $15.1 billion bid for the Wachovia Corporation, scuttling a rival deal with Citigroup that had been struck under government pressure. The move helped raise confidence among investors that companies were still willing to take on major acquisitions amid the current crisis. Still, financial stocks as a group ended lower for the day.
 The sell-off after the vote on Capitol Hill may have been the result of investors' tendency to buy on expectations -- in this case, that the House would ultimately pass the bill -- and sell when the event actually occurs. 
 And Mr. Stern, of Bessemer Trust, noted that Fridays were becoming popular days for investors to sell their stock holdings. ''There are two more days that used to be called the weekend, and now are simply two more business days, where important news may develop,'' Mr. Stern said, referring to recent developments -- the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers; the sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America -- all of which have occurred on the weekend. 
 ''There's no way to trade on that news until Monday. Therefore you need to position your portfolio on Friday to be ready for what happens over the weekend.'' 
 Mr. Stern chuckled. ''In 2008, you have to stay close to your BlackBerry on the weekend.''
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury bill rose 6/32, to 103 8/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 3.6 percent, from 3.63 percent late Thursday. Oil prices fell 9 cents, to settle at $93.88 a barrel. 
 In Europe, the markets closed ahead of the House vote. The major indexes all rose after stocks on Wall Street advanced. The FTSE 100 index in Britain ended up 2.3 percent, the CAC-40 in Paris rose 3 percent, and the DAX in Frankfurt gained 2.4 percent.

HEADLINE: They're Pinching Hundred-Dollar Bills

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
The jet set, too, feels the pain.
 Louis L. Gonda, a regular on the Forbes list of the 400 richest Americans, has put two jets on the market. Interested parties could pick up the pair for $108 million.
 A private businessman who has given many millions to charities, Mr. Gonda, along with his father and a partner, sold their airline leasing company to the American International Group in 1990 for stock and cash. While it is not clear how many shares of A.I.G. he held onto or whether A.I.G.'s problems prompted the plane sale, the stock is not worth much today. Mr. Gonda would not return calls to discuss his finances. 
 He still has a luxurious home in Bel Air, Calif., and a penthouse on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. But he sold a $2.7 million property in Southern California at a loss in July. And Forbes has just dropped him from its list, citing the drop in value of A.I.G. shares. 
 The turmoil on Wall Street has not only taken down once-solid companies, it has cut into the wealth of some Americans whose fortunes were tied to those companies. So the wealthy -- and many still are that, by most measures -- are postponing big purchases. 
 Suppliers of luxury goods ranging from jets and jewelry to thousand-dollar bottles of wine and exotic vacations say demand is softening. While the middle class slowed its buying months ago, a decline in spending by the wealthy represents just one more drag on the economy.
 ''The superwealthy in America are in a state of shock,'' said Ronald Winston, honorary chairman of Harry Winston, the jeweler. ''They are not rushing out to buy expensive diamonds. The psychological mind-set of the nation is keyed to the stock market, and in a downturn everybody is psychologically affected.''
 To be sure, some of the superwealthy have made such big fortunes that they remain hugely rich despite the recent crises. Richard S. Fuld Jr., the former chief executive of Lehman Brothers, for example, took home $256 million in cash and proceeds from stock sales from 1993 through November 2007, according to the compensation analysis firm Equilar.
 But even those who still make millions a year, or who had giant paydays before the downturn, may be uncomfortable spending lavishly when so many are hurting and worrying about their jobs. 
 Polly Onet, whose company, Ober, Onet & Associates, specializes in planning large parties, said the first signs of a slowdown appeared last summer. 
 One woman recently planning a surprise party for her husband decided not to hire a headliner to perform, which can cost $150,000 to $1 million. The hostess also told Ms. Onet that she wanted a ''grunge'' look, rather than making the space look elegant. ''Is the family hurting or is it scaling back for appearances?'' she said. ''In many cases it is probably some of both.'' And she said that several days ago a hedge fund, which she declined to identify, postponed a January party at the Museum of Natural History. 
 A strong indicator of the severity of the fallout will probably come in mid-October, when some of the wealthiest families complete plans for the Christmas holidays. Traditionally, prices at high-end resorts from Hawaii to the Caribbean can range from $1,000 a night for a room to $25,000 a night for a villa. 
 At the Sandy Lane resort in Barbados, rooms cost at least $3,000 a night in season and villas go for as much as $25,000 a night, with a required minimum two-week stay. Families that reserved there for the holiday season before Oct. 15 must pay 25 percent of the total cost in advance, and will have to pay the balance in mid-October. Renting a villa would cost $350,000 for a two-week stay, not including lunch and dinner. For now, the hotel is sold out. But travel agents are watching closely to see what the room availability is after that deadline.
 If the jet sales business is any indication, there is likely to be some fallout from the Wall Street turmoil. 
 ''Starting out in the beginning of the year, we got some indication that things would slow down,'' said Brad Wollen, general manager at Clay Lacy Aviation and vice president for aircraft sales. 
 But, he said, the market for business jets that cost $30 million to $75 million ''had been pretty well insulated until just two months ago.'' Then, he said, ''We started seeing them come on the market and the prices coming down.''
 The number of private jets available for sale or lease has increased by 31 percent since last year, and resale transactions in the first eight months of the year are down 9 percent compared with 2007, according to the Amstat Corporation, which tracks the corporate jet industry.
 Mr. Gonda, for example, is offering his Gulfstream V for $43 million and a Gulfstream G550 for $65 million, according to several executives in the jet sales industry who did not want to be identified because they do not like to discuss individual transactions. 
 As recently as 2007, Mr. Gonda was listed at No. 286 on the Forbes 400, with an estimated net worth of $1.7 billion. Since then, public filings show, he sold a home in Playa del Rey, Calif., for $2.4 million in July that he bought in 2006 for $2.7 million. 
 Executives in the private airline industry say they expect the number of planes for sale to rise in part because many of the superwealthy borrowed against their stock to make the purchases. ''If they borrowed against their stock and their stock goes down in value, then they have a margin call,'' said Richard T. Santulli, chief executive of NetJets, the world's largest operator of private jets. 
 The increase in the number of planes on the market ''is not dissimilar from the Internet bubble,'' he said. ''When the market crashed, there was a flood of planes for sale. But this is more severe than the Internet. The airplane market will face a problem because the banks will make it more difficult to finance purchases.'' 
 If selling jets is the most drastic way of economizing, most belt-tightening is far subtler. 
 Sales of expensive wines are off at Sherry-Lehmann, a well-known wine and liquor merchant in Manhattan. 
 ''People had a great deal of money over the past few years,'' said Chris Adams, executive vice president at Sherry-Lehmann. ''But there is a pause in the market. Over the last year, Champagne sales have softened but sparkling wine has gone up.'' 
 At a wine auction at Sotheby's on Sept. 20 in New York, revenue was down 10 percent compared with the auction last year. Bottles of California wine costing $700 to $1,000 or more were hardest hit, said Jamie Ritchie, Sotheby's senior vice president for wine. 
 The slowdown has also touched travel agents who book high-end trips. ''We are not seeing the normal flow of new bookings,'' said Steve Ridgway, president of Travel Concepts. His firm, based in Palo Alto, Calif., plans educational trips for alumni organizations and museums to places like Bhutan that can cost $8,000 and up for each person. ''We are not getting cancellations, but what we are getting is a bit of wait and see.'' 
 Companies and individuals are also economizing in other ways. Julian Niccolini, who runs the Four Seasons restaurant in Manhattan, where the city's top business executives like to eat and eye one another, says he has seen an impact. ''Of course, people are concerned,'' he said. ''What I really believe is that people are more careful about what they order. Instead of ordering three or four bottles of wine, they order two bottles. They may reduce their drinking but they are still coming.''

HEADLINE: O. J. Simpson Found Guilty in Robbery Trial

BYLINE: By STEVE FRIESS

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS O.J. Simpson was found guilty late Friday on all 12 counts, including armed robbery and kidnapping, that stemmed from last year's hotel-room confrontation.
 The verdict, which comes 13 years to the day after Mr. Simpson was acquitted in the highly publicized murders of his ex-wife and her friend, was a shocking conclusion to a four-week trial that many have seen as a proxy for those unsatisfied by that 1995 outcome.
 Mr. Simpson now faces 15 years to life for the kidnapping charge as well as a minimum of at least another 10 years in prison on the other charges. His attorney, Yale Galanter, said he would appeal.
 The football Hall of Fame inductee showed little emotion as the verdicts were read and the judge denied him bail. As his sister, Carmelita, wept and fainted in the front row, he was led away in handcuffs. Mr. Simpson is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 5. 
 ''He's extremely upset, extremely emotional,'' said Mr. Galanter of his client's demeanor after being removed from the courtroom. ''We knew this was going to be very difficult, we knew the jury was going to be very difficult, we knew the jurisdiction would be very difficult.''
 Clark County District Attorney David Roger, the lead prosecutor in the case, said his office would not comment on the case until after sentencing. None of the jurors spoke to the media on Friday.
 The charges arose after Mr. Simpson led five cohorts on a raid of a Palace Station Hotel-Casino room and departed with hundreds of items of memorabilia related to the sports careers of Mr. Simpson and three other athletes.
 The items were in the possession of two memorabilia dealers, Bruce L. Fromong and Alfred Beardsley, who were led to believe that a prospective buyer was coming to browse the goods. Instead, Mr. Simpson and his group burst into the room. According to several witnesses, at least one gun was brandished.
 The presence of a weapon adds years to the minimum sentences for nine of the 12 charges, which also included conspiracy to commit robbery and kidnapping, burglary, robbery, assault and coercion.
 The jury of nine women and three men deliberated for 13 hours, mulling weeks of testimony as well as hours of surreptitious audio recordings of the planning and execution of the event by Thomas Riccio, a memorabilia auctioneer who arranged the confrontation.
 There were no blacks among the jurors, a concern of the defense that Mr. Simpson's attorneys said would likely be a part of an appeal. In 1995, the 12-person jury included eight blacks, which some believe was a factor in his acquittal on charges he stabbed to death his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman.
 Convicted alongside Mr. Simpson, 61, was Clarence Stewart, 54, one of the five men who accompanied Mr. Simpson in the raid. Mr. Stewart faces the same sentences.
 Throughout the trial, Mr. Stewart's attorney E. Brent Bryson asked repeatedly for Mr. Stewart to receive a separate trial because associating with Mr. Simpson was poisonous to the defense. Each of his severance motions was denied.
 ''If there was ever a trial in the history of American jurisprudence that should have been severed, it was obviously this trial,'' a stunned and dazed Mr. Bryson said. ''There's a spillover effect here. There's a gentleman by the name of O.J. Simpson who was sitting across the table. Mr. Simpson has a certain history that followed him into the courtroom and, unfortunately, it engulfed Mr. Stewart also.''
 Mr. Simpson's defense was that he sought only to retrieve personal keepsakes such as ceremonial footballs from his Hall of Fame N.F.L. career and photos of his family that years ago were taken from his home. Mr. Roger told the jury he should have filed a civil lawsuit to regain the items if they were, in fact, stolen from him.
 ''We don't want people going into rooms to take property,'' said Mr. Roger in his closing arguments on Thursday. ''That is robbery. You don't go in and get a gun and demand property from people.''
 Four of the 24 witnesses who testified were the other men who accompanied Mr. Simpson and Mr. Stewart, all of whom have accepted plea deals from prosecutors in exchange for testimony. Two of those men, Walter Alexander and Michael McClinton, carried guns in the incident, and one, Mr. McClinton, testified that he did so at Mr. Simpson's request.
 Mr. Simpson said he did not know the two would carry weapons and never saw any guns displayed during the incident.
 This Simpson trial failed to capture the intense public interest that turned his 1995 trial into the so-called Trial of the Century. That spectacle became a racial touchstone and turned a list of legal analysts including Greta Van Susteren, Jeffrey Toobin and Star Jones into television stars. Few of the media stars involved in that case flocked to this one Vanity Fair's Dominick Dunne was a notable exception and even Marcia Clark, the former prosecutor who failed to convict Mr. Simpson in 1995, did not appear despite securing media credentials to report for Entertainment Tonight.
 Indeed, this case played out against the backdrop of a nation obsessed by a presidential election campaign and the nation's economic crisis. But the current trial also featured victims who were far less sympathetic, two middle-aged memorabilia dealers who both attempted to profit from their roles in this case by trying to sell their stories to the tabloid media.
 The defense focused much of its efforts on discrediting Mr. Fromong, Mr. Beardsley and the four men who assisted Mr. Simpson and Mr. Stewart in the alleged robbery. On several occasions, Simpson attorneys Yale Galanter and Gabriel Grasso caught those witnesses in apparent contradictions, such as when Mr. Fromong insisted he did not try to sell his story despite audio recordings immediately after the incident in which Mr. Fromong is heard saying, ''I'll have 'Inside Edition' down here tomorrow. I told them I want big money.''
 While Mr. Simpson's famous acquittal in the 1994 murders was never discussed during the trial, it hung over the proceedings. Jurors were quizzed extensively before their selection about their views of the divisive 1995 trial, and references were made in some of the audio recordings to the fact that Mr. Simpson owes the estate of Ms. Simpson and Mr. Goldman $33.5 million because in 1997 he was held liable in a civil lawsuit for the deaths.
 Mr. Galanter attacked that issue in his closing, noting that Mr. Riccio's recorder picked up police officers at the crime scene seeming to exult in their chance to prosecute Mr. Simpson. He also noted that Mr. Riccio alone testified that he had made more than $200,000 in fees from the news media in exchange for interviews and rights to his recordings.
 ''This case has never been about a search for the true facts,'' Mr. Galanter said. ''This case has taken on a life of its own because Mr. Simpson's involved. You know that, I know that, every cooperator, every person with a gun, every person who signed a book deal, every person who got paid money, the police, the district attorney's office, was only interested in one thing: Mr. Simpson.''

HEADLINE: European Banks Expect to Benefit From the Chaos in Their Industry

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and CARTER DOUGHERTY; Nelson D. Schwartz reported from Villiers-le-Mahieu, France, and Carter Dougherty from Frankfurt.

DATELINE: VILLIERS-LE-MAHIEU, France 

 BODY:
Late last month, with Wall Street in disarray, American bankers watched anxiously as the fate of the $700 billion bailout proposal hung in the balance.
 A continent away, French bankers gathered just outside Paris at a 17th-century chateau and confidently laid out plans for a global landscape where many once-formidable American competitors and some weaker European banks have vanished.
 ''With fewer players in the U.S. and in Europe, clearly there is an opportunity for Societe Generale,'' the bank's chief executive, Frederic Oudea, told colleagues amid a serene setting of ivy-covered walls and classical statuary. He ticked off sectors where the bank expected to make inroads, including investment banking and equity derivatives.
 Executives at Europe's still-solvent giants see an opportunity to crack businesses long dominated by more nimble American companies brought low by the financial crisis. 
 The knowledge that Europe, on the whole, generally stuck with its broad ''universal'' bank approach and never fully bought into the stand-alone investment banking model that has now collapsed provides a reassuring backdrop for its executives. 
 Europe's banks still have problems -- a trading scandal cost Societe Generale 4.9 billion euros ($7.2 billion) this year and UBS has written down tens of billions of dollars in distressed mortgage debt. 
 And on Saturday, President Nicolas Sarkozy and other European leaders will try to formulate a coordinated response to the credit crisis, which has already pushed Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland and Ireland to shore up lenders. European Union officials hope to strengthen regulatory oversight of an industry where national borders are increasingly blurred.
 Yet there is already evidence of a shift. In the prime brokerage business -- holding assets, clearing trades and providing financing and back-office services for hedge funds -- Credit Suisse, BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank and UBS say a tidal wave of money has poured in from clients nervous that other American companies might follow Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns.
 ''We had massive inflows,'' said Alex Ehrlich, global head of prime services for UBS. Mr. Ehrlich said his firm was poised to take over the No. 3 ranking in prime brokerage, filling the position Bear Stearns once occupied behind No. 1 Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.
 ''We were just deluged,'' Mr. Ehrlich said, with ''tens of billions'' coming in without the need to call around and pitch services. ''We were working very hard to accommodate clients, and trying at the same time to make sure we didn't screw anything up in processing record volumes.''
 Even for the strongest financial institutions, banking is not an easy business to be in right now and it could well get worse. And once the current crisis is over, banks in both the United States and Europe will be subject to more regulation and tighter capital requirements, a sure-fire recipe for lower profits.
 Even before a new framework is sorted out, leading European banks -- like the surviving American giants Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase -- are preparing to take advantage of their more diversified stature.
 Klaus-Peter Muller, chairman of Commerzbank and the Association of German Banks, said the universal bank model was looking better by the day, thanks to the multiple pillars that support its business. ''Usually when one pillar suffers, the others do better,'' Mr. Muller said. ''Seldom do all sectors of a universal bank do badly.''
 Barclays, the British banking giant, acquired the North American investment banking and capital markets units of Lehman, along with its New York offices, for $1.75 billion late last month.
 That is far less than such businesses were worth only a few weeks ago.
 On Wednesday, the French bank BNP Paribas completed its acquisition of Bank of America's prime brokerage unit, giving it new entree in a business long dominated by the likes of JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.
 ''People are now coming to us,'' said BNP's chief executive, Baudouin Prot. 
 And if they are not coming, European banks are not shy about going after them. Deutsche Bank's poaching of prime brokerage clients from Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs was forceful enough that it got a polite but firm word from regulators, an executive with the bank said. With the crisis this bad, Deutsche Bank was told, we need you to ease off.
 Deutsche Bank is also casting about for an acquisition in asset management in the United States, the executive said, requesting anonymity because no targets had been settled on yet. 
 Deutsche Bank also secured its footprint in the ultra-stable European consumer banking business by seizing a controlling stake last month in Postbank, a German company that was once a stodgy state-owned business.
 The Continent's insurance executives have more than a little swagger as well.
 European insurers watched the near collapse of the insurance titan American International Group with a sense of awe that quickly turned into anticipation at the prospect of snapping up parts of what was left.
 ''Insurance suddenly looks like a pretty attractive business to be in,'' said Paul Achleitner, chief financial officer at Allianz in Munich.
 He said that with his company's revenue heavily weighted toward Europe, Allianz was interested in acquiring parts of A.I.G.'s business in Asia, though he declined to be more specific. Across town, the reinsurer Munich Re, which also competes in the primary insurance business, said it would look for deals in Asia and Eastern Europe.
 With A.I.G.'s outlook still murky, German insurers are not the only ones that stand to profit. AXA of France, Aviva of Britain, Generali of Italy and Swiss Re are other big insurers that could bid for the pieces of A.I.G. that are essentially owned by the government, analysts and executives said.
 ''I think insurance will be an industry where at the end of the day the majority of the leading players are in Europe,'' Mr. Achleitner said. ''We'll have to see about the Asians.''
 The billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett, whose company, Berkshire Hathaway, has stakes in several insurers, is likely to be one American survivor.
 In good times and bad, banks frequently raid each other for talent. But with the downturn on Wall Street, European banks are in a better position to search for talent that can be had more cheaply than in the past.
 Mr. Prot, the BNP chief executive, said his bank typically did not offer the outsize pay packages once common at many American firms.
 But that does not matter now. ''We are seeing resumes from people that might have gone to investment banks that have now disappeared,'' Mr. Prot said. ''Lehman had good talent.''
 Deutsche Bank snapped up a Lehman managing director, Maarten van Berckel, as managing director for global banking in the Benelux countries.
 UBS, despite its extensive write-offs from subprime mortgages and the continuing American investigation into its tax avoidance practices, has hired 26 financial advisers from Lehman, bulking up its wealth management unit in New York as well as San Francisco and Los Angeles.
 The hiring on Wall Street hints at a long-term faith in the United States that many Americans seem to lack these days. 
 ''The United States will come back, and European banks may use the change to take on a few good people and build that up,'' said Christian Strenger, a board member of DWS Investment, Deutsche Bank's asset management business. ''The United States is very flexible in these things, and what is the drama today is the opportunity tomorrow.''
 But the Wall Street of tomorrow is likely to be very different, ruled by more strictly regulated big banks with fingers in many different operations.
 ''The market today is choosing the business model for the future,'' said Severin Cabannes, deputy chief executive at Societe Generale, ''and voting for the universal banking model.''

HEADLINE: Smarting From Crises in the Past, Germans Approach Bailouts With Reluctance

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH; Carter Dougherty contributed reporting from Frankfurt, and Victor Homola from Berlin.

DATELINE: BERLIN 

 BODY:
Germans tend to be the strait-laced, play-it-safe types in financial matters. That has left them particularly frustrated at footing the bill for bank bailouts and fretting over their accounts because of a global financial crisis that seems to emanate from the spendthrift ways of others and the unfathomable risks taken by Wall Street bankers.
 American taxpayers may be no happier about bailing out Wall Street, either, but those living in Germany know that they bear little resemblance to Americans on economic matters.
 After struggling at times in recent years, the German government has the federal budget nearly balanced, though that goal is most likely out the window now. The world's leading exporter of goods, Germany had a current-account surplus of $185 billion last year, compared with the United States' deficit last year of $731 billion in that broad measure of trade. 
 Unlike in fellow European Union countries like Spain, Ireland and Britain, there was no real-estate bubble here. Germans abhor credit. And few own stocks, just 5.4 percent according to a study by the Deutsches Aktieninstitut, a nonprofit group that promotes equity ownership. Instead, most Germans sock away 11 percent of their incomes on average into savings accounts, often with Sparkassen, municipally owned savings banks that are popular and stable.
 Risk averse and cautious with their own money, most German citizens are particularly unhappy about the notion of paying billions for bad mortgage bets made by their financial institutions. It is a battle between the bankers and the piggy bankers. 
 ''It's always the taxpayers,'' said Marianne Rochlitz, 61, who works at the Berlin State Opera, expressing a common complaint in interviews with Germans passing through the Alexanderplatz in Berlin on a rainy October afternoon. ''Whatever it is that happens, we have to pay for the mess.'' 
 Attitudes here help explain why German officials were quick to reject out of hand a notion that France and a couple of other nations briefly toyed with: a $414 billion bank bailout. They have chosen to stand pat, in the belief that they have rooted out and rescued their own mortgage-lamed institutions, and they do not want to foot the bill for other countries' problems. 
 Yet the financial crisis has been unpredictable. Germany's own flagship institution, Deutsche Bank, had enormous but manageable write-downs of over $11 billion from the earlier stages of the crisis. Now, like other large European banks, Deutsche Bank is extremely leveraged, given the erosion in its share price, analysts said.
 Chancellor Angela Merkel has responded in a discreet fashion, siding with the piggy bankers, while explaining the local bailouts. ''I have my own savings and no fear about them,'' Mrs. Merkel told constituents Thursday in an interview with the newspaper Bild. 
 Germany is a country where economic prudence was ingrained in the popular consciousness by long centuries of war and the wrenching hyperinflation of the 1920s. ''Americans have trust in the future and are willing to borrow against it,'' said Matthias von Arnim, a German financial expert and author. ''The Germans say, 'In the future everything is going to be worse, so I have to save.' ''
 One very big exception came during the dot-com bubble, when even the equities-shy Germans grew exasperated watching everyone else get rich playing the stock market. They piled in just as the bubble was about to burst, in an unfortunate case of better late than never that turned out to be better never than late. It is a parallel, experts here say, to the last-minute leap several German banks made into American mortgage debt toward the end of the rise in real-estate prices in the United States. 
 Mrs. Merkel defended the decision to rescue Hypo Real Estate, a commercial property lender, with a nearly $50 billion line of credit from the government and several banks as a move to protect the public. ''We act not in favor of the banks but for the security of the individual citizens of our country,'' Mrs. Merkel told Bild. 
 But the evident concern etched on the faces of government leaders here is not just about answering to the displeased German voters. It is much more the fear that, if the instability in the financial system continues, there could be more bailouts to come. 
 For now, the problems seem to be limited to a few lenders, particularly among the more plodding German banks. They plunged into complex, mortgage-backed securities with particular gusto because they saw American and British institutions making huge profits. 
 The problem for German policy makers is twofold. On one hand, they can never be sure whether another nasty surprise will pop up on another German bank's balance sheet. On the other hand, even financial boy scouts can be caught off guard as panic and broken trust continue to ripple through global markets and as credit to highly leveraged lending institutions dries up. There is nowhere to hide, and the definition of a healthy balance sheet keeps changing. 
 It has been easier for German leaders to blame the Americans than to admit that some of their own institutions were hooked on bad mortgage debt. The current cover of the German magazine Spiegel shows a picture of the Statue of Liberty's torch, extinguished, under the headline, ''The Price of Arrogance.'' 
 Government officials have fretted publicly about the crisis, in particular the need for the United States to get its house in order and pass a rescue package, which Congress did this week and which President Bush signed on Friday. Most memorably, Germany's finance minister, Peer Steinbruck, declared last week that ''the U.S. will lose its status as the superpower of the world financial system,'' and that ''the financial crisis was above all an American problem.'' 
 It was just a few days later, however, that the German government, along with a number of banks, was forced to put together the rescue deal to save Munich-based Hypo Real Estate, which was announced Monday by the company. 
 ''The Europeans were laughing, more or less, when the U.S. investment banks came down,'' said Arnoud Boot, professor of finance and banking at the University of Amsterdam. ''They said, 'We don't have that. We have superior supervision.' ''
 He added: ''Now, look at what's happening to commercial banks in several European countries. That type of rhetoric is misplaced.''
 Last year, when the financial crisis first erupted, two German banks had to be rescued after speculating in subprime-related securities. The state lender SachsenLB had to be bailed out by the state of Saxony and other regional banks. IKB Deutsche Industriebank lost billions of euros speculating on mortgage-backed securities and had to be bailed out by the state-owned KfW Bankengruppe and then sold for pennies on the dollar to an American private equity firm. 
 KfW, in turn, revealed last month that it had half a billion euros caught up in the Lehman Brothers collapse, including a last-minute transfer as Lehman entered bankruptcy that made KfW a laughingstock nationwide.
 Klaus Zimmermann, director of the German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin, said that the greater regulation that German government officials have called for in the United States would not necessarily have prevented the crisis. 
 But Mr. Zimmerman said that he saw the German banking system as more stable, primarily because banks here are better diversified than many United States institutions.
 In interviews here, German citizens actually seemed less willing to blame the Americans for the troubles at home, pinning the problem on the greed of their own banks. 
 ''The Americans always go first,'' said Gesine Wiemer, 40, who works in marketing for a scientific research company, ''but the rest of them go along with them.''

HEADLINE: City Opera Lays Off 11 Members Of Its Staff

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
New York City Opera has laid off 11 members of its administrative staff because of financial pressures and a lack of work caused by the cancellation of most of its season, a spokesman said on Friday. 
 The employees, mostly in junior positions, were dismissed on Wednesday and given severance packages, said the spokesman, Pascal Nadon. ''There is no plan for them to be rehired,'' he said in a telephone interview.
 The opera is offering limited programming while its Lincoln Center home, the New York State Theater, is renovated. ''Fewer staff members are needed to implement the coming season,'' Mr. Nadon wrote in an e-mail message. The company ''believes that this reorganization will position the opera to deal with current economic conditions.''
 The laid-off employees come from a ''variety of departments,'' Mr. Nadon said, including marketing, development, finance, artistic and production. The entire administrative staff numbers 82.
 The layoffs weren't announced but were confirmed after a reporter's inquiry and come just before Saturday's season opener, a concert on Staten Island by City Opera Orchestra and Chorus. The layoffs follow other turbulence, including a quixotic bid by the general manager-designate, Gerard Mortier, to take over the Bayreuth Festival in Germany, which surprised board members.
 City Opera faces a deficit of up to $15 million, made up of previous shortfalls and an expected gap this season. Fund-raising had also fallen, as some board members were not convinced by Mr. Mortier's plans to shake up the company, Mr. Mortier has said. But company officials say the board is now behind him. 
 In what Mr. Nadon called an unrelated development, the opera's executive director, Jane M. Gullong, will leave the company, as Mr. Mortier has effectively eliminated her job. ''The way Gerard Mortier works is, he never had an executive director in previous functions,'' Mr. Nadon said. ''It was clear that Gerard would not need an executive director.'' 
 Ms. Gullong, who Mr. Nadon said was leaving on good terms, will depart at the end of the year. She was named executive director in late 2004 and was the chief fundraiser for a decade before that. She did not return a voice mail message left on Friday.
 Mr. Mortier is in his last year as director of the Paris National Opera and will take over at City Opera next season. He was in Paris on Friday, and there was no answer at his office.

HEADLINE: Bailout Brings With It Diverse Perks

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD and KATE GALBRAITH; Ron Lieber contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The economic bailout package contains an assortment of benefits for consumers. 
 It more than doubles the amount of insurance backing bank deposits and protects millions of taxpayers from paying the more onerous alternative minimum tax. It includes perks for green-minded consumers and puts mental health coverage on an even footing with physical health benefits.
 But the package does not include the one provision that consumer advocacy groups and some Democrats had initially been pushing for -- giving bankruptcy judges the power to modify troubled borrowers' mortgages on their primary residences. While the new law does offer a helping hand to these homeowners, critics say the benefits will not be as substantive as the bankruptcy judge provision would have been.
 ''While we are hopeful that some of the provisions in the bill will push loan servicers and investors to offer affordable deals to homeowners seeking to save their homes,'' said Alys Cohen, a staff lawyer at the National Consumer Law Center, ''the bill is essentially a bailout of the actors who funded the lending abuses of the last decade without any guarantee that homeowners will get the assistance they need.'' 
 The law may well provide indirect assistance to consumers, if it can stabilize the nation's financial institutions, reopen the credit spigot and prevent a deeper economic slowdown. It also preserves many of the existing tax benefits that were due to expire and adds a few more.
 ''There are probably two headlines about this,'' said Clint Stretch, managing principal of tax policy at Deloitte Tax in Washington. ''One is that the vast majority of what they've done in the bill is to keep the law the way it has been.'' 
 ''Secondly, they have made fairly significant progress in the renewable, sustainable energy area,'' Mr. Stretch added. ''It does look like a hodgepodge, but Congress is saying that the tax system should be a part of a solution, both with respect to carbon and more generally.''
 Here are some of the items that will affect consumers:
 TROUBLED HOMEOWNERS The Treasury Department will be buying toxic mortgage assets from financial institutions as part of the bailout. But it is unclear how many mortgages it will ultimately own or control and whether it will be able to exert enough influence to move homeowners into more traditional mortgages they can afford.
 The law states that the Treasury Department is required to ''maximize assistance to homeowners'' and encourage mortgage servicers to modify loans through programs including Hope for Homeowners, which went into effect this week. The department is required to report the number of modifications and foreclosures within 60 days after the bill becomes law.
 It also extends through 2012 the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007. Under the program, homeowners whose mortgage amounts were reduced will not owe tax on the amount forgiven, which is sometimes treated as income. And the law provides that renters who live in foreclosed properties can remain in their homes, under the terms of their leases.
 DEPOSIT INSURANCE The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will back bank deposits of as much as $250,000 per account holder, up from $100,000, through the end of 2009. That means accounts held by two people would be covered up to $500,000. Retirement account coverage was held steady at $250,000.
 ALTERNATIVE ENERGY There are several new or extended tax credits to promote reduced energy use or alternative energy.
 The law extends for eight years a 30 percent tax credit for homeowners who put solar panels on their roofs. Previously, the maximum credit was $2,000; that limit is removed, so that a homeowner installing a typical $20,000 system would be able to claim a credit of $6,000. There is also a new 30 percent tax credit for homeowners installing a small wind turbine on their property. Geothermal heat pumps also qualify for a credit.
 A tax credit encouraging energy efficiency in existing homes has also been extended for a year. Improvements like installing a biomass stove or an efficient water heater will be eligible. Contractors working on new homes will be eligible for a credit of up to $2,000 if they include highly efficient systems for things like heating and cooling. 
 The law gives manufacturers of energy-efficient dishwashers, clothes washers and refrigerators a tax credit.
 And owners of plug-in electric vehicles will be eligible for a tax credit of up to $7,500 that will start to phase out after 250,000 of the vehicles are sold in the United States. (There are now an estimated 250 plug-in hybrids in the country, most of them converted hybrids like the Prius.) 
 ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX The new law includes a provision to protect middle-class taxpayers from the alternative minimum tax by reducing the amount of income that is subject to the tax.
 For joint filers, the exemption would increase to $69,950 from $66,250 in 2007, and, for singles, to $46,200 from $44,350. As in prior years, the exemption amount begins to phase out once joint-return filers' taxable income exceeds $150,000, or $112,500 for singles, said Bob D. Scharin, a senior tax analyst for the tax and accounting business of ThomsonReuters.
 The alternative minimum tax is a parallel tax system created in 1969 to ensure that wealthy individuals did not take too many tax deductions and paid their fair share of taxes. Since the tax was never indexed for inflation, it has risked ensnaring more middle-class taxpayers each year. 
 MENTAL HEALTH PARITY Another part of the law could affect how health insurance works. If an employer has 51 or more workers and offers mental health or substance abuse coverage, it must now have the same rules and limits on what it will pay for as it would for, say, a visit to a cardiologist. 
 Some companies that offer mental health coverage make people pay higher co-payments for office visits than they would for medical treatment of physical symptoms. Or perhaps the deductible is higher for mental health treatment than other types, or there are lower limits set for the number of days covered for in-patient substance abuse treatment than there are for other types of hospitalization. Now, all of these rules will have to be the same, including those for out-of-network coverage. 
 The new legislation could easily put hundreds of dollars a year back in consumers' pockets if they make regular visits to a mental health practitioner. There is always the possibility, however, that some employers could scale back their other coverage to make it equal to their mental health offerings. The bill does not require employers to cover mental health treatment or substance abuse in the first place. 
 SUNDRY TAX ITEMS There are a variety of items that extend current tax breaks. A deduction for higher education expenses was extended through 2009, and applies to all taxpayers, including those who do not itemize their taxes. Single filers with adjusted gross incomes up to $65,000 (or $130,000 for joint filers) can deduct up to $4,000 for education expenses. Taxpayers with income less than $80,000 (or $160,000 for joint filers) can claim a deduction of up to $2,000, said Laurie Asch, a senior tax analyst in the tax and accounting business of Thomson Reuters.
 Meanwhile, another provision extends taxpayers' option to deduct state and local sales taxes instead of income taxes, if they itemize. This is attractive to people who live in states with no income taxes, like Florida or Texas, and especially to buyers of big-ticket items.
 The law extends the additional standard deduction for property taxes. And it also extends a provision that allows people older than 70 1/2 to use distributions from individual retirement accounts to contribute up to $100,000 to charity, and exclude that amount from their income. 
 MIDWEST DISASTER RELIEF The law contains provisions to help victims of this summer's storms in the Midwest.
 It includes a waiver of a 10 percent penalty for disaster-related distributions from I.R.A.'s, increases the amount that people affected by the disaster can borrow from their 401(k)s and gives a tax exemption for anyone housing up to four people dislocated by the floods. The bill also includes tax relief and scholarship provisions for people affected by other disasters.

HEADLINE: Defying a Spate of Bombings, Baghdad Has a Party

BYLINE: By SAM DAGHER

DATELINE: BAGHDAD 

 BODY:
Residents of the Iraqi capital celebrated an important holiday in the Muslim calendar on Friday, shrugging off a spate of bombings and a debate among the country's political and religious elite about when the holiday is actually supposed to start.
 Id al-Fitr, which marks the end of a period of daytime fasting, prayers and abstention from vices during the holy month of Ramadan, is the much-anticipated reward for the pious. The holiday is usually a time for family gatherings and outings, with children receiving new clothes and gifts. But across the Arab world it is also an excuse for parties and fun, especially for young people. 
 This year Iraqis, especially those in Baghdad, seem to be determined not tobe left out of the festivities despite all the dangers and difficulties.
 Since Sunday, bombings in busy markets and mosques in Baghdad have killed more than 50 people and badly wounded scores more. On top of that the country's religious establishment could not even agree on a unified date for the start of Id, which hinges on the sighting of a new crescent but is subject to certain theological interpretations. Sunnis and some Shiite clergy declared Tuesday as the start of Id, other Shiite clerics said it was Wednesday, while the most revered Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, said it was Thursday. 
 The government, anticipating the problem, had decreed that the holiday would run from Tuesday to Sunday, and everyone was out in full force Thursday evening and Friday. 
 But theological debates were the last thing on the minds of holiday revelers as they streamed into the riverside park of Abu Nuwas and the adjacent main street in the central Karada district.
 The park, which has been renovated with United States military funds and remains protected by a private security firm, is one of the true safe havens in the capital. It was flooded for a second day in a row Friday with holiday celebrants coming from as far afield as Falluja, west of Baghdad, and the southern province of Nasiriya. 
 ''If you wallow in grief for too long you will be finished. Living is hoping,'' said Salah Mahdi who was out with his wife Zahra Rahim. They are newlyweds living in the New Baghdad district, not far from the Rasoul Shiite mosque, which was the target of a suicide bomber on Thursday.
 ''Life does not stop,'' chimed in Ms. Rahim, wearing a festive-looking headscarf. The couple sipped juice cocktails on the second floor of a busy and brightly decorated cafe overlooking the main street in Karada known as Karada Dakhel. 
 Below, members of the national police force, anxious to avoid a repeat of Sunday's bloodshed in Karada when more than a dozen people were killed in double bombings, beefed up a checkpoint at the beginning of the street searching every vehicle.
 There was a momentary reprieve from the humming of privately owned generators that line the street because electricity from the state grid was being provided more frequently for the occasion of Id. Aziz Rafik, a business owner, said he had five hours of state-provided electricity in the span of 12 hours on Friday, compared with the typical allotment of two hours a day. 
 Strollers walked past bright shop windows brimming with toys and fashionable clothes. Teenage boys with gel-slicked hair, dressed in jeans and tight-fitting shirts, gathered in front of an ice cream parlor. A group of women giggled and lowered their heads as they passed by five men on a side street in a state of near trance as they twirled and swayed to the frantic sounds of Iraqi pop blaring from the stereo of their parked vehicle.
 The air was filled with the smell of rotisserie chicken and traditional masgouf, fish that was split open and grilled flat in a flaming pit.
 Inside Ammar Salem's clothing boutique several young men were shopping for clothes to wear at a live music party that is expected to take place on Saturday at one of Baghdad's hotels.
 Mr. Salem said business was brisk and that he was trying to remain upbeat despite the fact that one of his best friends, Wiaam Abbas, was badly wounded in Sunday's bombings, which took place half a mile from his shop.
 ''We will remain open and Karada will keep on going,'' he said.
 A customer, Hassan Hussein, came to shop with his friend Salah Hussein from Baghdad's Sadr City, the teeming predominantly Shiite district that until recently was in the tight grip of the Mahdi Army militia of the anti-American cleric, Moktada al-Sadr.
 ''The Mahdi Army destroyed the lives of the youth,'' Mr. Hussein said. ''You cannot listen to songs or dress and cut your hair the way you want.'' 
 He says he remains apprehensive and continues to feel threatened by the Shiite militia in Sadr City, despite the heavy presence of American and Iraqi troops and the numerous checkpoints and protective walls. A ceasefire agreement between the militia and the government ended the fighting in May but left much of the already impoverished area reeling from the battle scars.
 Underscoring the fragility of the security arrangements, the United States military completely closed off on Friday the main entry point in the concrete barrier that they have erected along Al Quds Street intended to seal off the southern quarter of the district and turn it into a haven.
 ''This checkpoint is closed because of the recent attacks. It will remain closed until the attacks against the security forces cease,'' was sprayed in black in Arabic on freshly installed concrete slabs.
 An American soldier was killed with sniper fire on Tuesday not far from the same spot. This was confirmed by a US military spokesman, who nonetheless insisted the blocking of the entry point was more for the protection of the Jamila market within the walled area.
 The United States military announced on Friday the death of an American soldier in another part of Iraq that has seen recent confrontation with the Mahdi Army. It said the soldier was killed Thursday when a roadside bomb hit his vehicle in the southern city of Amara.
 One of Mr. Sadr's top aides in Amara trekked to Sadr City on Friday to deliver a sermon during weekly prayers that continue to be held in the open air outside the cleric's headquarters near Al Quds Street.
 Speaking to hundreds of men, the cleric Sattar al-Battat castigated the young men in the crowd for being too preoccupied with fashion and life's pleasures. 
 ''Do not be effeminate,'' he said. ''Be tough men.''
 Mr. Battat went on to berate the government for not doing enough to provide adequate basic services to Iraqis despite the windfalls it was reaping from high oil prices.
 During his sermon, Mr. Battat read a new statement from Mr. Sadr, who is believed to be in Iran. It urged the Iraqi government to ''strive to drive out the occupier from our holy land and not sign an agreement with the infidels and occupiers.''
 A security agreement between Baghdad and Washington that would govern the presence of American forces in Iraq past the end of December remains stalled because of a number of demands by the Iraqi side, including restricted immunity for American soldiers.
 The United States Embassy announced that the deputy secretary of State, John D. Negroponte, arrived in Baghdad Friday for talks with Iraqi officials on ''political, security and economic progress in Iraq.''
 Meanwhile, Iraq's presidency council, made up of the president and his two deputies, issued a statement Friday saying the body had ratified a provincial election law that the Parliament passed 10 days ago. This paves the way for local elections before the end of January in all of Iraq except in the hotly contested northern oil rich area of Kirkuk.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Grants Rights to Build a Wind Farm About 20 Miles Offshore

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
Regulators in New Jersey awarded the rights on Friday for construction of a $1 billion offshore wind farm in the southern part of the state to Garden State Offshore Energy. The rights, which include access to as much as $19 million in state grants, is part of New Jersey's Energy Master Plan, which calls for 20 percent of the state's energy to come from renewable sources by 2020. The decision comes on the heels of decisions by Delaware and Rhode Island to allow the installation of offshore wind farms.
 Energy experts say that these approvals could prompt regulators in New York to support projects off the south shore of Long Island and New York City. 
 Garden State Offshore Energy is a joint venture that includes P.S.E.G. Renewable Generation, a subsidiary of P.S.E.G. Global, which is a sister company of the state's largest utility, Public Service Electric and Gas Company.
 The proposal by Garden State Offshore Energy includes the installation of 96 turbines to produce as much as 346 megawatts of electricity, enough to power tens of thousands of houses, starting in 2013. The turbines would be arranged in a rectangle about a half-mile long by one-third of a mile wide and would be placed 16 to 20 miles off the coast of New Jersey's Atlantic and Ocean Counties, much farther out and in much deeper water than other proposed wind farms. Deepwater Wind, which will work with P.S.E.G. to build the wind farm, said it could affordably build turbines in 100 feet of water with the same technology used to build oil and gas rigs in the Gulf of Mexico and other places.
 Because the wind blows more reliably during the day farther offshore, the company expects to be able to more readily tap into the higher prices available on the power market at peak times. And by putting the turbines so far out, the company hopes to blunt opposition from environmentalists and residents who say that turbines diminish ocean views and damage wildlife.
 ''People don't have to choose between clean energy and a clear view,'' said Nelson Garcez, a vice president of P.S.E.G. Global. Mr. Garcez said the deep-water turbines would produce enough power to help the company break even in about seven years.
 The next step is for Garden State Offshore Energy to seek permits from state and federal agencies to build offshore. The company will also have to get commitments from manufacturers to build the turbines, which would be assembled in New Jersey and could potentially create hundreds of new jobs.
 The decision by New Jersey's Board of Public Utilities comes a little more than a week after the Long Island Power Authority and Con Edison said they would study the economic feasibility of building a wind farm about 10 miles off the south shore of Queens. In August, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said that the city would solicit proposals from companies interested in building offshore wind farms and placing turbines atop buildings in the city.
 The projects being approved in neighboring states could increase the chances for approval of offshore wind farms in New York, where a vast majority of wind turbines are on land and upstate.
 ''It's like a rising tide lifting all boats,'' said Peter M. Iwanowicz, the director of the New York State Climate Change Office of the Department of Environmental Conservation in Albany. ''More projects in the Northeast helps with public acceptance that we need more clean electrons and helps us guard against rising fossil fuel prices and water levels on the coast.''

HEADLINE: Service Sector Showed Tepid Growth in September

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The sluggish service sector was barely growing in September as the country's worst financial crisis since the Great Depression reached new heights, according to a report released on Friday. 
 The Institute for Supply Management said its nonmanufacturing index came in at 50.2, marginally above the level of 50 that signals expansion, with the help of a slight rise in new orders.
 Financial markets, starved for any good news, took the report as a slight positive for the beleaguered economy, but few doubt it is in rough shape after being pounded this year by high energy costs and the worst housing slump in a generation.
 ''It is a pretty dark picture for the U.S. economy at year-end, and I do not get anything in this I.S.M. nonmanufacturing to suggest maybe it is not so bad,'' said Josh Stiles, bond strategist at IDEAglobal.com.
 The service sector represents about 80 percent of economic activity in the United States, including businesses like banks, airlines, hotels and restaurants.
 The result was slightly below August's reading of 50.6 and marginally above economists' median expectation of 50.0 forecast in a Reuters poll.
 The report's gauge of service sector employment fell in September and was in contractionary territory for a fifth consecutive month, the first slump of this magnitude since 2003.
 With good news hard to find, investors and Federal Reserve policy makers will probably be happy with a fall in the report's gauge of inflation to its lowest in a year, which will help the Fed keep benchmark interest rates low to ride out the financial crisis.

HEADLINE: A.I.G. Uses $61 Billion Of Fed Loan

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
The American International Group said on Friday that it had already drawn down $61 billion of the $85 billion emergency bridge loan it received from the Federal Reserve two weeks ago, an announcement that startled credit ratings agencies. 
 The emergency loan was supposed to buy the company time to sell its troubled assets in an orderly manner. But the sell-off has not yet begun, and now the insurer faces the additional pressure of trying to sell the businesses at a time when potential buyers are having trouble borrowing money.
 Moody's downgraded A.I.G.'s senior unsecured debt on Friday and said it might downgrade other types of the company's debt, which could make it more expensive for A.I.G. to borrow money and do business. 
 A.I.G.'s chief executive, Edward M. Liddy, told securities analysts on Friday that $53 billion to $54 billion of the Fed's loan had gone to shore up A.I.G.'s troubled structured-finance unit and its securities lending business. Another big block of the Fed's money has been used to support A.I.G.'s daily operations, Mr. Liddy said in a conference call, because demand for the company's commercial paper has dried up as a result of the worldwide credit crisis. 
 After the conference call, Standard & Poor's said it had changed A.I.G.'s credit watch status to negative, expressing concern about whether A.I.G. would be able to restructure with the help of the Fed, as planned. The change indicated that a downgrade could be coming. 
 It was a series of downgrades in A.I.G.'s credit ratings in mid-September that set off certain contractual provisions requiring the insurer to post billions of dollars of collateral with its trading partners, a catastrophic event that led to the huge federal bailout. 
 Since then, A.I.G. has not released any information about whether additional ratings downgrades would lead to any additional collateral calls. 
 Both ratings agencies cited concerns about A.I.G.'s rapid use of the Fed's loan. 
 ''The $61 billion draw to date on the facility is much larger than we had previously anticipated,'' said Rodney A. Clark, an analyst with Standard & Poor's, explaining the change in outlook. 
 A.I.G. is required to pay back its borrowings from the Fed within two years. Mr. Clark said that to raise the money, the rapid drawdown of the loan made it likely that A.I.G. would have to sell off more businesses than Standard & Poor's had expected. 
 This would leave ''a much smaller and less diversified A.I.G.'' to pay off a proportionally bigger debt to the Fed, Standard & Poor's said in a statement. 
 In the conference call, Mr. Liddy detailed which of A.I.G.'s subsidiaries he intended to keep and which he was putting up for sale. Over all, he said, the company would hold on to its property and casualty insurance business in the United States and its general insurance businesses outside the country. Together, they generated revenue of about $40 billion in 2007. 
 In addition, Mr. Liddy said A.I.G. would keep a continuing ownership in its foreign life insurance businesses, most of which operate in Asia. 
 Other than that, he said, virtually everything else under A.I.G.'s corporate umbrella was for sale. That would include its life insurance companies in the United States, its retirement operations on four continents, its aircraft leasing business, its consumer finance business and other lines of insurance and reinsurance. 
 Mr. Liddy said these were valuable businesses for which A.I.G. had already received many expressions of interest, although he acknowledged that there was a big difference between a nibble and an actual sale. He said that the Blackstone Group and JPMorgan Chase had been hired to put the businesses up for sale. 
 Earlier, Mr. Liddy had indicated that he hoped A.I.G. would be able to retain its life insurance business in the United States. But in the conference call on Friday, he said that solving the problems of the financial products unit, which dealt in complex debt securities and credit derivatives, ''has caused us a lot of pain.''
 ''We do intend to wind down that operation,'' he said. ''It is not something you can announce on Friday and expect to do by Monday.'' 
 Mr. Liddy said that all of the energy being expended on that troubled unit was aimed at winding down its affairs -- not getting them up and running again. ''We are not entering into any new activity'' there, he said.
 In response to questions, Mr. Liddy said it was impossible to say exactly how much money A.I.G. would have to raise to pay back the Fed and emerge from its crisis as a smaller company with adequate capital. 
 ''It's kind of a Rubik's Cube,'' he said. ''We need to be very flexible'' because of the fluid economic environment. 
 He said that in addition to using the $85 billion Fed loan, A.I.G. would be able to participate in the $700 billion bailout program signed into law by President Bush on Friday. The additional help from the Treasury might ease some of its financial burdens, Mr. Liddy said.

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
With the markets bobbing up and down daily, millions of Americans have been queasy about their personal finances and, to judge from readers' comments as well as opinion surveys, wondering whether the ship of state is still seaworthy. 
 No one can know when things will calm down, but history does offer markers for dealing with some of the issues.
 Q.Even if the government gets some of the money back in the course of a rescue plan, it sounds as if America can say farewell to the really good times, doesn't it? 
 A. Beware of predictions like that. Remember that a decade or so ago, with the country awash in prosperity and the Soviet Union and the cold war having passed into history, there was some serious debate about what the government should do with the enormous budget surpluses projected for the first decade of the new century. 
 A terrorist attack, a recession and a couple of wars later, that debate seems as ancient as arguments over whether Americans would ever buy Japanese cars. There is no perfect telescope to peer into the future.
 Q.If taxpayers finance this recovery plan, will Social Security and Medicare be affected? 
 A. There will be no effect on Social Security and Medicare, which are paid for through deductions from paychecks and contributions from employers. Yes, Social Security and Medicare face some problems that will have to be addressed sooner or later, but to avoid a headache, you should think of those issues apart from the current financial crisis. And tune out oversimplified, alarmist language.
 Q.But if the government spends hundreds of billions of dollars on a rescue plan, won't there be a mountain of debt that will take years to pay off? 
 A. There's already a mountain. As for the current crisis, optimists have suggested that after the Treasury buys up those troubled mortgage-backed securities and resells them, it could actually wind up ahead. 
 Previous ''financial interventions,'' as the Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress calls them, have turned a profit. When the government helped Chrysler with $1.5 billion in loan guarantees in 1980, it made a profit of $311 million from the sale of warrants, or options to buy stock. On the other hand, the 1989 bailout of the savings and loan industry cost the Treasury $150 billion, according to the research service. 
 The value of the mortgage-backed securities in the current crisis will not really be known until they are unraveled. As the research service says, surely without fear of contradiction, determining the cost of government intervention ''is not straightforward.'' 
 Q.Despite all the talk about Wall Street greed and regulators who don't regulate, aren't the American people partly to blame for the current mess, considering that a lot of them took on debt they couldn't pay back?
 A. Political oratory notwithstanding, there is no simple answer to this one. Most Americans still make their mortgage payments each month. And one person's greed is another person's aspiration. Yes, some people took on debt they ultimately could not handle, and there were some shady lenders and real estate speculators, but no two situations are alike. 
 Being a homeowner is a big part of the American dream, and has long been encouraged by the government. Consider the mortgage-interest deduction, for instance. Q.Suppose the Treasury can't sell all those mortgage-backed securities for anything close to what it paid for them. Couldn't that put the government deeper in the hole, and shouldn't that worry people? 
 A. We're back to that ''mountain of debt.'' 
 The rescue plan calls for raising the national debt ceiling by $700 billion, to $11.3 trillion. But, again, it has never been clear that the full $700 billion will be spent. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the final cost could be ''substantially less.''
 And all this talk about billions and trillions demands a little perspective. As of mid-August, the total outstanding debt of the United States government was just a bit more than $9.6 trillion, according to the budget office. But not quite $4.2 trillion of that is debt held by government trust fund accounts, the largest being those for Social Security and also including accounts for retirement benefits destined for military people and civil service employees. Economists, who supposedly understand this stuff, like to focus more on the publicly held debt that the United States owes to domestic and foreign lenders. That number, now just above $5.4 trillion, is about 38 percent of the country's gross domestic product for 2008. Compare that to the historical high of 1946, when World War II had pushed the overall debt to 109 percent. Moreover, a lot of the debt is owed to Americans whose portfolios include Treasury securities. 
 Q.But shouldn't the people be worried that a huge bill will come due one day?
 A. Again, some perspective is called for. Consider this passage from an article in The Times: ''When President Bush informed the nation last Sunday night that remaining in Iraq next year will cost another $87 billion, many of those who will actually pay that bill were unable to watch. They had already been put to bed by their parents.''
 That was written five years and several hundred billion dollars ago and is truer than ever. Also the United States still has a good credit history. Perfect, in fact. It has never defaulted.

 DICTATOR PROPOSED FOR AFGHANISTAN 
 In Leaked Diplomatic Cable
 A coded French diplomatic cable whose contents were leaked to a French newspaper quotes the British ambassador in Afghanistan as predicting that the NATO-led military campaign against the Taliban will fail. And according to the newspaper, the ambassador said that the best solution for the country would be the installation of an ''acceptable dictator.'' PAGE A9
 BITTERSWEET FESTIVITIES IN IRAQ
 Residents of Baghdad celebrated an important holiday in the Muslim calendar, Id al-Fitr, shrugging off a spate of bombings and a debate among the country's political and religious elite about when the holiday was supposed to start. The holiday is usually a time for family gatherings and outings, with children receiving new clothes and gifts. This year, Iraqis seem to be determined not to be left out of the festivities, despite all the dangers and difficulties. PAGE A8 
 ISSUES UNRESOLVED IN NORTH KOREA
 An American envoy returned to the South Korean capital, Seoul, after three days of inconclusive talks with North Korea, while Bush administration officials said the North's government was continuing to take steps toward restarting its nuclear weapons program. PAGE A6
 RETURN HOME TO SAME CHALLENGES
 Heba Said Ahmed, above, who had polio as a child, won a gold medal in power lifting during the Paralympic Games in Beijing. She broke a world record in her 181-pound weight class, too, lifting 341 pounds. ''In Egypt, they think a handicapped person should just stay in bed,'' she said. Egypt is filled with people who face adversity, most often a function of poverty and systemic indifference. But Ms. Ahmed never refers to fate; she talks about choices. She does not talk about obstacles; she talks about challenges. PAGE A6
 TAKING HOLD OF POPPY PRODUCTION
 As the new planting season for opium poppy draws near, the governor of Helmand, Afghanistan's largest poppy-producing province, says that this year he is determined to confront the illicit crop that is a major source of money for drug lords and insurgents. PAGE A9
 WHO WILL PAY THE PIRATE'S RANSOM?
 It is one thing to haggle for a pirate's ransom. But it is apparently a whole other matter to figure out who, exactly, should pay it. It seemed that discord among all the players -- the shipping company, the ship owner, the insurance companies, government officials and relatives of the captured crew, not to mention the pirates -- was slowing negotiations over how to free the arms-laden Ukrainian freighter that Somali pirates seized last week.

 AN AGONIZING WEEK FOR SOME
 Who Voted Against the Bailout
 It was a rough week for many of the House members who voted against the initial bailout legislation on Monday. They returned to their districts and to angry responses from their constituents. They kept low profiles, as leaders in their party -- and even the president -- asked them to reconsider. And though many of them changed their no votes to yes, it was often an agonizing decision. PAGE A10 
 GOVERNORS' RACE SHARES SPOTLIGHT
 There are 11 races for governor across the country, although they have taken a back seat to the presidential race and the economic crisis. Democrats control 28 of the 50 governors' chairs and are expected to retain a majority. But dig past the surface, and you would find a cauldron of ambition and practicality, full of rising and falling stars eyeing the national stage, and issues that touch how Americans live their daily lives. PAGE A9
 ADJUSTING THE F.B.I.'S FOOTING
 As part of its effort to affirm the F.B.I. as ''an intelligence agency as well as a law enforcement agency,'' the Justice Department completed an overhaul of many of the bureau's investigative guidelines that will give it freer reign to begin investigations into the possibility of terrorist activity, even in the absence of evidence of wrongdoing. The new guidelines came after a review that was introduced to consolidate different and sometimes conflicting standards in the F.B.I. about surveillance, informants and interview techniques. PAGE A9 
 MINISTRY FOR AN ECONOMIC CRISIS
 The nation's recent economic woes have overlapped with two religious periods devoted to soul-searching -- the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the Jewish ''days of awe'' culminating in Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur. That has not been lost among members of the clergy, whose congregations include investors, executives and employees of the shaken financial industry, and who may find it useful that both observances require abstinence and scaling back, as the nation embarks on a season of belt-tightening.

 IN A HEATED MEETING, PATERSON ASKS
 For Further Budget Cuts
 In a sometimes testy meeting with state lawmakers, Gov. David A. Paterson said he would call the Legislature back to Albany after the election to reopen the state budget. The governor is seeking $2 billion in new cuts to the state's current budget, after recent turmoil on Wall Street has opened an additional $1.2 billion hole -- and the numbers are expected to worsen.

 FALLOUT FROM A DECISION TO CREMATE
 After Shafayet Reja died in a car accident on Sept. 10, his Hindu mother and Muslim father agreed to have him cremated in the Hindu tradition.

 AFTER SOLID SECOND HALF,
 Mets Give the Keys to Manuel
 Jerry Manuel took over the helm of the lackluster Mets from Willie Randolph less than four months ago, and injected into the team some much-needed life. And though they stumbled down the stretch -- as they had under Randolph -- many felt that had done a solid job as the team's interim manager. Now Manuel is on the verge of signing a two-year contract to manage the team through the 2010 season, according to two people familiar with the negotiations. PAGE D4 
 FIGHTING N.C.A.A.'S AMATEUR RULES
 Just before a crucial game at the N.C.A.A. regionals in May, officials at Oklahoma State suddenly declared their star pitcher, Andrew Oliver, ineligible to compete for allowing his adviser to contact a professional team while he was a high school senior -- a violation of N.C.A.A. rules meant to preserve amateurism. Now, Oliver is suing the N.C.A.A. in an Ohio court, arguing that the restriction on agents is illegal. PAGE D1
 NEBRASKA'S THRIVING WALK-ONS
 Four years ago, Matt O'Hanlon turned down a football scholarship at the University of South Dakota for a chance to walk on at the University of Nebraska, where he had dreamed of playing since he was a child. And in a yearly ritual that resonates across Nebraska, where football is considered a public trust, Coach Bo Pelini gathered the team after practice for an announcement: O'Hanlon and another walk-on were receiving scholarships. That makes him one of four starters who began their careers for the Cornhuskers as walk-ons. PAGE D1

 AS WALL STREET GIANTS STUMBLE,
 European Banks See an Opening
 The economic crisis toppled some of the biggest institutions on Wall Street and forced others to dramatically change the way they do business. That has left a gaping hole in the financial world, which some major European players -- which were more diversified than their more nimble American counterparts -- are looking to fill. PAGE C5
 IN BAILOUT, STRANGE BEDFELLOWS
 The House did not vote on the government's bailout plan until the early afternoon, although it was clear it would pass in the morning. In the interim, there was the curious sight of ideological allies in fierce opposition and natural foes in agreement. ''In the end, the very real possibility that we are on the brink of economic disaster carried the day--overcoming even election jitters,'' writes Joe Nocera. ''In Congress, it doesn't get any more serious than that.'' PAGE C1
 HOW WILL TAXPAYERS BENEFIT?
 The revised bailout package doubles the amount of insurance backing bank deposits, and extends a credit that will protect millions of taxpayers from paying the much-maligned alternative minimum tax. It does not include, however, giving bankruptcy judges the power to modify troubled borrowers' mortgages, which many had been pushing for. If the plan succeeds in stabilizing the nation's financial institutions, it will benefit consumers by reopening the credit spigot and preventing a deeper economic slowdown. PAGE C6
 MARKETS SLIDE ON RECESSION FEARS
 Wall Street investors have shifted their focus to growing evidence that the nation is embroiled in a recession. Those concerns were part of what prompted the loss in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which finished under 1,100 for the first time in four years. The Dow and Nasdaq also slid on Friday. ''Investors still have to face some significant challenges in the broad economy that can't be magically removed by a group of our Congressional leaders,'' an executive at Bessemer Trust said. PAGE C7
 A.I.G. DRAWS HEAVILY ON LOAN
 Credit ratings agencies were startled by news that American International Group said that it had already drawn down $61 billion of the $85 billion emergency bridge loan that it received from the government two weeks ago. The loan was supposed to buy the company time to sell its troubled assets in an orderly manner, but the sell-off has not started yet, and A.I.G. is feeling the pressure to sell businesses at a time when prospective buyers are having trouble borrowing money.

HEADLINE: 159,000 Jobs Lost in September, The Worst Month in Five Years

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN

 BODY:
The American economy lost 159,000 jobs in September, the worst month of retrenchment in five years, the government reported on Friday, amplifying fears that an already painful downturn had entered a more severe stage that could persist well into next year.
 Employment has diminished for nine consecutive months, eliminating 760,000 jobs, according to the Labor Department's report. And that does not count the traumatic events of recent weeks, as a string of Wall Street institutions collapsed, prompting the $700 billion emergency rescue package approved by Congress on Friday.
 ''It's a dismal report, and the worst thing about it is that it does not reflect the recent seizure that we've seen in the credit markets,'' said Michael T. Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners, a research and trading firm in Greenwich, Conn. ''There's really nothing good about this report at all. We've lost jobs in nearly every area of the economy, and this is going to get worse before it gets better because the credit markets have deteriorated basically on a daily basis for the last few weeks.'' 
 Though the bailout may restore order to the financial system and eventually filter through the economy by making it easier for businesses to secure capital, few analysts expect it to swiftly reverse the nation's fortunes. Housing prices continue to fall, eroding household wealth just as millions suffer the weight of unmanageable debt. The deteriorating job market has taken paychecks out of the economy, reinforcing a predilection for thrift that has cut sales from car showrooms to hair salons. 
 Banks should see their balance sheets improve as the government relieves them of disastrous investments, yet they may remain skittish and reluctant to lend. 
 ''At best, the bailout stops a much deeper decline in activity,'' Mr. Darda said, ''but it's not like they're going to do this and all of the sudden the clouds part and the skies are clear.''
 Only a few weeks ago, many economists still held hopes that the economy might recover late this year or early next. But with the job market now contracting faster, and fear dogging the financial system, the broad assumption has taken hold that 2008 is a lost cause.
 Most economists have concluded that the economy will struggle well into next year. More pessimistic forecasts envision the economy remaining weak through most or all of next year.
 ''This is an economy in recession, and every dimension of the report confirms that,'' said Ethan S. Harris, an economist at Barclays Capital. ''This has been preceded by a slow-motion recession. Now we're going into the full-speed recession that will last somewhere between three and five quarters.''
 For the first eight months of the year, the economy lost an average of 75,000 jobs each month. September's report more than doubled the pace.
 ''A lot of companies came to the realization that there was no momentum in the economy to pick them up in the second half of 2008,'' said Steve Drexel, chief executive of Corestaff Services, a staffing company in Houston. ''They had been hanging on to people and hoping things would improve, but now a lot companies are just sort of retrenching.''
 The unemployment rate remained steady at 6.1 percent in September, but economists said that reflected how people who had given up looking for work were not counted. Over the last year, the unemployment rolls have swelled by 2.2 million, to 9.5 million. On Friday, Goldman Sachs forecast that the jobless rate would reach 8 percent by the end of next year, which would be the highest in 25 years.
 In Charlotte, Mich., Sean Schwartz, 26, has been out of a job for nearly two months since his last stint as a construction worker. His $750-a-week paycheck has been replaced by a $620.10 unemployment check every other week. 
 Mr. Schwartz and his wife -- who works at Wal-Mart -- have a 2-year-old daughter and are expecting a baby in December. His job search has turned up little beyond fast-food jobs at a fraction of his previous earnings. Mr. Schwartz is becoming anxious.
 ''We're not getting the bills paid,'' he said, estimating that his family is behind $5,000 on medical bills for his daughter and his wife's prenatal care. ''It's rough. There's nothing really out there.''
 As the impact of Wall Street's distress ripples out, economists expect opportunities to grow leaner still. On Friday morning, banks needing to borrow from other banks were paying nearly 4 percent more in interest than the Treasury offers on savings bonds -- a spread reflecting a general unwillingness to part with cash. That spread was wider than after the 1987 stock market crash.
 ''It sets us up for some really grim news in the immediate future,'' said Robert Barbera, chief economist at the research and trading firm ITG. ''Credit was already hard to get in early September. But it's really impossible to get now.''
 The report amounted to a catalog of woes afflicting Americans who depend on paychecks. 
 Manufacturing lost 51,000 jobs in September, bringing the decline so far this year to 442,000. Retailers lost 35,000 jobs, and construction shed 35,000. Employment in transportation and warehousing slid by 16,000.
 Jobs in financial services dropped by 17,000, and have slipped by 172,000 since employment peaked in that part of the economy in December 2006. Health care remained a bright spot, adding 17,000 jobs in September. Mining added 8,000 jobs.
 Government payrolls grew by 9,000 jobs -- a trend with a limited shelf life as the economic slowdown shrinks tax revenue.
 Doug Fleming has been out of work since last fall, when he lost his job as a quality inspector for a home builder in Anderson, Ind. Nearly 800 resumes later, he has received no offers. ''Maybe it's my age,'' said Mr. Fleming, 41.
 His wife has emphysema but has visited the doctor only once in the last year because his family lacks health insurance, he said. His daughter, 15, was hoping to talk her way into her high school's homecoming football game on Friday evening, unable to afford a ticket. 
 Unemployment rose to 11.4 percent among African-Americans in September, and to 19.1 percent among teenagers.
 More than 21 percent of those receiving unemployment checks have been without work for more than six months, up from 17.6 percent a year ago, the report said.
 In the suburbs of Richmond, Va., Ginny Hoover, a single mother, has been out of a job since November, when she lost her clerical position at a pharmaceutical company. Her $500-a-week take-home pay became a $285-a-week unemployment check. Barring an extension of those benefits by Congress -- something blessed by the House of Representatives on Friday -- Ms. Hoover, 48, received her last check this week.
 ''I've completely exhausted my savings, which was supposed to be a down payment for a house,'' she said.
 Initially, Ms. Hoover sought another office position. ''Now, I'll apply for anything that has a paycheck attached to it,'' she said. Her current focus: a job selling cellphone service at a kiosk at a Costco store for $7 an hour -- less than half of what she earned in her last position. ''It won't even cover my rent,'' she said.
 The number of Americans working part time because their hours were cut or they could not find a full-time job increased by 337,000 in September, to 6.1 million -- a jump of 1.6 million over the last year, and the highest number since 1993.
 Average weekly wages for some 80 percent of the American work force have risen by a meager 2.8 percent over the last year, with the gains more than reversed by increases in the prices of food and fuel.
 ''This economy is just not creating near enough economic activity to generate wage or income growth,'' said Jared Bernstein, senior economist at the labor-oriented Economic Policy Institute in Washington. ''That has serious living standards implications.''

HEADLINE: Among All Faiths, Ministries for a Crisis

BYLINE: By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN. 
E-mail: sgfreedman @nytimes.com

 BODY:
Several weeks ago, before the earth cracked open on Wall Street, Imam Khalid Latif had a chat with one of his regular worshipers at the Muslim center at New York University. This young man, a business student, had a theological complaint to register. Why did Islam make such a big deal about the principle of mutual benefit? What was the matter with just taking care of yourself?
 About 10 days later, with the landscape marked by the bankruptcy, emergency sale and federal bailout of some of the nation's most venerable financial companies, a more abashed version of that same student returned. ''Now I know why I can't define security by the number of zeroes on my paycheck,'' Imam Latif, N.Y.U.'s Muslim chaplain, recalled the man saying. 
 Presented with the spiritual equivalent of what educators call a ''teachable moment,'' Imam Latif spoke to the student about the humility, perseverance and especially the Islamic concept of sabr, meaning ''patience.'' He offered a hadith from the Muslim tradition: ''Patience comes at the first sign of calamity.''
 Variations of the imam's conversation have been proceeding in virtually every faith these last few weeks, especially for clergy members who have a following among the investors, executives and employees of the shaken financial industry. They are practicing ministry for a meltdown.
 ''There is no such thing as an atheist in a foxhole,'' goes the wartime cliche. As if to make the truism even truer, the recent financial troubles have coincided with two religious periods devoted to soul-searching -- the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the Jewish ''days of awe'' culminating in Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur.
 ''The High Holy Days are a time people take stock of their life,'' said Rabbi Joshua Metzger of the Chabad Lubavitch center in Midtown Manhattan. ''And the confluence of the financial crisis and this period of penitence is surely in sync with the message of self-appraisal, repentance, re-examination and the need to make good decisions.''
 As the United States staggers from its credit binge to a straitened future, the religious holidays demand their own form of self-denial. Jews fast on Yom Kippur and, for the most observant, the Fast of Gedalia, which comes the day after Rosh Hashana. Devout Muslims did not take food or drink during daylight hours for the entire month of Ramadan, which ended this week.
 ''The purpose of the fast goes beyond a physical one,'' Imam Latif said. ''It puts into perspective a lot. When you have that drink of water at sundown, when you eat that date to break the fast, you have a deeper appreciation of what you have.''
 The Rev. George W. Rutler, pastor of the Roman Catholic Church of Our Saviour in Midtown Manhattan, has been giving a similar message to the younger of his parishioners. Unlike the older generation, which lived through the Great Depression, these men and women had known nothing except exuberant days for investment banks, hedge funds and the stock market.
 ''They're just astonished; they have no historical reference,'' said Father Rutler, the former national chaplain of Legatus, a group of prominent Catholic executives. ''I've said to them: 'You're part of history now. And in the future, you will learn to be more practical about value.' This was a necessary purge, painful in many ways.''
 The weekday Mass on Sept. 24 supplied Father Rutler with texts to underscore his lessons in prudence and frugality. One of the readings, Proverbs 30, included the admonition to ''give me neither poverty nor riches; provide me only with the food I need.'' The Gospel reading, from Luke 9, had Jesus dispatching his disciples to travel among the people to heal the sick and tame demons. ''Take nothing for the journey,'' he instructs them, ''neither walking stick, nor sack, nor food, nor money.''
 The Rev. Suzan Johnson Cook has turned more often to biblical passages of solace. She has made a clerical specialty of ministering to the black and Latino middle- and upper-middle classes, both as pastor of the Bronx Christian Fellowship and as leader for a worship service every Wednesday at noon at the John Street United Methodist Church amid the canyons of Lower Manhattan. For her flock, relatively new arrivals to lucrative jobs in finance, the economic tremors have threatened to undo generations of struggling progress.
 ''The stress level is just high,'' Ms. Cook said. ''It's a feeling of not knowing what your last day will be. These are people with a family to support, with kids in college. They feel like: 'It took so long to make it. We played by the rules. And now look what happened. How am I going to make it?' ''
 At a pragmatic level, Ms. Cook has referred congregants to career counselors, particularly those who charge on a sliding scale. In both sermons and pastoral sessions, she has turned to Psalms 26 and 61, verses that ask for mercy and compassion from a God who ''hast been a shelter for me and a strong tower from the enemy.''
 At Chabad in Midtown, Rabbi Metzger has also emphasized the need for trust in the Almighty. 
 He has frequently quoted from a talk that the late Lubavitcher rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneerson, gave shortly after the stock market crash in October 1987. The rebbe gave a blessing that ''it should be revealed that there is only descent for the purpose of ascent.''
 And just in case any listener might misconstrue, Rabbi Metzger adds: ''This is not a matter of financial advice. This isn't Jim Cramer.''

HEADLINE: Reconsidering a Critical Vote, Under Intense Pressure

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, RAYMOND HERNANDEZ and CHARLIE SAVAGE

 BODY:
To turn the tide on the $700 billion bailout bill, House leaders needed to change at least a dozen votes. Republicans and Democrats who voted no on Monday heard from constituents, business lobbyists, the White House and even the presidential candidates. Some who had voted yes were consumed by second thoughts. 
 Four lawmakers allowed reporters to look in on the wrangling. As seen up close, it made for an excruciating week.
 A CHANGE OF MIND 
 Representative Howard Coble, a crusty Republican from the Piedmont area of North Carolina, is a fiscal conservative. During 24 years in the House, he has often voted against Congressional pay increases. He refuses to participate in the Congressional pension program, which he calls ''a taxpayer rip-off.''
 So Mr. Coble initially balked at legislation providing up to $700 billion to shore up faltering financial institutions. On Monday, he was among 133 Republicans who voted against the bill. Then the telephone began to ring.
 Leo M. Lambert, the president of Elon University in Elon, N.C., told Mr. Coble on Monday that the school had been squeezed by the recent credit crisis. ''I said, 'Howard, my friend, this credit crisis, this liquidity crisis, is on our doorstep,' '' Mr. Lambert said, recalling the conversation. '' 'This is not just about Wall Street tycoons.' ''
 The White House called on Thursday, asking if Mr. Coble would like to speak to President Bush about the bailout bill. He turned down the offer. (''I don't want to be brushing aside the president,'' the congressman said. ''But I did not want anybody leaning on me or twisting my arm.'')
 Other calls came from the House Republican leader, John A. Boehner of Ohio, and the Republican House whip, Roy Blunt of Missouri.
 By that point, Mr. Coble was ready to say that he was ''leaning yes,'' but ''not warmly embracing the bill.''
 He said he did not believe ''the sky is falling,'' as some officials had asserted. And he said he knew his vote for the bill ''may be politically damaging.''
 ''The sky may fall tomorrow,'' Mr. Coble said. ''But it will fall upon my head. It won't fall on anyone else, and no one else will be adversely affected.''
 The bill was improved, Mr. Coble believed, by amendments that were adopted by the Senate on Wednesday. He welcomed an increase in the protection of bank deposits, raising the amount that can be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to $250,000 per depositor per bank from $100,000. He was also swayed by the Senate's addition of a tax provision, which will shield more than 20 million middle-income households from the alternative minimum tax, originally aimed at high-income people.
 Among other provisions added in the Senate was a tax break for movie and television production companies that shoot films in the United States. While some lawmakers denounced this as a pet project, Mr. Coble said it was important to his state. The Civil War epic film ''Cold Mountain,'' he recalled, may have been set in North Carolina but it was filmed in Romania.
 ''I don't like to hurriedly vote on significant legislation; I want to do it thoroughly and significantly,'' Mr. Coble said, explaining why he had voted no on Monday. 
 By Friday, when it came time to choose again, Mr. Coble switched his vote to yes. The reason, he said, was in no small measure the torrent of telephone and e-mail that had swung in favor of the bill.
 He called the vote one of the most difficult he has ever cast. ''Half of my constituents will be annoyed with me, and half will be pleased,'' he said.
 ROBERT PEAR
 ANOTHER UNEASY VOTE
 ''Let's hope they don't break my arm,'' Representative Jose E. Serrano of New York City said on Thursday night. He was heading to a meeting of fellow Democrats, where the party's leaders were seeking to scrounge up as many new votes as they could for the bailout plan.
 Mr. Serrano had broken ranks with the Democratic leadership on Monday, joining 94 other Democrats who cast the no votes that helped to defeat the first version of the package. Now President Bush and legislative leaders in both parties were warning of an economic meltdown if Congress failed to pass a bill. 
 It was an issue that hit home for Mr. Serrano, given that Wall Street is to New York City what the auto industry is to Detroit. His office had already heard from aides to Gov. David A. Paterson of New York urging him to reconsider his position. ''It wasn't easy,'' said Mr. Serrano, who kept such a low profile all week that his own staff on occasion had a hard time tracking him down. ''I'm the only New York City guy who voted against it.''
 But Mr. Serrano was also mindful that he represented one of the poorest districts in the nation, a long stretch of the Bronx where nearly a third of the residents live below the poverty line.
 Many residents there appear outraged at the prospect of spending billions of dollars to bail out the very Wall Street tycoons who contributed to the crisis -- at least if the reaction Mr. Serrano received was any measure.
 Nearly all of the 100 or so e-mail messages and phone calls that Mr. Serrano and his staff got each day from constituents in the Bronx urged him to reject any bailout plan brought to the House floor, his aides said.
 Mr. Serrano shared many of the concerns that his constituents voiced.
 He said the $700 billion bailout package would add to the federal government's already ballooning budget deficit. And that, in turn, would make it almost impossible for the government to spend in critical areas like health care and education.
 ''You know what is ironic about this? I sound like a Republican,'' he said, referring to his complaint that the bailout package was fiscally irresponsible.
 All week long, Mr. Serrano would not rule out the possibility that he might change his vote. He seemed aware of the stakes involved. He recalled a similarly tough vote in 2002, in the wake of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, when he opposed the resolution authorizing military action in Iraq. ''It was not an easy vote for me,'' he said.
 As it turns out, Mr. Serrano said, he now feels vindicated about that vote, given that the Bush administration's warnings about Iraq's unconventional weapons turned out to have been based on bad intelligence. 
 He said the White House predictions that an economic calamity would occur without the bailout had aroused his skepticism. ''I know a hustle,'' he said. ''And I know a hustler.''
 On Friday, for the second time, Mr. Serrano voted no.
 RAYMOND HERNANDEZ
 FROM TEXAS, AND TORN
 Like two-thirds of the other House Republicans, Representative Michael C. Burgess of Texas voted against the economic rescue bill on Monday. What followed, from constituents and lobbyists, was an immense amount of conflicting advice. 
 Mr. Burgess said, ''The telephone, fax, and e-mail systems in my office have been deluged.'' He had a typical one at his fingertips, one that derided the $700 billion package this way: ''This is madness, to ask us taxpayers to cover the liabilities of Wall Street. We are tired of being fleeced.''
 As the Senate resurrected the legislation, Mr. Burgess agonized. He was seen by some Republicans as a potential switcher. He recognized that some provisions in the bill, including one that would extend a tax credit for production of wind energy, could help constituents. ''We are the No. 1 wind-producing state,'' Mr. Burgess said.
 But he also complained that the bill included some pork-barrel items, like a tax exemption for wooden practice arrows used by children. 
 Mark J. Davis, the host of a Texas radio show on which Mr. Burgess appeared on Thursday, said the negative reaction to the bailout was ''profound and visceral.''
 Many callers, the talk-radio host said, insisted that ''there has to be a way, through the free market and the private sector, to dig ourselves out of the hole created by the unwise distribution of credit.''
 ''It's been a roller coaster,'' Mr. Burgess said after the appearance. ''There is no soft landing for anyone in the political process on this issue.''
 Mr. Burgess is an obstetrician-gynecologist whose seat was once held by Dick Armey, the onetime House Republican leader. ''One of the biggest questions for me is whether the dire predictions of a financial Armageddon are accurate,'' Mr. Burgess said. ''Are we on the edge of a complete financial meltdown? Or is there inherently more strength and stability in the economy? I hear different opinions.''
 He also said he was concerned about ''the massive amount of federal power'' that he said would be vested in a new oversight board, including the secretary of the Treasury. ''I have no way to predict who that will be in the next administration,'' Mr. Burgess said. 
 Among the provisions that would help constituents, he mentioned a measure that would protect millions of middle-income taxpayers from the alternative minimum tax. He also cited a measure that would extend a deduction for state sales taxes in states like Texas that do not have an income tax.
 ''All that is important to me,'' he said. ''But at what price? Does it mean I have to vote for this $700 billion bailout, I mean, 'rescue' bill? Seven hundred billion dollars is still a problem for me. I'd like to see us do something more judicious.''
 In the final roll call on Friday, Mr. Burgess voted no again.
 ''This bailout bill's second verse is essentially same as the first, so I cannot support it,'' Mr. Burgess said. ''A bailout by any other name is still a bailout.'' 
 ROBERT PEAR
 A SAFE SEAT, BUT STILL...
 On Monday, Representative Jim Cooper, Democrat of Tennessee, voted yes.
 On Thursday morning, Mr. Cooper got a message from an aide. An old friend of the congressman's had called for a second day in a row, as the House was moving toward a second vote on the bailout measure.
 The message was blunt. If Mr. Cooper voted again for the $700 billion bailout package, the friend wanted the congressman to know, he intended ''to raise all the money he could to see that you are defeated in November.''
 Mr. Cooper is a member of the Blue Dog Democrats, a group that favors tight controls on spending; his book-strewn office has stacks of posters railing about the budget deficit and national debt. Over the last week, his office received thousands of calls and e-mail messages, a volume rivaled only by the 1993 debate over gays in the military, his aides said. 
 The messages ran about 15 to 1 against the bailout, and anger rose after the Senate on Wednesday added more than $100 billion of tax credit extensions and other special-interest items to the bill. Mr. Cooper said he agreed that the Senate's additions to the bailout were ''a true outrage.'' But, he said, his mind was made up. In conference calls and meetings with fellow Democratic moderates, Mr. Cooper told his colleagues that they had no choice but to vote for the package. ''I said we've got to take a deep breath and put this into perspective,'' he said. ''What is the most important thing here? It's saving the economy.''
 He pointed to the business section of Thursday's Nashville Tennessean. A banner headline screamed ''September Car Sales Plunge,'' focusing on a 36.8 percent decline in September sales by Nissan, which has a factory in Tennessee. 
 Mr. Cooper said the plunge was largely because of increased difficulty in getting car loans. Fears in the credit market, he said, threaten to devastate businesses and local banks.
 The man who would benefit most from anger at Mr. Cooper's vote -- his Republican challenger in the November election, Gerard Donovan -- was not buying it. 
 In a phone interview, Mr. Donovan dismissed talk of credit markets, saying gas prices and outsourcing were the real problems for the economy. He said he was telling voters that Mr. Cooper was just ''pandering to the special interests'' and had lost touch with the people he represents.
 But Mr. Cooper's district is heavily Democratic; in 2006, he beat a token Republican challenger by 41 points. This year, Mr. Donovan has raised only a few thousand dollars.
 When constituents and colleagues demanded that he vote against the bailout, Mr. Cooper -- a former Rhodes Scholar who keeps a mug proclaiming ''NERD PRIDE'' in his office -- handed out graphs meant to show how quickly the credit crisis is spreading. But that did not mean he was shrugging off his constituents' complaints.
 ''This is not a great time to be in Congress,'' he said on Thursday night. 
 On Friday, once again, Mr. Cooper voted yes. CHARLIE SAVAGE

HEADLINE: BAILOUT PLAN WINS APPROVAL; DEMOCRATS VOW TIGHTER RULES

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
It will be one of the world's largest asset management firms with an impressive $700 billion war chest. Nothing short of the global economy depends on its success. And the Treasury Department has barely a month to get it up and running.
 The bailout bill that President Bush quickly signed into law on Friday must do what financial experts have been unable to do for the last year -- put a dollar value on mortgage-related assets that no one wants, move them off the books of ailing banks and unlock the frozen credit markets. 
 In signing the measure, Mr. Bush warned Americans not to expect instant results. ''This will be done as expeditiously as possible, but it cannot be accomplished overnight. We'll take the time necessary to design an effective program that achieves its objectives -- and does not waste taxpayer dollars.''
 Even after working feverishly over the last two weeks, the Treasury will not buy its first distressed asset from a bank for roughly six weeks, and almost certainly not until after the Nov. 4 elections. 
 Treasury officials do not plan to manage the mortgage assets on their own. Instead, they will outsource nearly all of the work to professionals, who will oversee huge portfolios of bonds and other securities for a management fee. 
 The Treasury is expected to name a senior official to supervise the program. For now, various working groups creating the program are reporting directly to Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary.
 Mr. Paulson has recruited several former colleagues from Goldman Sachs to advise him, though administration officials took pains to say that they were not dominating the process, pointing to other Treasury employees who were playing major roles.
 ''We will move rapidly to implement the new authorities, but we will also move methodically,'' Mr. Paulson said in a statement after the House passed the bill on Friday.
 The government will hire only a bare-bones internal staff of about two dozen people with expertise in asset management, accounting and legal issues, according to administration officials, and will outsource the bulk of the program to 5 to 10 asset management firms.
 Administration officials said they had not yet selected the list of firms to run auctions or manage the assets. During the last few weeks, the Treasury has informally consulted major firms -- including BlackRock, the Pacific Investment Management Company and Legg Mason -- but none have been given a mandate, they said.
 The selected asset management firms will receive a chunk of the $250 billion that Congress is allowing the Treasury to spend in the first phase of the bailout. Those firms will receive fees that are likely to be lower than the industry standard of 1 percent of assets, or $1 for every $100 under management. 
 Administration officials said they would try to drive down fees with a competitive bidding process. But with $700 billion to disburse, the plan could still generate tens of billions of dollars in fees if the firms negotiate anywhere close to their standard fees.
 The main mechanism for buying these assets will be reverse auctions, using the same principles that govern auctions of electricity or the wireless spectrum. In this case, the government will issue an offer to buy a class of assets -- for example, subprime mortgage-backed securities -- with the final price being determined by how many banks are willing to sell.
 Using outside contractors on such an extensive scale raises a host of thorny questions, outside experts said. Among the most pressing is: How will the Treasury avoid conflicts of interest that fund managers will encounter as they work both for their own clients' interests -- which could pay higher fees -- and the interests of taxpayers? 
 ''With anyone short of the stature and honesty of a Paul Volcker running it, you need to worry a lot about conflicts of interest,'' said Alan S. Blinder, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, referring to its former head. ''Unfortunately, there just aren't many people with the expertise you need but without any possible conflicts.'' 
 The Treasury officials said they were still writing a policy on conflicts of interest as well as guidelines on compensation. 
 As if the mechanics were not daunting enough, Treasury officials need to make wrenching decisions that will determine the bailout's winners and losers. With so much money on the line, lobbyists for interest groups are already besieging the government to decide in their favor.
 The prospect of pitching in during a national crisis has drawn unsolicited offers from prominent asset managers, like William H. Gross, the managing director of Pimco, who offered his services free.
 In setting up the program, Mr. Paulson has relied on a cadre of former Goldman Sachs executives: Edward C. Forst, a former co-head of Goldman's investment management business who is on leave from his job as executive vice president at Harvard; Kendrick R. Wilson III, formerly chairman of Goldman's financial institutions groups; and Dan Jester, who was deputy chief financial officer at Goldman. 
 But administration officials said several other Treasury officials were playing crucial roles, including six assistant secretaries: Peter B. McCarthy, Phillip L. Swagel, Neel Kashkari, Kenneth E. Carfine, David G. Nason and Kevin I. Fromer, who led the Treasury's negotiating team on Capitol Hill.
 Mr. Forst is expected to soon return to Harvard, where he helps manage its endowment fund. And with a change in administrations looming, many of the people involved in organizing the program will not be around to manage it.
 Still, the Treasury may not have trouble recruiting replacements, given the job losses that have plagued the finance industry. 
 ''There are a lot of people, because of the downsizing of Wall Street, who won't be getting a paycheck at all,'' said Joshua S. Siegel, the managing principal of Stone Capital Partners, a fund that manages $2.2 billion. ''They would love to be involved.''
 Of all the challenges that the Treasury faces, the trickiest might be determining a price for the largely unwanted wreckage it will be buying. Many of the junk loans and mortgage-backed securities have no market price at all because they have no potential buyers. The firms hired by the government will have enormous power to push the ''market'' price up or down as they choose.
 If the government bargains to buy at the lowest possible price, it will protect taxpayers. But forcing the banks to book big losses could be self-defeating if they cannot resume lending until they raise fresh capital. If the government agrees to buy the assets at the value at which banks are keeping them on their balance sheets, taxpayers will almost certainly be overpaying. 
 The ''right'' price will depend on whether the government is favoring buyers or sellers. Many banks are hoping that the government will pay close to par -- the value listed in their books.
 But hedge fund managers and other potential buyers are demanding that the government push for the much lower price, based on the current trading value of the assets. These potential buyers are hoping they can piggyback onto the Treasury program, perhaps even acquiring distressed assets alongside the Treasury in auctions. 
 There are similar debates over how the Treasury should organize the plan. Most financial experts agree it would be impossible to build an internal operation of this size in a few weeks.
 ''It's essential they outsource almost everything possible,'' said T. Timothy Ryan Jr., president of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. ''The one thing they can't outsource is the final decision, and they can't outsource the infrastructure -- people, hiring policies, contracting rules. But they can hire people to do everything else.'' 
 Mr. Ryan is a former director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, where he played a key role in the savings and loan cleanup. Still, some investors are troubled by the government's heavy reliance on private firms. They said it would be difficult to prevent firms from steering capital in ways that favor their private customers.
 Inevitably, large asset management firms own, or are tied to banks that own, some of the same securities the government is seeking to sell. Pimco, for example, is owned by Allianz, one of Germany's largest insurance companies. Merrill Lynch owns a stake in BlackRock.
 ''I can't even fathom how I would manage that,'' Mr. Siegel said. ''How would I manage one side, where I'm seeking to maximize profit, and the other side, where I'm looking out for the social good?''
 The law stipulates that the government must prevent conflicts of interest in the hiring of firms, the decision of which assets to buy, the management of those assets and even the jobs held by employees after they leave the program. But it leaves the details to the Treasury.
 The Treasury plans to publish guidelines for hiring the asset management firms in the next day or two, officials said. Some experts say that the department simply needs to gird itself for protests. 
 ''You're never going to get past conflicts of interest, so you take your lumps,'' said Peter J. Wallison, who was general counsel of the Treasury during the Reagan administration.
 The bailout legislation itself highlights the contradictory goals that the Treasury will face when it goes on its buying spree. Among the goals it is supposed to consider are ''protecting taxpayers,'' ''preventing disruption to financial markets'' and ''the need to help families keep their homes.''
 Democratic lawmakers insisted that the Treasury use its authority to help restructure many subprime mortgages so that at least some troubled homeowners could avoid foreclosure.
 But the Treasury's auction plan will make that difficult. More than 90 percent of all subprime mortgages are part of giant pools, or trusts, which sell mortgage-backed securities to investors around the world.
 Before the government would be able to modify any mortgage that was in a trust, securities experts said, it would have to acquire agreement from 100 percent of the bondholders. But a senior Treasury official said the government would probably want to buy no more than half of the securities tied to a trust, which would hamper winning agreement from all investors.
 Treasury officials have emphasized that the government will also be buying up whole mortgages, which have not been securitized, and that it may well buy whole mortgages through one-on-one negotiations with individual banks. Officials said they would probably experiment with other approaches as well.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about plans by the Treasury Department to carry out the new bailout program for financial institutions misstated the name of the investment fund of Joshua S. Siegel, who commented on recruiting people to oversee the bailout effort. (The error also appeared in the attribution for the Quotation of the Day by Mr. Siegel.) The fund is StoneCastle Partners, not Stone Capital Partners.

HEADLINE: 90 Minutes to Exchange Views or, at Home, to Occasionally Scratch Heads

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, MICHAEL LUO and ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
The debate between the vice-presidential nominees offered the campaigns a chance to clarify their stances on central issues, but the exchanges often led to murky impressions of where they actually stand. Here is a second look at their positions in three areas: executive powers, taxes and the environment.
 Executive Powers
 Among leading scholars of the vice presidency and the Constitution, eyebrows rose Thursday night when Gov. Sarah Palin offered her vision of the job. ''I'm thankful that the Constitution would allow a bit more authority given to the vice president if that vice president so chose to exert it,'' she said. 
 ''I was perplexed when I heard that, and I imagine Republicans in the Senate are also scratching their heads,'' said Joel K. Goldstein, professor of law at St. Louis University and author of ''The Modern American Vice Presidency: The Transformation of a Political Institution.'' 
 ''The way I understood it,'' Professor Goldstein said of Ms. Palin's remark, ''she claimed more could be done in the Senate, and to that extent I just don't know what she's talking about. I don't think that's the case.''
 As defined by the Constitution, the vice president has powers and duties that are quite limited. Over the last 60 years, those responsibilities have often expanded, but they have done so because that is what presidents have chosen, not because the Constitution envisions it.
 ''What powers the vice president has today really come from the president,'' said Timothy Walch, editor of ''At the President's Side: The Vice Presidency in the Twentieth Century.'' ''If what she is calling out for is to formally acquire additional power, authority or a leadership role, that is unprecedented and would most likely require some kind of constitutional amendment, or a sense of the Senate resolution at the very least.''
 Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. also made statements about the vice presidency that have drawn notice in the wake of the debate. He incorrectly stated, for instance, that Article I of the Constitution governs the vice president's executive branch functions -- actually Article I deals with the legislative branch -- and he restricted those duties to breaking a tie vote in the Senate, not mentioning the constitutional mandate that the vice president ''shall be President of the Senate.''
 But it was Ms. Palin's comments that are being most heavily dissected, partly as a result of the outsize role that Vice President Dick Cheney has played over the last eight years, with responsibility for large swaths of policy. 
 A spokeswoman for Ms. Palin said Friday that the governor had meant only that she would work with the president to shape her role.
 ''The Constitution allows the president to determine the role his or her vice president shall play in his or her administration,'' said the spokeswoman, Tracey Schmitt. ''Every vice president since Walter Mondale has had additional responsibilities determined by the president. As vice president, Governor Palin would look forward to fulfilling such duties.''

 The back-and-forth over taxes between Ms. Palin and Mr. Biden was replete with misleading and inaccurate assertions from both sides. Certainly typical voters could be excused for feeling perplexed about how their bottom lines would be affected by the respective tax plans of Senators John McCain and Barack Obama. 
 The nonpartisan Center for Tax Policy completed an updated analysis this month with examples of how a variety of taxpayers would fare under each candidate's plan. In general, Mr. Obama's plan would cut taxes the most for those at the bottom of the income scale and reduce them as well for those in the middle, but raise them significantly for those at the very top. 
 While Mr. Obama would make permanent certain parts of the Bush tax cuts that are set to expire in 2011, individuals earning $200,000 or more a year and families earning more than $250,000 -- about 2 percent of the population -- would see their tax bills rise.
 Mr. McCain's proposal is simpler. Trying to spur economic growth, it cuts taxes across the board, for corporations as well as individuals, but provides relatively little relief for people at the bottom, more moderate benefits for those in the middle than Mr. Obama's proposal, and large breaks for those at the top. 
 As for the cost, fiscal monitors have raised questions about the impact of both plans on the budget deficit, with Mr. McCain's appearing to add the most to the national debt.
 Calculations of given taxpayers' bottom lines will vary, of course, depending on their distinct circumstances. And those calculations will change over time as additional provisions of the plans take effect in outlying years.
 But the Center for Tax Policy calculated that in 2009, under Mr. Obama's plan, a typical two-income married couple who have two children and earn an adjusted gross income of $50,000 a year -- meaning they are in the middle-income quintile -- would get a tax cut of about $1,000. Under Mr. McCain's plan, the cut would be $700.
 The difference is greater if the couple's income is just $35,000. Under Mr. Obama's plan they would get a tax cut of $1,400, under Mr. McCain's less than $500. 
 The contrast is even more striking in the upper reaches of income. A couple with two children and two incomes who earn $1.5 million would see a tax increase of more than $75,000 under Mr. Obama's plan, but a cut of about $300 under Mr. McCain's.

 Environment
 Political debates are often about making digestible points with simple language, and that makes them a poor fit for examining inherently complicated issues. Global warming is a case in point. 
 When Thursday night's moderator, Gwen Ifill, turned to climate change, she alluded to conflicting campaign-trail statements each side had made about its own position and challenged the contenders to clarify their stances on ''clean coal'' and ''capping'' emissions of carbon dioxide, a gas scientists have linked to rising temperatures. 
 Noting that Mr. McCain ''has said he supports caps on carbon emissions,'' Ms. Ifill asked Ms. Palin whether she took a similar position. 
 ''I do, I do,'' Ms. Palin answered, although neither she nor Ms. Ifill specified a mandatory cap or a voluntary one.
 The difference between mandatory and voluntary is enormous in this context. Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden support mandatory caps on emissions. Mr. McCain's climate plan, as presented on his Web site, also centers on a mandatory cap, but on the trail lately he has suggested that he would start out with only a voluntary one. Thursday night's debate did not clarify the Republican ticket's position in this regard.
 Ms. Ifill, still focused on climate, then pressed Mr. Biden to clarify whether he was for or against ''clean coal,'' alluding to a statement he made last month that he was against it.
 But the question, regardless of the answer, has little meaning in the context of current global warming policy.
 For decades, under ever tightening regulations, utilities have been scrubbing chemical pollutants like sulfur dioxide that are generated when coal is burned. Mr. Biden's response -- ''My record for 25 years has supported clean coal technology'' -- was clearly a reference to that environmental cleanup. But those pollutants, and cleanup technologies, have nothing to do with global warming. Unlike sulfur, mercury and other trace contaminants in coal, carbon dioxide is a basic byproduct of combustion, generatedin vast volumes by power plants. Systems for capturing, compressing and burying the gas have been tested at the scale of only about a million tons a year or so, even as billions of tons are flowing annually from coal-burning power plants now -- with higher amounts projected for at least another couple of decades, driven mainly by rapid growth in electricity use in China and India.
 Energy specialists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and elsewhere have said that construction of a fleet of industrial-scale demonstration projects that might be able to capture and bury the climate-changing gas should be getting under way immediately if there is to be any chance, even by 2020 or so, of meaningfully curbing emissions.
 So ''clean coal,'' in the context of climate change, remains a pipe dream for now. ANDREW C. REVKIN

An article on Saturday about the tax proposals of Senators Barack Obama and John McCain misidentified the organization that analyzed the impact of their plans on taxpayers. It is the Tax Policy Center -- not the Center for Tax Policy, another group that evaluates tax policies.

HEADLINE: Paterson Seeks $2 Billion in Budget Cuts

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM and JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Gov. David A. Paterson said on Friday that he would seek $2 billion in new cuts to the state's current budget and challenged lawmakers to abandon Albany's spending habits amid a deepening financial crisis. 
 In a meeting with legislative leaders that was at times remarkably testy for what are often scripted affairs, the governor said he would call the Legislature back to Albany -- but not until after the election -- to reopen the state budget. The governor and lawmakers agreed during a session in August to cut $427 million from this year's budget, but recent turmoil on Wall Street has opened an additional $1.2 billion hole, and the numbers are expected to worsen.
 While Mr. Paterson and legislative leaders have warned that the Wall Street crisis would have a magnified impact on New York, the extent of the damage is only beginning to emerge. 
 Preliminary tax receipts released this week by the state comptroller's office showed that revenue in September from sales, business and other taxes declined by about 7 percent, or $154 million, compared with September 2007.
 Tax receipts are expected to get worse, Mr. Paterson said. Tax revenue from Wall Street bonuses, expected to be down sharply this year, will not be counted until early next year.
 Mr. Paterson said he would take the unusual step of submitting an executive budget more than a month early -- in mid-December instead of late January -- in an effort to stave off a downgrade of the state's financial rating. Such a downgrade would raise the state's borrowing costs.
 Delivering a budget that early -- which has not been done since 1995 -- will present challenges for the State Division of the Budget, which will have to forecast next year's revenue earlier than usual. Mr. Paterson also said that he would seek to move up the start of the fiscal year from the current April 1. 
 ''With the tremendous amount of deficit hanging over our economy, it appears clear that we are going to have a downgrade in our financial rating by the ratings agencies,'' the governor said during the Friday morning meeting, which was held at his Midtown Manhattan office. ''I want to try to avoid that, and I want to try to avoid it in a way that addresses their concerns as quickly as possible, letting them know that in spite of the difficulty of these times, New York State is going to attack this problem.''
 Under the law, however, the conditions under which New York can borrow money to pay for its operating costs are very narrowly defined.
 The governor and lawmakers ruled out raising taxes to plug this year's deficit, but Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, the Legislature's top Democrat, would not preclude such a step for next year. Dean G. Skelos, the Senate majority leader and the Legislature's top Republican, has adamantly opposed tax increases; the governor, too, has said that he does not want to raise taxes, but he has resisted making any promises.
 On Friday he would not flatly rule out a tax increase. During a contentious exchange after Mr. Paterson said he did not believe taxes should be raised, Mr. Skelos pointedly asked him, ''Will you stand firm on that pledge?''
 Mr. Paterson paused and said, ''I just did,'' but later declined to say that he would never approve a tax increase.
 The two men, who are known to have cool relations, in no small part because Mr. Paterson and his fellow Democrats are trying to wrest control of the Senate from Mr. Skelos, also had a bitter exchange after Mr. Paterson accused the Legislature of not grasping the severity of the state's financial problems. 
 The governor, himself a former state senator, brushed aside the compliments conferred on him by the legislative leaders sitting beside him and said he was ''going to risk some of those friendships'' and ''say some things I would have normally said privately.''
 ''I don't think we all get how serious this problem is,'' he said. 
 Mr. Paterson then challenged the legislative leaders to cut their own budgets the way the executive branch has cut its own--the governor has already ordered state agencies to cut 10 percent from their spending.
 Mr. Skelos bristled.
 ''I'm not in college and I'm not in law school anymore and I don't need to be lectured,'' he said. 
 ''I apologize, Senator, if I hurt your feelings,'' the governor said later, to which Mr. Skelos replied sharply, ''I've been in the business a long time, so my feelings don't get hurt.''
 Wall Street accounts for a fifth of the state's revenue. And the state is now forecasting that it will take in about $39.6 billion in general fund revenue this year, while earlier forecasts had projected $43.2 billion. 
 Next year's budget deficit, which had been projected at $5.4 billion, is now expected to be considerably larger. 
 Many observers believe that when a special legislative session is convened after the election, lawmakers will be forced to cut the two largest areas of the budget, Medicaid and education. Hospitals and their workers and teachers are among the most powerful interest groups in Albany. 
 ''It has to be done,'' said Carol Kellermann, the president of the Citizens Budget Commission. ''There really isn't anyplace else to go to make cuts of that size.''
 And the challenges keep coming. Mr. Paterson lamented the news that the Wachovia Corporation had agreed to be acquired by Wells Fargo, a West Coast bank, instead of the expected acquisition by Citigroup, which is based in New York.
 The governor called the development ''a significant hit to the New York economy.''
 ''There's no way to sugarcoat it,'' he said of the overall situation, and then cited an analogy used recently by the billionaire investor Warren Buffett: ''The United States economy can be compared to a great athlete who suffered a stroke.''

HEADLINE: Bush Signs Bill

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Reporting was contributed by Robert Pear and Carl Hulse in Washington; Steven Lee Myers in Abington, Pa.; and Michael Cooper in Flagstaff, Ariz.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
After the House reversed course and gave final approval to the $700 billion economic bailout package, President Bush quickly signed it into law on Friday, authorizing the Treasury to undertake what could become the most expensive government intervention in history. 
 But even as Mr. Bush declared that the measure would ''help prevent the crisis on Wall Street from becoming a crisis in communities across our country,'' Congressional Democrats said that it was only a first step and pledged to carry out a sweeping overhaul of the nation's financial regulatory system. 
 The final tally in the House was 263 to 171, with 91 Republicans joining 172 Democrats in favor. That was a wider bipartisan majority than vote-counters in both parties had expected, completing a remarkable turnabout from Monday, when the House defeated an earlier version of the bill by 228 to 205. 
 The financial markets, however, were not enthusiastic. Already weighed down by another round of bleak economic data, including a report showing that 159,000 jobs were lost in September, the Dow fell 157 points to close at 10,325, or nearly 818 points lower than when the week began, before the House's initial rejection of the bailout. 
 Some measures of the credit markets improved after the bill was approved, but only modestly. Analysts said it was too soon to tell whether borrowing rates -- the interest rates banks charge each other for loans, and a key indicator of the flow of credit -- would fall. 
 The change in course by the House was prompted by fears of a global economic meltdown, and by old-fashioned political inducements added by the Senate: a portfolio of $150 billion in popular tax provisions, including credits for the production of solar, wind and other renewable energy, and an adjustment to spare middle-class families from paying the alternative minimum tax. 
 In the end, 33 Democrats and 24 Republicans who had voted no on Monday switched sides on Friday to support the plan. Both Mr. Obama and his Republican rival, Senator John McCain, voted for the measure when the Senate approved it on Wednesday, and both hailed Friday's outcome. 
 Mr. McCain said that lawmakers had acted ''in the best interests of the nation,'' while Mr. Obama warned that ''a long and difficult road to recovery'' might still lie ahead.
 In a sign of the urgency surrounding the economic rescue effort, Congressional staff rushed the newly printed legislation into a news conference where Democratic leaders gathered after the vote. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, of California, signed it at 2 p.m., and it was sent to the White House for Mr. Bush's signature.
 Appearing in the Rose Garden, Mr. Bush praised Congress for acting just two weeks after the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., requested the emergency bailout legislation with a warning that the American economy was at risk of the worst economic collapse since the Depression. 
 ''We have shown the world that the United States will stabilize our financial markets and maintain a leading role in the global economy,'' Mr. Bush said. 
 But it was a hollow victory for the administration, which after long favoring a hands-off approach toward the financial industry has found itself interceding repeatedly this year to avert one calamity after another. 
 Ms. Pelosi and other Democrats, who expect to widen their majority in Congress in the November elections, said they intended to tighten controls. 
 ''High-fliers on Wall Street will no longer be able to jeopardize that personal economic security of Americans,'' Ms. Pelosi said, ''because of the bright light of scrutiny, accountability and the attention given under regulatory reform.''
 Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the Financial Services Committee, said: ''We will be back next year to do some serious surgery on the financial structure.'' 
 The Republican leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, had urged his colleagues to vote yes. ''We know if we do nothing this crisis is likely to worsen and put us in an economic slump the likes of which we have never seen,'' he said. ''I am going to vote for this bill because I think it's in the best interests of the American people.''
 Opponents of the bailout called it a costly Band-Aid that did not address the core problems in the financial system. ''Some things have changed in this bill but taxpayers will still be picking up the tab for Wall Street's party,'' said Representative Marilyn Musgrave, Republican of Colorado. ''I am voting against this today because it's not the best bill. It's the quickest bill. Taxpayers for generations will pay for our haste and there is no guarantee that they will ever see the benefits.''
 Among House Democrats as well as Republicans, many lawmakers facing the toughest challenges for re-election remained in the no column. Those with easier races were more likely to switch. 
 Many said they agonized over the decision amid a torrent of calls from constituents. Several who switched to yes cited a provision added by the Senate increasing the amount of savings insured by the Federal government to $250,000 per account, from $100,000. 
 Fears about the economy also motivated support. ''Nobody in East Tennessee hates the fact more than me that I am going to vote yes today after voting no on Monday,'' Representative Zach Wamp, a Republican, said.
 ''Monday I cast a blue-collar vote for the American people,'' he continued. ''Today I am going to cast a red, white and blue-collar vote with my hand over my heart for this country, because things are really bad and we don't have any choice.'' 
 Several Democrats in the Congressional Black Caucus said they were persuaded to support the bill by Mr. Obama. 
 Representatives Elijah E. Cummings and Donna F. Edwards, both of Maryland, said they had each spoken to Mr. Obama who helped persuade them to support the bill, in part by assuring them that he would work to achieve a goal that Democrats gave up during negotiations: a change in bankruptcy laws to let judges modify first mortgages. 
 Mr. Obama, speaking in Abington, Pa., said he had urged lawmakers from both parties to ''not make the same mistake twice.'' But he warned that passage of the measure should be just ''the beginning of a long-term rescue plan for our middle class.''
 Mr. McCain, speaking in Flagstaff, Ariz., warned that the bill was not perfect and there was more to be done. ''It is an outrage that it's even necessary,'' Mr. McCain said. ''But we must stop the damage to our economy done by corrupt and incompetent practices on Wall Street and in Washington.'' Mr. McCain said he spoke to House Republicans before Friday's vote and urged them to approve the bill.
 Friday's vote capped an extraordinary two-week final stretch for the 110th Congress. Lawmakers, eager to get home for the fall campaign season, had intended to wrap up by adopting a budget bill to finance government operations through early March. 
 Instead, after dealing with the budget, they found themselves still in Washington, just five weeks before Election Day, facing the most important vote of the year -- the most important vote of their lives, many lawmakers said -- and under extreme pressure by the White House, the presidential nominees, and Congressional leaders of both parties to make a quick decision. 
 Supporters said the bailout was needed to prevent economic collapse; opponents said it was hasty, ill conceived and risked too much taxpayer money to help Wall Street tycoons, while providing no guarantees of success. The rescue plan allows the Treasury to buy troubled securities from financial firms in an effort to ease a deepening credit crisis that is choking off business and consumer loans, the lifeblood of the economy, and contributing to a string of bank failures.
 Officials say the final cost of the bailout will be far less than $700 billion because the government will resell the assets that it buys. 
 The final agreement disburses the money in parts, with Congress able to block the second $350 billion. It also provides for tighter oversight of the program by two boards, and requires the government to do more to prevent home foreclosures. Lawmakers also included efforts to restrict so-called golden parachute retirement plans for some executives whose firms seek help, and a provision allowing the government to recoup any losses after five years by assessing the financial industry.

HEADLINE: In Governors' Races, the Emphasis Is Local, Not National

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
In an election season dominated by the presidential race and the financial crisis, the 11 races for governor, by and large, are being swung outside the national spotlight by local issues and personalities.
 In the three states where incumbents are facing competitive battles to stay in office -- Washington, Indiana and Vermont -- issues like traffic congestion, college and heating fuel costs, and economic development, or decline, have dominated the conversation.
 In the races for open seats in Missouri, Delaware and North Carolina, personal stories -- about end-runs around the political hierarchy, or the legacies and foibles of governors heading for the exit -- have turned elections into sweeping melodramas of ambition or failure.
 ''There's a unique quality in each state,'' said Alan Rosenthal, a professor of public policy at Rutgers University who studies the states. ''The economy is obviously part of it, and this whole change and anti-politics government thing has got to slop over in most places. But the weight of each factor is different state-by-state and week-by-week.'' 
 Democrats now control 28 of the 50 governor's chairs -- having seized a majority in 2006 for the first time since a Republican surge in the mid-1990s -- and are expected to retain a majority with a shift of perhaps one or two seats one direction or another, political experts say.
 But beneath that surface calm lies a churning cauldron of ambition and practicality, full of rising and falling stars eyeing the national stage, and issues that touch how Americans actually live their daily lives.
 In Washington, an almost verbatim replay of the 2004 election is unfolding, with Gov. Christine Gregoire, a Democrat, facing off against Dino Rossi, a Republican former state senator. Ms. Gregoire beat Mr. Rossi by fewer than 200 votes last time -- one of the closest major elections in American history -- and the two are running neck and neck again as though time had stopped.
 In Delaware, an insurgent Democrat, State Treasurer Jack Markell, walked off with the nomination for governor in a surprise victory in the primary last month -- upending careful plans by the Democrats for an orchestrated handover of power from the term-limited incumbent, Ruth Ann Minner, to her trusted lieutenant governor. Mr. Markell sold voters on detailed plans for health care and economic development, and now faces Bill Lee, a Republican and retired judge.
 In Missouri, the race to succeed Matt Blunt, a Republican who chose not to run for a second term, has become at least partly a referendum on Mr. Blunt and his party. The election between State Attorney General Jay Nixon, a Democrat, and Representative Kenny Hulshof, a Republican, is in some ways a microcosm of the national debate about President Bush and his legacy. But across the state, the terms are homespun, local and specific down to the level of college loan programs and health care.
 In North Carolina, the opposite has unfolded, with the Republican candidate, Mayor Pat McCrory of Charlotte, arguing that 15 years of Democratic control at the governor's office is enough. Polls show the race to succeed Gov. Michael F. Easley, who is leaving because of term-limit rules, a toss-up between Mr. McCrory and Lt. Gov. Beverly Eaves Perdue, a Democrat.
 ''The lesson of 2008 gubernatorial races is that governing matters and records matter,'' said Nick Ayers, the executive director of the Republican Governors Association.
 ''National politics does tend to play a role to some degree in these races, and these races to some degree play a role in national politics,'' Mr. Ayers added. ''But by and large, people are going to win or lose based on their own candidacy.'' 
 The luck of the draw in geography or economics probably also helps.
 Of the eight states where incumbents are running, for example -- Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Utah, Vermont, Washington and West Virginia -- three are rated by The Cook Political Report, an independent nonpartisan research group, as competitive: Indiana, Vermont and Washington.
 Here is the pattern: the states where incumbents are considered safest, the economy is also generally holding firmer in the face of the national downturn.
 Montana (Brian Schweitzer, Democrat), New Hampshire (John Lynch, Democrat), North Dakota (John Hoeven, Republican), Utah (Jon M. Huntsman Jr., Republican) and West Virginia (Joe Manchin III, Democrat) all handily beat the national average, and the average in their regions of the country, in job growth for the 12 months through August, compared with a 0.2 percent job loss nationally, according to an analysis for The New York Times by Moody's Economy.com. 
 But all 11 states, with the exception of Indiana, also had rates of home foreclosures far below the national average, and all except New Hampshire and Vermont had house prices that held up better than the nation's as a whole over the last year. 
 Historically, most of the group leans toward the Republicans in national elections. Eight of the 11 states supported President Bush in 2000, and seven did so again in 2004. This year, seven are considered likely to support the Republican presidential candidate, Senator John McCain, according to Cook Political Report, with three likely for the Democratic candidate, Senator Barack Obama, and one toss-up, New Hampshire.
 But governors have also often been contrary indicators on the national scene -- another historic measure of how voters perhaps perceive them differently as the front-line face of government. Republicans sometimes do well in ostensibly Democratic-leaning states -- California, New York and Vermont, for example -- while Democratic governors have done well in heavily Republican states like Montana, North Carolina and West Virginia.
 But no matter who wins, the next advancing phalanx of state executives is likely to face rocky times, said Thad L. Beyle, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who studies governors. Professor Beyle said he thought a federal bailout of Wall Street would alter a crucial element of the gubernatorial chemistry: the ability to collect checks from a Washington that finds itself crimped and looking for ways and means to cut.
 ''As soon as they get elected, they will see problems: falling revenues and decreasing help from the federal government,'' said Professor Beyle, who edited a book of essays about governing in bad economic periods, ''Governors and Hard Times'' (CQ Press, 1992). ''They're going to be really in trouble and will have to face legislatures that are in trouble.''
 But for now, the energy of the state campaigns, even if it is not translating far into the national consciousness, is intense. In Washington, where Ms. Gregoire won by 133 votes last time, her Web site is posting stories of people who once supported her opponent but have changed sides. Individuals, not voting blocs, are being counted there.
 ''There's no governor who knows more than she does that every vote counts,'' said a spokesman for Ms. Gregoire, Aaron Toso.

HEADLINE: Palin's Alternate Universe

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
Sarah Palin is the perfect exclamation point to the Bush years.
 We've lived through nearly two terms of an administration that believed it could create its own reality:
 ''Deficits don't matter.'' ''Brownie, you're doing a heckuva job.'' ''Those weapons of mass destruction must be somewhere.''
 Now comes Ms. Palin, a smiling, bubbly vice-presidential candidate who travels in an alternate language universe. For Ms. Palin, such things as context, syntax and the proximity of answers to questions have no meaning. 
 In her closing remarks at the vice-presidential debate Thursday night, Ms. Palin referred earnestly, if loosely, to a quote from Ronald Reagan. He had warned that if Americans weren't vigilant in protecting their freedom, they would find themselves spending their ''sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it was like in America when men were free.''
 What Ms. Palin didn't say was that the menace to freedom that Reagan was talking about was Medicare. As the historian Robert Dallek has pointed out, Reagan ''saw Medicare as the advance wave of socialism, which would 'invade every area of freedom in this country.' ''
 Does Ms. Palin agree with that Looney Tunes notion? Or was this just another case of the aw-shucks, darn-right, I'm-just-a-hockey-mom governor of Alaska mouthing something completely devoid of meaning?
 Here's Ms. Palin during the debate: ''Say it ain't so, Joe! There you go pointing backwards again ... Now, doggone it, let's look ahead and tell Americans what we have to plan to do for them in the future. You mentioned education, and I'm glad you did. I know education you are passionate about with your wife being a teacher for 30 years, and God bless her. Her reward is in heaven, right?'' 
 If Governor Palin didn't like a question, or didn't know the answer, she responded as though some other question had been asked. She made no bones about this, saying early in the debate: ''I may not answer the questions the way that either the moderator or you want to hear.''
 The problem with Ms. Palin's candidacy is that John McCain might actually win this election, and then if something terrible happened, the country could be left with little more than an exclamation point as president. 
 After Ms. Palin had woven one of her particularly impenetrable linguistic webs, Joe Biden turned to the debate's moderator, Gwen Ifill, and said: ''Gwen, I don't know where to start.''
 Of course he didn't know where to start because Ms. Palin's words don't mean anything. She's all punctuation.
 This is such a serious moment in American history that it's hard to believe that someone with Ms. Palin's limited skills could possibly be playing a leadership role. On the day before the debate, the commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, Gen. David McKiernan, made an urgent appeal for more troops, saying the additional ''boots on the ground,'' as well as more helicopters and other vital equipment, were ''needed as quickly as possible.''
 The morning after the debate, the Labor Department announced that the employment situation in the U.S. had deteriorated even more than experts had expected. The nation lost nearly 160,000 jobs in September, more than double the monthly losses in July and August.
 Conditions are probably worse than even those numbers indicate because the government's statistics do not yet reflect the response of employers to the credit crisis that has taken such a hold in the last few weeks.
 Where is the evidence that Governor Palin even understands these complex and enormously challenging problems? During the debate she twice referred to General McKiernan as ''McClellan.'' Neither Ms. Ifill nor Senator Biden corrected her.
 But after Senator Biden suggested that John McCain's answer to the nation's energy problems was to ''drill, drill, drill,'' Ms. Palin promptly pointed out, as if scoring a point, that ''the chant is 'Drill, baby, drill!' ''
 How's that for perspective? The credit markets are frozen. Our top general in Afghanistan is dialing 911. Americans are losing jobs by the scores of thousands. And Sarah Palin is making sure we know that the chant is ''drill, baby, drill!'' not ''drill, drill, drill.''
 John McCain has spent most of his adult life speaking of his love for his country. Maybe he sees something in Sarah Palin that most Americans do not. Maybe he is aware of qualities that lead him to believe she'd be as steady as Franklin Roosevelt in guiding the U.S. through a prolonged economic downturn. Maybe she'd be as wise and prudent in a national emergency as John Kennedy was during the Cuban missile crisis.
 Maybe Senator McCain has reason to believe that it would not be the most colossal of errors to put Ms. Palin a heartbeat away from the presidency.
 He's got just four weeks to share that insight with the rest of us.

HEADLINE: Everything You Heard Is Wrong

BYLINE: By STEVEN PINKER. 
Steven Pinker, a professor of psychology at Harvard, is the author of ''The Stuff of Thought: Language as a Window Into Human Nature.''

DATELINE: Boston 

 BODY:
 SINCE the vice presidential debate on Thursday night, two opposing myths have quickly taken hold about Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska. The first, advanced by her supporters, is that she made it through a gantlet of fire; the second, embraced by her detractors, is that her speaking style betrays her naivete. Both are wrong.
 Let's take the first myth: Governor Palin subjected herself to the most demanding test possible -- a televised debate. By surviving, she won. As the front page of The Daily News of New York screamed this morning, ''No Baked Alaska.'' 
 But as a test of clear thinking, the debate format was far less demanding than a face-to-face interview -- the kind Ms. Palin had with Katie Couric of CBS.
 Why? Because in a one-on-one conversation, you can't launch into a prepared speech on a topic unrelated to the question. Imagine this exchange -- based on the first question that the moderator, Gwen Ifill, gave Ms. Palin and Senator Joe Biden -- if it took place in casual conversation over coffee:
 LISA How about that bailout? Was this Washington at its best or at its worst? 
 MICHAEL You know, I think a good barometer here, as we try to figure out has this been a good time or a bad time in America's economy, is go to a kid's soccer game on Saturday, and turn to any parent there on the sideline and ask them, ''How are you feeling about the economy?''
 Lisa would flee. (This was, in fact, Ms. Palin's response.) In a conversation, you have to build your sentence phrase by phrase, monitoring the reaction of your listener, while aiming for relevance to the question. That's what led Ms. Palin into word salad with Ms. Couric. But when the questioner is 30 feet away on the floor and you're on a stage talking to a camera, which can't interrupt or make faces, you can reel off a script without embarrassment. The concerns raised by the Couric interviews -- that Ms. Palin memorizes talking points rather than grasping issues -- should not be allayed by her performance in the forgiving format of a debate. 
 The second myth about Ms. Palin is that her accent is contrived, or that it reveals laziness or ignorance on her part. Certainly, Ms. Palin cranked the folksiness dial to 11 during the debate: she dropped more g's, reverted to ''nucular'' after being teleprompted during the Republican National Convention to pronounce it ''new-clear,'' and salted her speech with cutesy near profanities like ''darn,'' ''heck'' and ''doggone.'' 
 But it would be unfair to question the authenticity of her accent or to use it as a measure of her intellect or sophistication. The dialect is certainly for real. Listeners who hear the Minnewegian sounds of the characters from ''Fargo'' when they listen to Ms. Palin are on to something: the Matanuska-Susitna Valley in Alaska, where she grew up, was settled by farmers from Minnesota during the Depression. 
 And no, ''nucular'' is not a sign of ignorance. This reversal of vowel-like consonants (nuk-l'-yer --> nuk-y'-ler) is common in the world's languages, and is no more illiterate than pronouncing ''iron'' the way most Americans do, as ''eye-yern'' instead of ''eye-ren.'' 
 Nor is Ms. Palin guilty of laziness in ''dropping g's,'' because there is no such thing as ''dropping g's.'' The sounds at the end of ''nothing'' and ''nothin''' are different consonants (linguists call them ''eng'' and ''en''), one produced with the tongue on the gum ridge, the other with the tongue on the soft palate. We just spell the second one with two letters. We all flip between ''eng'' and ''en'' in our speech, though lower-class speakers do it more, and everyone does it more when the conversation is more casual. It's the output of an informality dial that all of us, regardless of accent, twiddle as we tune our speech to the circumstances. 
 And twiddle it she did. Ms. Palin, for instance, pronounced her ''ens'' more conspicuously in the debate than in the Couric interviews, a part to emphasize that she was one with ''everyday American people, Joe Six-Pack, hockey moms across the nation.'' 
 The impression fits with the overall theme that Ms. Palin and Senator John McCain have been trying to advance: that expertise is overrated, homespun sincerity is better than sophistication, conviction is more important than analysis. 
 Being able to see Russia from Alaska, then, means you have an understanding of foreign policy; living in an Arctic state means that you have an understanding of climate change. In Mr. McCain's case, it means, as he wrote last month, understanding technology policy because he flew airplanes in Vietnam and being concerned about the oceans' health because he served in the Navy. 
 Much could also be written about Senator Joe Biden's gaffes and what they reveal about him. In the meantime, voters judging Ms. Palin's performance should focus on the facile governing philosophy that is symbolized by her speech style, not the red herrings of accent or dialect.

HEADLINE: California May Need U.S. Loan Of $7 Billion

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
California, the nation's most populous state and the world's sixth-biggest economy, has warned the Treasury Department that it may need a $7 billion emergency loan from the federal government because it is running out of cash and has not been able to borrow more.
 State officials said they hoped that the $700 billion federal bailout of the financial system approved by the House of Representatives on Friday would help open credit markets that have balked at providing the kind of short-term financing California and other states and local governments routinely rely on to keep operating. 
 But Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, said at a news conference on Friday that the state ''is not out of the woods yet'' and in a few weeks could run out of cash to pay for basic services.
 Mr. Schwarzenegger had sent a letter on Thursday night to Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., warning that the state might be forced to seek the emergency loan. 
 The letter was seen by some financial experts as an attempt to pressure lawmakers in Washington to approve the plan, which President Bush signed Friday. But the underlying credit problem is real and coming into glaring focus, state officials and outside analysts said, not only for California but also for several other states and local governments. In his letter, Mr. Schwarzenegger wrote that the situation in California was so acute because the state's ''short-term cash flow needs exceed the entire budget of some states.''
 Creditors, shaken by the economic turmoil, are not providing the kind of short-term financing that governments, normally safe bets, depend on to stay afloat until tax revenue is collected.
 ''There may have been a little gamesmanship, a little pressure put on Congress to make sure the bailout passed,'' said Sujit M. CanagaRetna, a fiscal analyst at the Council of State Governments, a research group. ''But there is no doubt there is a severe credit crunch.''
 Massachusetts, he said, recently fell $170 million short of the $400 million it had sought in the credit market to make a routine quarterly aid payment to cities and towns. Louisiana and New Mexico both postponed multimillion-dollar bond sales in the face of the quivering market.
 The problem, he said, may grow worse as 15 states besides California, including New York and Connecticut, work to fill several billion dollars in funding gaps that have emerged this fall.
 In his letter, first reported by The Los Angeles Times, Mr. Schwarzenegger said, ''California and other states may be unable to obtain the necessary level of financing to maintain government operations and may be forced to turn to the federal treasury for short-term financing.''
 Treasury officials said they were reviewing the letter.
 If California follows through on a $7 billion request, the loan, the equivalent of $192 for each resident, could surpass the federal government's bailout of New York City in 1975 as it teetered on bankruptcy. After initially refusing, the federal government eventually provided $2.5 billion in federal loan guarantees that helped the city recover.
 Still, Mr. Schwarzenegger and state officials said they viewed such a loan as a last resort in the event the government recovery plan did not sufficiently unlock the credit market.
 ''It is hard to get that loan'' in the markets, Mr. Schwarzenegger said. ''If we can't get that loan through the normal course, we will go through the federal government, and we already set that in motion.''
 Asked what would happen if the markets or the government did not come through, Mr. Schwarzenegger replied, ''This is no such thing in my vocabulary as, 'what if not.' We will.''
 Mr. Schwarzenegger plans to meet on Saturday morning with John Chiang, the state comptroller, to discuss the problem, and to gather next week with legislative leaders to strategize.
 Bill Lockyer, the state treasurer, had warned Wednesday that as Congress debated the rescue plan, the state had been locked out of credit markets for the past 10 days. ''The credit market is frozen because financial institutions are afraid to commit capital amid enormous uncertainty,'' he said.
 Mr. Lockyer also said the state's cash reserves would drain completely near the end of the month, jeopardizing payments for teachers' salaries, nursing homes, law enforcement and an array of other state-financed services. California's 5,000 cities, counties and school districts, he added, would face the same fate.
 In an interview on Friday, Mr. Lockyer said the state routinely received short-term loans in the fall to cover payments until state coffers refill in the spring from tax revenue and other sources. But the shuttered credit market has upended the system, he said, adding that even if the credit markets loosened, it could cost more to borrow. He noted that in the weeks leading up to the crisis, borrowing terms had increased.
 Still, Mr. Lockyer said he believed the recovery plan would provide some relief and predicted that would be more likely than the government loan.
 ''No one likes looking over the precipice, but I think we're O.K.,'' Mr. Lockyer said.
 Analysts said the credit problems in California in part reflected years of budget problems lingering from the economic downturn after the Sept. 11 attacks.
 ''The state's failure to bring the state budget back into balance in good times left the state very vulnerable to the downturn it is facing this cycle,'' said Robert Kurtter of Moody's Investors Service.
 Late in September, California adopted a $143 billion budget, 85 days overdue, after a protracted fight between Mr. Schwarzenegger and the Legislature over how to close a $15 billion gap.
 The budget included some cuts in services. It also relied on accounting maneuvers and assumptions like voter approval to borrow $5 billion against future lottery revenue and to expand the state's rainy-day fund to 12.5 percent of general fund expenditures, from 5 percent.

HEADLINE: Mr. Olmert's Belated Truths

 BODY:
Ehud Olmert, Israel's soon to be ex-prime minister, voiced some startling truths this week. He said that in exchange for peace, Israel should withdraw from ''almost all'' of the West Bank and share its capital city, Jerusalem, with the Palestinians. He also said that as part of a negotiated peace deal with Syria, Israel should be ready to give up the Golan Heights. 
 It's frustrating that Mr. Olmert, who is stepping down as prime minister after being accused of corruption, waited so long to say these things. And it is tragic that he did not do more to act on those beliefs when he had real power. 
 His statements in a farewell interview with the newspaper Yediot Ahronoth were unlike anything any Israeli political leader had dared to say -- at least publicly -- before. He also dismissed as ''megalomania'' any suggestion that Israel should act by itself to destroy Iran's nuclear program. 
 There always has been far too wide a gap between Mr. Olmert's belief that Israel's security and demographic survival depends on a two-state solution and what he has been willing to do to get such a deal. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, also has not shown nearly enough political courage. The result is that while the two men have been negotiating since the American-led Annapolis peace conference last fall, very little progress has been made. 
 There are, of course, many fraught issues to solve: drawing permanent boundaries that give Israel defensible frontiers and the Palestinians an economically viable state; finding a way for both states to claim Jerusalem as their capital; and compensating and resettling Palestinian refugees in the new Palestinian state.
 But Mr. Olmert was never willing to take even the tactical steps needed to improve the lives of ordinary Palestinians and give them a real stake in peace: fully freezing the expansion of Jewish settlements and sufficiently reducing the roadblocks in the West Bank that are strangling the Palestinian economy. Although a discredited messenger, Mr. Olmert still deserves credit for putting the most sensitive issues on the table and identifying the only viable formula for a peace agreement. 
 Tzipi Livni, Mr. Olmert's designated successor, has been Israel's chief negotiator for the past year. It is unlikely that she will show any candor while she tries to put together a coalition government. But we hope that she takes Mr. Olmert's truths to heart. And we hope she is willing to do what is needed to build a lasting peace.

HEADLINE: Economic Crisis Fuels Obama In Tight Ground War for Florida

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

DATELINE: NEW PORT RICHEY, Fla. 

 BODY:
Jim Piccillo lost his job as a bank vice president in August, applied for food stamps to support his two young daughters and swore off a life of loyalty to the Republican Party. He now volunteers here in Pasco County for Senator Barack Obama of Illinois. 
 Madeline Aquanno's change of heart came more recently. Two weeks ago, she said, she had planned to vote for Senator John McCain of Arizona, the Republican, who impressed her with his knowledge of the world. But as the economy began to scare her more than terrorism, she reconsidered. 
 ''Obama is more for the people,'' she said, near the pool at her middle-class retirement community in Broward County. ''I'm worried about the jobs that are being lost, for my son, my daughter, my granddaughter. You have to look down the line.''
 Here in a swing state of severe economic hurt -- a leader in foreclosures where empty offices now litter strip malls -- there are signs that Mr. Obama is gaining ground. In interviews and surveys, voters across Florida said the debate in Washington over how to fix the credit crisis had fueled frustration with the Bush administration and pushed them away from the Republican ticket. 
 The four most recent polls from late September put Mr. Obama ahead of Mr. McCain by three to eight percentage points, a sharp swing from the previous six weeks, when Mr. McCain led by as much as 10 points. 
 Also in Mr. Obama's favor, Florida as of August had 498,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans, up from an advantage of 373,000 four years ago. 
 And yet, this state has a history of defying electoral math, and the challenge for Mr. Obama remains profound. For one thing, Florida's population is older than average, a demographic that tends to favor Mr. McCain.
 Meanwhile, the schisms of race, sex and class opened by the bitter Democratic primary contest between Mr. Obama and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York have not fully healed. Many older Democrats quietly admit they will not vote for Mr. Obama because they fear he would put too many blacks in power, or be hamstrung in office by racial opposition. 
 Add to the mix a new voting system that lost 3,000 votes in a local election this summer, rumors that new laws to prevent voter fraud will lead to long lines or legal battles, and Mr. McCain's surprise pick of Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska as his running mate, and the Sunshine State starts to look cloudy.
 That is why, many analysts say, both campaigns are focusing on the ground game that they believe they can control.
 ''The battle in Florida comes down to one word,'' said Susan MacManus, a political scientist at the University of South Florida who served on the Florida Elections Commission under Gov. Jeb Bush. ''And that's 'turnout.' ''
 The Obama campaign is trying to bring out young voters and African-Americans, historically an unpredictable bunch when it comes to voting, while also peeling off former Bush supporters in Republican areas. 
 It now has 350 paid staffers in Florida, a budget of at least $39 million and more than 50 offices everywhere from heavily Republican Pensacola to the Democratic stronghold of Fort Lauderdale. 
 Mike DuHaime, Mr. McCain's national political director, acknowledged that the McCain budget was smaller (he did not give a dollar amount), though it is expected to grow now that the campaign has pulled out of Michigan. Mr. DuHaime also said it was clear that the Democrats were ''trying to emulate what Republicans have done'' by contesting areas where they had little hope of winning. 
 Still, he said he was confident of victory because with the help of the state's Republican Party, ''what we have is a team in Florida that has done this before.''
 Pasco County is just one place where the Republicans' experience is running up against the Democrats' new arrivals. It was here, among the rural areas and exurbs north of Tampa, where President Bush ran up the big margins that helped push him to victory in 2004. Senator John Kerry, the Democratic nominee that year, did not open an office in the county, making the Obama outpost here in New Port Richey a novelty. 
 The handful of paid organizers in their 20s have been a welcome sight for Democrats like Dan Callaghan, 66, a retired English teacher whose son is serving his fourth tour in Iraq. The goal, Obama advisers say, is to use these local supporters to influence their Republican neighbors and turn out more Democrats, who make up about 37 percent of the county rolls. 
 It will not be easy. Of the 16 people Mr. Callaghan encountered during a recent canvassing trip, only four said they would vote for Mr. Obama. Of the rest, two people said they were McCain supporters, seven were undecided and three did not intend to vote.
 Anecdotally, though, Mr. Obama seems to have made some headway. At Christina's, a family restaurant in downtown New Port Richey, the red leather stools at the counter held both Republicans tried-and-true, and Republicans, like Chris Hart, 48, who had begun to sour on Mr. McCain. 
 ''Every time you turn around, he flips,'' Mr. Hart said. A front-desk clerk at a local Y.M.C.A, he said he was also motivated by his need for health insurance, which had recently forced him to buy antibiotics at pet stores because it was cheaper than the pharmacy. 
 While not sure that Democrats could get him the coverage he needed, Mr. Hart said he wished Mr. McCain focused more consistently on the issue. ''I was in the Navy, in aviation like John McCain, so I feel like I'm getting punched by one of my own,'' Mr. Hart said. 
 For Mr. Piccillo, 34, skepticism arrived with the Republican convention. After voting twice for George W. Bush, he said he was especially turned off when Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor, mocked Mr. Obama's early work as a community organizer. 
 ''Those are the people I'm looking to for help,'' said Mr. Piccillo, a former mortgage banker who said he had sent out 1,500 resumes without finding a job. 
 There are, of course, enthusiastic McCain fans in Pasco County, perhaps none more so than Bill Bunting, chairman of the county's Republican Party. Mr. Bunting said he had opened four offices this year, up from two in 2004, to compete with the Obama campaign's one.
 Inside his headquarters, the walls are covered with photographs of Republican leaders, including Gov. Charlie Crist -- a sign of the party's local dominance, and one reason Mr. Bunting is confident he can get far more people to the polls. 
 Outside, taped to the door, is another hint at why Republicans think they can win: a picture of Ms. Palin firing a gun below the Obama catchphrase ''change we can believe in.'' 
 Mr. Bunting and other party officials said Ms. Palin had electrified the race. In Tampa, the day Mr. McCain announced that she would be his vice-presidential pick, 20 women showed up to volunteer at the campaign's local headquarters, said Greg Truax, the office's campaign director. In Pasco County, 95 new people appeared. 
 ''Every one of them said they were motivated by Palin,'' Mr. Bunting said. 
 Less clear is whether that motivation can be sustained. Polls have shown support for Ms. Palin dwindling, and the McCain-Palin offices in Tampa, Pasco County and Broward County all seemed emptier than Mr. Obama's during several visits over the last two weeks. 
 Ms. Palin seems mainly to have crystallized partisan divisions. In Pasco County and in South Florida's strip malls and gated communities, Republicans like Dennis Colado, 50, a chemical salesman, said they found her refreshing. 
 But others shared the view of Sherry Kruta, a Democrat and former Clinton supporter from Highland Beach who only a month ago said she might vote for Mr. McCain. ''The thought of her maybe being the president scares me to death,'' Ms. Kruta said. 
 Fear, in fact -- of Mr. Obama or Ms. Palin -- seems to be widespread. At Wynmoor Village, the retirement community in Coconut Creek where Ms. Aquanno said she was leaning away from Mr. McCain because his snap judgments made him seem ''more like Bush,'' others said they were afraid of what an Obama administration might mean. 
 Some older residents, in whispers over lunch, said they worried that African-Americans like the Rev. Jesse Jackson would be given too much power in an Obama administration.
 Gertrude Weinberg, 91, head of the Wynmoor Democratic Club, said such views were common. ''They're not looking at the man as a whole,'' Ms. Weinberg said. ''They're looking at color.''
 At the same time, the Obama campaign has made blacks, who supported Mr. Obama by as much as nine to one in the primaries, an important component of its Florida strategy. 
 On Sunday, the rapper Jay-Z is to hold a free concert in Miami where organizers are asking Obama supporters to bring friends who are not yet registered to vote.
 The campaign has also recruited owners of 50 to 60 barber shops in South Florida, giving them voter registration forms to pass along to their patrons. 
 Steve Schale, Mr. Obama's Florida campaign manager, said the results statewide had been encouraging. ''We have 600,000 African-American voters who are registered to vote who did not vote in 2004,'' Mr. Schale said.
 Victory, though, most advisers and analysts agree, will be determined by whether Mr. Obama's supporters vote in the same proportions as Republicans. 
 Over the last few weeks, the Obama campaign has been battling false rumors that the state's so-called ''no match no vote law'' will keep people from casting ballots if the address on their driver's license does not match the address on the voting rolls. (Just the name and license number need to match, state election officials say.)
 Campaign volunteers were encouraging people to vote absentee or early to avoid problems. Some supporters were even arranging with as many as a dozen friends to drive older, poorer or disabled Democrats to the polls on Election Day. 
 It is exactly the kind of thing that Florida Republicans have used to get out the vote and win.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 9, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about signs that Senator Barack Obama is gaining support in Florida because of economic woes misstated the job history of Jim Piccillo, a former Republican who now volunteers for Mr. Obama. Mr. Piccillo says he was laid off while in a training program to become an assistant vice president at a bank; he was not, as he initially said, a bank vice president when he lost his job in August.

Senator John McCain is entering the final month of the presidential campaign with his prospects weakened by the nation's deepening financial crisis and persistent doubts about his choice of running mate, but his game plan is clear: sow doubts about Senator Barack Obama by portraying him as liberal and unready to lead.
 That strategy was on vivid display here Friday as Mr. McCain released an advertisement claiming that Mr. Obama was ''not truthful on taxes,'' told a crowd that Mr. Obama had ''the most liberal voting record in the U.S. Senate'' and falsely painted Mr. Obama's health care plan as a government-run system. 
 ''Senator Obama wants to stand between you and your family doctor,'' Mr. McCain said at a town-hall-style meeting. ''You watch.''
 But the day showed how difficult that effort would be. Mr. McCain hammered at Mr. Obama just hours after a report showed that the economy had lost 159,000 jobs in September, the ninth straight monthly decline. And the attention of the political world was still focused on Washington, where some Republican lawmakers were reversing their opposition to the bailout plan for the financial system, starving the presidential race of attention that could put Mr. McCain back in the spotlight.
 For several months, Republicans inside and outside the campaign have said Mr. McCain's best chance for victory was to make the campaign a referendum on Mr. Obama and raise questions about his readiness. Each day counts more and more in delivering that message, and each lost news cycle chips away at the McCain campaign's ability to overcome a deficit in the polls that has seemed to widen as the economic news has worsened. 
 Polls have shown that voters trust Mr. Obama more to handle the economy, and the fact that Mr. McCain is running to succeed an unpopular Republican president makes his path more difficult.
 ''We are looking at turning the page on this financial crisis and getting back to discussing Mr. Obama's liberal -- aggressively liberal -- record and how he will be too risky for the Americans,'' Greg Strimple, a senior adviser to the McCain campaign, said this week in a conference call with reporters.
 But doing so has its own complications. The performance of Mr. McCain's running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, in the debate Thursday might have reassured many Republicans, but after her rocky performance in recent interviews, the focus of the debate was much more on Ms. Palin than on Mr. Obama.
 On Friday, Ms. Palin returned to the campaign trail and tried to redirect the flurry of news media attention away from her and onto Mr. Obama's record.
 Ms. Palin said in an interview on the Fox News Channel that one of her regrets about her recent interviews on CBS News, in which she seemed ill-informed to many people, was that she had been unable to effectively press her case against Mr. Obama.
 ''I wanted to talk about Barack Obama increasing taxes, which would lead to killing jobs,'' Ms. Palin said on Fox. ''I wanted to talk about his proposal to increase government spending by another trillion dollars. Some of his comments that he has made about the war that I think may, in my world, disqualifies someone from consideration as the next commander in chief.''
 Mr. Obama, who was campaigning in Abington, Pa., questioned Ms. Palin's effort in the debate to portray his economic proposals as a ''job-killing plan.''
 ''I wonder if she turned on the news this morning,'' Mr. Obama said, noting the report on job losses. The crowd in the high school football stadium where he was speaking booed.
 ''So when Senator McCain and his running mate talk about job killing,'' Mr. Obama said, ''that's something they know a thing or two about, because the policies they've supported and are supporting are killing jobs every single day.''
 Mr. McCain's effort to regain the upper hand by portraying Mr. Obama as liberal and unprepared is not new. 
 He has run advertisements labeling Mr. Obama as a celebrity and other spots saying that Mr. Obama would raise taxes and that he had supported the teaching of sex education to kindergartners, which is false. And the Republican convention was dominated by speeches, some of them laced with sarcasm, that questioned Mr. Obama's readiness. An overwhelming majority of the advertisements that Mr. McCain is running this week attack Mr. Obama. 
 But some Republican strategists who once worked for Mr. McCain say that the attacks and false statements have weakened the brand he built over the years as a straight talker who lamented the bitterness of modern politics. More than half of the respondents in a New York Times/CBS News poll said late last month that Mr. McCain spent more time attacking Mr. Obama than explaining what he would do as president.
 And Mr. McCain finds himself playing defense in a growing number of states he had expected to carry easily.
 Aides to Mr. McCain said that they had only recently started advertising in some of those states, and that they were confident they could turn things around in states like Florida, Indiana, Missouri, North Carolina and Virginia that are crucial to their hopes for victory but where Mr. Obama has been showing strength in recent weeks.
 Mr. McCain said in Pueblo that he was looking forward to his debate with Mr. Obama on Tuesday. The face-off affords him a second chance to try to raise doubts about Mr. Obama, after Mr. Obama's performance in their first debate, on foreign policy, was well-received.
 ''I guarantee you, you're going to learn a lot about who's the liberal and who's the conservative,'' Mr. McCain said Friday, ''and who wants to raise your taxes and who wants to lower them, and who can secure, who can bring reform, prosperity and peace to America and the world. I can do that, my friends; I have a record. Senator Obama has the rhetoric, not the record.''

HEADLINE: Big Change at Hand, Political Pugilists Are Unusually Calm

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

DATELINE: New Yorkers relish a brawl 

 BODY:
and in a city filled with ambitious politicians, passionate activists and eager lawyers, it has never been hard to start one. 
 In 1968, the spark was the desegregation of public schools; in 1988, it was the proposal to abolish the all-powerful Board of Estimate; and in 1999, it was eligibility requirements to stay in homeless shelters. 
 But as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg tries to rewrite a voter-approved term limits law so he can seek a third term, most of the city's political class has so far responded with a collective shrug -- even though the mayor is reversing himself and, arguably, the will of the people. 
 A handful of City Council members have registered firm but polite disapproval. A candidate for mayor called it a ''back-room deal.'' And several good-government groups have vigorously wagged their fingers. 
 However tepid it is now, the opposition could snowball, becoming a meaningful obstacle to the mayor's strategy -- which is to quickly pass a law in the Council that allows dozens of elected officials to serve three four-year terms, instead of the current two.
 But the absence of serious pushback reveals much about the state of New York City politics under the reign of Mr. Bloomberg. 
 While his predecessors Rudolph W. Giuliani and Edward I. Koch became lightning rods who seemed to feed off controversy, Mr. Bloomberg has taken a different approach. 
 Political analysts and elected officials say that over the last seven years, the mayor's largely nonpartisan, inclusive brand of governance has weakened the influence of the traditional political parties, which had fueled many of the city's major battles. 
 The mayor's financial standing and willingness to use his own fortune to finance the city's civic, educational and cultural groups have at times discouraged dissent from those who rely on his financing, or may someday need it. 
 And his personal popularity across racial and class lines -- his approval rating hovers around 70 percent -- has made the city's elected leaders think twice about taking him on. Even many who angrily oppose the mayor's third-term bid acknowledge admiring him and his leadership. 
 ''The fact that he has tremendous good will across many sectors of this city has neutralized some of the outrage that people may have otherwise felt,'' said Dick Dadey, the executive director of Citizens Union, a government watchdog group that opposes Mr. Bloomberg's plan to change term limits in the Council. 
 Mr. Dadey predicts that the fight over altering the law ''will be a civil process.''
 There is growing evidence to support that view. 
 Major unions, a reliable ingredient in any city brawl, are taking a wait-and-see approach to the term limits issue. After Mr. Bloomberg said he would challenge the law, the head of the city's powerful teachers' union, Randi Weingarten, offered a carefully worded response, saying: ''We have to explore the pros and cons of changing, and of doing it in this kind of way, rather than putting it to the voters.''
 At crucial moments in New York's history, the City Council has served as a check against -- and a loud critic of -- the mayor's power. But this time, the self-interest of the mayor and that of many members of the Council are largely aligned: They are looking for a chance to remain in office longer. 
 The speaker of the City Council, Christine C. Quinn, who could easily block the term limits legislation, has instead hinted that she will shepherd it through, parroting Mr. Bloomberg's argument that the Council has the legal right to change term limits and that voters can render their verdict during elections. 
 In a press conference on Thursday notable for its deference to the mayor, Ms. Quinn said that ''checks and balances do not have to mean fights and arguments.''
 Several members of the Council are putting up a fight, however, like Bill de Blasio, a Brooklyn Democrat who has opposed any legislation that would revise term limits without a voter referendum. 
 Mr. de Blasio said those opposed to the change ''have a decent shot at defeating this.''
 But those close to the Council speaker and mayor say they believe they can cobble together the 26 votes needed to prevail in the 51-member Council. 
 Mark Green, the former public advocate who ran against Mr. Bloomberg for mayor in 2001, is trying to organize unions and civic groups against changing term limits. But even he said Mr. Bloomberg ''has the upper hand.''
 ''He is a popular, financially endowed incumbent,'' Mr. Green said. ''But he has picked a fight -- and there will be a fight.''
 Given the quick timetable that Mr. Bloomberg is envisioning -- he hopes to have a law changing term limits passed within several weeks -- there is little time for opponents to organize. 
 Their biggest hope was that Ronald S. Lauder, the billionaire cosmetics heir who opened his wallet to help pass the current term limits law in 1993, would fight Mr. Bloomberg's effort to roll the rule back. But Mr. Lauder now appears to be content to stay on the sidelines, after announcing that he supports a third term for Mr. Bloomberg -- despite some confusion about whether he would embrace a permanent extension of the law, as the mayor is envisioning. 
 Even if several groups do wage a public relations battle against Mr. Bloomberg and the Council, it is unclear whether the public will rally behind it. 
 The day that Mr. Bloomberg announced his intention to change term limits, he attended a breakfast for small-business people in Queens. Outside the event, a lone protester, Robert Williams, held up a handmade sign that said ''Vote No to a Third Term.''
 Mr. Williams, 40, said that he had voted for Mr. Bloomberg twice, but supported the current term limits. ''No politician,'' he said, ''should have a job for life.''
 But back inside the breakfast gathering, hundreds of people appeared to feel differently. They cheered loudly when the event's host urged Mr. Bloomberg to seek a third term, and shouted, ''Four more years!''
 Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban policy at New York University and a former adviser to Mr. Bloomberg, said that New Yorkers were, by and large, happy with how the mayor has run the city -- and how the city itself runs. 
 ''The city is safe, race relations are even-tempered, and the economy, until very recently, was going strong,'' he said. ''There is a very different political climate in New York City today than there has been before.''

HEADLINE: Envisioning a Way To Help Homeless Vets

BYLINE: By JOE WOJTAS

 BODY:
THE LaFlamme-Kusek American Legion Post in Jewett City is trying to do something that just a handful of the world's almost 15,000 Legion posts have ever done.
 The post and its 167 members have applied for a $5.2 million Connecticut Housing Finance Authority loan to build 18 one-bedroom apartments for homeless and disabled veterans. The group plans to renovate two floors of the 19th-century brick building it owns on South Main Street into eight apartments and then construct a connected building next door with 10 more units.
 Members hope to receive the loan in November and open the apartments next fall. 
 The project is the dream of William Czmyr, the post's finance director, who is the president of the organization set up to head the project. ''I've been looking into this for years. I've always said I'd like to get it renovated and put veterans in there. There are so many of them that have no place to live,'' he said.
 According to literature from the post, it is estimated that nationally, as many as one in four people who are homeless have served in the armed forces. In addition, there is evidence that the problems associated with homelessness are even more complicated for veterans. This is because a large number of them live with the lingering effects of post traumatic stress disorder and substance abuse, and their military training and experience are often not transferable to jobs in the civilian workplace. 
 According to a Department of Veterans Affairs report, more than a half-million veterans are homeless at some point during the year. The post pointed out, however, that department programs reach only 20 percent of those in need.
 Joe March, director of public relations at the American Legion's national headquarters, welcomed the project.
 ''It's a great thing when one of our posts is reaching out that way to the homeless,'' he said.
 Joe Sharpe, the legion's deputy director for economics, pointed out the legion has a host of programs to address the homeless problem for veterans. ''It's a huge issue for us,'' he said. 
 Mr. Sharpe said just a few posts around the country, though, have been able to provide housing for veterans. One of those is in Pennsylvania, where a statewide legion group has six homes that house 16 veterans. 
 Members of the post kicked off their fund-raising efforts this summer with a spaghetti supper. Mr. Czmyr said he hoped to approach the legion's three million members as well as the several million Veterans of Foreign Wars and Amvets members for donations to help pay for the project.
 ''If they all just give us a dollar or two,'' he said. ''We're not asking for the impossible, just a few dollars.''
 Mr. Czmyr said the eastern part of Connecticut especially needs the housing because of its large number of veterans, many of whom served in the Navy. The Naval Submarine Base is located in Groton. Mr. Czmyr said the Department of Veterans Affairs does not help finance permanent housing like the one planned by his group, just transitional housing where veterans can stay a maximum of two years.
 State Senator Andrew Maynard, whose district includes Jewett City, said there could be some additional state funding to help pay for the project. Mr. Maynard, who is the Senate chairman of the legislature's Select Committee on Veterans Affairs, said he was pleased by the grassroots effort. 
 ''They're doing something really special, and maybe it's something that can be replicated in other places,'' he said. 
 Mr. Maynard said such housing may be needed even more with veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. He also said that was why adequate counseling was needed to head off the problems that can turn into unemployment and homelessness for veterans. Counseling and other support services would be part of the package in the Jewett City project. Case managers from nonprofit agencies would be in the building to help tenants with life skills and money management, crisis intervention and work and family issues, said Mr. Czmyr. Veterans would be referred to organizations that can provide medical care, mental health and substance abuse counseling as well as job placement and education. 
 While the Jewett City post will not only have to pay off the mortgage but raise money to pay for costs not covered by the rent payments, Mr. Czmyr remains undeterred. 
 ''I've just talked to a lot of people,'' he said. ''They say we can do this.''

HEADLINE: Rentals Remain Robust

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
RIGHT now, the housing market in New Jersey is being described by those in the know as ''stable,'' ''vital'' and ''trending upward.'' The rental market, that is.
 The overall occupancy rate for rental buildings in the state is currently 97 percent, reported Jose Cruz of Cushman & Wakefield, which provides advice to real estate investors. Given the persistent stress on the home-buying market, Mr. Cruz said, the high rental occupancy rate is expected to stay where it is for the immediate future, or perhaps even tighten further.
 Perhaps not coincidentally, monthly costs for renters are steadily rising -- at an average pace of 4 percent to nearly 7 percent a year, according to various analysts' calculations. Cushman projects that average monthly rent for all of 2008 will be up by 6.8 percent over 2007 (rising to $1,541 by year's end, from $1,443 last year). 
 Developers like these statistics so much that many are pressing forward with new multifamily rental projects, at a time that many condominium projects are being tabled or shelved.
 AvalonBay Communities, a national developer and owner of exclusively rental buildings, is setting out to expand its presence in New Jersey ''in any way possible,'' said its state division chief, Ron Ladell. ''These are definitely boom times for us here.'' 
 AvalonBay, which owns 3,850 rental apartments in 12 New Jersey communities, will break ground this month on a 164-unit rental complex with attached retailing in North Bergen.
 It also recently took over as the lead developer of the 406 rental units and adjacent retail space proposed at Westmont Station in Wood-Ridge. 
 The Westmont project was created by Somerset Development, and is still planned to include more than 800 residential units and a new rail station. But until AvalonBay stepped in, a lack of financing had stalled progress for about two years. Construction is set to start in January.
 The Value Companies, another large player in New Jersey's rental market, is a month away from opening 140 Mayhill, a 158-unit complex in Saddle Brook in Bergen County. It anticipates a quick lease-up. ''People there are desperate for new quality rentals,'' said Andrew Abramson, the company's president. ''I've been in the business 55 years, and this is as good a time for rentals as I've seen.''
 In Hoboken, the Tarragon Corporation has begun marketing several hundred new rental units at an amenity-laden building called 800 Madison. It is the sixth residential building at the Upper Grand development on the city's west side. Two older buildings are condos, but the others are rentals.
 At 800 Madison, monthly rents will range from $2,375 to $5,495, for one-, two- and three-bedroom units of differing sizes and configurations. Those rates are steep, considering that the complex is not near the waterfront -- and only months ago, they were not quite as high.
 Last summer, Tarragon was offering leases ranging from $2,250 to $5,000 a month. Cushman's market analyst, Mr. Cruz, noted that Tarragon was following the pattern it had established when another building, 1000 Madison, opened last year at Upper Grand. ''At first, Tarragon figured on charging $2.80 per square foot, but they ended up leasing at $3.15 per square foot'' because demand was strong.
 Still, this won't continue indefinitely, said Jeffrey G. Otteau, whose Otteau Valuation Group keeps tabs on the residential market for many builders and brokers.
 ''The number of units in the pipeline in the state is, well, dramatic,'' said Mr. Otteau, adding that, in fact, it was already time to start thinking about the issue of overbuilding. 
 If the supply of rental housing grows too fast, it will meet or even outstrip demand, and the market will stall -- exactly as it now has stalled for condominiums, to the detriment of various projects in northern New Jersey.
 Looking just at downtown Jersey City, where city officials have encouraged a raft of new residential projects, a total of 5,122 rental units, at 22 different sites, are under construction. 
 Another 8,533 units, at 46 construction projects, have been approved by Jersey City officials for the downtown area, so that developers could proceed with them at any time.
 Projects can certainly be switched from condo to rental, or vice versa, even after construction has begun, and plans can be dropped along the way, several New Jersey developers pointed out.
 Mr. Otteau agreed that it was unlikely that all 13,655 rental apartments would hit the market within the next few years in downtown Jersey City.
 ''Still,'' he said, ''it's a general caution to keep in mind.''
 Several developers -- including Michael Barry, a principal with the Applied Development Company based in Hoboken -- said the demand for rental units was much greater than the supply, and would stay that way for some time.
 ''Even now, with the overall economic uncertainties and people on Wall Street losing their jobs, the demand is holding up -- and certainly could increase, for that same reason,'' said Mr. Barry, whose company's high-end rental properties in Hoboken, Jersey City and Long Branch have consistently been fully rented. ''We see more people who have the ability to buy a home nonetheless choosing to stay on the sidelines, and rent, until things settle down.'' 
 Mr. Abramson, of the Value Companies, which is based in Clifton, said his company had seen a surge of interest in its rental properties recently, as it became clear that the days of subprime mortgage lending were truly over. 
 ''There is a now a whole new class of potential renters -- those who were incorrectly granted mortgages in the past,'' Mr. Abramson said. ''Those people are permanently out of the for-sale market, and will never get mortgage financing. Whether they like it or not, they are renters for life -- and some appear to have realized it.''
 In the first two weeks of September at Value's 903-unit Gateways at Randolph complex, Mr. Abramson said, the number of inquiries concerning available apartments suddenly jumped by 50 percent.

HEADLINE: Minding the Inequality Gap

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KOTKIN

 BODY:
DURING the first 70 years of the 20th century, inequality declined and Americans prospered together. Over the last 30 years, by contrast, the United States developed the most unequal distribution of income and wages of any high-income country.
 Some analysts see the gulf between the rich and the rest as an incentive for strivers, or as just the way things are. Others see it as having a corrosive effect on people's faith in the markets and democracy. Still others contend that economic polarization is a root cause of America's political polarization. Could, and should, something be done? 
 Claudia Goldin and Lawrence F. Katz, two Harvard economists, think yes. Their book, ''The Race Between Education and Technology'' (Harvard, $39.95), contains many tables, a few equations and a powerfully told story about how and why the United States became the world's richest nation -- namely, thanks to its schools.
 The authors skillfully demonstrate that for more than a century, and at a steady rate, technological breakthroughs -- the mass production system, electricity, computers -- have been increasing the demand for ever more educated workers. And, they show, America's school system met this demand, not with a national policy, but in grassroots fashion, as communities taxed themselves and built schools and colleges.
 Beginning in the 1970s, however, the education system failed to keep pace, resulting, Ms. Goldin and Mr. Katz contend, in a sharply unequal nation. 
 The authors allow that a decline in union membership and in the inflation-adjusted minimum wage also contributed to the shift in who partook of a growing pie. But they rule out the usual suspects -- globalization (trade) and high immigration -- as significant causes of rising inequality. Amid the current calls to restrict executive compensation, their policy prescription is to have more Americans graduate from college.
 If only it were that easy.
 The authors' argument is really two books in one. One offers an incisive history of American education, especially the spread of the public high school and the state university system. It proves to be an uplifting tale of public commitment and open access. The authors remind us that the United States long remained ''the best poor man's country.'' A place where talent could rise.
 The other story rigorously measures the impact of education on income. The authors' compilation of hard data on educational attainment according to when people were born is an awesome achievement, though not always a gripping read.
 They show that by the 1850s, America's school enrollment rate already ''exceeded that of any other nation.'' And this lead held for a long time. By 1960, some 70 percent of Americans graduated from high school -- far above the rate in any other country. College graduation rates also rose appreciably.
 In the marketplace, such educational attainment was extremely valuable, but it didn't produce wide economic disparity so long as more people were coming to the job market with education. The wage premium -- or differential paid to people with a high school or a college education -- fell between 1915 and 1950.
 But more recently, high school graduation rates flatlined at around 70 percent. American college attendance rose, though college graduation rates languished. The upshot is that while the average college graduate in 1970 earned 45 percent more than high school graduates, the differential three decades later exceeds 80 percent.
 ''In the first half of the century,'' the authors summarize, ''education raced ahead of technology, but later in the century technology raced ahead of educational gains.'' 
 Proving that the demand for and supply of educated workers began not in the time of Bill Gates but in the era of Thomas Edison is virtuoso social science. But wasn't a slowdown in rising educational attainment unavoidable? After all, it's one thing to increase the average years of schooling by leaps and bounds when most people start near zero, but quite another when the national average is already high. 
 The authors reject the idea that the United States has reached some natural limit in educational advances. Other countries are now at higher levels. 
 What, then, is holding American youth back? 
 The authors give a two-part answer. For one thing, the financial aid system is a maze. More important, many people with high school diplomas are not ready for college. 
 The second problem, the authors write, is concentrated mostly in inner-city schools. Because the poor cannot easily move to better school districts, the authors allow that charter schools as well as vouchers, including those for private schools, could be helpful, but more evaluation is necessary. 
 Data on the effects of preschool are plentiful, and point to large returns on investment, so the authors join the chorus in extolling Head Start, the federal government's largest preschool program. 
 Providing more children with a crucial start, along with easier ways to find financial aid, are laudable national objectives. One suspects, though, that the obstacles to getting more young people into and through college have to do with knotty social and cultural issues.
 BUT assume that the authors' policies would raise the national college graduation rate. Would that deeply reduce inequality?
 Averages can be deceptive. Most of the gains of the recent flush decades have not gone to the college-educated as a whole. The top 10 or 20 percent by income have education levels roughly equivalent to those in the top 1 percent, but the latter account for much of the boom in inequality. This appears to be related to the way taxes have been cut, and to the ballooning of the financial industry's share of corporate profits.
 It remains to be seen how a reconfigured financial industry and possible new tax policies might affect the 30-year trend toward greater inequality.
 In the meantime, it is nice to be reminded, in a data-rich book, that greater investments in human capital once put Americans collectively on top of the world.

HEADLINE: A Consultant's Life: Risk, Yes. Structure, No.

BYLINE: By EILENE ZIMMERMAN. 
E-mail: ccouch@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Q. You've always worked for others but now feel ready to strike out on your own as an independent consultant. Are you cut out for it?
 A. Compared with corporate workers who take direction from a boss and receive regular paychecks, consultants lead lives with much less structure and much more risk. You need to know whether you can handle a new level of uncertainty and self-direction. 
 Before you decide to take the plunge, understand that consulting doesn't always provide consistent income. 
 ''You may have the best-laid plans, but you still don't know when you will land that first client, or when your income will become regular,'' said Edith Onderick-Harvey, president of Change Dynamics Consulting, a leadership development firm in Andover, Mass. Also realize that you will need to spend a significant amount of time marketing your skills.
 ''Sometimes 75 percent of your time will be spent selling yourself and often that's just networking, not even real job opportunities,'' Ms. Onderick-Harvey said.
 Successful consultants are very self-motivated and nimble, said Bradford Agry, founding partner of CareerTeam Partners, a career management consulting firm in New York.
 ''Most people are used to working in a job that has a specific description,'' he said. ''But your consultancy is going to unfold and change, so you need to be flexible.'' 
 Q.How far in advance of leaving your job should you begin planning your move, and what should you do during that time?
 A. Plan on six months to a year to lay the groundwork for your consulting business. Building a network of contacts is crucial during this time, said Linda Stewart, the chief executive of Epoch, which helps find projects for independent consultants in financial services. That network includes friends, colleagues, business associates, vendors and clients. 
 Write a business plan that establishes how revenue will be generated and how you will handle sales, marketing, finance, operations, expenses and fees, Ms. Stewart said. 
 Meet with an accountant and a lawyer, who can advise you about what kind of entity to form -- like a limited liability company or a corporation -- and about the tax implications of each. Legal advice will also help ensure that the work you do as an independent contractor doesn't subject you to any personal liability, said Jay A. Zweig, a partner specializing in employment law with the Bryan Cave firm in Phoenix. 
 ''One thing that is absolutely critical is to develop a standard engagement letter stating that a particular company is hiring you as an independent contractor and this is how and when you will be compensated,'' Mr. Zweig said.
 Q. What kind of financial cushion should you have before leaving your job to become a consultant?
 A. Depending on whether you have a partner or spouse helping to pay the bills, you should have 6 to 12 months of living expenses in the bank. Make sure you have a clear understanding of both your personal and business-related financial obligations, Ms. Onderick-Harvey said. 
 ''Working out of your home may mean low overhead costs,'' she said, ''but you need things like office equipment, phone lines, business stationery, I.T. services, health insurance and professional malpractice insurance.'' 
 Q.Is it advisable to become a consultant during an economic downturn?
 A. A downturn isn't necessarily a bad time to be working on your own, provided that you have a realistic understanding of your market. But your financial cushion is even more important because it could take longer to establish a steady income stream.
 Q.If you've been laid off, is that a good time to become a consultant?
 A. If your severance package allows you the time to make the transition properly, yes. But you still need to evaluate your skills, personality type, income requirements and risk tolerance, Ms. Stewart said.
 The decision to become a consultant should never be a knee-jerk reaction, said Ms. Onderick-Harvey, especially if you have a small severance package. 
 Q. When you are starting out, how do you obtain clients?
 A. Begin with your network. Systematically send e-mail -- then follow up with phone calls -- to everyone you know who might need your services or be able to refer you to a potential client.
 Approach larger consulting firms in your industry and let them know you are interested in working as a subcontractor when they need extra help, Ms. Stewart said. You can also work with contract staffing firms that can act as a broker and connect you with projects. 
 Q.It's troubling that the term ''consultant'' often has a negative connotation. Why is that? 
 A. Consulting gets a bad rap because there is no barrier to entry, said Alan Weiss, president of the Summit Consulting Group, a management consulting firm in East Greenwich, R.I., and author of ''Million Dollar Consulting.''
 ''There is a lot of schlock in the field,'' he said, ''but the greatest companies in the world use consultants because they know they need them.''

HEADLINE: Change and Outrage At the Bus Station That Time Forgot

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
The old men stood inside the George Washington Bridge Bus Station on Saturday morning, waiting. They waited not for a bus but, in a sense, a horse. The Off-Track Betting parlor was opening in about an hour.
 Joseph Sanchez, 71, sat in the bus station's barbershop, reading the paper. He waited, too, though not for a haircut or a bus but for the OTB as well. ''You lose,'' shrugged Mr. Sanchez, a retired carpenter at a now-shuttered elevator company. ''You cannot win.''
 The bus station, in the Washington Heights neighborhood in northern Manhattan, is the kind of place that people forget is a bus station. Waiting for a bus, you could get a haircut at the three-chair barbershop, buy a candy bar at one of several newsstands, take out a loan at the Neighborhood Trust Federal Credit Union, get a new pair of eyeglasses at the optometrist or get your teeth cleaned at the dental offices of Howard Bloom and Steve Kaufman. 
 Sitting on one of the metal benches outside the optometrist's office, watching the well-fed pigeons that sneak in and wobble or fly around, listening to the rapid-fire Spanish of neighborhood old-timers killing time on the benches with you: such is the drowsy life at Manhattan's other bus terminal.
 In any other city, the station -- about five million people on 300,000 buses passed through it last year -- would be a thriving transit hub. But it has never escaped the shadow of the Port Authority Bus Terminal, the world's busiest, about eight miles south in Midtown. And so the George Washington Bridge station at Broadway and West 178th Street, a sprawling structure with triangular, concrete wings lining the roof, has become an overlooked spot on the New York grid.
 The three-level bus station opened in 1963, and it shows: Anyone who wonders where all the pay phones in New York City have gone should wonder no more. The main concourse swelters in the summertime because there is no buildingwide air-conditioning. Ceiling tiles in the men's room are missing, and, outside of the horse races, its primary economic engines appear to be lottery tickets and 95-cent coffee.
 Washington Heights residents have been frequenting this unpolished site for decades, taking an occasional bus to New Jersey, but mostly sitting, socializing, shopping, sleeping. Mr. Sanchez has been a bus station and OTB regular for 20 years. ''Passing the time, you know what I mean?'' he said.
 Yet change is soon coming to this unchanged place.
 The station will undergo a $152 million renovation in a deal approved on Thursday by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's board of commissioners. The renovation will expand the retail space and increase the number of buses that can use the station. As part of the deal, the station's current tenants will be forced to move out. 
 The station has about a dozen tenants, and owners and workers at some of the businesses on Saturday expressed uncertainty and frustration over the planned renovation. 
 No one was sure how long they would be able to stay open. Some were skeptical that the renovation would become a reality, saying that the Port Authority had been talking about overhauling the building for years, to no avail. Others said they were angry at the Port Authority for what they called its failure to include them in the redevelopment and its failure to keep them informed of the plans.
 ''They just want to get rid of us, all the small guys,'' said one business owner who asked that his name not be used, for fear of retribution. ''They never did the right thing for the building. They've really taken care of this building as a stepchild.''
 Altagracia Guzman, 78, passes through every day. Ms. Guzman, who has lived in Washington Heights for four decades, was one of the first customers at the credit union. The eyeglasses she wears, she said proudly, were made at the optometrist. 
 ''This is like a family place,'' she said, adding that she was angry that the small businesses were being forced out. ''It's not fair. I repeat it in front of the president of the United States: It's not fair.''
 The station, connected to the George Washington Bridge by ramps, is a point of arrival and departure for commuters from northern New Jersey and Rockland County, Atlantic City gamblers and city children bound for summer camp in upstate New York. It replaced several bus loading areas when it opened in 1963, but its popularity waned with the expansion of the Port Authority Bus Terminal in the early 1980s.
 Homeless people congregated at the station in the middle of the night in the 1980s, giving the bus station a seedy aura that has never quite lifted. It remains the kind of place that needs to make it clear, in a long list of rules posted on the walls at the entrances, that bathing, shaving and spitting are not allowed, and neither are urinating and defecating anywhere ''other than a urinal or toilet.''
 In recent years, the Port Authority made a number of improvements, renovating bathrooms and installing new windows, lighting and seats. The authority had even started playing classical music throughout the station. But plans to build a 12-screen, 2,800-seat movie theater on top of the roof of the station in 1999 fell through.
 There are attractions, or items that come close to that. Along one wall is a strange sight for a bus station: a maritime exhibit, featuring handwritten notes by an ocean liner historian and a black-and-white picture of the Queen Elizabeth docking in New York City in 1958. There is a bust of O. H. Ammann, the designer of the George Washington Bridge, but no prominent display honoring Pier Luigi Nervi, the man who designed the station. 
 Mr. Nervi, an Italian engineer and architect known for his dramatic use of reinforced concrete, helped design Italy's first skyscraper, the Pirelli Building in Milan.
 Every few minutes on Saturday, not far from Mr. Ammann's frozen gaze, a loud clatter of voices filled the main concourse. The men watching the races at the OTB yelled and cheered and cursed. All was quiet, meanwhile, outside the office of Drs. Kaufman and Bloom.
 The dentist office opened in 1973. Dr. Kaufman arrived in 1979 and Dr. Bloom in 1984. The two dentists see about 100 patients a week. They do not have to travel far to see their handiwork. Some of their patients are toll collectors on the bridge.

HEADLINE: A Man of Many Talents, Eager to Use Them All

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN

 BODY:
EARLY this summer Caleb Burhans cleared his performance calendar for the first time since 2001, when he graduated from the Eastman School of Music in Rochester and moved to New York City. He wasn't taking a vacation, exactly. Lincoln Center and Alarm Will Sound, a new-music orchestra in which he plays violin, had commissioned him to write a work to be performed in March as part of the reopening festivities at Alice Tully Hall, and Mr. Burhans resolved to do nothing but compose. 
 Well, sort of. He set aside his weekly bread-and-butter job, singing as a countertenor in the Trinity Choir on Sunday mornings, and turned down pickup orchestra gigs. 
 But at the Bang on a Can Marathon in June, he played his ''No,'' for violin and electronics, and performed with Alarm Will Sound and another new-music group, Signal. He also performed with Signal at the Ojai Music Festival in California. And in a three-day stretch in August, in New York, he sang with two chamber choirs (also conducting one of them), played and sang in a pop theater piece and gave a concert with itsnotyouitsme, his ambient rock duo. 
 And when his Sept. 1 deadline arrived, the industrious Mr. Burhans not only had completed his work for Lincoln Center, ''oh ye of little faith ... (do you know where your children are?),'' but had started two more pieces as well. 
 At 28, Mr. Burhans has pursued a career path so logical that it seems almost foolproof. Just sing, compose and master several instruments (besides the violin he plays viola, guitar, bass, keyboards and percussion) and the New York freelance world is your oyster. But this is a new development. Until recently, the conventional wisdom went, musicians with diverse talents should specialize: decide whether they are better suited to composing or performing, singing or playing an instrument, working in classical music or a variety of pop. 
 And while most young musicians still make the traditional choices and scramble to find work in freelance ensembles until they have established themselves as recitalists or chamber players, others are seeking to diversify. Mr. Burhans's generation is the third to come of age during the rock era, and where conservatories once taught only classical music, most now offer courses and even degrees in jazz and rock, recording technology and the music industry itself. And musicians who grew up hearing everything from Mozart and Ligeti to Wilco and Radiohead are less inclined than their elders to compartmentalize their passions. 
 ''I was always told, when I was a kid, that you have to decide at some point what it is you want to do,'' Mr. Burhans said one afternoon early in his composing break. ''And I thought, that's cool. I'm going to school and study violin, viola and composition, and I'm playing in jazz and rock bands, and when I move to New York, that will decide it for me. People will see what I'm best at, and that's what I'm going to do. 
 ''But when I got here, I actually did the opposite. I kept doing them all, and I love it. The variety keeps me on my toes, creatively.'' 
 A film about Mr. Burhans would be a cross between ''Zelig'' and ''Amadeus.'' In New York's trendy new-music world, he is everywhere, working with just about everybody as both performer and composer. His name stands out on a roster, and if you've heard him as a violinist, guitarist, bassist or mandolinist in a new-music group, it can be puzzling to find him listed among the choristers at Trinity Church or as a member of the disco band Escort or the techno ensemble Bleknlok. 
 But there's no mistaking him. He's the one with the short, sometimes spiky hair, retro eyeglasses, black nail polish and earring. 
 As new as Mr. Burhans's career approach is, he is hardly an anomaly. Seven other musicians in Alarm Will Sound also compose. Several have rock bands as well. And the number of musicians with fingers in both classical and pop seems to be growing.
 Lev Zhurbin, a young violist and composer who works under the name Ljova, has largely given up his chamber ensemble jobs now that his composing career has taken off. He performs most often with his genre-crossing ensembles, the Kontraband and Romashka, both of which draw on classical pop and world music. 
 Christina Courtin, a Juilliard-trained violinist, plays in orchestras but is also a pop singer-songwriter with her own band and an album coming from Nonesuch. And Brooklyn Rider, a string quartet that sometimes accompanies Ms. Courtin -- and that, like Ms. Courtin, plays in the Knights, a chamber orchestra -- performs a repertory that tilts toward new music, sometimes with multicultural strands. 
 ''Playing different kinds of music is something young musicians increasingly have to do,'' said Justin Kantor, a 29-year-old cellist and the proprietor of Le Poisson Rouge, a new Greenwich Village club that offers both pop and classical performances. ''And besides, it's fun.'' 
 Role models are few for musical switch-hitters. Leonard Bernstein, who balanced conducting, composing, piano playing and multimedia lecturing, is one. So are Steve Reich and Philip Glass, who early in their careers revived the 19th-century notion of the touring composer-performer, leading their own ensembles in programs devoted to their works when there was no other way to get them played. 
 ''My goal (when I was 14) was to move to NYC and play/sing for Philip,'' Mr. Burhans wrote in an e-mail message. ''That didn't really work out (I work with Steve Reich instead, which is cool by me ...) but I've always held up Philip and Steve as models of the do-it-yourself way of approaching music.'' 
 But in an interview a few weeks later, he noted a significant difference between himself and those composers.
 ''It's different for me because I thrive on doing other people's music as well as my own. And if I didn't have those outlets, I don't know what my music would be like. I'm so influenced by other things around me. It's nice to know I'm singing in a church service in the morning, and I'm playing with a rock band at night.'' 
 The catholicity of Mr. Burhans's listening habits is something he has in common with an increasing number of musicians of his generation. Classical musicians who grew up in the 1960s and '70s may have listened to rock and played jazz in their off hours, but those influences didn't inform their performing lives. One reason was that ''crossover'' projects, which sought to link pop and classical music, were regarded as both unhip and inept by listeners on both sides. The doorways between the repertories were few. 
 But by the time Mr. Burhans came of age, he noticed even at a considerable distance from New York that the downtown Manhattan indie rock scene had links to avant-garde artists and composers. And from his point of view, as both a listener and a player, the boundaries between avant-garde rock and avant-garde classical seemed invitingly porous. 
 The varied musical life that Mr. Burhans leads is evident to anyone visiting his studio, a sunny, instrument-filled room in his Washington Heights apartment. A book of Mr. Glass's piano works sits on an electric piano along one wall. And on music stands to either side of a selection of guitars, violins (Baroque, modern and electric), a mandolin and two violas (also Baroque and modern), Mr. Burhans has a book of Bach sonatas, Mr. Reich's ''Violin Phase'' and works by Biber, Paganini, Ysae, Xenakis and John Adams, as well as a couple of his own pieces. 
 On the floor toward the center of the room, Mr. Burhans has a Casio sampler and a collection of electronic pedals, which he uses to make loops: recordings of musical passages that repeat continually. In some of his music, shifting loop sequences form a backdrop against which melodies unfold. 
 Sitting at his computer, Mr. Burhans played a handful of his loops, some of which he uses as they are, in spacey, meditative (or at times, rambunctious) electronic works; others are radically transformed. A plaintive, minor-key violin and bass loop was the basis of a haunting choral setting, ''Nunc Dimittis'' (2004), written for a church in Rochester and also performed at Trinity; the new piece for Alarm Will Sound and Alice Tully Hall is partly based on a loop as well. 
 Playing several instruments and being drawn to most musical styles is in Mr. Burhans's DNA. His father, Ron Burhans, was a guitarist and bassist who toured as a sideman with Ray Charles, the Everly Brothers and Kenny Rogers. After he gave up touring, he worked as a one-man party band, with a repertory of about 3,000 songs and a setup that included MIDI guitars, bass pedals, a drum machine and a vocal harmonizer. (He died when Caleb was 17.)
 ''I've tried to figure out how Caleb ended up the way he did,'' his mother, Venus Burhans, said. ''I would say part of it was modeling from his father, who as a musician did not try to peg himself as just rock 'n' roll. He was ready with all the country songs, the classics or whatever was out there, basically so that he could work and put food on the table. We could see that the more versatile you were, the more marketable you were. So Caleb was always around music. His dad had all his equipment set up in the middle of the living room, and whenever he was away from it, Caleb would run up to the microphone and sing into it.'' 
 Mr. Burhans also got a sense of a musician's itinerant lifestyle early on. He was born in Monterey, Calif., in 1980, and lived briefly in Chiloquin, Ore., before moving to Houston and then to Janesville, Wis. He began his musical studies in Houston, when his second-grade music teacher persuaded him to join the Spring Branch Boys Choir; soon after, he was drafted into a production of ''The Pirates of Penzance'' as Buttercup and discovered that he liked the attention. 
 He was also -- haltingly at first -- becoming interested in instruments. He turned down his father's offer of guitar lessons and gave up the flute after a week before becoming fascinated with the violin. His parents resisted his pleas for a violin at first, but when the family moved to Wisconsin and Mr. Burhans was still clamoring for a fiddle, they gave in. 
 ''I didn't listen to any classical music until I started playing the violin,'' Mr. Burhans said. ''I discovered Mozart and the Beatles in the same year, when I was 9. I came one day and said, 'Could you guys get me a Mozart tape?' And my parents weren't sure why, but they got me one. I was listening to Mozart, Beethoven and Bach, and then Philip Glass. Before Stravinsky or Bartok. It made sense, because I grew up with 1980s rock, which is very compressed, and then there was Mozart, with those Alberti basses that are almost like the arpeggio sound in Glass, so when I first heard Philip's music, it made total sense. It wasn't until I was 15 or 16 that I began listening to Ligeti, Xenakis, Ravi Shakar and Aphex Twin. And I was, like, 'Wow, this is all great.' '' 
 Having discovered his diverse group of musical favorites, Mr. Burhans continued to sing in choirs and joined two professional local orchestras when he was 13. He also played and sang in punk and jazz bands. He studied piano for a while, getting as far as the Beethoven concertos before deciding to give it up to spend more time composing. When he made that decision, he also asked his parents to remove the television and Nintendo game from his bedroom so that he wouldn't be distracted by them. 
 Summers, he attended music camps, including Interlochen in Michigan, where he also spent a year preparing for conservatory auditions. Among the musicians he came to know there was his future wife, Martha Cluver, then a violinist and violist, now a soprano who often works with Mr. Reich, John Zorn and other composers. 
 ''We've known each other since we were 11,'' said Ms. Cluver, who grew up in Fort Atkinson, Wis., 30 minutes from Janesville. ''We had the same violin teacher. Even before I 'liked' him, I thought he was this genius.''
 Ms. Cluver and Mr. Burhans both completed their music degrees at the Eastman School, where they became involved with Ossia, a new-music orchestra from which a group of graduating students -- including Mr. Burhans and Alan Pierson, the conductor -- formed Alarm Will Sound in 2001. 
 ''I encountered Caleb when he was a freshman,'' Mr. Pierson said, ''but I had heard about him before I met him. A friend of mine who had been at Interlochen mentioned that there was a phenomenal violinist coming to Eastman. When we were planning an all-Ligeti program in 1998, we were looking for a violinist. One of my friends, walking across the campus, ran into this kid looking at the score for the Ligeti Piano Concerto and thought, that has to be Caleb. We auditioned him, and he quickly became an important part of the new-music scene.'' 
 Mr. Burhans took a job as a substitute in the Rochester Philharmonic, which was sometimes rocky. Once, when Mr. Burhans turned up at a rehearsal with his hair dyed purple, the orchestra's managing director asked him to do something about it before the concert. Mr. Burhans turned up in a witch's wig, cut short. The next week he tried to dye his hair a conventional red, but because of the purple die, it came out crimson, so he shaved his head. 
 ''I found out that one of the trumpet players was going around saying that I was making a mockery of classical music because my hair was purple,'' Mr. Burhans said. ''And I had a really intense conversation with the managing director, where I said: 'You know, I'm just trying to help classical music, because if we don't get more people like me coming to these concerts, this orchestra is going to die. The only people who are coming are old people, and you're shooting yourself in the foot.' And he said: 'Yeah, you're right. Sorry.'
 ''But I made a sign that said, 'I Make a Mockery of Classical Music' and started wearing it around.'' 
 Mr. Burhans had decided by then that one of the brass rings of a traditional classical music career -- a seat in a major symphony orchestra -- was not for him. That was a big decision: jobs at the top orchestras are scarce, but the base pay at several now tops $100,000. (At smaller orchestras around the country, the schedules are sparser and salaries can be around $25,000. Some musicians cobble together a living by splitting their services among several orchestras in adjoining states, which means driving hundreds of miles between jobs.) Playing in freelance ensembles and chamber groups, to say nothing of composing, though more attractive to musicians of Mr. Burhans's interests, is more financially precarious. 
 When Mr. Burhans and Ms. Cluver graduated from Eastman, they considered moving to Boston but opted for New York. The decision was made carefully, with the advice of friends who were pursuing careers. New York remains the most vibrant center of classical music performance in the United States, and it offers the most freelance opportunities. 
 Even so, it's hard for a conservatory graduate to hit the ground running, and Mr. Burhans and Ms. Cluver lived on credit cards at first before landing choral jobs at Trinity Church in downtown Manhattan. The jobs remain the basis of Mr. Burhans and Ms. Cluver's household economy, although they now both pursue a crowded schedule of freelance jobs as well.
 But lately Mr. Burhans has been wondering whether the cacophonous variety of his career is a double-edged sword. 
 ''I know Caleb is confused about this sometimes,'' Ms. Cluver said. ''He thinks about focusing more on composing or on his band itsnotyouitsme. But then all these other opportunities come up, and he gets really excited about them. He's just so talented, it's hard for him to pick and choose. With me, I'm just focusing on singing, and he's told me, 'I'm jealous of you, because you know what you're doing.' But I don't. He's the one who knows what he's doing. And most of the time, he's happy staying busy.'' 
 His success has not dulled his wry, sometimes self-deprecating humor. ''When I was in school,'' he said, ''my grandmother asked me what I wanted to do. And I said, 'I'm going to move to New York and freelance.' She said: 'What do you mean? Don't you want to be in an orchestra?' So I said, 'No, I want to live from paycheck to paycheck and not have health insurance.' She was terrified: 'Oh, my God!' And here I am, living paycheck to paycheck and not having health insurance. I'm fulfilling my dream.''

HEADLINE: Her City's Not Gone, and Neither Is She

BYLINE: By ALAN LIGHT

 BODY:
MANSFIELD, Mass.
 BACKSTAGE at the 23rd annual Farm Aid concert, the sound of Kenny Chesney's voice filled the air. Chrissie Hynde cursed at her cellphone, pulled off her boots and curled up on a couch, following a sundown set by the latest configuration of her band, the Pretenders.
 In typically ornery fashion, the majority of songs they performed came from an album that was weeks away from reaching stores: ''Break Up the Concrete,'' the first Pretenders album in six years (which will be released on Tuesday on Shangri-La Music; that night, the band will perform at the Highline Ballroom in Manhattan).
 ''Ambition is not my middle name,'' Ms. Hynde said. ''But I don't care -- I'm up to my eyeballs most of the time goofing off. I'm kind of a hippie, so the idea was not to have goals or anything. Just moving around and observing and living life; that's necessary before you can make a record anyway.'' 
 Sipping a nonalcoholic beer and smoking a hand-rolled cigarette, Ms. Hynde, 57, remains as rail thin as she was almost three decades ago, when the Pretenders' self-titled debut album perfectly melded punk energy with British Invasion style and hooks. She now allows some gray streaks to show through her trademark black bangs, but with her makeup smeared from the heat of the late-afternoon stage, she still looked every bit the rock legend. 
 Discussing ''Concrete,'' though, it becomes clear that Ms. Hynde's recent thoughts have largely been shaped by a traditional factor: spending more time in her hometown, Akron, Ohio. Like the rest of the Rust Belt, Akron (also the birthplace of eccentrics like the filmmaker Jim Jarmusch, the country outlaw David Allen Coe and the garage rockers the Black Keys) has been hit hard for decades; unemployment hovers well above the national average, and only one rubber manufacturer remains in the former Rubber Capital of the World.
 Ms. Hynde might seem an unlikely cheerleader. She moved to London, her primary residence, in the early 1970s and only recently took an apartment in Akron. But she has written about her hometown in songs like ''My City Was Gone,'' and it offers an opportunity to champion causes like mass transit and urban renewal.
 ''My parents are really old now, and I want to be around more,'' she said. ''I'm trying to discover my own relationship to Akron -- there's a resonance you get when you go back to the place you were born.''
 Most notably, last year she opened a vegan restaurant in Akron called the VegiTerranean. Ms. Hynde is an animal rights activist and has been arrested several times in protests (once for slashing leather products in a Gap store in Manhattan). At Farm Aid, she wore a T-shirt reading ''Tax Meat'' and called for a day when ''all McDonald's and slaughterhouses are burned to the ground'' -- presumably not a sentiment shared by the cattle farmers present.
 ''There wasn't one vegetarian restaurant in Akron, so I said, 'I'll do it,' and it's just been a phenomenon,'' she said. She described its ''international flavor, right down to the tea bag in the pot''; at its opening, she personally served veggie burgers to police officers.
 ''Everybody told me, 'Don't do it, it will not work,' '' she said of the restaurant. ''But I had to do it anyway, because I had to have somewhere I could eat. And more than the music, it's what I'm about. To me, the music is a vehicle so I can have a voice.
 ''I don't think the world really needs another Pretenders record. But frankly, I was getting embarrassed because we hadn't made a record in so long. And we were doing a lot of touring, and I just can't stomach doing those old songs anymore. It's just torture.''
 As she began to work on new songs, she found her direction changing. ''Spending more time in Akron, I was getting more of an American feel in my sensibility,'' she said. In addition, the Pretenders toured last year with ZZ Top, and Ms. Hynde participated in a tribute concert to Jerry Lee Lewis. When she went to Joshua Tree National Park in California and found where the ashes of the alternative-country pioneer Gram Parsons had been scattered, ''I sort of had my epiphany there and I thought, Wow, I think I know how this thing is going to go now.''
 Cut live in the studio in less than two weeks, ''Concrete'' is loose and scrappy, shot through with rockabilly and country. It offers yet another version of the Pretenders, whose lineup Ms. Hynde has continually juggled since the deaths of the founding guitarist, James Honeyman-Scott, and the bassist Pete Farndon in the early '80s. The drummer Martin Chambers, the other most consistent member, is touring with the band, but the session ace Jim Keltner plays drums on the album. ''Chrissie is as subtle as napalm,'' Mr. Chambers said in a phone interview. ''She's absolutely uncompromising. She knows when there's something wrong that needs to be fixed, and she does it.''
 The album's title track is a high-speed meditation on urban sprawl and cultural homogenization, but at Farm Aid, Ms. Hynde expressed optimism. She cited wider acceptance of vegetarianism and increased attention to downtown areas as evidence of changing attitudes.
 ''I have a very good sense of these things,'' she said. ''Like when I was moving around in the '70s, trying to get a band together. I went to Cleveland, I went to Paris, but around 1976, I could just sense something was going to happen in London. Sure enough, in 1977 the whole punk thing broke loose. And I have that same feeling right now about America.
 ''Believe me, I don't feature any false optimism. I'm very realistic about things. But I can sense that there is this change coming, and a lot of it is because people will have no choice.''
 Though the Pretenders have never matched the peaks of their 1979 debut (which included the hit ''Brass in Pocket'') and 1984's glorious ''Learning to Crawl'' (''Back on the Chain Gang''), the band managed to become a kind of institution. Ms. Hynde's bravado and ragged style influenced subsequent female rockers from Shirley Manson and Liz Phair to Lucinda Williams; today, her spirit is visible in the likes of Karen O from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs.
 ''Why hasn't a movie been made about her?'' said the pop-rocker Katy Perry. ''She is the pioneer for female rockers with her personal style, a female Mick Jagger, but more punk.''
 Every few years, the spotlight swings back to her: her appearance on ''Friends,'' for example, or Carrie Underwood's cover of ''I'll Stand by You.'' Despite its punk origins (Ms. Hynde played in early versions of the Clash and the Damned), the band is now a staple on classic rock radio and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005.
 Ms. Hynde, though, adamantly refuses to think in terms of the band's legacy. ''I hate all that,'' she said, calling the Hall of Fame ''another American cheesy moment.'' She added: ''A Hall of Fame is for sports. It was a big deal to my parents, but I don't see it as any kind of honor.''
 The common perception is that, at some point, the Pretenders turned into a solo project, backed by whatever musicians Ms. Hynde pulls together. She said, however, that the Pretenders will always remain a genuine band. ''I've changed the band over the years, but I've never been sued, I've always remained friends with the guys,'' she said. ''They can see that I can't play very good, but I've got a certain vision -- and that my loyalty always has to be to the music first.''
 ''I never would have been interesting if it would have been me alone,'' Ms. Hynde concluded. ''If it was Chrissie Hynde and her guitar, we wouldn't even be having this conversation. You wouldn't even know who I was.''

HEADLINE: Facing Shortfall, Massachusetts Inquires About a Federal Loan

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
The Massachusetts state treasurer has asked the federal government about lending the state money under the same favorable terms given to banks and investment firms during the financial crisis. 
 Treasurer Timothy P. Cahill's requests last week to the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston were prompted by the state's inability to borrow from the short-term debt markets, The Boston Globe reported on Saturday. The financial turmoil has caused credit markets to stop lending, or to charge prohibitive rates.
 California has made a similar request, saying it will run out of money by the end of the month if the short-term debt markets do not ease. That state has said it may need a $7 billion emergency loan.
 Massachusetts has enough money to cover its expenses for the coming weeks, Mr. Cahill said, but a low-rate loan would ease a cash shortfall if the credit problems persist.
 The state's borrowing problems come as it deals with a $223 million shortfall in projected tax collections during the first quarter of the state's fiscal year.

HEADLINE: A Manhunt Or A Vital War?

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. KAPLAN. 
Robert D. Kaplan is a national correspondent for The Atlantic and a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security in Washington.

 BODY:
THE rising violence in Afghanistan and fractious political situation in Pakistan have become leading issues in the American presidential campaign and the debates between the candidates. Indeed, after seven years of war in the region, it's time to ask a very impolite set of questions: If we did, by chance, capture or kill Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, would Afghanistan still matter? Would there be public support for sending more American troops to stabilize a country that has rarely in its history enjoyed strong central government and that abuts a tribal area in Pakistan that neither the British nor the Pakistanis have ever been able to control? Is the war in Afghanistan, deep down, anything more than a manhunt for a handful of individuals? And if it is, how do we define victory there? 
 After all, Afghanistan is not the only ungovernable space with an Islamic setting around the world that can provide a base for terrorists who want to attack the United States. The world is full of them: from Somalia to the southern Philippines to the Indonesian archipelago. Better, perhaps, not to be tied down with thousands of troops in one or two places, and instead use sophisticated, high-tech covert means to hunt down hostile groups wherever they crop up. The problem with Osama bin Laden, one could argue, was not that he had a haven in Afghanistan in the 1990s but that he was not pursued there with sufficient vigor.
 So, here's my answer: In fact, Afghanistan is more than a manhunt, and it does matter, for reasons that have not been fully fleshed out by policy makers or the military. 
 Just because you can't pacify all the ungovernable Islamic spaces on the map doesn't mean you can't fix the one or two that are the most important, that have strategic weight over wide regions. For Afghanistan looms larger than it appears. 
 Strategically, culturally and historically speaking, Afghanistan and Pakistan are inseparable. In the 16th and 17th centuries, both countries, along with northern India, were united under the Mughal Empire. Today Pakistan, with 165 million people, is a nuclearized Yugoslavia in the making, and threatens to be torn apart by the Taliban rebellion in its North-West Frontier Province (and, possibly, by the growing Baluchi and Sindhi separatist movements in its southern half). 
 Since its birth 60 years ago, Pakistan has had darkly Shakespearean politics driven by passion and vendetta in which a small cast of individuals -- Mohammad Zia ul-Haq; Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and his daughter, Benazir; Nawaz Sharif; Pervez Musharraf -- have in turn executed, replaced and imprisoned one another. The only qualification of the new president, Asif Ali Zardari, is that he is Benazir Bhutto's widower. The soap opera goes on, as Mr. Sharif, a two-time former prime minister, will undoubtedly seek to undermine him by leveraging his native Punjab against Mr. Zardari's Sindhi base.
 Yet Pakistan is salvageable: it has an expanding urban middle class, and recent elections have by and large seen the defeat of religious extremists in favor of moderates. Pakistan's future may hinge on the degree to which the United States can work with the Pakistani military to keep the Taliban rebellion from expanding not only throughout Afghanistan, but into Pakistan's own cities as well.
 Paradoxically, that will mean making deals with some Taliban groups against others. For the Taliban are not a monolithic organization, but bands of ornery Pashtun backwoodsmen who have been cut out of the power base in Afghanistan by an increasingly corrupt and ineffectual government in Kabul. They are not Al Qaeda: they lack a well-defined worldview and some are susceptible to political entreaties. But if our drone air strikes are not accompanied by nation-building steps like constructing roads and water wells, we will fail and Pakistan will be further destabilized.
 A failure in Afghanistan that destabilized Pakistan would do India no favors. Indeed, Pakistan would not go quietly into history. Sindhi and Baluchi separatists talk openly of an alliance with India if Pakistan unravels. But India, while its intelligence services now and then stoke Baluchi separatism, is terrified of such a development. 
 India's gravest problem -- the one that has bedeviled its rise to great power status and with which its army is obsessed -- is the fact that it shares long borders with dysfunctional states like Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal. The more responsible Indian nationalists see their country's expansion not in terms of hard conquest, but in terms of soft economic envelopment of its neighbors. And an American failure in Afghanistan would set in motion a string of consequences that threaten such a benign vision.
 In the end, victory in Afghanistan can be defined by achieving the kind of security there that existed in the 1960s, when King Zahir Shah controlled the major cities and the roads connecting them, and a relative peace reigned. Even under a weak central government, Afghanistan could finally achieve economic salvation: the construction of a web of energy pipelines that have been envisioned for years connecting Central Asia with the Indian Ocean. These might run, for example, from the natural gas fields of Turkmenistan down through Afghanistan and into the dense population zones of Pakistan and India, with terminals at ports like Gwadar in Pakistani Baluchistan and Surat in the Indian state of Gujarat. 
 In other words, in Afghanistan we are not simply trying to save a country, but to give a whole region a new kind of prosperity and stability, united rather than divided by energy needs, that would be implicitly pro-American. 
 Indeed, a main reason the Pakistanis have been hesitant to work with us in the tribal areas is their fear that a manhunt is all we care about, rather than the region's long-term prospects. The Pakistanis take note of our burgeoning strategic partnership with India, even as they believe that India's recent opening of several consulates in Afghanistan is aimed at helping Baluchi separatists weaken Pakistan. 
 Consequently, they feel squeezed, and on the brink of being deserted by us once we track down Al Qaeda's leading figures. Afghanistan is a strategic rear base that India and Pakistan are now fighting over; both countries fear chaos there and desperately want us to calm it.
 What the Pentagon calls the ''long war'' is the defining geopolitical issue of our time, and Afghanistan is at its heart. The fate of Eurasia hangs in the balance.

HEADLINE: What Mattered Most to Paul Newman

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI. 
E-mail: conn@nytimes.com

DATELINE: ASHFORD 

 BODY:
 AFTER the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp emptied of children last month, Ray Lamontagne, the camp's chairman, and his wife, Monica, drove Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward from their Westport home to visit the camp Mr. Newman had created for children with life-threatening diseases.
 They toured the grounds in a golf cart before settling at a porch behind a cabin on the edge of the camp's fishing pond. There, they ate sandwiches and stared at the water in silence, aware this was probably Mr. Newman's last visit. 
 ''We were just sitting there,'' Mr. Lamontagne recalled Tuesday. ''All of a sudden, Paul looked up with this look of joy on his face. He said, 'I can still hear the laughter of the children!' ''
 After Paul Newman's death late last month, few places registered as palpable a sense of loss as this camp, the signature jewel of the actor's philanthropic career. But in circles as widely dispersed as the Westport Country Playhouse, Lime Rock Park and the countless nonprofit organizations Mr. Newman supported across the state, his death also brought sudden cause to weigh the man's impact, beyond the jolt of his face on-screen.
 Mr. Newman was known by most for his looks and his acting, but for those who knew him as a neighbor, benefactor and friend, he was the man for whom fame was a currency to be spent on behalf of others.
 Mr. Lamontagne, a longtime camp board member who now serves as the camp's chairman, sat in a corner of the dining hall Tuesday evening, talking about the man whom he characterized as a close friend.
 ''He never really felt like the money was his,'' Mr. Lamontagne said. ''Some people are born on third base and feel like they hit a triple. Newman was almost the opposite. He made it on his own and felt there was a lot of luck in what he made, and that he wasn't entitled to anything.''
 In Westport, Mr. Newman's home of roughly 45 years, the actor was mourned quietly by a town that, during his lifetime, largely spared him the deification he loathed. At the Westport Public Library, visitors penned remembrances in a book for Mr. Newman's family. In Town Hall, First Selectman Gordon Joseloff set aside calls for a memorial until he could gauge the family's wishes. The Westport Country Playhouse, where Mr. Newman's wife, Ms. Woodward, is the creative director, lowered its flags. 
 Anne Keefe, the playhouse's artistic director, wrote in an e-mail message that Mr. Newman ''loved our history almost as much as Joanne.''
 One could throw a tomato from the playhouse to the headquarters of Newman's Own, the locus of Mr. Newman's food business. There, staff members fielded calls from reporters, donors and bereaved fans, and posted a valedictory video online. Down the hallway, Leo Nevas, Mr. Newman's longtime friend and lawyer, continued, in his 97th year, his daily work. 
 ''I'd see him practically every day,'' said Mr. Nevas. ''It leaves a big hole.'' The pair met when the actor moved to Westport. They found common interests in nonprofits, politics and charity, he said, but vastly divergent tastes in due diligence.
 Among Mr. Newman's associates, tales of his spontaneity abound. A group of nuns needs bus tires? Cut a check! A choir can't get to Europe for a once-in-a-lifetime concert? Done!
 Bigger checks from a growing trove of food industry revenues required a more deliberate approach, and as the food company's gifts passed the $200 million mark two years ago, Mr. Newman formed the Newman's Own Foundation and largely handed the philanthropic reins to pros.
 IT was through these proxies last year that Mr. Newman helped finance the Achievement First Bridgeport Academy, a middle school in a low-income neighborhood. Debon Lewis, the school's principal, planned last week to tell students about Mr. Newman's death, but had not yet formulated an explanation that might reach fifth graders who have not yet watched ''Hud'' on DVD.
 On the opposite end of Connecticut's economic and actuarial spectrum, Lime Rock's owner, Skip Barber, struggled with a different question: how to memorialize someone known for humbling AARP newcomers who figured they could catch an 80-year-old racecar driver. (A year ago last weekend, Mr. Newman won a Sports Car Club of America championship there.)
 ''We'll do something,'' Mr. Barber said. ''But there's no part of the track we'd associate with him. No corner he always went off of, although he'd appreciate that.''
 The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp, where this reporter worked a decade ago -- and, like other staff members, stumbled into occasional conversations with Mr. Newman -- will continue to bear physical reminders of the man who championed the place. The ''Newmoose'' moose head hangs in the dining hall. From the boathouse, one can see the cottage where Mr. Newman often stayed while at camp. The Newman's Own lemonade boxes fill a refrigerator in the dining hall.
 Mr. Lamontagne said the 11 camps that now make up the Association of Hole in the Wall Gang Camps were Mr. Newman's proudest achievement. More than 135,000 children have attended free of charge. ''I can't tell you how many times in the past 25 years he said the one thing he wanted to be best remembered for was not the movies, not the racing, not the salad dressing, but the camps,'' he said.
 As he spoke, staff members lingered on a dirt path nearby, having finished, minutes earlier, an impromptu celebration of Mr. Newman's life.
 The event was equal parts retrospective and rite of passage, with the stewardship for Mr. Newman's camp legacy resting now with administrators who first came to Ashford between college semesters, and who have since made a career of the place.
 The group formed a circle, locked arms and sang ''Lean on Me,'' ''Seasons of Love'' and other camp anthems. There was sadness, but laughter, too.
 Later that evening, Matthew Cook, the camp director, sat in his office and considered the start of the post-Newman era. ''It makes me really sad to think of his absence,'' he said quietly, then paused. ''But I also have faith in that voice of his. It's been strong enough, I think, that we have our true north.''

 CORRECTION:
The Town Green column on Oct. 5, about Paul Newman's legacy as a philanthropist, misstated the name of the organization that helps to manage the children's camps he founded. It is the Association of Hole in the Wall Camps -- not the Association of Hole in the Wall Gang Camps.

 BODY:
The Republican cloakroom of the House of Representatives is a strangely narrow room that bends around a corner and hardly seems like much of an antechamber for the barons of American politics. Members negotiate tight spaces between the furniture, stepping around one another to find an open seat to while away the breaks, maybe pick up a newspaper or chat with a colleague.
 On a desultory afternoon last month, Representative Tom Davis cruised through the cloakroom on his way to the floor to manage a bill, a mobile telephone pressed to his ear as he waved me to follow. We entered the chamber where war, slavery and impeachment have been debated, and he headed to the lectern while I sat a couple rows back. Davis clicked his phone shut and addressed the mostly empty chamber: ''Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on H. R. 5683, the Government Accountability Office Act of 2008.'' 
 After a couple of minutes, Davis was back in the cloakroom, plopping down in a chair, propping his feet up on a coffee table and popping open a Diet Coke. He sighed at the tedium of the exercise and then thought back to the first time he ever managed a bill on the floor. It was 1995, and he was a freshman Republican congressman from Virginia, swept into office by Newt Gingrich's revolution. ''What a thrill,'' he said, his eyes lighting up at the memory. ''I thought, You know, maybe I belong here. Now it's kind of like, Oh, I gotta do this?''
 A few minutes later, in fact, an aide emerged from the House chamber to ask Davis if he wanted to manage the next bill, H. R. 6575, the Over-Classification Reduction Act. Davis shook his head no. ''In the old days, you'd jump at the chance to manage a bill,'' he told me.
 No more. The revolution is over, the thrill is gone and the Republican brand under President Bush has, in Davis's view, been so tarnished that, as he likes to say, ''if we were a dog food, they would take us off the shelf.'' These will be Davis's last few weeks in Congress. He decided against re-election, disaffected by the partisanship, by a process he calls broken, by a party he considers hijacked by social conservatives. ''We're just not getting much done,'' he said.
 Another aide sat down and told him there would be three more votes. ''They're all yes votes,'' the aide said.
 Davis laughed. ''Let me make up my own mind!'' he said in mock protest. Gesturing to me, he said, ''I've just been telling this guy I'm an independent agent!'' 
 Then he asked for a list of the three bills to see if he really did want to vote yes: A nonbinding resolution ''recognizing that we are facing a global food crisis.'' O.K., Davis said puckishly. That's a yes.
 A second resolution ''expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the emergency communications services provided by the American Red Cross are vital resources for military-service members and their families.'' O.K., another yes.
 A third resolution ''condemning the use of television programming by Hamas to indoctrinate hatred, violence and anti-Semitism toward Israel in Palestinian children.'' A third yes. ''They read me pretty well,'' Davis said, chuckling at the absurdity of it all.
 Then he shook his head. Three resolutions offering platitudes, none of them carrying the force of law, none of them actually doing anything. Davis asked for a list of all 20 bills on the floor that day -- naming post offices, recognizing the anniversary of Bulgaria's independence, honoring an old American war sloop.
 Davis wanted me to have the list. ''Tell them about the important work we're doing while Rome burns,'' he said.
 After 14 years in Congress, Tom Davis is giving up his place in the bucket brigade. Someone else will have to put out the fire. If anyone wants to try.
 For Republicans like Davis, these are gloomy times. While John McCain's pick of Sarah Palin as his running mate energized the party after a long stretch of depressing developments, the most optimistic Republican strategists still expect further losses in Congress even if McCain wins the White House.
 The way Davis sees it, the system has become dysfunctional. Bush has so destroyed the party's public standing and Congress has become so infected with a win-at-all-costs mentality that there is no point in staying. ''You know, the Cubs fans used to put the bags over their heads,'' he told me when we met for eggs at Mickey's Dining Car in St. Paul the first morning of the Republican National Convention. ''That's what I feel when you say you're from Congress, because there are just so many things we're not doing.''
 This might be dismissed if it came from a fringe player on Capitol Hill, but for years Davis was one of the rising stars, a quintessential inside player who as part of the leadership managed to steer his party to election victories in even-numbered years while working with Democrats on legislation in odd-numbered years. He ran the House Republican campaign committee for two elections and later bypassed more senior congressmen to become chairman of the House Government Reform Committee until his party lost control of Congress. He spent a lifetime getting to this point and is now washing his hands of it, even as he foresees a fiscal reckoning after so much unbridled government spending, most recently to bail out Wall Street.
 ''When you get the majority, the leadership team sits around the table, and the first question the winners ask, sitting in this ornate room, is 'How do we stay in the majority?' '' he said. ''Now the members, a lot of them, are willing to tackle these issues, but they elect leaders, and the leaders' report card is: Do they get their members re-elected? You see what I'm saying? And the minority, by the way, sits in a little less ornate room, a little smaller room in the Capitol, and they say, 'How do we get it back?' And so for every issue it's 'Do we cooperate or do we try to embarrass them?' Very few times they cooperate.''
 As for Bush, Davis long ago lost faith. ''He's a disappointment,'' Davis said. ''How else do you say it?'' In his view, Bush grew isolated and surrounded himself with people who made bad decisions. The president, he lamented, failed to effectively tackle a rising deficit, Medicare and Social Security. He rose to the occasion after terrorists attacked on Sept. 11, 2001, but not after Hurricane Katrina smashed into the Gulf Coast. ''I would vote for him again against John Kerry; that's not an issue,'' Davis said. ''But I'm disappointed just in terms of his stewardship. I wrote the Katrina report. Just the fact that he wasn't down there the next day and he flew over it in Air Force One to get a view of it -- that, to me, is not leadership.''
 Davis is one of 26 Republicans who have chosen to retire from the House this year, many of them moderates like him, compared with 6 Democrats. ''There's no question we're a dying breed,'' said Representative Jim Ramstad of Minnesota, who is also giving up his seat.
 By one measurement, Congress is the most polarized it has been in a century. Sean Theriault, a scholar at the University of Texas at Austin who just published a book called ''Party Polarization in Congress,'' analyzed voting patterns to put each two-year session on a scale. In his study, Congress in its Watergate session from 1973-74 was 29 percent polarized. By 2005-6, it was 46 percent, the highest since the most polarized Congress in history, back in 1905-6, when it reached 48 percent on Theriault's scale.
 ''The electoral campaign has infiltrated the legislative process,'' Theriault told me. ''Congressmen used to campaign at home, win elections and then come to Washington'' to grapple with the issues of the day. Now, he said, ''They're just looking to gain advantage wherever they can.''
 This evolution has been fueled by migration patterns, demographic shifts and, many argue, redistricting. Most lawmakers represent safe districts, giving them little incentive to tack to the center and work together. Indeed, many incumbents worry more about ''being primaried,'' as they put it, drawing a primary challenge from within their own parties for being insufficiently orthodox. 
 Davis represents one of those few districts that can go either way, a cluster of wealthy suburbs outside Washington rapidly transformed by immigration. A third of the residents are from minority groups and a quarter speak a language other than English at home. Bush edged Kerry by 2,000 votes there in 2004, while the Democrat Jim Webb trounced Senator George Allen in 2006. Davis has not drawn a first-tier challenger since winning his seat in 1994 but saw a warning sign two years ago when he won with just 55 percent after outspending a little-known Democrat 10 to 1.
 ''I had a guy say to me: 'Look, I've voted for you before, I'll probably vote for you again. But not this time. I'm sorry, but you're just collateral damage,' '' Davis told me. He recalled another voter telling him: '' 'I like you, you're good. But I've just got to send a message to Bush.' I said, 'Look, give me a letter, I'll take it to him for you personally.' ''
 The party has taken such a beating because of Bush and Congressional scandals that Davis took it upon himself to sound the alarm last spring in a 20-page memo to the Republican leadership, calling the atmosphere ''the worst since Watergate,'' even worse than 2006. ''Failure to fundamentally change the G.O.P. brand can lock us into a long period of minority status,'' he warned. The memo became public, and some Republican colleagues were irked with Davis. But none, he says, disputed his analysis.
 For Davis, who is 59, the decision to leave came after a series of personal blows. The loss of the majority in 2006 cost him his chairman's gavel. His wife, Jeannemarie Devolites Davis, lost re-election as a Virginia state senator in 2007. And he gave up his ambition to run for the United States Senate this year when his state party decided to choose its nominee by a convention dominated by conservatives rather than a primary open to Davis's independent supporters.
 So in recent weeks, he has become the picture of Republican frustration. ''You know, when I was first elected, I think I would have done or said anything just to get elected,'' he told me. ''I just wanted to win. But the longer you stay in, you don't feel that anymore.''
 His wife interjected. ''It's my influence over him,'' she joked, knowing that some in Virginia blame her for making him quit. A 10-year legislator in her own right, Devolites Davis says politics has grown too corrosive. ''When you get to a legislature you start compromising yourself,'' she said. ''You get caught after a while. You have to keep up with how you're changing to please this person and that person. And you come to understand you can't please everyone. It's impossible.''
 If anyone ever tried to please everyone, it was Tom Davis. I first met him 22 years ago when he was a local supervisor in Fairfax County outside Washington and I was a rookie reporter. Davis was the boy wonder of Virginia politics, whip-smart and funny, affable and ambitious. He had an easy smile and could make fun of himself. He was a deal maker, a consensus builder who brought Democrats and Republicans together. He had future written all over him.
 I remember hanging out with Davis in a backroom of the county headquarters talking politics during breaks in zoning hearings. Davis knew election results the way other boys knew baseball statistics. (Actually, he was a baseball fiend and knew both.) He could expound on campaigns down to the precinct level in, say, Oklahoma or New York. He knew how much of the vote Richard Nixon received in the District of Columbia in 1972 and how the Atlanta suburbs were changing politically. I had little doubt that he would be a senator or speaker of the House someday.
 Davis came at this by virtue of his grandfather, Clarence Davis, who was elected attorney general of Nebraska at 25. Born in Minot, N.D., Thomas M. Davis III moved at age 5 to the Washington suburbs when his grandfather went to work for the Eisenhower administration. Davis remembers his grandfather coming back from the Republican convention of 1956 with ''I like Ike'' buttons. ''I'm 7 years old, he started talking politics and something clicked,'' Davis told me. ''There was an interest there unlike anything that I ever experienced, except for baseball, and I clearly wasn't good enough for baseball.''
 The young boy devoured everything he could about politics, down to the footnotes. He charted his first elections in 1958 at age 9, although his mother made him go to bed before West Coast returns came in. In 1960, he volunteered for Nixon. He later became a Senate page and collected autographs from Barry Goldwater and Mike Mansfield. Jim Ramstad, then a Senate messenger, said Davis stood out. ''He already had developed his encyclopedic knowledge of political data,'' Ramstad told me. ''I thought at the time, This guy's going to be in Congress someday.''
 What Davis did not tell Ramstad about was the trauma at home. His father was a college professor who grilled his son about presidents on the ride home from picnics along the Potomac River. But he was also an alcoholic who stormed about in drunken stupors, chasing his wife onto the front lawn as young Tom ran after them to protect her. His father left home and twice wound up behind bars for petty larceny, shoplifting and public drunkenness.
 Davis's housing stipend from the Capitol Page School went to pay the mortgage, but when he left for Amherst College on a scholarship, the checks stopped coming, forcing his mother to sell their house and take a two-room apartment. When he came home from college, his father had been released from prison, and there was no room for young Tom, so he slept on a neighbor's couch. Even today, Davis does not drink, and those close to him attribute his conciliatory political style to early experiences with his father.
 After an internship in the Nixon White House, stints in the Army and Army Reserves and a law degree from the University of Virginia, Davis embarked on a political career. He notched the first of 11 straight election victories in 1979, when he won a seat on the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors at 30. ''I ran it like a presidential race,'' he recalled. ''If a new 7-11 opened, I was there to sip the first Slurpee. I was 24-7.'' Over the next 12 years, he pushed through a no-smoking law, opened a county homeless shelter, drafted an affordable-housing ordinance and made friends on both sides of the aisle. When he ran for board chairman in 1991, he ousted the Democratic incumbent in a landslide, then wiped out a $200 million budget shortfall with a bipartisan plan that spread the pain and generated a unanimous vote.
 He mastered the skill of appearing to be all things to all people. ''It was Tom Davis who taught me to vote yes on the amendment and no on the main motion so I could be on both sides of the issue,'' one Democrat who likes him told me with professional admiration. When that did not work, he would be accused of playing both sides. And by his own admission, he did not take criticism well. Lots of reporters and politicians have stories of searing phone calls.
 I remember the night voters rejected his proposal to levy a restaurant tax to help address the budget crisis. He saw me in the county building and asked to read the article I had just filed, then grew hot as he complained that he should not be blamed for the defeat. His chief aide had to pull him away, nudging him out to the parking lot to go home. He got in his car but, after the aide drove off, got out again, stalked back into the building and resumed railing at me.
 But Davis did not stay mad for long, and it was hard to stay mad at him. He understood how the game was played and realized that holding grudges was never smart. And at least some of his temper was calculation. Once I bristled when he accused me of adopting a critic's spin. He instantly backed off. ''How can I make you feel guilty without ticking you off?'' he asked. ''That's what I'm trying to do.''
 Tom Davis arrived in Congress with the Gingrich class of 1994, again ousting an incumbent Democrat, but he was hardly a revolutionary. Davis was a business-oriented Republican animated by economic competitiveness, fiscal responsibility and bipartisan problem solving. Right away, he teamed with Democrats to tackle the financial collapse of city government in Washington. ''He was basically mayor by default,'' his longtime aide, Howard Denis, told me. Davis worked with President Bill Clinton's aides and other Democrats to form a financial-control board to get the city back on its feet. ''We moved it through a lot of land mines,'' he recalled. ''That taught me right away up here -- if that had been a partisan deal, it never would have gone.''
 That is the model he says is missing today. As coarse as politics seemed in the 1990s, Davis remembers it as a productive period when Clinton and Gingrich and their parties actually did business. They overhauled welfare and eliminated the deficit. Davis managed to close the long-hated Lorton prison in Virginia and to push through legislation allowing children from the District of Columbia to pay in-state tuition at any state college in the country. Divided government, he told me, may actually be better for getting results. ''If you're solving a big problem, whether it's welfare reform or Social Security, you want every perspective at the table -- not so they can veto it, but so you can get everyone involved,'' he said.
 Since Bush took office, with Republicans in charge of Congress for most of the last eight years, there has been little appetite for reaching across the aisle. The two sides, he says, are so divided that they are incapable of recognizing what he sees as the looming crisis of our time -- the massive debt accumulated during the Bush years. The only time the two parties agree, he noted scornfully, is to spend vast sums of money to prop up the economy and win re-election. He voted against the economic stimulus package last spring as a result. ''The fiscal thing is awful,'' he told me. ''When you're running $300, $400 billion a year in debt every single year and nobody wants to face the issue, the time is coming pretty soon where it's going to have a huge effect on things.''
 The collapse of Wall Street reinforced his view that Washington has fallen down on the job. ''Nobody keeps an eye on anything unless it hurts the other party,'' he said. With the situation now threatening widespread economic damage, Davis told me in late September that he expected he would have to go along with a massive bailout proposed by the Bush administration. But he fretted that it would only worsen the nation's balance sheet and tie the hands of the next president. ''This compounds the whole deficit issue,'' he said. ''It's huge. I listen to McCain and Obama and they mean well. But there's no money to do anything.''
 He says that members of both parties shy away from the hard stances, like raising the retirement age for Social Security or ruling out new tax cuts. And Davis knows he went along with bad decisions for the same bad reasons others did. One example he cited was a change allowing elderly Americans to receive Social Security benefits even if they are still working. ''We made it worse, and I voted for it,'' he said ruefully.
 Davis, of course, was never above politics. He made a national name for himself beating Democrats when he was chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee from 1998 to 2002, picking candidates, raising money, setting strategy and traveling the country. ''That was the job I was made for,'' he told me wistfully. His detailed knowledge of districts paid off. He held the Republican majority in 2000 and 2002 but clashed over strategy with fellow House Republican leaders and with Karl Rove, Bush's political guru. ''He looks through the cultural prism of divide and conquer,'' Davis said. ''I look at it like, 'Look, the world is changing and we need to appeal to these people.' We had a different view of how the coalitions should evolve.''
 (Rove disputed that, saying his strategy was to expand the universe of Republican voters to reach Hispanics, Jews, Catholics and exurbanites. ''To suggest that our focus was inside not outside -- I could not get him to be as outside as we wanted him to be,'' Rove told me.)
 To conservative House leaders, Davis seemed mercurial and unreliable. He voted to authorize the Iraq war and to expand counterterrorism powers but broke with Bush on stem-cell research and children's health insurance. He voted against same-sex marriage but for employment-discrimination protection for gay and lesbian workers. He voted for trade pacts and tax cuts but against drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. He voted for a fence along the Southern border and also for a ban on assault weapons.
 ''Tom has taken some arrows for being willing to work across party lines,'' Mark Warner, the former Democratic governor who would have been Davis's opponent had he run for Senate, told me recently. ''He was always a hard-core fighter for increasing the Republican majority. But he also thought you could have professional differences without making it personal.'' 
 Davis had to give up the campaign committee because of a term limit, but he said it was clear House leaders were just as happy to see him move on. His payoff was chairmanship of the Government Reform Committee, a prime post for someone who represents so many federal workers. He quickly forged a partnership with the top Democrat, Representative Henry Waxman of California. ''When he became chairman, he said to me a lot of the issues that would come before our committee would not make the difference between Democrats and Republicans and we should try to work together,'' Waxman told me. ''And when we have differences, we'll battle it out.'' 
 Davis and Waxman did team up for a high-profile investigation into steroid use in Major League Baseball. But as Davis walked out of their first hearing, an aide told him that Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, then the powerful House majority leader, was waiting in his office. ''Have you heard of Terri Schiavo?'' Davis recalled DeLay asking. Schiavo, a brain-damaged woman kept alive on a feeding tube, had become a cause celebre for the right. DeLay wanted Davis to subpoena the woman and her medical tubes, effectively ordering that she be kept alive while conservatives tried to pass legislation intervening in the case. Davis balked. ''I asked him, 'Can't you get Frist to do it?' '' he told me, referring to Bill Frist, then the Senate majority leader. ''I was looking for any way not to do it.'' But Davis was the only House chairman with the power to issue a subpoena unilaterally. DeLay insisted. Davis relented. ''I signed it,'' he said. ''I serve at the pleasure.''
 He brought the episode up with me as an example of the trade-offs for a congressman serving in the leadership and an explanation for why he was not destined to rise higher in the ranks. ''There are costs to being a leader,'' Davis said. ''You're not an independent actor as a leader.'' Eventually, he said, he refused to extend the subpoena as long as DeLay wanted.
 Tension flared as well over Davis's efforts to engage in oversight. He produced a report blistering the Bush administration for its botched response to Katrina. And he pushed DeLay to investigate lobbying corruption. ''I said: 'Tom, this is the biggest scandal to hit Congress in 30 years and we do nothing? It's just not credible. We are not just an appendage of the administration,' '' Davis told me. ''He understood. He wasn't happy about it.''
 Neither were Democrats, who accused Davis of not going far enough. ''We were very discouraged our committee didn't do more oversight when Republicans were in power,'' said Waxman, who added the word ''Oversight'' to the committee's name after taking charge last year. ''When Bush became president, even under Chairman Davis, there wasn't a scandal too big for them to ignore.'' While crediting Davis for taking on Katrina, Waxman lamented that he did not dig deeply enough into the White House role.
 Other critics said Davis was too cozy with K Street lobbyists and the federal contractors who populate his district. The Washington Post called into question Davis's relationship with a consulting firm that advises technology companies seeking government work, a firm that was formed by a close friend and employed Davis's wife. Davis erupted at the story. When he later ran into one of the reporters at a supermarket, Davis loudly berated him. ''I told him he was scum, basically,'' Davis told me. ''I told him it was a scummy thing to do and I hope he felt good about it and I hoped he'd rot in hell.'' He paused at the memory. Davis usually regrets his outbursts after he cools down. ''If it was just me, that's fine,'' he said. ''But on her, I get very, very defensive. Why do you have to drag her into it?''
 Tom Davis and Jeannemarie Devolites met in the 1990s as she was building her own political career and he became a mentor. After their respective marriages fell apart, they became engaged and married in 2004. But their partnership rankled some Republicans, and the couple found ugly and mean things written about them on the Internet.
 Last year, Devolites Davis lost re-election as a state senator in an increasingly Democratic district. One person close to Davis called it ''vendetta politics,'' saying ''the party line was 'we can't get him, but we can get her.' '' Both Davises took it hard. The election came only weeks after Republicans decided on a convention to pick their United States Senate nominee in 2008. The party, Davis declared, ''gave me the middle finger.'' He announced he would not run for Senate. In January, he said he would not to run for re-election to the House, either.
 ''He's entitled to some resentment,'' said Gerry Connolly, the Democrat who is now favored to win Davis's seat. ''This is somebody who did a lot for party building, certainly at the national level and certainly here in Virginia at the state and local level. And he saw it all slipping away.''
 Jeff Frederick, who took over as chairman of the Virginia Republican Party after the convention decision, told me: ''People statewide sometimes forget this -- Tom Davis has been a team player. Although he's sometimes in intense battles, when it comes time to close ranks, he closes ranks and fights for the team.''
 It may be that fighting for the team is what has taken such a toll on Davis. The cost of loyalty -- reconciling his own centrist, pragmatic instincts with the demands of a conservative party -- seems to weigh on him. ''You've got to, quote, 'play the game,' '' he told me. ''If you want advancement, you've got to adhere to the party lines on a lot of issues.''
 During one of our conversations last month, I asked him whether it was a mistake to invade Iraq. He stared at me intently without answering for quite a while, as if trying to decide whether to say what he really thought. On my tape, it counts out to eight long seconds before he spoke, but at the time, it seemed longer. Finally, he said softly: ''I don't want to go there. We're where we are. I don't think we need to revisit that issue. Probably the facts speak for themselves.'' 
 Then he tried to explain his vote. ''Our vote to go to war was a vote to give permission,'' he said. ''It wasn't a vote to go to war. It wasn't a declaration of war. The president was trying to get inspectors in there and he said, 'Look, we're going to do this the hard way or the easy way.' And if you don't stand behind the president in those circumstances, you kind of pull the rug out from under him. You know what I'm saying? Now, if you knew it was going to come out this way, that's a different answer.''
 At the same time, he seems angry his team did not stand behind him, particularly on his effort to give the District of Columbia a full-fledged member of the House. Davis tried to address longstanding Republican objections by balancing what would be a new safe Democratic seat by adding a safe Republican seat in Utah at the same time. It passed the House, but Republicans filibustered in the Senate. And he took it as a sign. ''The party leadership,'' he said, ''has kind of signaled that since I was not a hard-core social conservative, any advancement was going to be over them, not with them.''
 For a smart, connected guy like Davis, doors will open. After 29 years in public office, he said he wants to earn money before retirement, spend time with his wife and go to more baseball games. He has started teaching. I went to one of his first classes at George Mason University. There was the boyish enthusiast I remembered from the 1980s, lecturing on cultural politics of the South and rattling off election results over the past century. At one point, discussing voting rights for felons, he allowed that not all felons are Democrats. ''There are a lot of Republican felons,'' he said. ''I served with them in Congress.''
 But the students did not come alive until he threw the discussion open for questions and they asked about Sarah Palin. ''The base hated McCain; it was a marriage of convenience,'' Davis told them. ''What are the negatives? What about her resume? I got through it in about 10 seconds. Does that hurt? He's the guy running on experience -- '3 a.m., I'm the guy.' And she's a heartbeat away.'' On the other hand, Davis said, Republicans can argue they would make history just as Democrats would with Barack Obama. ''She helps on the change issue, doesn't she? She's sure change, isn't she?''
 After class, we headed over to the student union. Davis ordered a Double Whopper at Burger King, hold the bread in deference to his Atkins diet, but yes to the onion rings. At that moment, McCain had jumped up in the polls, but Davis said he was not having second thoughts about quitting. He could be more productive elsewhere, he said. And while he still loved the game, he said, he was tired of the rules. ''We all bob and weave,'' he said. ''Everybody bobs and weaves in this business. I've bobbed and weaved with the best of them.''
 Then again, another Senate seat is up in 2012. ''I can step back in it if I want -- if they're looking for a problem solver,'' he said. ''But right now, neither party is looking for that.''

DATELINE: DARIEN, Conn. 

 BODY:
 What's life like these days in the community said to have the nation's highest percentage of residents working in financial industries?
 Probably a lot like it is for the rest of us, only more so. On the one hand there's an anxious, attenuated version of the old normal. On the other, there's the nagging fear we're like Wile E. Coyote having zoomed over the cliff, blithely walking on air as long as he manages not to look down and ponder the void below.
 So, on the one hand, it's hard to imagine anything too catastrophic going on in Darien. It still seems the affluent Fairfield County enclave, with its impossibly thin moms bringing impossibly cute kids to Gofer Ice Cream or the Upper Crust Bagel Company, its fliers from the Canine Health and Fitness Club where they'll jog with your dog for you, the squadrons of investment whizzes and sundry hotshots packing the 5:04, 5:28, 5:54 and 6:20 from Grand Central. 
 On the other there are the photocopied pages, spreading around town like lice, of the Business Week story last month that said that 27.2 percent of Darien's 20,000 or so residents work in finance, real estate, insurance and leasing -- the highest percentage in the country. (Westport, up the road, ranked seventh. Greenwich, for technical reasons having to do with census designations, was not rated.) There's the latest issue of The Darien News, its front page dominated by one of the ubiquitous house-for-sale signs and the headline ''Wall Street Crisis: Could Darien Be Hit Hard?''
 The first item on the weekly bulletin given to Sunday worshipers at Darien's stately St. Luke's Parish begins: ''Feeling the Impact of the Financial Crisis? In a Job Transition? We want to help.''
 Housing sales are down 40 percent or more from a year ago, and when the Homebuilders Association of Connecticut met here on Wednesday, many on hand were in a panic.
 John Doherty, of Doherty and DeLeo Developments, has added geothermal heat and other green technologies to try to sell a 6,500-square-foot house on Buttonwood Lane that he hopes to list for under $4 million. But he's hustling up as much remodeling work as he can find and holding off on trying to build anything else until the financial weather changes.
 ''Even people who have money are afraid to spend it,'' he said. ''Right now everyone is being affected. It's kind of funny -- you play golf with people in construction and all they want to talk about is politics. They never did that before. Now, they're all looking for a way out of this.''
 At Nicholas Roberts Fine Wines, Peter Troilo, the managing director, said that two years ago his wine prices typically ranged from $60 to $100. Now it's more like $18 to $35, and he has added lots of bottles in the $10 to $15 range. ''You have to be responsive to what's going on out there,'' he said. ''If the market's down 700 points, you don't want to be having a special on an expensive bottle of wine. We have to work a lot harder to make money these days.''
 One of his customers, who is in wealth management but declined to give his name, said everyone feels the chill. ''Everyone knows someone who lost his job, at Lehman Brothers or Bear Stearns or somewhere else,'' he said. ''Everyone knows that even the firms that survive are going to be laying off people.''
 There are more sympathetic victims than Fairfield County hotshots in multimillion-dollar houses. But depending on how bad things get, hard times in Fairfield County will feel far different from hard times in some mill town -- more private pain, less public recognition of it.
 ''When I first came here, there was more of a sense of community, people were a lot friendlier and relaxed,'' said the Rev. Anthony L. Gibson, a vocal social conservative whose Calvary Baptist Church has a more working-class congregation, with many worshipers from outside of town. ''Even on my street, they tore down two perfectly good houses to build these immense mansions -- one sold for $2 million and one for over $3 million. One has an electric gate in the front so you can't even go meet your neighbors if you wanted to, because you don't know the code to get to the door.''
 At St. Luke's, founded in 1855, the rector, David R. Anderson, said, ''Everyone's anxious, everyone's nervous; we all want security, and we can't lay our hands on it right now.'' 
 But he said there was not much to be gained from demonizing guys stuck with oversized houses in Darien. He mentioned a visit to someone who worked at Lehman Brothers, who had left his office amid protesters with placards reading: ''Greed eats itself.''
 Mr. Anderson said there was no doubt there were some Wall Streeters who fit the worst stereotypes of heartless businessmen. But, he added: ''Most of these are people just working hard and just trying to do their best. Listen, everyone was greedy. When they were selling all these million-dollar houses, everyone was getting their piece -- if you were selling floor tiling or lighting or home theaters. We're all greedy. If you can acknowledge that in yourself, you can make some progress. If you want to find someone else to blame, you're probably not going to make much progress yourself.''
 Friday, Congress approved the bailout bill in Washington. The market still tanked. There was an autumn chill in the air as the commuters got off the 5:04, 5:28, 5:54 and 6:20. In some of those great big houses, with heating bills bigger than many people's mortgages, it's going to be a very long winter in Darien.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In ''What's Free About Free Enterprise?'' (Economic View, Sept. 28), Peter L. Bernstein noted that our economic system ''is rooted in individual decision-making in free markets.'' 
 Thus, individuals make free, uncoerced decisions within the markets, based on information generally available. The government maintains this freedom by making and enforcing rules against coercion, fraud, theft and other crimes. Buyers and sellers, not the market structure, have the freedom. Thus, governmental regulation, properly done, aids a free market, rather than spoiling it. Those who rail against regulation either fail to see this point or hope to confuse the issue.
 Mr. Bernstein supports bailouts in the current crisis; so do I, with emphasis on bailing out small investors and homeowners. Gerald M. Levitis
 Mahopac, N.Y., Sept. 29
 To the Editor:
 In his column, Peter L. Bernstein says that when bailouts send the message that no one will be allowed to fail, risk takers will know no limits. ''Who will see any need,'' he asks, ''to pay attention to the possible consequences for the government's budget, the market for its bonds, the taxpayers, its creditors and, indeed, the whole economic structure?''
 It sounds like a modern version of ''The Fall of the Roman Empire.'' John Cova

HEADLINE: It's a Wonderful Block

BYLINE: By MARK OPPENHEIMER. 
Mark Oppenheimer is an editor of The New Haven Review and a frequent contributor to The New York Times Magazine.

 BODY:
ON WARM EVENINGS, ESPECIALLY when the light lasts long, 11-year-old Lucy Friedman-Bell rides her Razor scooter up West Rock Avenue until she gets to the corner of West Elm Street. If she crossed West Elm and kept going, she would soon arrive at our house, where she would see me and my wife sitting on our front porch with our 1-year-old daughter, Rebekah, and her best friend, J. J. the spotted mutt, snuggled between us. But Lucy's not allowed to leave her block by herself, so she turns around and goes back toward her house, the fifth in from Yale Avenue at the other end. Before she gets there, she will pass about a dozen houses -- some on her side of the street, some across the street -- whose inhabitants know her. ''Hi, Lucy!' 
' they call, and she always waves, sometimes with the regal, cupped-hand wave of the queen, and shouts in her small voice, ''Hi!'' Lucy's head is barely visible under her helmet, and people appreciate the effort it must take to call back to them. She used to make this circuit on her bicycle, but last year it was stolen. The whole street went into mourning, and we whispered to one another, ''What will Lucy do without her bike?'' But after a week of shiva, she emerged on the scooter, and all seemed well again. She does this circuit, up and down the block, every day she can, sometimes for an hour or two. ''It's my thinking time,'' she told me.
 I know a lot of the people on my street, by which I mean the two blocks of West Rock Avenue between Yale and Edgewood Avenues in New Haven, where my life seems mainly to take place. I know all six members of Lucy's family, whose nickname is the Friebellarkenthals. They are the Brady Bunch of West Rock Avenue, created when Richard Bell, who lost his wife, Trudy Friedman, to cancer five months after she gave birth to his twins, Hannah and Lucy, fell in love with Marjorie Rosenthal, whose husband, Amal Murarka, was killed in a car crash when their children, Elina and Maya, were 7 weeks and 2. The Friedman-Bell twins are fair, though otherwise they don't look alike; the Murarka girls look half Indian, a reminder of their father.
 The Friebellarkenthals live next door to Sean Smith, a consultant who is in Pennsylvania working for Barack Obama right now, and his wife, Susan Hyde, a professor at Yale. Three doors from Smith, at the corner of West Rock and Yale, lives Nancy Ahern, the last Republican to represent the Westville neighborhood on the New Haven Board of Aldermen. (She lost her seat in 2003.) Nancy moved here in 1939, when she was 3, and attended Edgewood School, which is at the end of my block, at West Rock and Edgewood. Across the street from the Friebellarkenthals live Sarwat Chaudhry and Varman Samuel, married doctors who moved here from an expensive suburb in part, Sarwat told me, because she wanted sidewalks. Two doors down from them live a family I haven't met yet but who, I hear, home-school their children.
 When Rebekah, J. J. and I try to visit the Chaudhry-Samuels, we often fail to arrive, waylaid by friends we pass on the way. Sometimes Tom Bontly, a philosopher at the University of Connecticut, or his wife, Allison Ponce, a psychologist, is the culprit. More often it's Matt Higbee, a journalist turned software entrepreneur, or his wife, Nicole Fluhr, an English professor at nearby Southern Connecticut State University, or one of their two young daughters, Tessa and Miranda.
 That's not everybody, not even close. I also know Linda Drazen and her wife, Meg Bloom -- they married in Massachusetts in August. More than 30 years ago, Meg was an early member of the cooperative day care center that still exists in the basement of the synagogue I now belong to. I know my next-door neighbors, Steve and Victoria Knezek, who bought their house in 1982 with Al Gobel, a fellow member of their charismatic prayer group who lived with them. (These days, Victoria's religion seems to be gardening.) I know Lee and Mary Faulkner, who invited us for chili during a snowstorm our first week on the street, and I know Jack Paulishen, a social-studies teacher who invites neighbors over whenever Chad Dawson, a New Haven native son and former World Boxing Council light-heavyweight champion, is fighting on TV. I know Bob the former electrical engineer, now a handyman. I know Naomi the flutist and Pattie Belle the graphic designer and Jim the concert promoter, whom I keep meaning to ask for free Steely Dan tickets.
 What surprises me is that I like knowing these people. I'm a New Englander, which means I don't smile broadly at strangers and ask how they're doing. I might borrow a cup of sugar, but if so, I'm sure to repay the debt the next day. I inherited from my father, who spent part of his childhood in the South, a deep antipathy toward the false chumminess that so often passes for neighborliness. Like many Americans, between leaving home and marriage I lived in apartments, and everything about them suited me, above all the understood transience that required of neighbors little more than polite nods when we passed in the hallways. Neighbors' responsibilities to one another included keeping the music down and curbing the dog.
 I've changed my mind for many reasons, including the obvious: I became a father, someone who understands that the people on my block are my little daughter's entire world. These other toddlers are the ones who will invite her for sleepovers in six or seven years; in their houses she will eat junk food and watch cable TV and then not tell us about it; their parents will keep her safe. So I'd better like these people around me, or at least get to trust them.
 But if that's why I've gotten to know my street, it doesn't explain why I love my street. I love my street because it works. That's a subjective proposition, of course. My street wouldn't ''work'' for people who require the quiet of the countryside or the excitement of a metropolis. An acquaintance from San Francisco recently told me he couldn't move here because we're 40 minutes from the nearest Whole Foods Market. That would never be my complaint, but I have others: the Friebellarkenthals have had three bikes stolen, not just Lucy's. West Rock Avenue is an urban street in a poor city with high taxes and struggling schools. On my block, 15 of the 42 houses are multifamily, spoiling the image that we're all homeowners here; some of those houses need a fresh coat of paint. It's no real estate agent's dream. In saying West Rock Avenue works, what I mean (I've decided after much thought) is, first, that our street values community without requiring conformity; second, that neighbors are friendly but not nosy; and, finally, that even with all of the above, there's no sense of smugness. It's neither a suburban idyll nor a hip, funky enclave. It just works.
 MY WIFE GREW UP ON THE LOWER EAST SIDE OF MANHATTAN, where she felt oppressed by the noise and crowds of city life. She read books set on the frontier, like those of Laura Ingalls Wilder, and in rural England: she liked the sense of space. She always thought she'd end up in the countryside. Now she hopes never to leave our street. We talk a lot about what makes West Rock Avenue so happy.
 Partly, it's the houses, a terrifically appealing mix of stately and modest, small and medium and big, very old and just plain old. They have a family resemblance, and many of them were even built on the same plan, but they've all been through enough owners, with the attendant additions, customizations and refittings, that each has its own character. The original farmhouse across the street from where I live is a two-story Italianate built in the mid-1870s, but most houses on the street are of a different vintage, dating to around the time of the Great War. There are a few Arts and Crafts cottages, like mine, which was built in 1930, and several three-story, multifamily houses, where the street's minority of renters live. The rich can afford to live elsewhere, but the poor might get a foothold on our street. I don't ask my neighbors what they earn, but the housing stock is conducive to economic diversity.
 Most houses are for families to buy and raise children in, but some of the rental units are occupied by single people or the retired. We have a coffee shop and an elementary school too. When I began thinking about what makes my street work, I knew that this variety helped. But I also knew that my untrained eye was missing a lot, so I asked Dolores Hayden, a Yale professor of architecture who writes about public space, to walk with me down West Rock Avenue. What, I asked her, seemed right about our street?
 ''Look at these sidewalks'' was the first thing she said, as we embarked from my house heading north toward West Elm. ''First of all, you have them. Second, they're wide enough for people to walk down two or three across, or with a stroller or a dog.'' In other words, she was saying, it's not enough to have a sidewalk -- if it's narrow, then when people approach, their urge is to squeeze past. On our street, I told her, I had seen children and dogs plop down and sit for half an hour on the sidewalk while the grown-ups talked. ''Exactly,'' she said. ''And you have a planting strip too, and people can plant things on it.'' And it's true that many of our street's avid gardeners don't just work the backs and sides of houses: they use their front yards, especially if their grass has gotten sparse.
 At the corner of West Elm, Hayden looked in both directions and said she was curious what the streets parallel to West Rock were like. ''Are they busier streets?'' she asked.
 ''Much,'' I said. ''Central Avenue goes all the way through from Whalley to Route 34, so if you're looking to get across town, you take Central. And Yale Avenue'' -- which both intersects West Rock and then curves to be parallel to it -- ''also goes all the way through, and past the Yale Bowl and the other athletic fields. So a lot of trucks use it.''
 ''See, that's important,'' Hayden said. ''You're surrounded by two streets that take up a lot of your traffic. That makes this street quieter. And people like to have conversations on quiet streets.''
 Hayden noted that most of the houses on the street had porches, which I knew was supposed to be a good thing. ''But do people use them?'' she asked. Yes, I said. It was something I'd always noticed, but it wasn't until Hayden asked that it occurred to me that a porch alone doesn't mean much. People have to use their porches, and use isn't automatic. People are more inclined to use their porches if they can speak to passers-by -- which means that the low traffic density makes the porches more desirable to use, because sitting on the porch isn't just a breath of fresh air; it's also a chance for conversation.
 As Hayden asked about the nearby streets, another thought occurred to me. Some of the more expensive streets in the Westville neighborhood, prestigious addresses like McKinley and Alston Avenues, seem less friendly, despite their beautiful houses set behind gorgeous green lawns. Is it because the lawns are too big? Fewer houses on those streets have porches anyway, but for those that do, sitting on the porch is probably a less welcoming proposition, because you're that much farther from the street. You're likely to wave, but no more. So my favorite pastime with Rebekah -- sitting on the stairs to our porch and greeting the parade of children walking to Edgewood School every morning -- wouldn't be possible if we lived on McKinley. The big kids would be too far away. And if we lived on Yale Avenue, the traffic (including the school buses, which drop off on Yale) might drown out her tiny shouts of ''Hi!'' The school, the porch, the quiet, the short distance to the street: they create the perfect conditions for the kind of friendly, frequent intercourse that brings neighbors together.
 THERE ARE ALSO, IT SO HAPPENS, THE FEATURES THAT MANY planners mention first when describing good design. In the 1980s, when they began to coalesce around their opposition to sprawl, the New Urbanists -- like Andres Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, who attended architecture school together in New Haven -- embraced old-city virtues. ''New Urbanism'' is now a term so ubiquitous as to lose meaning, but the principles listed at NewUrbanism.org give a sense of the movement: ''walkability,'' which would include the presence of sidewalks, buildings close to the street, porches and trees; ''connectivity,'' which means, among other things, a grid system rather than the cul-de-sacs popular in new developments; a mix of housing styles and prices; and, most important, high residential density, which is good for the environment and for people's social lives.
 With the drop in crime during the 1990s, people fell in love with cities again, and residents of New York -- and Boston and San Francisco -- could once more brag about their high urban density, variegated commerce and sidewalk life, all features that Jane Jacobs wrote about in her 1961 classic, ''The Death and Life of Great American Cities,'' a book influential among the New Urbanists. When she wrote, ''urban renewal'' was destroying poor neighborhoods in New Haven and elsewhere, leveling mixed-use streets to build freeways, malls and high rises; now people are reclaiming city centers, but as they do, housing floats beyond middle-class means. The vibrant, diverse urban jumble of which Jacobs wrote is not an aspect of many cities' revival. Nor is it present in an acclaimed New Urbanist development like Duany and Plater-Zyberk's famous Seaside, Fla., which looks so obviously idyllic that ''The Truman Show'' was filmed there.
 West Rock Avenue isn't part of a self-conscious renewal movement. We get our street cred the old-fashioned way: by being old. In fact, as Vincent Scully, the great Yale historian of architecture, writes in an essay about Seaside, the town may owe its existence to New Haven, whose streets inspired Duany and Plater-Zyberk when they were architecture students here. ''They led me and the rest of our class through the streets of New Haven,'' writes Scully, their old teacher. ''So we saw the posts and the porches anew, the wood stripping and the shingled surfaces, the frontal gables and, more than that, the front steps, the sidewalks, the grass verge with its trees.'' The two visionary students took their class to Edgewood Avenue -- the cross street closest to where I live -- and showed their classmates and teacher what they all could learn from architects and city planners who worked a century, even two centuries, ago. Here in New Haven, on streets like these, New Urbanism is very old.
 Our old urbanism has none of the sheen, potential for kitsch or forbiddingly high prices that have dogged the new. (In Seaside, condominiums can cost more than $1 million.) In many ways, the neighborhood has an old soul. It lacks the consumer satisfactions that citizens of bigger and richer towns expect. Our park -- Edgewood Park, 123 acres one block to the east, partly designed in 1910 by one of Frederick Law Olmsted's sons -- is beautiful, but not perfectly kempt. Our city buses, which I catch on Edgewood Avenue, are only mostly on time. The coffee shop on the corner is independently owned, but it isn't open at night. 
 These seem like fair trades.
 I LIKE THE BUILT environment, the streets and houses and sidewalks, and I love the canopy of tree leaves over the street from May to September. But looks aren't everything. There are streets nearby that are physically similar but lack the West Rock Avenue feel, which is both fragile and contingent. That's why there's something especially delightful about living on a street that you love: it's largely a matter of luck. You can do all the research in the world, but you don't know until you move there if it will feel right. And that feeling, if it comes, is like Nabokov's cradle, rocking above an abyss -- it can't last. A cute child next door becomes a teenager playing drums at all hours; a close friend is transferred across the country; a favorite dog dies. A great block is a delicate ecology, consisting of elements in perpetual flux.
 The right mix of ages, for example, can never last long. When Dolores Hayden and I were walking, she asked me about the ages of the people who lived on the street. There's a wide variety, I told her. There are 30 children on my block alone, and their parents are in their 30s and 40s and have moved here in the past 10 years. But then there are empty-nesters, like my neighbors the Knezeks and the Millers, who moved here with their young families in the early 1980s. And there are several residents who grew up on the street, including Helen Buck, who is 92 and has never lived anywhere else.
 ''That's good,'' Hayden said, ''because you want the young people for the energy, of course. Then you want slightly older people, because they know the history, and they know how to get things done too, how to get a pothole fixed or negotiate the bureaucracy downtown. The retired people, they really know the history. Also, they're the eyes on the street: they're home during the day, they make the street feel inhabited.''
 Some of the older folks provide baby-sitting for us young parents. Meg Bloom and Linda Drazen often look after little Beyla Ridky, age 2, who lives across the street with her parents, infant brother and elderly Newfoundland. When I first moved to the block, I sometimes wondered if the two families were related. And Victoria, next door to me, is always happy to chase Rebekah down the block when I'm too tired.
 My older neighbors aren't just free labor, though. They know things, in many cases things that people knew 30 years ago but that relative newcomers, like me, don't. Ten years ago, Andrea Miller fought bureaucracy as co-chairwoman of the parent-teacher association at the large urban high school her daughters attended; she'll have good counsel when we're in the school system. Meg Bloom, a sculptor and retired social worker, was part of the left-wing New Haven counterculture back when there was such a thing, and she belonged to an old food co-op and the day care co-op and worked at a health clinic. If I wanted to start something new, I would ask Meg -- although she points out that our block serves many functions for me that her wider political community served for her.
 ''Our day care community and the community of people who were politically active, our kids grew up together,'' Meg said, when I had tea with her and Linda at their house in June. ''We were tight the way this block is tight now. There were way fewer kids on the block then.''
 Meg made me think about the role of institutions, then and now. Most elementary-school-age children on our street go to Edgewood School, a magnet school where test scores are high by New Haven standards but still too low. The public schools are, along with high property taxes, the biggest deterrent to living in New Haven. Wilbur Cross High School, the city's largest public high school, used to have a reputation for violence, and although today it's said that students can get a fine education there, many parents in our neighborhood figure that eventually they'll use private schools. On a street of northeastern liberals, people aren't particularly religious, but the presence of churches and synagogues nearby makes the area feel comfortable for the observant. At least three Catholic families on the street attend St. Aedan, on nearby Fountain Street. I know of two Protestant churchgoers, and Jews in the neighborhood have a Conservative, an Orthodox and another Orthodox synagogue to choose from; at the other Orthodox synagogue, housed in an old Tudor church building, you can still hear Yiddish spoken. There's a Korean church on Harrison Street, and it rents space to a nursery school and to the New Haven branch of the Metropolitan Community Church, a gay and lesbian denomination. 
 ''There are reasons those of us who live here chose to live here,'' said Jack Paulishen, a bluff social-studies teacher who works part time as a real estate appraiser and attends St. Aedan with his wife and young son. ''I grew up in a blue-collar suburb eight miles from here -- Seymour. My wife grew up in a rural area, Burlington, in Hartford County. But we craved diversity. Michelle used to drive to the punk rock clubs in New Haven in the '80s. I think people from our hometowns thought we were a little nuts. But we have never regretted it.''
 Jack is one of the leading contenders for social director of the block, though he faces stiff competition from the Faulkners, next door, who dismantled half of their two-car garage and transformed it into a plein-air, lean-to party space, which Lee, an Australian electronics whiz and the dad of the family, jokingly calls the relaxatorium. Jack not only plays host at the TV parties when Chad Dawson is fighting on TV but also at the occasional sing-alongs where neighbors sing show tunes in his living room. But when I asked him to describe the virtues of the street where he has lived since 1998, his answer had nothing to do with his social life, and in fact his gregarious tone changed. He got serious.
 ''I never have to worry,'' Jack said, leaning forward in his easy chair, ''that when my son is a teenager, I'll get a call from a principal that my son yelled an ethnic slur at an Orthodox Jew. Or that he was upset that someone has two mommies. And the chance of me ending up next door to someone who doesn't share these values about diversity -- the chance of me living next door to a bigot -- is pretty slim.''
 Then, after his paean to diversity, he mentioned something different that drew him to West Rock Avenue. ''There's also quite a few Catholics who like to live near their church,'' he added. ''We bought this house thinking, Isn't this nice, we'll walk to church -- when we get up early enough to go, that is.''
 I related to what Jack was saying: it's nice to be near people different, and it's also nice to be near people the same. I like that there are other Jews around -- and other writers, other dads, other dog owners. I'm also glad there are gentiles, carpenters, gay couples, old people, black people and the dedicated cat lady who lives across the street.
 I'm glad for my street's diversity, but I am just as glad that we don't define ourselves by it. Living here is not a cause or a statement. There's nothing exquisitely bohemian about West Rock Avenue, nor overtly political. You don't move here for the food co-op; it's gone now, though during the summer months there's a farmers' market in Edgewood Park (where the vendors take food stamps). There's no used bookstore, no record store. The coffee shop plays big-band music, not indie rock or jazz, because that's what Carol, the owner, likes. Right now there are just two political signs in yards, and one discreetly in a window, all for Obama. Our diversity comes because some people who grew up on our street still live here, others married into the street and others found affordable houses. As I type, the house across the street from me, a three-bedroom with 1,700 square feet, is on the market for $270,000. Numbers like that are great levelers. Come as you are.
 That's Nancy Ahern's sentiment, anyway. I was talking to our street's most famous Republican beside her pool. She was looking at me with her back turned to the pool and, beyond the fence, to the house next door, where Nancy spent her childhood. She married,moved away and, after her divorce, moved into her current house in 1971 with her elderly parents, who then rented out her childhood home. For a few years, Nancy and her kids replaced the renters in the house next door, but in 1982, when her parents died, Nancy inherited and reoccupied the red house on the corner, giving her a history on West Rock Avenue that stretches from World War II. ''The street was very much like it is now,'' she said. ''That's the crazy thing about this little piece of southwest Westville. This street in particular, it continues to be where people who work in New Haven can live here and, to the extent they can, support the school.''
 One thing has changed. When Nancy was growing up next door, there was no pool here. She and her second husband, Jack, built the pool after her last child graduated from college. ''I looked at the hemlock trees and thought, We could have a pool there,'' Nancy told me. ''I felt a little bit guilty about having a pool all to ourselves, but I had read a column in Dear Abby about how a family solved the problem of unwanted visitors to their pool. They used a flagpole'' -- when Nancy's American flag is raised, the pool is open to neighbors. This way, there are still children in Nancy's life: ''I see them learn to swim in my pool.'' Nancy raised a hand to keep the sun out of her pale eyes. She squinted, felt the heat, looked around at the empty deck chairs and said, ''The flag should be up now, in fact.''

HEADLINE: Bailout Votes and the Economy Threaten to Overwhelm Other Issues

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Members of Congress headed home this weekend to try to persuade constituents that they did the right thing on the economic bailout plan, a momentous vote that injected an unpredictable new element into the climactic final weeks of the campaign season.
 The legislative, economic and political drama surrounding the approval of the $700 billion effort to free up credit markets obscured some of the other bitter conflicts and notable accomplishments of the 110th Congress -- the first Democrat-controlled Congress since 1995. Analysts and lawmakers were left wondering what the race-by-race impact of the bailout would be.
 Will lawmakers who supported the plan that initially sparked public outrage be pummeled or praised? Will those who nearly doomed the initiative and sent the markets spiraling down suffer at the hands of Americans whose portfolios took a hit, or be rewarded as guardians of tax dollars? Will those who switched their votes during a frenzied week be labeled as flip-floppers or lawmakers who saw the error of their ways? 
 ''There are tough consequences whether you vote yes or no,'' said Representative Ric Keller, a Florida Republican in a competitive race, who opposed the plan both times it came to a vote in the House. ''I have a swing district, I have people of good conscience on both sides, and I just had to vote the way I thought was best.''
 While the next month will clarify the political ramifications of the bailout, the high-profile end-of-session vote and the economy in general are threatening to overwhelm the campaign dialogue -- overshadowing the war in Iraq, energy costs, health care and other issues that could have risen to the top of the agenda.
 ''This is now the issue of the day,'' said Nathan L. Gonzales, who follows Congressional races for the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report. ''And you have candidates and coalitions all over the map.''
 After two years of Democrats running the House and Senate for the first time since the Republican takeover of the House in 1994, lawmakers on both sides do have other things to talk about. 
 Democrats will point to a hike in the minimum wage, an increase in auto mileage standards, expansive new veterans benefits, education aid and intensified oversight of the Bush administration as evidence of success. Republicans will emphasize a renewed terror surveillance law and their victory in repealing a longstanding drilling ban, while faulting Democrats as mishandling federal spending. 
 Both sides will claim credit for an economic stimulus plan that put a refund check in the hands of Americans this year. And both sides have some responsibility -- or culpability depending on one's view -- for the bailout.
 In some ways, the perception of this Congress has been shaped more by its angry tone than its actual record. Even the accomplishments were produced in a highly charged partisan atmosphere that drove down public approval and that can be traced to deep divisions over the Iraq war and a poor relationship between Democrats and a White House loathe to consider the priorities of the new power on Capitol Hill.
 ''They hadn't quite realized that we had won the election,'' said Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus.
 Republicans say Democrats reneged on their 2006 campaign pledge to run a fairer House. Democrats, newly led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, began the session in January 2007 by forcing through a string of pent-up Democratic initiatives without allowing Republicans much say, a start that colored the entire session.
 Republicans also say the new Democratic majority pushed too hard on divisive issues, like imposing a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq -- an effort Democrats failed at repeatedly.
 Despite the persistent partisan tensions, the leaders of the two parties came together in the final days of the session to put together the bailout measure at the behest of the Bush administration. But they had serious problems trying to get the rank and file to join them on a vote many lawmakers compared in magnitude to a vote for war or the 1998 vote to impeach President Clinton.
 Lawmakers in both parties, particularly those considered most vulnerable to losing their seats in November, balked at the idea of rapidly agreeing just weeks away from their re-elections to spend up to $700 billion from the Treasury to help out high-finance executives.
 Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, acknowledged that the proposal was a ''challenger's dream,'' allowing anyone running against an incumbent to rail freely against a proposal that left a sour taste with the public. 
 Challengers from both parties went on the attack. It quickly surfaced in high-profile Senate races in North Carolina and Minnesota and emerged in House contests around the country. Lawmakers noticed. 
 On the initial House vote, most of the so-called vulnerable lawmakers in both parties voted no, despite pleas for help from the leadership and the White House. On Friday, many of those in the toughest races as well as House members running for Senate rejected the measure again, though a handful of embattled lawmakers switched their votes.
 Representative Joe Knollenberg, a Michigan Republican who is a top target of Democrats, said he saw a real shift in public sentiment after Monday's House defeat and the ensuing market turmoil, prompting him to change his mind despite possible political fallout and back the bill. 
 ''This is the right vote,'' said Mr. Knollenberg, who said he had been encouraged to change by auto company executives worried about the tightening credit. ''It is tough vote, but quite honestly you are damned if you do or damned if you don't.'' 
 Representative Nancy Boyda, a first-term Democrat from Kansas who also faces a serious challenge, said she wrestled with the vote but ultimately rejected the legislation both times. ''I wasn't sure this was going to actually make a difference in the short-term, the medium-term or the long-term,'' Ms. Boyda said. ''Nothing would make me happier to be wrong.''
 The vote created some interesting political dynamics. In Minnesota, Al Franken, the Democratic Senate candidate, has criticized Senator Norm Coleman, the Republican incumbent, for supporting the measure. That stance puts Mr. Franken at odds with Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee; his party's Senate leadership; Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from the state; and the Democratic presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama.
 The fact that the party hierarchy and both presidential candidates came down so clearly in favor of the bailout could dilute its impact in the Congressional races. 
 Still, independent advocacy organizations and challengers themselves will still make use of it -- even if they share a position with their opponent.
 ''If I was in Congress today, I would have voted against the bailout as I would have the first time,'' said Sean Sullivan, a Republican challenging Representative Joe Courtney, Democrat of Connecticut, who twice voted against the bill. Mr. Knollenberg, the Michigan Republican, said he was not certain what role the bailout would ultimately play in his race. While it might be front and center now, he said, the election is a few weeks off and something else might develop.
 ''People forget in a hurry,'' he said. 
 However, $700 billion can leave quite an impression.

HEADLINE: Even a Boomtown, Dubai, Feels the Effects of a Global Crisis

BYLINE: By ROBERT F. WORTH

DATELINE: DUBAI, United Arab Emirates 

 BODY:
On the surface, this glittering Arabian boomtown seems immune to the financial crisis plaguing the global economy. 
 The skyline still bristles with cranes -- an estimated 20 percent of the world's total -- and the papers are full of ads promoting spectacular new building projects. On Sept. 24, tourists from around the world flocked to the opening of Atlantis, a gargantuan, pink, $1.5 billion resort hotel built on an artificial, palm-shaped island. There was no shortage of people willing to pay as much as $25,000 a night for a room, to gaze at the sharks and rays in a vast glass-lined aquarium in the lobby and to dine at marquee restaurants like Nobu and Brasserie Rostang. 
 But as recession looms in the West, cracks are appearing in the oil-fueled boom that has made Dubai, with its futuristic skyscrapers on the turquoise waters of the Persian Gulf, a global byword for unfettered growth. 
 Banks are reining in lending, casting a pall over corporate finance and building plans. Oil prices have been dropping. Stock markets across the region have been falling since June. After insisting for days that the oil-rich Persian Gulf region was fully ''insulated'' from financial troubles abroad, the Emirates' Central Bank made about $13.6 billion available on Sept. 22 to ease credit problems, in an echo of bailout measures in the United States. Already, some bankers are saying it is not enough. 
 Some of Dubai's more extravagant building projects -- the ever-bigger malls, islands and indoor ski slopes -- are likely to be dropped if they do not already have financing lined up, bankers say. The credit crisis could also reduce demand from buyers, who will have a harder time getting mortgages.
 The shrinkage will be more severe if the financial crisis worsens in the West. Property prices and rents, which have remained steady until now, are widely expected to start dropping soon. 
 At the same time, investor confidence has been harmed by a long string of high-level corporate scandals, jeopardizing Dubai's long-term ambition of becoming a regional financial capital. 
 ''Plenty of people are worried,'' said Gilbert Bazi, 25, a real estate broker from Lebanon who moved here a year ago. ''They are waiting to see if what happened in the United States will happen here.'' 
 When he first arrived, Mr. Bazi said, making money was almost absurdly easy. ''Iranians, Russians, Europeans -- everybody was buying,'' he said. ''I didn't have to call people; they were calling me.'' 
 Now, Mr. Bazi stalks the lobbies of hotels, trying to find clients.
 ''The market is sleeping,'' he said. 
 In fairness, Dubai still looks rosy when set against the financial turmoil elsewhere. Although it lacks the oil wealth of its sister emirate Abu Dhabi, Dubai has huge budget and current account surpluses, and the government of the Emirates federation is able and willing -- like its Persian Gulf neighbors -- to inject an almost unlimited amount of money into the system to ease credit problems. 
 The governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar have reaped so much profit from oil and gas in recent years that they are more worried about how to spend it than about managing any downturn. But the Persian Gulf's governments face real economic challenges, albeit ones that are profoundly different from those in the West.
 Until recently, credit in Dubai was growing by 49 percent a year, according to the Emirates' Central Bank -- a rate almost double that of bank deposits' growth. That unnerved some bankers here, who felt it could lead to a collapse. 
 ''In the U.S., the challenge is about keeping the banks going,'' said Marios Maratheftis, chief economist for Standard Chartered Bank. ''Here, the economy has been overheated, a correction is needed, and it's about making sure the slowdown happens in a smooth, orderly manner.''
 If that sounds like an easy problem to have, consider the manic vicissitudes of Dubai's real estate market. Speculators often got bank loans to put down 10 percent on a property that had not yet been built, only to flip it for a huge profit to another buyer, who would do the same thing, and on and on. That was easy to do when housing prices here were surging so fast that some properties multiplied tenfold in value in just a few years. 
 But the Dubai authorities began getting nervous about this and imposed new regulations this summer to limit speculation. 
 Many analysts say the slowdown in Dubai's economy, assuming it does not worsen to a slump, will make the city's growth more sustainable and healthy by reducing its dependence on loans and speculation.
 Similarly, the authorities hope that recent arrests in corporate scandals will root out the culture of corruption that plagues so many Arab countries. Some of those arrested have been Emiratis with connections to the ruling family, in a gesture clearly intended to send the message that no one is exempt. 
 As Dubai's frenzied growth slows, whether there is a hard or soft landing will depend in great part on the banks, the link between the region's declining stock markets and its still-thriving property sector. 
 ''Banks will have to start lending to end-users,'' said Robert McKinnon, a real estate analyst and head of equity research at Al Mal Capital here, referring to people who actually plan on occupying properties as opposed to trading them for profit. ''There are some questions about how the banks will handle that transition.'' 
 At worst, if the global economy worsened and some Dubai banks failed, there would be a firm crutch to lean on. In the early 1980s, after several Dubai banks stumbled, the government rescued them and relaunched them as the Emirates Bank International. In the early 1990s, two more banks were rescued. At that time, of course, Dubai was far smaller. The repercussions of such a government bailout today would be far more damaging to Dubai's image as the epicenter of Persian Gulf development.
 The government cushion appears to be part of the reason most local people do not seem anxious right now. 
 ''We don't worry about it,'' said Hassan al-Hassani, 26, a civil engineer and an Emirati citizen, who was drinking coffee late Wednesday night with relatives and friends at a faux-Bedouin-style tent, set up among Dubai's hypermodern skyscrapers in honor of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. ''Maybe it's good for things to calm down.'' 
 A few yards away, guests admired a miniature model of a new residential and commercial Dubai development called the City of Arabia, which includes what will be -- if it is really built -- the biggest mall in the world. 
 ''Sometimes we wonder, will people really come to live in these places?'' Mr. Hassani asked. But he quickly brushed off the thought with a smile, reminding his listener that native Emiratis -- unlike the foreigners, who make up a majority of Dubai's 1.3 million residents -- have a different perspective. 
 ''Remember, 30 years ago almost nobody had phones here,'' he said. ''There was maybe one tall building. My family only had one car.''

BYLINE: By ELSA DIXLER

 BODY:
BORN STANDING UP: A Comic's Life, by Steve Martin. (Scribner, $15.) Martin's engaging ''biography . . . about someone I used to know'' revisits his roughly 18 years as a stand-up comedian. (He quit in 1981.) In a memoir that is ''smart, serious, heartfelt and confessional without being maudlin,'' as Janet Maslin described it in The Times, Martin explains how he developed his act, what worked, what didn't and why. ''What if there were no punch lines?'' Martin asked himself. ''What if I created tension and never released it?'' I always knew Steve Martin was smart, but I never knew he was this smart. 
 SONS AND OTHER FLAMMABLE OBJECTS, by Porochista Khakpour. (Grove, $14.) This first novel, about a family who fled revolutionary Iran to settle in a Southern California apartment complex called Eden Gardens, deals with familiar themes -- father versus son, assimilation versus cultural allegiance. But Khakpour's biting humor and acute observations bring her characters to vivid life as they struggle to escape or cope with the past. 
 THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS: 50 Years Reporting in Washington, by Robert D. Novak. (Three Rivers, $18.95.) Novak's career as a political reporter, syndicated columnist, television commentator and leading character in the outing of the C.I.A. officer Valerie Plame is the subject of this interesting book. It ''dishes gossip and delivers payback to enemies for ancient slights,'' our reviewer, Jack Shafer, said; it also illustrates Novak's ''symbiotic'' (as he puts it) relationship with his sources. 
 PONTOON: A Novel of Lake Wobegon, by Garrison Keillor. (Penguin, $14.) Keillor's fictional town ''has always sat a little closer to Winesburg than Mayberry,'' Thomas Mallon wrote in the Book Review, and readers who venture there in search of nostalgia will ''be brought up short by surprisingly large measures of sadness and dread.'' The protagonist of this installment, a widow for 19 years, is discovered, after her death, to have had a lover. Like Keillor, she realizes ''there are no answers, just stories.'' 
 GOOD CALORIES, BAD CALORIES: Fats, Carbs, and the Controversial Science of Diet and Health, by Gary Taubes. (Anchor, $16.95.) The low-fat-diet orthodoxy was first challenged by Taubes in a much-debated article in The New York Times Magazine in 2002. There, and in this book, Taubes shows convincingly that the hypothesis that dietary fat causes heart disease, which gathered strength in the 1970s and '80s, was based on flimsy science. Taubes believes that a diet rich in protein and fat but low in carbohydrates is best and that weight gain is not determined only by ''calories in minus calories out.'' 
 THE INDIAN CLERK, by David Leavitt. (Bloomsbury, $16.) When S. Ramanujan, a clerk from Madras who was a gifted mathematician, went to Cambridge at the invitation of the brilliant G. H. Hardy, he became a celebrity with various dons competing for his society. Unlike most American writers, Leavitt is keenly interested in class, and his seventh novel explores the betrayal of an outsider by an insider, who struggles for the rest of his life with the consequences. 
 THE MASCOT: Unraveling the Mystery of My Jewish Father's Nazi Boyhood,by Mark Kurzem. (Plume, $16.) When Kurzem was an Oxford student, his father revealed that he was Jewish, not Russian, and asked his son to help him uncover his Holocaust past. Kurzem discovered that his father, who was probably 5 when he witnessed his mother's murder, had become the mascot of a troop of Nazi soldiers. ''This is a book to keep you up at night,'' Dinitia Smith wrote in The Times. An equally absorbing story of survival is told in THE ZOOKEEPER'S WIFE: A War Story,by Diane Ackerman. (Norton, $14.95.) The keeper of the Warsaw Zoo -- a lieutenant in the clandestine Polish Army -- and his wife smuggled Jews out of the ghetto and hid them in the zoo, saving 300 lives. (Ackerman is pictured at right.) One who did not survive was Petr Ginz, a teenager from Prague who kept a diary of his life in that city until he was taken to Theresienstadt. The voice in THE DIARY OF PETR GINZ: 1941-1942,edited by Chava Pressburger, translated by Elena Lappin (Grove, $16), is very different from Anne Frank's; Petr offers an unsentimental perspective on his changing world, with a sense of alarm only occasionally slipping through. (Pressburger is Ginz's sister.) 
 THE MYTH OF THE RATIONAL VOTER: Why Democracies Choose Bad Policies, by Bryan Caplan. (Princeton University, $17.95.) ''I see neither well-functioning democracies nor democracies hijacked by special interests,'' Caplan, a teacher of economics at George Mason University, says. ''Instead, I see democracies that fall short because voters get the foolish policies they ask for.'' His provocative book identifies four areas of ''systematic error'' by voters, all related to economics. 
 DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, by Eavan Boland. (Norton, $13.95.) In her 10th book of poetry, Boland writes about Ireland, the relations between men and women, erotic passion, and the link between the personal and the political. ''Nothing we said / not then, not later / fathomed what it is / is wrong in the lives of those who hate each other,'' she writes in the title poem.

HEADLINE: For the Repo Man, Business Is Brisk

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
AS the economy sours and people fall behind on their monthly payments for cars, motorcycles, soft-serve ice-cream machines and even barber's chairs, the repossession industry is getting a growing number of calls to return leveraged items to the banks that own them.
 Since 2007, repossessions in the metropolitan area have risen about 25 percent, according to bank analysts, law enforcement officials and officials in the repo industry, which is also known as collateral recovery and skip tracing. 
 ''Our employees aren't exactly out buying Lamborghinis or yachts, but yes, we're up,'' said Ron Giordano, a manager of Past Due Recovery. The company's territory includes New Jersey's Essex and Hudson Counties, though Mr. Giordano declined to reveal the exact neighborhood of his storage yards for fear that people angry about losing their cars might show up looking for them.
 The company is receiving up to 50 orders a day, which is triple the number of a year ago, said Mr. Giordano, who has worked in the business for 12 years. To meet the increased demand, his staff has added employees, he said, and increased the fleet to seven tow trucks from five.
 Even though the drivers of these high-tech trucks can stealthily hook vehicles without getting out of their cabs, confrontations do occur. One man whose 2005 Lexus sport-utility vehicle was being repossessed recently crushed its windshield with a baseball bat, Mr. Giordano said.
 ''It's real emotional to some people,'' he said.
 In past downturns, cars have made up the bulk of what repo men picked up, and during this go-around, by wide margins, that trend has held, repossession officials said; indeed, 80 percent of Past Due's repossessions are vehicles, Mr. Giordano said. 
 But boats, which historically have been purchased by people who kept up their payments, are now being recovered, too, said Brad Ferguson, co-owner of Northeast Marine Liquidation, in Stonington, Conn.
 This year, his business, which focuses exclusively on watercraft, from Maryland to Maine, will seize about 250 boats, up from 200 last year, Mr. Ferguson said. It is the largest spike in 16 years for Mr. Ferguson, who has added three employees to handle the increase.
 Banks can pay up to $2,000 for each boat repossessed, especially if it is more than 30 feet long and requires fuel and a captain to move, and there are outstanding marina fees, Mr. Ferguson said. Cars, meanwhile, command about $400, though more if they are, say, partly buried in a fit of rebellion in someone's backyard, industry officials said.
 But banks typically want to avoid repossessions, as the cars are usually worth less than what is owed, said Carol Kaplan, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association, a trade group for commercial banks.
 The costs of repo men and the paperwork to transfer ownership of the vehicle are additional disincentives, she added.
 ''Nobody gains but the repo guy,'' Ms. Kaplan said.
 But auto repossessions show no signs of flagging. In 2007, 2.15 out of every 1,000 cars with outstanding indirect auto loans -- which are the kind offered by dealers and which make up 90 percent of all auto loans -- were repossessed each month, according to the bankers association. That is up from 1.82 cars per 1,000 outstanding loans in 2006.
 ''And until the jobs picture improves, we will not see consumer delinquencies improve,'' said James Chessen, chief economist with the association.
 Banks, then, are being more flexible about repayment schedules, letting buyers postpone payments for a few months without penalty and lowering interest rates on their loans, he said.
 But banks' efforts do not seem to be stemming the repossession tide yet, said Michael Gouldsbury, owner of East End Asset Management, in Center Moriches in Suffolk County.
 In fact, buyers seem more resigned about losing their cars than ever. Voluntary surrenders, when people willingly hand over the keys, now account for 45 percent of all of Mr. Gouldsbury's repossessions, compared with 30 percent last year. 
 Plus, the number of cars that are ultimately redeemed -- when owners pay their past-due payments plus fees to get their vehicles back -- has sharply decreased; three years ago, owners redeemed about 45 percent of their cars, versus 15 percent today, Mr. Gouldsbury said.
 ''People are realizing that there's no light at the end of the tunnel,'' he said.
 The recent increase in work notwithstanding, many repo men and women complain that it is getting tougher to do their job. 
 High fuel costs are taking a toll, especially when tracking down one vehicle may require a dozen trips, they said. 
 Burnout is high, too, as worries about safety win out, said Robert McCrie, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan. Since 1986, about 25 of his students have worked as repo men after graduating, though many lasted only a few years, he said.
 ''They had a feeling that one day their luck might run out in the event they can't outrun this hostile delinquent debtor,'' Mr. McCrie said.
 Plus, in today's market, competitors -- often inexperienced -- are flooding the field, industry veterans say. Thrusting relative amateurs into a potentially dangerous line of work often presents problems in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, where the industry is unregulated, they said. 
 The law says that cars can be repossessed only if there is no breach of peace, like breaking into a garage. To make sure newcomers operate within the law, some police departments are encouraging repo men to share more information.
 In New York, where repossessions are supposed to be reported in person at the local precinct after the fact, the Village of Westbury and the City of White Plains are asking repo men to tell them before any seizure. The rationale is to cut down on unnecessary emergency calls to people's homes, in the event the owner reports the car stolen, officials said.
 ''It helps with the appropriate use of resources,'' said Capt. Frank Cariello, a spokesman for the Yonkers Police Department, which since 2004 has requested that repo men check in by radio before hauling cars away. 
 ''It saves some time and increases safety of everybody involved,'' he said.

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
 AMERICAN enthusiasm for the Paris Motor Show, which opened for press previews on Thursday, has generally been tempered by a dearth of French autos in the United States. Most Americans don't remember Citroen, Peugeot and Renault; long-running efforts to sell their cars in the United States met repeated failure. 
 But this year's Paris show, which is open to the public through Oct. 19 at the Porte de Versailles convention center here, offers a good deal of relevance to American car buyers.
 That's because many of the nearly four dozen new vehicles being introduced here use the latest hybrid, electric, clean diesel or fuel-cell-powered technologies. Some are destined for the American market, including a few as soon as next spring. 
 Perhaps the most notable model among this year's Parisian fashions is the 2009 Honda Insight. Honda is reviving the Insight name for a small hybrid sedan that it said would take the measure of the Toyota Prius on price, utility and fuel economy. Although the Insight was described as a concept vehicle here, the car that Honda plans to start selling in the United States next year will look very similar.
 The production version of the Chevrolet Volt, star debutante of General Motors' 100th anniversary celebration in Detroit last month, had its international auto-show debut in Paris -- odd considering its all-American image. 
 General Motors also had its thumb in other Paris pies. From Chevrolet came the cute compact Cruze, which goes on sale in Europe next spring and is one of Chevy's most important new models. Opel (Saturn to you, America) introduced the Eco-Flex Sports Tourer, a further evolution of its alternative-fuel concepts. 
 Ford, on the other hand, seems to have few cars of real interest here: a racier Focus, a thriftier Fiesta and a redesigned Ka. The Ka is a cheeky little car (say it with your best Boston accent) that has built something of a cult following in Europe in its 12 years on the market here. It once looked as if Ford might bring the fuel-efficient little rascal to the United States, but it quashed those hopes at this show. 
 Ignoring economic realities at the other end of the scale was Lamborghini, which will bring out a new four-door supercar, the Estoque, despite gale warnings on the economy. Ferrari introduced the California, its first convertible with a retracting hardtop. A lavishly sleek concept wagon called the Fascination twirled around on the Mercedes-Benz stand; BMW proudly showed its new flagship 7 Series, hybrid powertrains available upon request.

HEADLINE: Housing Stack

BYLINE: By SALLY McGRANE

 BODY:
With Pile Up, an apartment-building design concept patented both in Europe and in the United States, the 78-year-old Swiss architect Hans Zwimpfer has come up with what he thinks is a solution to the problem of suburban sprawl and the long commutes and pollution that come with it. Take single-family houses, whose benefits -- space, privacy, light, a yard -- suburbanites are loath to give up. Then simply stack the houses, one on top of another. Voila: The comforts of suburban living, with the convenience and ecological benefits of urban density. 
 Pile Up was born seven years ago, when Zwimpfer set out to write a book about the problems of contemporary urban planning (or the lack thereof). He quickly realized that there were already plenty of similar books out there, but few real solutions. ''You can't just criticize,'' Zwimpfer says. ''You have to show people how it can be done.''
 He put pencil to paper and began drawing. What he came up with is an unusually shaped apartment unit -- like a capital L rotated 90 degrees, so that its short leg is vertical. In order to provide a single-family dwelling's sense of spaciousness and natural light, each apartment has a section that is two stories high, in the vertical leg of the L. Open-air terraces are also in this lofted area, so that residents don't feel cramped in their outdoor space.
 Then there was the question of flexibility. A suburbanite living in a free-standing house can always tack on an addition or renovate the attic for more space -- not options in an apartment building. Zwimpfer's solution was to make, as much as possible, only the outer walls of the units load-bearing. That means that the interior floor plans can not only be dictated by the resident but can also be reconfigured over time to accommodate changing lifestyles and needs. 
 Overall, the costs aren't much more than a typical apartment complex. Zwimpfer's office estimates that Pile Up buildings cost about 6 percent more than other structures of comparable size and finish.
 So far, four Pile Up projects have been built in Switzerland, with three more in the works there. Developments are also under discussion in Austria, Germany, France, Luxembourg, Libya and South Africa. The patent dictates that the L-shaped units must have the same relative dimensions, but they can be built on larger or smaller scales, for luxury or more economical developments. To maintain density without losing what Zwimpfer calls ''human scale'' proportions, the buildings will range in height from at least 4 to no more than 20 piled-up units.
 Beat Schreiber, who moved into a Pile Up building in Rheinfelden, Switzerland, with his wife and two teenage children, says that the flexibility of the floor plan was a big draw. He is already thinking about how he will renovate when his teenage daughter moves out in a few years. He has his eye on a wall in her bedroom that he plans to take out to make room for a new lounge. Schreiber is quick to add: ''She won't be forced out. She's welcome to stay as long as she wants.''

HEADLINE: A New Term for the World Leader

BYLINE: By CHERYL JENSEN

DATELINE: STOWE, Vt. 

 BODY:
 FORGET tawdry profit motives. More than 40 years ago, when Tatsuo Hasegawa was chief engineer for the very first Toyota Corolla, he described his work as a quest ''for the welfare and happiness'' of the entire world.
 Since his original model went on sale in Japan in 1966 -- it reached American shores two years later -- the Corolla has laid claim to being the planet's best-selling line of passenger cars. And while Mr. Hasegawa's admirable goal of worldwide happiness remains elusive, at least the new 10th-generation Corolla can improve the general welfare by conserving fossil fuels.
 The Corolla LE achieved 32 m.p.g. over all in Consumer Reports' real-world tests and 40 m.p.g. on the highway. The magazine called that ''among the best gas mileage C.R. has seen in a conventional gasoline-powered car with an automatic transmission.'' 
 I also tested a 2009 Corolla LE, the best-selling version, with the same 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine and 4-speed automatic transmission. Federal fuel economy estimates are 27 m.p.g. in town, 35 on the highway and 30 combined. 
 I took the Corolla on a loop through Vermont that included a stretch on Interstate 89 to Burlington, a segment on two-lane roads from South Hero to North Hero on Grand Isle in Lake Champlain, then a twisty-turny drive on Route 108 that included a brisk ascent to Smuggler's Notch on the way to Stowe. For the trip, which included mountain roads that penalize fuel economy, I averaged slightly less than 38 m.p.g. 
 Aside from admirable mileage, the new Corolla is a good all-around choice among compact cars, which is not damning it with faint praise. 
 This is, in a sense, the universal car: With two 4-cylinder engines, five trim levels and a choice of transmissions, there is a Corolla for just about everyone. Prices start at $15,910 (including the $660 delivery charge) for the Standard model with a manual transmission and rise to $19,420 for the XRS.
 A 5-speed manual transmission is standard with both engines. Aside from the 4-speed automatic, which is available with the 1.8-liter engine, a 5-speed automatic is offered with the 2.4 engine. 
 By happenstance, I also had a new Honda Civic test car available for comparison while I was testing the Corolla LE. I also sampled the sportier XRS.
 My LE test car started at $16,650, including the automatic. A few options, including electronic stability control ($250), brought the total to $18,453.
 At no time during my 350-mile test loop did I feel that the 132-horsepower engine was wimpy or inadequate. Although this engine was used in the previous-generation Corolla, it has been re-engineered and now has variable valve timing ''with intelligence,'' to improve performance and fuel economy.
 The reworking makes for a fairly responsive engine that works well with the 4-speed automatic. But the small engine could benefit from a 5-speed automatic (like the one in the Civic or the Corolla with the larger engine).
 This year, for the first time, the Corolla has electric power steering, and the system varies the amount of power assist depending on the speed of the car.
 While electric steering has been around a while, a common complaint is that it can feel numb. But that wasn't the case with the Corolla. My LE had decent road feel, although the steering hardly felt sporty.
 Corolla shoppers who want a sportier-feeling car can turn to the XRS, which has the 158-horsepower 2.4-liter engine. Its steering and suspension are tuned differently for more driver engagement. A strut-tower brace connects the front shock towers, giving the XRS a more rigid feel. The tradeoff is a slightly harsher ride.
 The Standard, LE and up-level XLE take a more relaxed approach with a suspension that is compliant without being sloppy. But like most front-drive cars, the Corolla can feel nose-heavy on turns, as was the case on some thread-the-needle curves on the way to Smuggler's Notch.
 But here is a refreshing change: this is a redesign that grew very little. The 2009 Corolla is a fraction of an inch longer than the last generation, and an inch lower. It did get wider by 2.5 inches, providing a bit more hip and shoulder room.
 The Civic beats the Corolla by a bit in headroom and legroom, except in the rear. The Corolla's 36.3 inches of rear legroom exceeds the Civic's 34.6 inches, and the Corolla's flat floor is more comfortable for passengers stuck in the back. The Corolla has a whopping 16.6 cubic feet of trunk space, while the Civic has only 12.
 The Corolla's rear seatbacks can be folded, but it's not a one-step process. Because this is a compact car, and the rear seats have head restraints, it is necessary to scoot the front seats forward before flipping down the rear seatbacks. Then the front seats have to be moved back so that you can drive the car. The Civic is the same way, though with its new Fit, Honda found a way for the rear seat to fold no matter how the front seat is set.
 While Honda gave the latest Civic an interior that is more youthful-looking and fun, the Corolla's cabin is quite conventional. It also loses econo-elegance points because it looks as if it were dipped in plastic. The furry seat upholstery in my test car seemed low-rent. 
 But interior storage is good, with nooks and crannies to hold the stuff that Americans haul around. There is even a storage bin above the glovebox. 
 Front, side and head-curtain air bags are all standard, as are active head restraints that move up and forward in a crash to protect against whiplash. Antilock brakes are standard on all models. Stability control, which helps to keep the car from skidding out of control, is standard only on the XRS. It is a stand-alone $250 option on other models.
 In crash tests by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration the Corolla received four of five possible stars in front crash protection for both driver and passenger. In the side crash tests, the Corolla got five stars for protecting the driver but only four stars for rear passengers. 
 In more severe frontal tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Corolla received the highest rating of ''good.'' 
 With its emphasis on safety, practicality and economy, the new Corolla seems more in tune with the times than ever. In 2007, the outgoing model had its best year ever in the United States even though it was the final year in the car's model cycle. So even in a grim economy the new version should have no trouble building on the Corolla's total cumulative global sales of 34.4 million.
 Clearly this is a car that has satisfied a lot of people. As for bringing about a global state of happiness, at least the Corolla is making an effort.
 INSIDE TRACK: Something for everyone.

HEADLINE: Older Residents Gain in School Tax Relief

BYLINE: By JULI S. CHARKES

DATELINE: White Plains 

 BODY:
 GARLAN GLOVER, 88, is looking forward to the rebate check due to come his way next month. The check -- for about $1,180 -- is part of the School Tax Relief program, known as STAR, which helps residents offset property taxes. As in past years, the money will help Mr. Glover, a widower who lives in a house here that he helped build in 1954, cover the cost of some basics: groceries, heating and electricity. 
 ''It goes toward regular living,'' he said. ''It goes in a great big hurry.'' 
 This year, it may go further, thanks to one factor: Mr. Glover's age. Unlike the checks for Basic STAR recipients, those for homeowners 65 and older -- known as Enhanced STAR -- are 40 percent higher than last year, said Thomas Bergin of the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance. His office will begin mailing out those checks this month. About 14 percent of Westchester's residents are 65 or older.
 The increase helps Mr. Glover and others like him at a time when the state is decreasing STAR exemption aid to school districts. That reduction is resulting in higher school taxes for most residents -- and offsetting the STAR rebates.
 Last spring, state lawmakers voted to decrease STAR exemptions to school districts by 10 percent, though reductions of more than 5 percent in a given year were previously prohibited. At the same time, lawmakers increased the rebate to homeowners 65 and older.
 The decision, part of the effort to balance the state budget, saved the state $110 million, said Geoffrey Gloak, spokesman for the State Office of Real Property Services. ''In a time of fiscal crisis, we saved the state millions of dollars,'' he said. 
 Local legislators said the move served as a corrective measure, an attempt to bring STAR payments in line with home values that have risen in Westchester.
 ''Essentially, over the course of time, as property values increased and as STAR payments did not drop, this was an attempt to put STAR back in line with property values,'' said Assemblywoman Amy Paulin, whose district includes Scarsdale, Eastchester and portions of White Plains and New Rochelle. 
 Ms. Paulin pointed to overall gains that Westchester school districts received in the same budget cycle. Overall state aid to Westchester schools increased this year by 9.6 percent, bringing the total to about $625 million, according to the State Education Department -- the most state education aid awarded to the county in the past 10 years. 
 But the decreased STAR aid to schools means homeowners across the board will pay more in school taxes as districts pass on the costs in order to maintain the budgets passed last April, school officials said.
 In White Plains, for example, state cuts in STAR aid meant an additional $1 million in taxes was passed on to homeowners, an increase of about 2 percent, said Fred Seiler, the school district's assistant superintendent for business. 
 That amount is part of the tax bill paid in July and January by residents of White Plains. For the year, the increase averages out to about $80 more in taxes for the average homeowner in the city, although it could be as much as $200 for owners of more valuable homes.
 Lloyd Tasch, the White Plains city assessor, said the 10 percent cut came as a surprise and would affect almost everyone in the community. ''It was a major change,'' he said.
 The STAR exemption cuts come as new figures released by the American Community Survey of the Census Bureau show that Westchester has the highest taxes of any county in the country, a situation that William M. Mooney Jr., executive director of the Westchester County Association, called untenable. ''With these tax increases, the economic vitality of this county is going to be hurt,'' he said. 
 School officials said the increased taxes that would result from the decision to cut STAR exemption aid would have a nominal effect on residents.
 But Mr. Mooney cautioned that the tax burden on residents had the potential to threaten Westchester's ability to attract and retain businesses and residents, which is further threatened by the economic crisis playing out across the country. 
 ''In this financial time, every dollar means something,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Mall Set to Open, and Worry Persists

BYLINE: By STEWART AIN

DATELINE: Deer Park 

 BODY:
 WHEN Tanger Outlets at the Arches opens later this month, it will be the first new mall on Long Island in 30 years. The mall will have dozens of stores with more coming, a 15-screen multiplex, an IMAX theater, a health club and, in winter, an outdoor ice skating rink.
 It will also add congestion to a traffic-choked area where four towns converge, nearby residents contend, and will be opening in the teeth of a languishing economy. 
 The developers say they are not worried about the economy. Outlet malls like theirs are made for hard financial times as consumers ''place more emphasis on price and value,'' said Janine H. Nebons, general manager of Tanger Factory Outlet Center, a sister operation in Riverhead. 
 Another of the developers -- David Blumenfeld, vice president of Blumenfeld Development Group in Syosset, which is an equal partner in the project with Tanger and Apollo Real Estate Advisors in New York -- said he was confident that the $10 million in road improvements the developers are paying for would prove successful in managing traffic.
 Still, residents are skeptical.
 Laura J. Mansi, president of the Four Towns Civic Association, said all of the elected officials she had met with had told her the mall, which is in Babylon but borders Huntington, Islip and Smithtown, ''will be the worst traffic nightmare on Long Island.'' Seven big-box stores, including a Wal-Mart, a Home Depot and a Marshalls, operate just three miles north of the Arches.
 The mall entrance is off Commack Road, about three miles south of the Long Island Expressway. That stretch of road is primarily a single lane in each direction. Other access points are located on the Sagtikos State Parkway and the Southern State Parkway.
 ''By the developers' own admissions, the project will bring almost 3,000 cars per peak hour,'' said James W. Ptucha, vice president of the civic association. ''Certainly that is a lot of cars to bring to any area, but what makes this problem so acute is the location.''
 The mall, scheduled to open Oct. 23, will bring in new tax revenue, he said, but not enough to compensate for the traffic problems. The developers are getting a 10-year tax abatement, after which the Town of Babylon projects $10.9 million in property tax revenue in 2019.
 William Hillman, chief engineer of the Suffolk County Department of Public Works, said that the county, the Town of Babylon and the state all took part in a traffic review but ''couldn't agree on how they thought traffic would go to the location.'' The project ''definitely will have an impact on traffic,'' he said, ''but I don't think the dire predictions from the community will be realized.''
 Mr. Hillman said that once the mall is completed, within the next two years, the developers would be required to conduct a six-month study to assess the original assumptions about traffic. If changes are needed, the developers will have to make them, he said.
 The population is large enough that there should be no shortage of cars on the roads. Mr. Blumenfeld said there were 350,000 residents within a mile of the mall. That puts the Arches in a more densely populated area than the operation in Riverhead, a 169-store manufacturers' outlet center that opened in 1994. 
 Both shopping centers are built on 800,000 square feet and have a comparable amount of parking -- about 4,700 spaces -- but the similarities end there. 
 Tanger Factory Outlet is strictly a manufacturers' outlet center with food courts, while the Arches will have not only outlet stores but also a full-price Old Navy, restaurants (Johnny Rockets, Nathan's, and Chipotle, a Mexican eatery), the theaters showing first-run movies and the health club. 
 Ms. Nebons said that the Arches, a $300 million project, would open with 30 to 40 stores and that the developers hoped to have the mall finished and all 60 establishments open by the end of 2009. Its anchor stores will be the Neiman Marcus Last Call Clearance Center, with designer merchandise previously stocked in its full-price stores and selling for 30 to 65 percent off; and the Christmas Tree Shops, a bargain-price retailer of home decor, giftware, housewares and seasonal products.
 Mr. Blumenfeld said that because the new mall is closer to the population than most outlet centers, it ''needs to act as a regional mall as well as an outlet mall.'' He noted that the nearest existing malls -- the Walt Whitman Mall in Huntington and the South Shore Mall in Bay Shore -- are 12 to 15 miles away.
 Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, the Island's largest business group, said discount stores do better than full-price stores during hard economic times.
 ''Wal-Mart stores are doing well, and all discounters are doing well,'' Dr. Kamer said. ''People who do not normally go to Riverhead will go to Deer Park. Whether they will buy as much as they would have a few years ago is hard to predict, but we see that shoppers are cutting back.'' The entertainment features should help, she said.
 Tanger said in a statement that the mall's 18-month construction was expected to create 2,000 construction jobs generating $97 million in wages. The Arches are expected to create 1,500 permanent jobs, Ms. Nebons said.
 Steven C. Bellone, the Babylon Town supervisor, said that the most important aspect of the Arches' opening was the huge injection of property tax revenue the mall would provide, removing some of the burden of local property taxes, fire and school and town taxes, from residents.

A CURE FOR NIGHT
 By Justin Peacock
 341 pp. Doubleday. $24.95
 Joel Deveraux is a sad young lawyer. While taking a break from writing memos, he gets mixed up with the wrong paralegal. She's blond, waifish, connected. He never leaves the office. Together, they take heroin chic too far. There's a scandal, and when Joel is removed from his elite Manhattan law firm he seeks refuge in a gentler land across the river, where the rent is cheaper, the air is redolent with Elliott Smith songs and everyone gets a second chance: Brooklyn. 
 Joel finds work in the public defender's office, helping the junior thugs in the city's drug trade avoid serious jail time. He keeps his head down and his nose clear, and soon gets the opportunity to assist on a tabloid murder case. It's a juicy one: white victim, black suspect and the requirement that he spend hours with the one hot lawyer in the office. Her name is Myra Goldstein. She's older, has ''dark, unruly'' hair and listens to Sleater-Kinney in her old Volvo. In the movie, she would be played by Catherine Keener. One guess who would play Joel. If you guessed Mark Ruffalo, go directly to Hollywood. 
 When the two lawyers begin their investigation, the novel finds its stride. ''A Cure for Night'' is the first novel from Justin Peacock, a young lawyer turned writer. That's a fine tradition, and Peacock makes a discerning choice of mentor. He forgoes the flashier precincts of John Grisham, where all is conspiracy and the legalese is leavened with bombs and gunplay, and heads toward Scott Turow country, where characters get enmeshed in the murky, moral corners of the actual law. 
 Peacock has Myra and Joel begin their case at Square 1, meeting their wary client, Lorenzo Tate, in a drab room on Rikers Island. ''No disrespect to you all,'' he asks, ''but do I need to be getting the money for a real lawyer?'' Myra informs him that a real lawyer would cost around $50,000 for a case like his. And so the precision details begin, with Peacock guiding us through the mechanics of criminal law as it applies to America's underclass. Myra and Joel quickly dispense with the facts of the murder case. They don't need to determine if Tate is innocent -- although it gnaws at them a little bit. Their job is to engage in a battle of storytelling, the defense versus the prosecution. 
 Myra and Joel's search for an alternate story takes them to the projects, where Peacock drops his knowledge of the social and financial networks of the drug trade. (He seems familiar with the work of Sudhir Venkatesh, who studies the underground economy of the urban poor.) Some of these episodes are marred by painful Ebonics -- let's declare a limit of one ''true that'' per scene in all future ''street'' dialogue -- but they come off as real enough. Peacock is better at trial, where he shows the electricity of confrontation inside a courtroom. 
 Away from the bench, ''A Cure for Night'' is fuzzier, like a slide that you can never really focus. Joel and Myra's personal lives are a little vague, while the restaurants they visit are extremely specific. (This book could double as a guide to nice places to go in Park Slope.) The downtime could have been graced more by Joel's lawyer friend Paul, with his jaded view of the billable life: ''I do it for the money, and because I failed to come up with anything more interesting to do.'' But you're not hiring Justin Peacock to be Bret Easton Ellis or Richard Price. He's all about the law, and based on his work here, he's got a good chance to make partner.

THE CHINA LOVER
 By Ian Buruma
 392 pp. The Penguin Press. $26.95
 In Japanese-occupied Manchuria in the 1930s, a teenage singer and actress named Yoshiko Yamaguchi rose to stardom in a series of propaganda films intended to celebrate Japan's noble role in China. Acting under the pseudonym Ri Koran, Yamaguchi created a sensation in erotic melodramas like ''China Nights,'' about a love affair between a Chinese peasant girl and a heroic Japanese ship captain in wartime Shanghai. Yamaguchi's career as a tool of the militarists continued until Japan's surrender in 1945, when Chiang Kai-shek's nationalist forces charged her with collaboration. (She was spared execution when she was able to prove her ethnic Japanese origins, which her bosses had kept secret.) Yamaguchi rebuilt her career from the war's ashes, first as the star of pro-American films in occupied Japan, then as the Hollywood actress Shirley Yamaguchi, her new name inspired by Shirley Temple. Retiring from the movies in the late 1950s, Yamaguchi continued to reinvent herself, as a diplomat's wife, as a journalist and as a prominent politician in the Japanese Parliament. 
 Yamaguchi's protean career forms the narrative thread of Ian Buruma's evocative novel, ''The China Lover,'' which spans roughly 50 years of Japan's tumultuous modern history. (Some of the events described are taken from Yamaguchi's own life; the rest have been fictionalized.) Buruma uses Yamaguchi's bizarre story as a metaphor for Japan's own shifting identity, from militaristic dictatorship to America-besotted postwar ruin to economically rejuvenated modern nation. He's also fascinated by the power of the cinema in Japanese history, both as a cultural touchstone and as a political tool used by conquering armies -- first the Japanese in China, then the Americans in Japan. 
 Buruma takes an unusual approach to his central character, dividing her biography into three parts, each narrated by a different man and each paralleling a different phase of Japan's self-reinvention. The societal misfits who narrate Yamaguchi's life story are twisted, compelling figures drawn to the movies as an escape from dead-end lives, part sycophants, part outsiders basking in Yamaguchi's reflected glory. This ambitious approach brings her world vividly to life, even while it leaves the reader struggling to get a fix on the woman herself. 
 The strongest section is set during Japan's occupation of Manchuria. Here the narrator is Sato Daisuke, a talent scout for the Manchuria Motion Picture Association,a sinister propaganda arm of the Japanese military government. From the time he first encounters the 13-year-old singer onstage at Mukden in 1933, Sato recognizes her erotic power -- and its potential to win over the Chinese multitudes to the Japanese cause. ''It was her eyes that left the deepest impression,'' he observes. ''They were unusually large for an Oriental woman. She didn't look typically Japanese, nor typically Chinese. There was something of the Silk Road in her, of the caravans and spice markets of Samarkand. No one would have guessed that she was just an ordinary Japanese girl born in Manchuria.'' 
 An eager participant in the militarists' cinematic project, Sato is entranced by Japan's supposed mission to uplift its backward Asian brothers: ''We were living at the birth of a New Asia,'' he proclaims, just after the bloody fall of Nanking in 1938. Prowling the bordellos and back streets of Manchuria's cities at night, Sato emerges as the other China lover of Buruma's tale, entranced by this sensuous Asian stew: ''The Mukden women were the most beautiful north of Shanghai: the Chinese girls, lithe and nimble as eels in their tight qi pao dresses; the kimonoed Japanese beauties, perched like finely plumed birds in their rickshaws bound for the teahouses behind the Yokohama Specie Bank; the perfumed Russian and European ladies taking tea at Smirnoff's in feathered hats and furs. Verily, Mukden was paradise for a young wolf on the loose.'' Eventually, however, Sato, like his female charge, realizes the dark truth behind Japan's New Asia: in one frightening sequence, he is arrested and tortured for suspected disloyalty to the imperialist cause; in another, a young Jewish acquaintance is kidnapped and brutally murdered. Sato finds himself adrift and terrifyingly alone as Japan's Asian project collapses into chaos. 
 In the novel's second section, set in the rubble of postwar Tokyo, Yamaguchi's tale is picked up by Sidney Vanoven of Bowling Green, Ohio, another cinema-obsessed outsider. Vanoven parlays a brief stint working as a gofer on a Frank Capra movie into a job in the United States military's Civil Censorship Detachment, vetting Japanese movies to make sure their content is pro-democratic. At first starry-eyed about his country's mission, Vanoven turns cynical about American cultural imperialism and insensitivity -- and is fired for approving a documentary that holds the Japanese emperor accountable for war crimes. (MacArthur and his underlings are fearful of provoking a rebellion by implicating Hirohito.) Finding work as a film critic for an English-language newspaper in Tokyo, Vanoven rubs shoulders with Akira Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune, shepherds Yamaguchi through a turbulent relationship with the Japanese-American sculptor Isamu Noguchi and spends his down time prowling the cinemas and parks of the capital for anonymous encounters with Japanese men. ''In Ohio I could be arrested for what I like to do,'' he observes. ''In Tokyo, I am free to do as I please.'' Like countless other foreigners living in Japan, he revels in the access and privilege of his outsider status, unaware he is living an illusion. ''I sometimes wished the folks in Bowling Green could have seen me, at the Imperial Hotel, in the company of my Japanese friends,'' Vanoven proclaims, shortly before his love affair with Japan ends in an explosion of anti-American violence tied to the security treaty of 1960. ''Perhaps it was my small vengeance for being made to feel like a freak. I was with real friends now, on a much more glamorous stage.'' 
 In the final section of the novel, Buruma veers off in a surprising and unsettling direction, following another Sato, Sato Kenkichi, born in northeastern Japan in 1945, whose embrace of all things American, including James Dean in ''Rebel Without a Cause,'' evolves into virulent anti-Westernism. Eventually he lands a job making television documentaries on world politics for Japanese housewives; his collaborator is none other than Yamaguchi. This leads Sato to an entanglement in Beirut with Palestinian militants and a suicidal attack on Lod Airport near Tel Aviv as a terrorist with the Japanese Red Army. 
 Buruma's plot strays all over the map, and that's part of the problem with this ambitious book. He seems to have tried to work in every theme he's every contemplated about Japanese history and identity: the problematic relationship between East and West, the Japanese underworld, anti-Semitism, the role of the foreigner in Japan, the web of connections and obligations that knits together Japanese society. The episodic narrative, packed with celebrity walk-ons (Pu Yi, the puppet emperor in Manchuria; Truman Capote), is always fascinating but sometimes dizzyingly unfocused. Moreover, as the story unfolds, Buruma's attitude toward his protagonist remains hazy. Yamaguchi rarely emerges as more than an enigma. As a symbol of Japan's often awkward -- and sometimes destructive -- relationship with the rest of the world, she could hardly be more effective. But as a character in a novel she can seem as brittle as a porcelain doll.

 BODY:
DOMESTIC DISTURBANCES In the 1980s it seemed respectable, honorable and, dare I say, valuable to do things other than make a lot of money. But by the late 1990s, in New York, if you weren't in the financial industry, it was hard to survive.
 And so it went throughout the country, in the whole winner-take-all-era ushered in by the boom years of the late 1990s. The model for success narrowed. The goal posts marking success grew more out of reach. For all the people who did something with their lives other than doggedly, single-mindedly -- and successfully -- pursue wealth, life got harder and scarier and more confusing. 
 Many of us who'd proudly decided to pursue edifying or creative or ''helping'' professions, woke up to realize, once we had families, that we'd perhaps been irresponsible. We couldn't save for college. We could barely save for retirement. If we set up a ''family-friendly'' lifestyle, we threw our financial futures down the drain.
 So, like just about everyone, we worked hard and treaded water, but felt we were entitled to do better. And if we lived in the New York area, or another wealthy place where the spoils of the new Gilded Age were constantly thrust in our faces, we felt a little something more: we knew that we were losers.

 Reader Comments:
 I am thinking about the 1960s and how brave -- and I suppose foolish -- we all were, thinking we could change the world with flowers, art and love. I was an artist then and still am. Back in those days, we had a term for those who went for the bucks (or for that matter even took a job!). We called it ''selling out.''

 TALK SHOW Paul Newman's fondness for elaborate pranks and practical jokes lasted, some felt, a bit too long. A famous friend who might prefer not to be named said that while Paul was a responsible and mature adult, ''his sense of humor froze at about seventh-grade level.''
 He and Robert Redford had become friends during ''Butch Cassidy.'' And Redford had a beloved sports car. In a move that few seventh graders could afford, Newman managed to have it towed away under cover of darkness -- and compacted. The massive block that resulted was returned to Redford's front lawn.
 Nobody needed to guess who had done it. The following morning the ugly monolith of glass and steel was gone from the Redford lawn. Dawn revealed it: it had suddenly and mysteriously found its way to the Newman residence, where it could be plainly seen ... on the roof.
 -- Dick Cavett, '' 'Tis But a Man Gone ... But What a Man''
 OUTPOSTS After wading through books with words like ''fiasco,'' ''hubris'' and ''denial'' in the title, presidential historians will go to first-hand sources, the people who worked with George W. Bush daily. There they will find Paul O'Neill, the president's former Treasury secretary. In 2002, he sounded an alarm, saying Bush's rash economic policies could lead to a deficit of $500 billion. This, after Bush had inherited a budget surplus, prompted many to scoff at O'Neill.
 He was wrong, but only in one respect -- the projected deficit, even without a financial bailout, will almost certainly be higher.
 This means a lot, for every bridge not built, every Pell grant not given to a kid who may never go to college without one, every national park road left to crumble, every sick person who cannot afford to see a doctor in a country that wants to be known as the best on earth.
 Historians will recall that in each of the major disasters on President Bush's watch, there were ample warnings -- from the intelligence briefing that Osama bin Laden was determined to strike a month before the lethal blow, to the projections that Hurricane Katrina could drown a major American city, to the expressed fears that letting Wall Street regulate itself could be catastrophic.
 Voluntary regulation. That phrase now joins ''Heckuva job, Brownie'' and ''mission accomplished'' among those that will always be associated with the Bush presidency.
 -- Timothy Egan, ''The Legacy''
 Reader Comments:
 It probably will be at least 15 years before a final verdict on George W. Bush as ''the worst president ever'' is rendered. That being said, when a football team is losing by five touchdowns with two minutes to play, the outcome is certain.

HEADLINE: In a Red State Rolling in Green, a Relaxed Attitude Toward the Election

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

DATELINE: ROCK SPRINGS, Wyo. 

 BODY:
There are any number of ways to gauge an economic boom, and here lap dances may be a pretty good measure.
 ''I make over $100,000 a year,'' bragged Eric Palmer, who works as a gas field operator in a town that has enriched many of them. Mr. Palmer was surrounded by a bevy of strippers at the Astro Lounge, all of them eager to take advantage of his generosity. ''I spend $3,000 a weekend here,'' he said. ''I just love the company of beautiful women.''
 The women in Rock Springs, off Interstate 80 in southern Wyoming, seem to like Mr. Palmer and his ilk, which is why they travel from cities across America -- often places where the economy has tanked -- to make thousands of dollars a week at places like the Astro Lounge. Most of their customers are men who work in natural gas exploration and production and who have few other ways or places to spend money on their rare days off. 
 The gas industry has almost single-handedly set Wyoming in stark contrast to the rest of the nation, where industries have fallen on hard times, homes are in foreclosures and many Americans have lost their jobs. While other states are laying off workers and cutting programs, Wyoming has enjoyed billions of dollars in surpluses in recent years. 
 There is a sort of relaxed composure here that other towns in America are not enjoying as the race for president enters its final chapter. Many voters here seem to agree: whoever wins is not likely to stand in the way of Wyoming and its natural gas fortunes. 
 ''We have the opposite economy of the rest of the United States,'' said Steve Aaron, who was eating dinner at the Coyote Creek steak house across the street from the Astro Lounge. Mr. Aaron works in the court system and is a part-time minister. ''But we still wonder and worry about what's going on around the rest of the country,'' he said, ''even though people in the oil fields are making more money than they ever have in their lives.''
 The fortunes here stem from the state's enormous supply of natural gas -- its reserves are second only to Texas -- and its role in supplying not only a demanding domestic market but other nations as well. Wyoming, the home state of Vice President Dick Cheney, has benefited from the Bush administration's energy policies, which opened up land for natural gas drilling. 
 Men making $15 an hour five years ago now take in as much as $26, and it all makes for very deep pockets for the workforce, much of it drawn from out of state. There is not very much to do in this town but work, and that is enough for most people.
 ''I was drawn here for economic reasons,'' said Colt Felmlee, 24, who was interviewed at the steak house. Mr. Felmlee, a foreman for an oil fields service company, moved here from Montana, where the wages are not as high. ''I don't find it hard to relate to the rest of the country's problems because I've been there,'' he said.
 Mr. Felmlee said he believed Senator John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee, was the candidate who most supported his industry. ''I think with him in office I would continue to do well,'' he said. ''I think in general the oil industry supports McCain. Not many people would take a strong opposition to him.'' 
 Some other oil workers said they supported Mr. McCain as well, but others said they were for Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee. 
 ''I think he'll be a stronger leader,'' said Cory Rock, as he sucked on a cigar at the strip club. But while the state's governor, Dave Freudenthal, is a Democrat, this mostly Republican state is almost certainly in Mr. McCain's column. 
 All the industries that serve oil workers -- steak houses, title brokers and bars -- have done well in the boom. 
 ''I find it odd that we are so for finding alternative sources of energy when this is where the money is,'' said Meesa, a stripper in the club who came from Idaho and asked to be identified by only her stage name. She makes about $500 a night. ''The guys here are paid hand over fist for extremely hard labor,'' she said, ''and there is no where to spend it here but on us.''

HEADLINE: Money for Nothing, As Seen by an Artist

BYLINE: By WENDY FRIED

 BODY:
Laura Gilbert, a Manhattan-based artist, is employing her creativity to protest what she calls ''the current economic calamity.'' Ms. Gilbert plans to stand on Wall Street this Tuesday and give away signed and numbered originals of ''The Zero Dollar,'' a slightly downsized rendering of the $1 bill with zeros in place of the ones. 
 Ms. Gilbert, who began working on the print after the fall of Bear Stearns earlier this year, sees the dollar bill as ''symbolic of America's stature in the world.'' As a reflection of the crisis in the financial markets, she has tried to lower the monetary value of the print itself to zero by creating a very large edition of 10,000. 
 The artist says she is prepared to ''confront financiers'' about the losses suffered by investors and homeowners. She also posed a question that may puzzle the financial crowd: ''Why should art be worth less just because it's free?'' WENDY FRIED

HEADLINE: Capitalism to the Rescue

BYLINE: By JON GERTNER. 
Jon Gertner is a contributing writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
How Green Was the Valley
One afternoon last May in Menlo Park, Calif., a venture capitalist named Ray Lane led me from his office to the parking lot, where an automobile had been delivered a few hours earlier by flatbed truck. The car, built in Norway, was powered by batteries and had a plug-in outlet hidden under a flip-top cover near the driver-side door. To my eye, the car resembled a generic European compact, but with some differences; the body, for instance, was made from a textured, plasticized material. In a lot full of gleaming new vehicles, some of them owned by the wealthiest venture capitalists in the United States, this car -- branded the Think -- seemed distinctive mainly for its lack of sparkle. 
''You want to drive?'' Lane asked, tossing me the key. Inside, the dashboard was seemingly made of densely woven fabric, and the seat was covered in a material that felt decidedly un-Corinthian. ''The Think is 95 percent recyclable,'' Lane said matter-of-factly, giving me the sense that we were about to drive a milk carton rather than a car. A turn of the key started up a barely perceptible hum somewhere under the hood. ''There we go,'' Lane said, sitting back with a pleased expression. I shifted into drive and hit the gas pedal -- actually, the electricity pedal -- a little too hard, and the Think lurched forward.
It was one of those hot, dry, cloudless days on Sand Hill Road, the wide avenue in Silicon Valley lined with some of the country's most powerful venture-capital firms. It would have been a fine adventure to see if the Think could hit its top speed of 65 m.p.h. on U.S. 101, which snakes through Menlo Park and down into Mountain View, Sunnyvale and San Jose, high-tech towns where Lane and his colleagues at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers have been financing companies (Google and Netscape, among others) for the past 36 years. But this Think, one of only three in the United States, had no license plates or registration. So Lane and I explored the private streets around the two Kleiner Perkins buildings instead. As we drove, Lane told me that if things went well -- if the Think's manufacturing process could be made more efficient, for instance -- the car would go on sale in the United States in 2009. He said he hoped to sell several thousand in the first year and eventually reach annual sales in the tens of thousands, with a sticker price below $30,000. But then outcomes were hard to predict with precision, he admitted, even for venture capitalists who spend their working hours imagining the future.
It was late last winter when I began speaking with Lane and his partners at Kleiner Perkins. My conversations lasted to mid-September, just as the financial turmoil on Wall Street was leading to bank failures and jagged movements in the stock indexes. The firm wasn't unconcerned about the crisis -- problems with the markets could potentially slow down the development of some of the companies it backed. Still, most of its ventures were long-term investments. And entrepreneurs were still bringing new ideas through the door at a steady pace. ''I don't expect the credit crunch will change that,'' John Denniston, a Kleiner partner, said. Indeed, throughout the summer the partnership was raising hundreds of millions of dollars to pour into clean or green technologies -- in V.C.-speak, ''clean tech'' or ''green tech'' investments. By the beginning of autumn, Kleiner had financed 40 different green-tech companies and raised a total of about $1 billion to that end. Some of the firm's fledging green ventures were evolutionary improvements on current technologies that would soon hit the market, like the electric Think car. Others I heard about promised to revolutionize various aspects of the energy economy -- in, say, solar power or biofuels -- much as Netscape or Google remade the Web or Genentech (another Kleiner Perkins venture) ushered in the biotechnology era several decades earlier. In many parts of Silicon Valley, it seemed misguided to regard the U.S. economy as reliant solely on Wall Street. The future still depended on entrepreneurs and innovations and green-tech businesses getting ''traction,'' as the V.C.'s at Kleiner liked to say.
Kleiner was not the only venture firm that had suddenly seen the future and decided it was green. But Kleiner's past success tended to legitimize the prospects of business ideas that in many cases had spent decades on the economic fringe. California this past summer seemed like a fantasia of alternative-energy start-ups, where legions of garage tinkerers were taking a break from writing software code so they could help solve the climate problem. At Kleiner, which might have fielded perhaps a dozen business plans a year for new green-tech companies earlier this decade, at least 100 ideas were filtering in every month. The smooth-talking serial entrepreneurs, the university physicists toiling in obscurity, the great throngs of unshaven engineering grad students -- every day they were pitching low-carbon devices that utilized cow dung or nanofilm or supersecret ceramic compounds that had so much transformative potential they could be discussed only in the strictest confidence. John Doerr, one of Kleiner's managing partners and arguably the world's most influential venture capitalist, made the case to me in his office one morning in July that these were signs that the multitrillion-dollar energy market would inevitably, and imminently, undergo a wholesale eco-transformation. In the view of Doerr and his partners, Kleiner's efforts to seed this prospective renewable economy with its investments and the help of its new partner, Al Gore, would help address some of the most vexing problems of the modern era -- namely, climate change, fuel costs and energy independence. Amid economic hardship and the turmoil within the financial-services industry, such efforts could also contribute to a profusion of green jobs in technology as well as in manufacturing. On a different morning, another Kleiner partner, Randy Komisar, told me that the firm's green-tech investments didn't seem terribly risky to him because the energy market was so large and outdated. ''I'm so dead certain that we're solving the next huge problem for the planet,'' he said. ''I'm not very good at hitting the bull's-eye. I need a big target. And this is the biggest target I've ever seen in my life.''
Was this true? One heated topic of debate in the valley last summer was whether Kleiner had found a way to create yet another pile of riches or whether the firm was making a grievous miscalculation. What intrigued me most about Kleiner's plans, though, wasn't whether its green-tech investments would (or would not) reap huge financial returns, but whether this country's private sector, spurred primarily by venture capital, could start to change the way the U.S. and the world use energy. In many respects, the solutions to global warming and fuel prices have been defined over the past year almost exclusively in terms of government action -- the policies of a Barack Obama or a John McCain administration, in other words, that could effect a new energy infrastructure or help forge international treaties to reduce global carbon emissions. One shortcoming of this view is that while government has a longstanding role in underwriting scientific research and regulating or (with less positive results) deregulating industries, government doesn't really innovate, at least not in the sense of readying technologies for the marketplace and integrating those technologies into mainstream companies. That's left to firms like Kleiner, which happened to be financing precisely those kinds of businesses, but largely out of the public eye. If they were succeeding in green tech -- an uncertain prospect -- then conceivably big profits would follow, not to mention a social and environmental dividend for the rest of us.
'The Map of Grand Challenges' as Investment Plan
While venture capitalists are sometimes mistaken for their cousins who work in private equity, they tend to have a very different role within the U.S. economy. Private equity funds invest large sums -- hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars -- on existing businesses. V.C. funds, by contrast, typically back entrepreneurs clutching a coffee-stained business plan. The V.C.'s swap money (often anywhere from $1 million to $15 million) for an ownership stake (usually from 20 to 40 percent) in the start-up. And the sums that a firm like Kleiner invests each year are modest compared with what a company like General Electric might spend on research and development. Yet venture dollars can be extremely potent. Many of the most innovative American companies -- FedEx, Amazon, Apple and Google, for instance -- have received venture money; a recent study by Global Insight noted that such businesses now account for nearly 18 percent of America's gross domestic product and 9 percent of our private-sector employment. According to Josh Lerner of the Harvard Business School, ''When you try to quantify it, a dollar of venture capital is somewhat equal to three or four dollars of corporate R&D.'' But one of the larger misunderstandings is that all V.C.'s have a Midas touch and a private jet. ''I think it's fair to say that by and large the median venture fund is a quite disappointing performer,'' Lerner says. ''Most of them are losers.'' Still, he adds, the data suggest that a few V.C. firms -- like Kleiner Perkins, or its neighbor the Sequoia Fund -- seem to do well year after year.
Kleiner's offices in Menlo Park have been described as a temple of capitalism, but inside they feel more like a ski chalet of capitalism. Set far back from the bustle of Sand Hill Road, the firm occupies two cedar-shingled, Arts and Crafts-style buildings shaded by redwood trees. Most of the firm's 29 partners occupy glassed-in offices around a common area with exposed wood beams that support a soaring, peaked ceiling. A breakfast is laid out on a table in the common area each morning; at about noon, chafing dishes arrive with lunch. Kleiner is among the most rarefied of guilds. Every few years, the firm raises a pool of money that ranges from $500 million to $700 million; the pool gets a name that includes Roman numerals -- the most recent is KPCBXIII -- and serves as a kind of bank account that the partners use to invest in 30 to 40 business ideas. Many venture firms struggle to raise this kind of money. At Kleiner, it pours in without much apparent effort. It comes from the Kleiner partners themselves, from foundations and university endowments (Stanford, Harvard, Yale, among others) and from wealthy individuals (the Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, for instance) who are allowed -- ''by invitation only,'' as one partner put it -- to add a few million to the Kleiner pot. Most of these elite investors, known as limited partners, are also Kleiner's helpers; they often direct ideas or new entrepreneurs to the firm. Kleiner is, in essence, a mutual-interest society of wealth, knowledge and connections, and even if you wanted to, even if you begged, you couldn't invest with them.
Traditionally, the firm has split its investments between digital-technology companies and health-related companies. Occasionally there are forays into businesses that fit neither category, however. One of these was Kleiner's humiliating investment in Segway, the maker of the battery-powered scooter, which, back in 2001, John Doerr predicted would be the fastest company in history to hit $1 billion in sales. Seven years later, Segway is not even close. Nonetheless, Segway yielded a different kind of return. The vehicle's creator, the inventor Dean Kamen, spent time at Kleiner talking with Doerr and his partners about the challenges in providing a growing and increasingly urban global population with clean water and energy. And, as it happened, around the time of the Segway's debut, Kleiner received a proposal from a professor at the University of Arizona named K. R. Sridhar, a former NASA scientist, who was working on a solid-oxide fuel cell in his garage in Tucson. Fuel cells are an old technology, dating back more than 150 years; they convert a fuel, like natural gas, into electricity through chemical reaction rather than combustion. Sridhar's pitch had some novel technological aspects, and his business plan called for making energy generators -- essentially, large box-shaped units for a home basement, or an office building -- for buyers who either had no access to an electrical grid or wanted to disconnect themselves from one. ''You could put natural gas into it and get electricity out,'' Aileen Lee, the partner at Kleiner who researched Sridhar's proposal, told me. ''Or it could be fuel-flexible'' -- meaning the boxes could run on, say, ethanol. At least in theory, the units, which Sridhar called Bloom boxes, would be reliable, quiet and very low in carbon emissions.
I heard a number of explanations about why the firm paused after investing in Bloom Energy in 2002. The consensus seems to be that it took time for the partnership to be persuaded that the economy would move in a greener direction and that green tech would have far larger potential payoffs than, say, the ideas for Web sites that were being financed at the time. Then, in late 2006, at one of Kleiner's corporate retreats, Bill Joy, a founder of Sun Microsystems and a new partner at the firm, displayed what later became known within Kleiner as ''the map of grand challenges.'' This was a matrix of colored squares that itemized the firm's progress in locating potential investments in about 40 different categories: water, transportation, energy efficiency, electricity generation, energy storage and the like. In the blank spots there were lists of ''things that ought to be possible,'' in Doerr's words -- ideas, in short, that might produce huge changes and, if Kleiner bought a stake, huge profits. Thus the grand map was a rough, imaginary outline of a clean-energy economy that didn't really exist and perhaps wouldn't in any meaningful way for decades. But it helped Kleiner understand what to look for. That same year, Kleiner officially informed its investors that it would begin putting $100 million of its newest fund in green technology. Doerr, Joy, Ray Lane and John Denniston all joined the green-tech group.
There was little doubt that partners like Lane and Doerr, who have countless connections within America's high-tech worlds, would get good green-tech pitches as word got around. In the meantime, Joy and his more technically minded colleagues ''went outbound,'' in Joy's words, which meant they started scouring laboratories throughout the United States, as well as academic departments around the world, for energy ideas that could satisfy challenges on the grand map. It has become a kind of received wisdom that American and European laboratories have yet to come up with enough innovations to ease our dependence on fossil fuels, or that effective (and affordable) technological solutions to climate change are still many decades away. In truth, there have been scores of recent scientific developments in wind, solar, biofuels and energy efficiency that have not yet entered the market, in part because the private sector has deemed them risky investments in a world where gas, coal and electricity are cheap. As Andy Karsner, who recently stepped down as the Department of Energy assistant secretary in charge of renewables, told me, ''Venture capital's interest in the sector didn't arise until price signals and climate change came into play a few years ago.'' Before that, he says, green technology ''was in a state of suspended animation.'' Dan Arvizu, the head of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colo., echoes this sentiment. Whenever Arvizu testifies in front of Congress on the state of renewables, he told me: ''They always ask the same questions -- 'When is this going to be real?' And I say: 'It's real now.' ''
Kleiner's partners largely shared this view. ''Our overarching thesis,'' Bill Joy says, ''was that a lot of stuff had already been developed, but there were things that were not yet commercialized because they had been frozen by the low price of oil. The innovation had occurred, but they hadn't been deployed.'' In addition to a number of California ventures, Joy and his colleagues ultimately tracked down worthy ideas in Massachusetts, Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and Georgia, as well as in Israel, Germany and China. One morning early in the summer, I had breakfast with Joy in Manhattan, and he took a folded sheet of paper from his pocket to show me what remained of the map of grand challenges, under the condition that I would keep confidential the technologies that were not public knowledge. Some slots remained open, but the firm had identified a number of projects that could be deployed quickly as well as longer-term proposals that might be called breakthroughs. Whether any would turn into flourishing companies -- let alone another Google -- was a far more unpredictable matter. For the time being, at least, Kleiner's partners had assembled the ideas for what they intuited to be the future. At one point during his globe-trotting pursuits, Joy recalled, John Doerr turned to him and said, ''I don't think anyone has ever really done venture capital this way.''
From Idea to I.P.O.
If you look over Kleiner's clean-energy portfolio, it's apparent that the firm has made a number of large and risky bets. In part this is because of the evolving economics of venture capital: to get the returns its investors have come to expect -- the firm says it has returned an average of $1 billion in profits per year to its investors over the past decade -- Kleiner has to produce one or two magical success stories every few years. Some of the risk taking, however, is a product of the firm's culture. Brook Byers, the firm's longest-serving partner, told me the place depends on a complementary mix of talents. This has been the case since the beginning, in 1972, when Eugene Kleiner, an engineer who had worked at the valley's earliest semiconductor companies, went into business with Tom Perkins, a former executive at Hewlett-Packard. Kleiner, who died a few years ago, was an Austrian-born intellectual of modest tastes -- ''a very soft-spoken, very wise, very gentle man,'' according to Doerr. Perkins was a brash gambler who would later build one of the world's most expensive yachts. You could argue that Perkins, now retired, left the larger imprint on the firm. As Doerr told me, ''Tom would say, 'When you have a great opportunity, push all the chips, all the resources that you can, to the center of the table.' '' Perkins, Doerr added, was more his mentor than Kleiner was.
Bloom Energy is a good example of a venture where the chips are now piled high. Though you wouldn't know it from appearances. Located in a modest, unmarked one-story building with large plate-glass windows off the highway in Sunnyvale, Calif., Bloom is one of the companies in the Kleiner portfolio closest to unveiling a commercial product. Over the past two and a half years, engineers at the University of Tennessee in Chattanooga have been testing a five-kilowatt Bloom box, which looks like a squat refrigerator and produces about as much electricity as a typical home requires. And at this point there seems little doubt that the idea K. R. Sridhar pitched to Kleiner in 2001 has become a high-functioning machine. ''We installed one of his first units here to assess its durability and performance, to see if it matched the claims,'' Henry McDonald, a professor at Tennessee who is overseeing the Bloom box, says. McDonald ran the box nonstop on natural gas for 6,000 hours, and its performance beat expectations. In everyday terms, the box was twice as efficient as a boiler burning natural gas, and its carbon emissions were 60 percent lower.
Kleiner didn't invest in Bloom for precisely these reasons. Rather, the firm's partners say that Bloom could eventually sell hundreds of thousands of boxes, either at the 5-kilowatt size or as larger, 100-kilowatt machines that power buildings or neighborhoods. The company's ambitions are indeed breathtaking in scope. As Sridhar told me, referring to the world's population: ''Two billion people have no access to electricity. And of the other four billion people with access, probably two billion are actually getting below their demands.'' That makes for a lot of potential users of his product. Sridhar also contended that even here, in the developed world, where the grid is reliable and electricity comparatively cheap, Bloom could find willing customers under the right circumstances. He showed me his first Bloom fuel cell, the one he made eight years ago in his garage in Arizona with some colleagues; it resembled a flat, rectangular metal plate, about the size of a pack of Chiclets. Etched across its face was a geometric pattern of tiny equilateral triangles. The prototype produced a couple of watts of electricity, he said, not even enough to power a light bulb. ''This is what I showed Kleiner as the proof of concept,'' Sridhar recalled. ''I said, 'This is what we can use to power the world and change the world.' ''
Entrepreneurs sometimes refer to the period between a project's origins and its commercial deployment as ''the valley of death.'' The meaning of the term may be self-evident: it is the bog where most ideas stall and expire. Kleiner's partners will tell you that ventures usually die because they fail to overcome one of four risk factors. To begin with, there is technology risk. As Ted Schlein, a Kleiner partner, put it one morning: ''Can it be built? How hard is it to build it? And if you can build it, can other people build it just as well?'' Next, Schlein said, is what he and his partners call ''people risk.'' How good is the team pitching the idea, and can its members execute their idea well? The third risk involves selling a product in the market, which most Kleiner partners believe is the hardest to gauge before making an investment. In Schlein's words: ''O.K., let's say we can build it and get great people. Will anyone buy it?''
The final risk is financial. Venture capitalists who back a company in its earliest stages, as Kleiner did with Bloom, typically invest only a fraction of what it takes to bring a business to market; as the company grows, the rest of the financing necessary comes at later stages -- known as ''B rounds,'' ''C rounds'' and so forth -- from other V.C. firms and outside investment funds. Companies that have problems with their technology, management teams or marketing have difficulty attracting more financing. With green tech, this may prove especially dire. Software or Web-site development can be fast and relatively cheap -- a couple of years, say, and a total of $50 million before a company can go public. A medical venture can cost double that amount and take up to a decade to mature. Green tech may well require more time and money than either. For companies requiring industrial production -- those making fuel cells or solar installations, for example -- Doerr estimated it would take anywhere from $200 million to $500 million to get them ready for public offerings. ''It took $25 million of venture capital to get Google into business,'' he said. ''It's taken $250 million of private capital to get Bloom into business. Google was five years from when we invested to an I.P.O. Bloom is six years since we invested to today.'' If Bloom has an initial public offering, it probably won't be for at least another few years.
A number of young companies, like SunPower and First Solar, have proved that green businesses can go from start-up stage to I.P.O. and be quite profitable. But the technology developed by those companies took well more than a decade to prove itself, and many other companies have died in the meantime. In recent months, Kleiner has tried to exploit investment opportunities in these long and complex start-up periods. The firm just raised $500 million for its Green Growth Fund, which is separate from typical Kleiner funds like KPCBXIII, to invest in up-and-running ''later-stage'' green-tech companies that need money to continue growing. (As an example, Green Growth has recently been considering an investment in an energy-efficiency company that sells wireless communications devices that utilities can install in the electrical grid -- and within homes -- to save power and money.) Meanwhile, almost all of the other companies in Kleiner's green-tech portfolio, including Bloom, continue the treacherous slog to commercialization. In talking about this process with Kleiner partners, there can be a robotic quality to their conversation; they all tend say that they are ''company builders,'' or that ''the least important thing we bring to the table is money.'' By some measures, Kleiner is not necessarily the most popular firm in the valley; a new Web site, for instance, thefunded.com, which lets entrepreneurs rate their interactions with V.C.'s, gives the firm mediocre marks. Still, there's truth to the assertion that Kleiner's value isn't so much its money as its worldliness: it can hire talented executives, offer expert advice on marketing and tap additional cash for growth. Moreover, a team that includes Al Gore and Colin Powell (who is also affiliated with Kleiner), as well as an extended network of well-heeled investors, provides something of a head start.
Ray Lane often divides the firm's partners into technologists and networkers. In the first category are people like Bill Joy, whom the firm depends on to analyze the technical feasibility of green-tech ideas. Then there are those like Lane himself, a former president of the Oracle Corporation, and Doerr, a Kleiner veteran of 28 years, who use their vast numbers of contacts -- in business, academia and politics -- to help start-ups. ''I probably have 6,000 people in my Rolodex,'' Lane told me, adding that he and Doerr have a friendly competition over who has more. When Trae Vassallo, a partner in the firm, was flying around the world researching geothermal energy, Lane helped her arrange a tour of Iceland's geothermal plants with Olafur Ragnar Grimsson. Grimsson is the president of Iceland, and Lane apparently knows him well. When Lane and I first met, he had just returned from Qatar, where he saw the country's emir and took the opportunity to tell him about Ausra, one of Kleiner's more promising investments, which uses mirrors to concentrate solar energy on water pipes to produce steam and, in turn, electricity.
Renewable energy may ultimately be about the environment, but it is perhaps about economics first and foremost. To take an example, Kleiner could have backed a number of other solar-thermal companies besides Ausra. The company's appeal, according to Vassallo, was not so much technical wizardry as ''a simplicity and elegance of design'' that persuaded the partners its installations would be durable, easy to manufacture and easy to operate. Moreover, because the technology uses available commodities -- steel, glass and ordinary turbines -- it could be deployed quickly. Before investing, Kleiner commissioned two consulting firms to assess how much Ausra's power would cost, and the resulting studies concluded its electricity could be 15 to 20 percent cheaper than that produced by its solar-thermal competition. Soon thereafter, Kleiner backed the company. When I visited the Ausra offices, just off U.S. Route 101 in Palo Alto, Calif., the company's C.E.O., Bob Fishman, told me Ausra's low costs would allow it to compete in the mainstream energy market, not just in the renewable-energy market. (In California, state mandates make it possible for solar companies to gain a modest foothold.) A new factory in Las Vegas was producing mirrors and parts, and the firm's West Coast solar installations should bring power to about 125,000 homes by 2011. Soon ''we want to go after gas and coal and displace them,'' Fishman said.
Unlike Ausra, most of the Kleiner's green-tech investments are not publicly discussed. By my count, the firm has acknowledged 15 of its 40 investments. The rest are in what V.C.'s call ''stealth'' mode, hidden from the press (and copycat V.C.'s) until they are on sounder footing. Last summer, the growing number of stealth companies involved with clean energy formed a kind of dark matter in the Silicon Valley universe, businesses that could not be seen yet nevertheless exerted a discernible gravitational pull. Executives would suddenly leave jobs at established companies to join ventures with no official name. Manufacturing facilities would set up shop in cheap, anonymous buildings in towns like Santa Clara, Calif., then begin round-the-clock operations. When Kleiner decided to invest in a company called FloDesign, a business in Massachusetts, sensitive pages on its Web site were quickly dismantled; when Kleiner decided to invest in a company known as Sundrop Fuels, online links that described the technology, which was developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory, were removed. In some respects, the more promising the technology, the more secretive the venture becomes. And both FloDesign and Sundrop were indeed promising. FloDesign intends to replace the common propeller wind turbine with something that resembles a jet engine. Doerr told me that the company's product, which is perhaps 18 months away from a prototype, would cost 25 percent less than any other kind of wind generation -- that could make it one of the cheapest renewable-energy sources in the world. Sundrop, meanwhile, is what Joe Lacob, a Kleiner partner, calls ''solar assisted'' fuel generation -- a process that combines the ingredients of carbon, hydrogen and sunlight to create a petrol-like product. ''We can actually take CO2,'' Lacob told me, ''which is what we're trying to get rid of, and make that our source of carbon, and use the sun's energy to create liquid fuels.''
Bloom Energy is not in stealth mode, but the company has been loath to offer progress reports, leading some in the venture community to wonder what $250 million in financing has actually achieved. The company's Web site, like those of many green-tech start-ups, is a prop, a confection of environmental images devoid of links or information. At the offices of Bloom, which now has over 200 employees, I questioned Sridhar about the willful obscurity, when Bloom will almost certainly have a commercial product ready within a year or two. He answered that there have been too many promises in the past, from both fuel-cell makers and other green-technology companies, that have never delivered on the hopes they stirred up. ''We want our product to speak before we speak,'' he said.
The V.C.s Make the Case for Government Regulation
As the summer wore on, Bloom and Ausra hit various benchmarks on the path to commercialization. Bloom made a highly technical breakthrough to improve its fuel cell's efficiency; Ausra, at a remote test installation outside Bakersfield, Calif., in late August, began producing steam at about 600 degrees Fahrenheit -- proof that its technical risk had been mostly overcome. To Kleiner's partners, watching such innovation happen in real time was largely satisfying. To an outsider, it seemed wearying. Rather than a swift series of eureka moments, progress took shape in setting goals, testing, tweaking and then setting more goals. Still, in September, Ray Lane told me he had concluded there were about 15 ''Google-type opportunities'' among the firm's green-tech investments. Unfortunately, he added, Kleiner's history suggests that the firm hits only one Google-type jackpot every few years. So either Ausra or Bloom might be a big winner. Or neither might. Kleiner's partners knew perfectly well that they needed to cover their bets. Hence the company had two other automotive-company investments besides the Think car. In addition to Bloom, there were two other fuel-cell ventures. There were five different investments in solar photovoltaic companies, several battery and electrical-storage investments and about a half-dozen bets on biofuels.
The venture capitalists at Kleiner nevertheless maintained their optimism. ''If you have anxiety,'' Brook Byers told me, ''this isn't a good business to be in.'' Or as Lane remarked: ''If I had to guess, five years from now this is going to be a topic at the dinner table -- the price of electricity, electric cars. Maybe not at the technical level we're talking now. But it's going to be routine.'' What makes Kleiner's green-tech ventures so risky, though, is that an assumption by the partners -- a profitable market for biofuels, for example -- could be correct and the investments could still falter. ''If you look out far enough, I have no doubt that many of the bets will pay off,'' says Paul Kedrosky, a former investment banker, blogger and longtime observer of the venture-capital industry. ''But in the venture business, being early is indistinguishable from being wrong. That's why everyone is terrified of being too early.'' In other words, imagine if electric cars become dinner-table conversation 10 years from now, rather than 5. As Harvard's Josh Lerner notes, it would be difficult for any venture firm to keep financing its start-ups for so long. And Kleiner has not yet had what V.C.'s call an ''exit'' in green tech -- meaning an I.P.O. or sale of a start-up to a private firm. It may be early still. At some point, though, the V.C.'s have to find a way to profitably disengage from their projects. ''Exiting,'' Lerner says, ''is ultimately the crucial thing.''
If technology cannot provide a safety net for green-tech investments, politics just might. At Kleiner, you rarely go a day without hearing how new federal laws that put a price on carbon emissions, for example, and that mandate levels of renewable electricity production could speed the adoption of green energy. The partners often made the case to me that if our national science budget for renewables and efficiency (about $1 billion annually) were brought in line with that of the National Institutes of Health (about $29 billion), a torrent of projects and jobs would be unleashed. So it's no surprise, of course, that partners like Doerr, Lane and Denniston have sought meetings with senators and governors, testified before Congress and pushed their message through lobbying channels like the National Venture Capital Association. Kleiner's partners told me that their portfolio could be very profitable without any public-sector policy changes, but it's hard to see how that could be the case. A price on carbon could, in one quick stroke, make Ausra's carbon-free solar electricity even cheaper than coal- or gas-powered electricity, which would both rise in cost because they produce CO2; as a result, there would be virtually no limit to the demand for Ausra power. That's how you get a green-tech Google.
To be sure, Kleiner is hardly alone in its agitation for new energy policies. Many of this country's largest corporations -- G.E., G.M., Dow Chemical, DuPont -- now support cap-and-trade laws on carbon. The presidential candidates' energy ideas differ in significant ways, yet Obama and McCain both back legislation to control carbon emissions. When I asked Robert Socolow -- a physicist at Princeton who helped create an influential framework, known as stabilization wedges, for steadying global carbon emissions -- which was more important, new technologies or new policies, he challenged my premise. ''You can't separate the two,'' he told me. ''The policy elicits the technology. The interactions are fundamental.'' Jeffrey Sachs, an economist and the head of Columbia University's Earth Institute, put it this way: ''I think the private-sector investments that are being made are going to make a very big difference, but one can see where the bottlenecks will come if this is only left to private capital.'' Sachs notes that putting a price on carbon is a crucial action. But it's not the only one. The electricity grid, he says, would almost surely need to be rebuilt as the country switched to renewables, a change requiring federal financing and policy action in land use, interstate law and liability.
It's worth asking, perhaps, if new energy legislation could spark a tulipmania-like bubble in green tech. At the moment, amid the suffering economy, public stock offerings are at a standstill, and green technologies remain a risk mainly for V.C.'s and investment bankers. But fond memories of the Internet era remain fresh at Kleiner. Doerr told me he remembers being in a grocery-store line in 1995, in Colorado, a few days after Netscape went public. To his surprise, several people in line were discussing Netscape's share price. ''For it to have penetrated the national consciousness?'' he recalled. ''It was a large step forward that said, Hey, there was a gold rush on with respect to the Internet.'' In his view, bubbles -- Doerr affectionately calls them booms -- often have a way of building up a useful infrastructure, even when they expand too far. Energy would be a far bigger market than the Internet, meaning a much bigger boom.
Doerr expects several Kleiner green-tech ventures to have I.P.O.'s within the next few years. But he dismissed the possibility that his enthusiasm for the energy sector might already be overheated. ''I believe what we're investing now,'' he told me, ''is a pittance in comparison to the size of the opportunity and the size of the problem.''
When I later parsed what Doerr was saying, I could see that on this occasion, as in others, he had woven the financial and redemptive strands of green tech together. At times, this tendency leads to controversy. When Doerr made an impassioned speech at a 2007 technology conference urging the business community to recognize that confronting global warming was a route to both salvation and profits, the idea was subject to mockery in some quarters of the business community. ''Clean tech brings out a really emotional response in people in the valley,'' Paul Kedrosky says. ''They react strongly to the idea that this has to succeed because it's really important, because it's too big to fail. Because that has nothing to do with whether or not you can make money on it.'' From some of Kleiner's competitors I heard criticisms that Doerr was betting the firm on perhaps an idealistic quest. But there doesn't seem to be much truth to the claim. In dozens of interviews at Kleiner it seemed clear that Doerr and his colleagues were not, despite their concerns about climate change, basing decisions on where they could do the most good. They were chasing the best returns. If you look back at more than a decade's worth of Doerr's interviews, you'll see that he has always called attention to the byproducts of his investments -- namely, new jobs and new technologies -- in an effort to stir up excitement, business prospects and perhaps benevolent public policy. Climate issues are merely the latest addition to his sales pitch about the social value of venture capital. When I asked Doerr whether he was investing to save the environment, he said, ''We are ruthlessly single-minded about our job, which is to make a lot of money for our investors.'' In his view, the process of making that money could change the world. But the firm was not directly pursuing a ''cause.'' If some of Kleiner's investors -- colleges, foundations and philanthropists -- wanted to do that with their profits, he added, then that was up to them.
Al Gore, Environmental Optimist?
If Kleiner's best investments were to overcome their technical and financial risks -- and if they got a boost from new federal policies -- would they clear a quicker path to energy independence? Or have a sudden impact on carbon emissions? At a talk on green tech at M.I.T. last April, Doerr said: ''To get solutions at scale, we're going to have to find answers that are economic for all people everywhere. We've got to use policy to harness innovation to make sure that the right thing to do is a profitable thing to do -- so it becomes the probable thing to have happen.'' In his folksy manner, this was his way of expressing how green tech could infiltrate our businesses and culture. Academics sometimes call this process the diffusion of technology. Diffusion can go very fast, as has been the case with personal computers or with Web applications like Facebook. But in the field of energy, history is less encouraging: new technologies have moved quite slowly into the mainstream. It has been 54 years, for instance, since the silicon solar cell was invented in New Jersey at Bell Laboratories. A front-page article in this newspaper heralded the breakthrough as something that promised to revolutionize the world. It hasn't yet, of course.
Perhaps the most challenging aspect of Kleiner's endeavor, then, is for green tech to expand into the markets more rapidly than any energy technology has done before. In a conversation I had with Al Gore in early September, I asked how that would be possible. Gore shows up at Kleiner's offices several times a month to share his political and environmental insights. (When I asked Gore what he thought he brings to Kleiner, he quipped, ''I think it's my knowledge of subatomic physics.'') He became involved in private-sector climate solutions because, he said, ''more money is allocated in the private markets in one hour than in all of the budgets of all of the governments of the world in a year's time.'' The trends that have governed the development of alternative-energy technologies till now, he said, aren't a result of some natural scientific law. Echoing a point Bill Joy made to me a few months earlier, Gore said cheap oil had made renewable technologies less appealing as investments, which in turn had made it difficult to bring clean-energy costs down through mass production. Gore used the example of digital products: prices have come down, even as sophistication has gone up, thanks to Moore's Law, which describes how computer chips double in capacity every two years or so. ''How slowly these technologies have been developed in the past,'' Gore said of green tech, has ''limited bearing on how quickly we could deploy them in the future, if we wanted to.'' Solar-thermal companies like Ausra could soon be competitive with coal-based electricity production, he said. And when the governments of the world assign a price to carbon, he added -- as he believes they will within a year or two -- demand for carbon-free electricity will explode.
From Gore, a bearer of bad tidings when it comes to climate news, this seemed to strike a more hopeful tone. ''My previous optimism involved an act of will that occasionally was hard to reconcile with the worsening reality,'' he told me. His optimism had recently grown considerably, partly because of the prospect of new policies on carbon emissions, and partly because of innovations he'd seen at Kleiner. Some of these were green-tech companies, Gore said, that were in ''deep, deep stealth''; they were known to no one except for a few V.C.'s and the entrepreneurs themselves. I heard a similar point elsewhere. John Doerr's speech last spring at M.I.T., for instance, was notably more upbeat than the emotional one he gave at the 2007 technology conference, where he said, ''I don't think we're going to make it.'' I recently asked Doerr how he felt now. ''I'm more optimistic about the innovation that will occur,'' he replied. ''I'm more humbled by the scale of what has to be done. Or more sober. And I'm particularly concerned about the speed.'' The green-energy technologies Kleiner was investing in, Doerr continued, ''won't impact the problem at scale in the next five years, just because they have long development times associated with them. In the 5-to-15-year period of time, I think they'll demonstrate, and clearly point the path to, lower costs than we would have otherwise imagined possible.''
The difficulties along the way can't be understated. Many green-tech companies are building products that require entirely new industrial processes, which might trap them in a kind of innovator's paradox. At Ausra or Bloom, for instance, it will be challenging, early on, to reach the stage of mass production because there aren't enough buyers willing to pay for the costly products. On the other hand, the products are so costly because they are not being mass-produced. Historical patterns of innovation suggest that novel products succeed in the marketplace by exploiting a niche as their sales steadily expand and as their performance improves and costs go down. Ausra has the good fortune to have contracts with California electricity providers. But the company intends to stake out other niches too -- selling solar-thermal installations to companies that require large quantities of steam for food production or oil production, for example, or to coal-fired power plants to supply some of the steam that runs their turbine generators. The latter use has the potential to reduce a coal plant's carbon footprint more cheaply than buying equipment to capture smokestack emissions.
At Bloom, K. R. Sridhar told me he considers his challenge akin to what cellphone makers encountered a few decades ago. Cellphones were initially balky and expensive; they created a niche market of users in the developed world who appreciated the phones for their portability. In developing countries, governments and entrepreneurs found it cheaper to build cellular networks than land lines. Eventually costs decreased, reliability improved and sales soared. In several conversations, Sridhar advanced this process as a model for Bloom. In the U.S. and Europe, he told me, Bloom has to be just as reliable as the power grid and priced competitively. In areas where the grid is stressed and utilities are reluctant to build expensive new power plants, he could sell his fuel cells to new hospital buildings, big-box retail stores and computer-data centers. ''In the developing world,'' Sridhar said, ''we don't have to compete with the grid price of electricity.'' The biggest hurdle, as he saw it, would be up-front capital costs -- helping energy entrepreneurs finance the purchase of a Bloom box, for instance, so they could create a ''microgrid'' that serves several hundred homes and stores. This is Sridhar's dream for civilization. Ultimately, the Bloom box could offer low-emission, 24-hour-a-day power to villages in Asia and Africa that have never possessed modern appliances or to cities that have never experienced reliability.
His immense ambitions were not unlike those of Amyris, a biofuels company in Kleiner's portfolio located in Emeryville, Calif., next to Oakland. Amyris is synthetically engineering new strains of yeast that will convert organic matter -- Brazilian sugar cane, initially -- into renewable fuels for automobiles, trucks and jets. Its diesel has a carbon footprint 80 percent smaller than that of regular diesel. ''Between now and 2020, here's what we think is possible,'' John Melo, Amyris's C.E.O. told me. ''Somewhere around 20 percent to 30 percent combined jet fuel and diesel'' will be produced globally through a renewable process like the Amyris technology. Without impinging on rain-forest land or food production, Melo maintained, Brazil could produce 100 billion gallons of biofuel annually from cane; Africa could produce a slightly smaller amount. (Last year, U.S. drivers consumed 140 billion gallons of gasoline.) Melo, who used to be president for U.S. fuel operations for BP, told me the first niche market for Amyris would be tractors and trucks at sugar mills in Brazil in 2010; U.S. trucking fleets and diesel cars would follow in 2012. In the meantime, the company would be working on a product for military and commercial jets. How much could he produce renewable diesel for? ''Our cost in Brazil is about $1.80, $1.85 a gallon,'' he said. Transport costs would add another 40 cents per gallon. At the time, the wholesale cost of diesel in the U.S. was around $4 gallon. ''So this is profitable venture,'' Melo concluded. ''By 2012 to 2013, our profits could be higher than many Fortune 500 companies.''
As with most of Kleiner's green-tech ventures, it was a financial outcome that wasn't yet certain in a future that wasn't yet real. And would it even get the chance? There were impediments for sure -- Brazil's regulatory ministries might not like the idea of genetically engineered yeast, or a competitor to Amyris might dominate the market. So maybe it wouldn't work. Or maybe it would. Melo and I were talking in a conference room with panoramic views of the East Bay. It was hot outside and warm inside; an assistant had brought in water, and the ice was melting quickly in our glasses. Seen out the window, the freeways were jammed. Oil was more than $100 a barrel. But for a brief moment, at least, in the realm of the venture capitalists, this particular idea, like so many of the others I'd heard, seemed bright with possibility, and I understood why Doerr and Gore had given in a little bit to hope. Almost anything seemed possible.

HEADLINE: Swedish Spoken Here

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
I was talking to friend in New York City the other day about the current financial crisis, and she told me about a scene she had just witnessed in the lobby of the Warwick Hotel. Four Swedish tourists, who clearly had been on a shopping spree in Manhattan, fueled by the still cheap dollar, were trying to cram all their purchases into four suitcases. They had bought a hand-held scale -- one of those you just grip onto the suitcase and lift -- to make sure all their American goodies were not overweight for the flight home.
 Another friend of mine in the ship-supply business in Baltimore, Alan Kotz, told me about a German customer who recently put in double his normal order. When Alan asked him if he was aware of how much he had ordered, the German brushed his question away and laughed: ''Alan, nevermind, everything for us is half price.'' 
 And a good thing it is. Even though the dollar has strengthened a bit lately, we are going to need foreigners and sovereign wealth funds from China, Asia, Europe and the Middle East more than ever to survive this crisis -- and they are going to need us to be healthy as well. In the process, we are going to become even more intertwined and dependent on the rest of the world.
 Sarah Palin won't have to worry that she doesn't know what the Bush doctrine is. No one really knew what it meant. But it had something to do with the unilateral exercise of American power, and the next president's ability to act unilaterally on anything other than vital national security issues is going to be reduced. As the old saying goes: He who has the gold makes the rules. Well, we no longer have as much gold, and until we get some, we will have to pay more heed to the rules of those who lend us theirs.
 At a time when the U.S. government gets half its borrowings from abroad, at a time when the U.S. household savings rate is hovering around zero and China alone is already holding around $1 trillion in U.S. Treasury notes and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds -- yes, that's how you got that cheap subprime mortgage -- it can't be any other way.
 Somebody better tell John McCain: We are all Swedes now. Forget about ''Live Free or Die.'' Until we get our financial act together, our motto is going to be: ''Swedish spoken here -- or Arabic or Chinese or German ...''
 I would also bet that more and more of the foreign investors who come our way are going to want to buy hard, tangible assets -- skyscrapers, real estate and real companies -- not just mutual funds, T-bills, bank stocks or other equities. No problem. Americans own assets all over the world; foreigners have long owned substantial positions in U.S. companies. That's globalization -- and now you are going to see globalization and financial integration on steroids. It should help us, but also change us. 
 ''The next round of capital that comes in from abroad is going to be much more demanding and move into real assets,'' argued Jeffrey Garten, professor of trade and finance at the Yale School of Management. ''Being a bigger debtor nation means losing even more of our sovereignty. It means conducting our economic policies with an eye toward whether others approve. It means bearing the advice and criticism that we have dispensed ad nauseam to other countries for over half a century. It means far more intensive consultations with other capitals on our fiscal policies and our monetary policies.''
 At the same time, added Garten, ''Corporate decisions will become more sensitive to international factors, in part because more non-Americans will be on the governing boards.'' Ultimately, this could make American industry even more globally competitive -- but for those who can't pass global muster or enlist global collaborators, the consequences could be harsh.
 Of course, neither Barack Obama nor John McCain dare talk about this now. They want to pretend nothing has really changed. The minute one of them steps into the Oval Office, they will tell us otherwise. That will be the January surprise.
 There was a lot of talk after Russia invaded Georgia that globalization was over and we were seeing the return of ''history'' and the primacy of politics over economics. I think not. Politics and economics are always inextricably intertwined. History-making is rarely free. The Russian stock market has been hammered as a result of its invasion of Georgia, and the global slowdown has sunk Russian oil and gas earnings. No country is an island today.
 Making history is not simply about the will to do so. It's also about the way -- the resources you have to achieve your ends. Whatever wills the next American president comes to office with, he is going to find that his ways have been diminished and restricted -- until we roll up our sleeves and work our way out of this mess.

HEADLINE: A Cure For Condo Glut?

BYLINE: By DANIEL McGINN. 
Daniel McGinn is a national correspondent at Newsweek and the author of ''House Lust: America's Obsession With Our Homes.''

 BODY:
For the condo developers Jeff Blum and David Franco, the evening of Sept. 14, 2006, couldn't have been more perfect. For two years the partners had worked on plans to construct a nine-story condo building called View 14 at the intersection of 14th Street and Florida Avenue in northwest Washington. On this night, they welcomed nearly 1,000 potential buyers into a nearby furniture store that they'd transformed into a nightclub. A D.J. spun music while bartenders poured an orange concoction called the View-tini. And as the party hit its peak, the partners unveiled a giant Lucite model, complete with dry-ice fog and glowing lights, of their building, which would cost $55 million to build. ''It was like the Detroit debut of a new car,'' Blum says. ''We had everything except the turntable.'' 
 The morning after the party, the View 14 sales center opened. Over the next few weeks, a crowd of potential buyers came through, ogling floor plans and artists' renderings of the units, which had an average price tag of $500,000. The sales team signed contracts for the penthouses, with one fetching $1.2 million. But sales of run-of-the-mill units were agonizingly slow. ''People loved the building, loved the finishes, but they weren't writing contracts,'' Blum says. According to the partners' business plan, 50 of the building's 180 units should have sold in the weeks following the launch party. But by early December, during a meeting with a key financial adviser, the partners closed the door to talk candidly. ''We haven't sold 40 or 50 units,'' Franco said. They'd sold only 18. The adviser's jaw dropped. A minute later, they gave him another shock: instead of selling View 14 as condos, Blum and Franco were thinking of converting the building -- on which construction hadn't yet begun -- into rental apartments.
 It's an act of real estate hocus-pocus that's starting to become common. ''It's happening all over,'' says Greg Willett, the vice president for research at M/PF YieldStar, an apartment-market consulting firm. Willett saw the first signs of the shift in early 2007 in places like Washington, Boston and Miami, where the condo boom had been particularly frenzied. Buyers were realizing that condo prices had reached a plateau. The speculators who once loved to flip new-construction condos had disappeared. Instead of rushing in with deposits, buyers began taking a wait-and-see approach, hesitant to risk watching their investment lose value during the course of construction. The credit crunch that began in mid-2007 made things only worse. As condo demand has fallen, some developers have tried to adapt by turning their projects -- some of them still in the planning phase, some partway through construction, some completely finished -- into rentals. ''We've been tracking this market for 35 years, and we haven't seen anything like this,'' says Gregory Leisch, the chief executive of Delta Associates in Alexandria, Va., which recently counted 15,000 capital-area condo units under development that would eventually hit the market as rentals.
 For developers, switching a project from condos to apartments can be difficult. In general, condo buyers are looking for larger units, with more square footage and bedrooms. They want better cabinetry, flooring, lighting and appliances. The ceilings in condos are often 6 or 12 inches higher than in rentals. Meanwhile, in a rental building, developers tend to invest more in shared amenities like lobbies, gyms, pools and roof decks. That's because condo owners spend more time inside their units, so amenities within the apartment are more important, whereas shared amenities like gyms and pools drive condos' common charges higher. In rental buildings, however, better common areas make it easier for landlords to re-lease apartments, which turn over more frequently than condos.
 Aside from design changes, the economics of making this switch can be daunting. Projects financed on an assumption that condos will sell for $550 per square foot look much different when the spreadsheets are tweaked to show monthly revenue of $3 per square foot stretching out for years. ''The lender has to be sold on it as well -- it's not necessarily you flip the switch, and all of a sudden you're a rental,'' says Jonathan Miller, a veteran Manhattan property appraiser. 
 For Blum, 46, and Franco, 43, the shift was an emotional decision as well as a financial one. They'd spent a couple of years negotiating to buy the land, which is located a little more than a mile north of the White House. (They say the site contained a dilapidated garage that the seller told them appeared in the 1983 Mr. T movie ''D.C. Cab.'') By late 2006, the partners had already spent $13.5 million on the land and another $5 million or so on ''soft costs'' (including architects' fees, permits and the launch party). But before breaking ground, they would have to line up financing for the tens of millions in construction costs.
 To make View 14 work as a rental, they needed to lower their original $55 million budget. They also had to plug in new assumptions about how much they could earn in rental fees for the 180 apartments (current estimates range from $1,450 a month for a 500-square-foot studio to $4,500 for a 1,700-square-foot two-bedroom with a den), how much that rental revenue would grow each year (3.5 percent), how long it would take to fully lease the building (nine months) and what percentage of the apartments would be vacant, on average (in their estimation, 5 percent). They needed to think about their exit strategy: whether to try to sell the building as soon as the apartments were rented or hold on to it, acting as long-term landlords and hoping the building grew in value over time. Blum says they haven't decided yet, but ''we'd been condominium developers. Our mind-set has been: build a project, sell a project.'' 
 For Franco, the switch came at a personal cost. He had set aside one of the nicest units -- a triplex with 3,200 square feet of living space and a 2,300-square-foot terrace -- for himself; now that penthouse would be chopped into apartments. ''I'm not the only developer that had great visions of living in their building and had to see those visions disappear,'' he says. Eliminating the penthouses boosted the number of units to 185 from 180. 
 Inside the apartments, the developers changed the designs in the hope of cutting costs and appealing to a broad pool of renters. They increased the sizes of bedrooms and closets -- they worried that the spaces would look skimpier in an actual walk-through than to someone buying from a floor plan, as many predevelopment condo buyers do. At the same time, they slightly reduced the overall size of each one -- by about 31 square feet apiece -- leaving them with an average size of 835 square feet. They switched from Italian cabinets to domestic ones; they swapped out KitchenAid appliances for Whirlpool and chose Moen plumbing fixtures instead of Grohe.
 The more visible changes came in the common area, which originally was just 1,800 square feet. To make the building more appealing to prospective renters, the partners expanded the lobby, added a game room, a business center and a fitness center and increased their spending on the roof deck. They also added a ''party room'': a loungelike space large enough to hold dozens of people, with nice furniture and an attached kitchen, that residents can rent out for events. ''You're selling a lifestyle, a community, in a rental project -- unlike a condo project, where you're selling somebody their own unique home,'' Franco says. These changes came at yet another cost: that extra 2,200 square feet was originally devoted to the restaurants and shops that would lease the first floor, so larger common areas would mean about $7,000 less per month in retail rent, which the partners hope to make up by charging residents a $500 annual ''amenities fee.'' 
 There were some things about the building they couldn't change. They wish they could have replaced the building's central heating/air-conditioning unit with cheaper in-unit models, at a savings of about $1 million. They might have changed the building's exterior, to cut down on its use of expensive glass. But by that point the permits and plans were too far along. Still, they'd cut enough corners to reduce the overall budget by around $5 million, though neither partner particularly enjoyed the exercise. ''Every time you go back, you strip out a layer of luxury, a layer of sexiness,'' Franco says.
 The partners were lucky that they decided to make the shift from condo to rental before they broke ground, which gave them leeway to make changes. Less than a mile north on 14th Street from View 14 lies Highland Park, a seven-floor building that at midsummer stood nearly complete. The developer, Chris Donatelli, began construction on two large condo buildings across the street from each other in 2005. The plan called for Highland Park to include 229 condos costing $300,000 to $600,000 each, with the building across the street containing 153 units at similar prices.
 By early 2007, however, Donatelli's sales force was experiencing the same slowdown as Blum and Franco's -- and the situation was made worse by having two condo projects so close to each other. ''We were competing against ourselves,'' Donatelli says. So he decided to switch Highland Park to rentals. By then it was too late to make structural changes to the building. But inside the units, his team made cosmetic adjustments, choosing 229 identical kitchens and shifting from hardwood floors to stained concrete, which would be easier to maintain in a rental. But Donatelli says the building, which was nearly half-rented during the summer while workers completed the upper floors, should work well as a rental because the original design and prices were in keeping with this up-and-coming neighborhood. ''It wasn't like we were trying to sell million-dollar condos and then tried to rent them -- that doesn't work well,'' says Donatelli, whose apartments will rent for $1,600 to $3,400 a month.
 Among developers, it's widely understood that constructing a rental building requires more patience than building condos. In a perfect world, when an apartment building is fully leased, the rental revenue will cover the building's carrying costs, giving the owner some profit -- but the developer never knows exactly how well he's done until he sells it down the line. Blum and Franco express confidence. They have a great location and unbeatable views of the city, they say, and despite the cost-cutting, the units still feel luxurious. ''We have absolutely no uncertainty that it's going to lease up,'' Franco says. 
 Up the street at Highland Park, Donatelli points out that if the market for condos heats up again in a few years, developers who have shifted from condos to rentals could always go full circle by converting their rental buildings back to condos. But for now, even developers whose projects once seemed like can't-miss propositions are learning to think long term, just like the rest of us.

HEADLINE: A Lot of Smiles Per Gallon

BYLINE: By STUART F. BROWN

 BODY:
THE friendly wave to an oncoming rider is a familiar tradition among motorcyclists, a subtle acknowledgement of shared membership in a brotherhood of free spirits.
 Why, then, did it surprise me when I was offered this greeting perhaps half a dozen times -- by owners of heavyweight touring rigs, no less -- while on a recent ride along Hudson Valley roads?
 Simple: I was riding a Vespa. 
 That's right, a motor scooter, which used to be considered -- let's not mince words here -- a sissy among two-wheelers, so far as real motorcyclists were concerned. 
 It's my best guess that the newfound cordiality had something to do with the scooter's good fuel economy, something everyone is thinking about these days. 
 It didn't hurt that the Vespa GTS 250 has an attractive retro design, streamlined in that particularly Italian way, and was shiny black. 
 My test of this $5,999 Vespa was part of an effort to identify some two-wheel commuter vehicles that would be fuel-efficient without being dull.
 The GTS 250 passed the test. Its four-stroke engine (no more trails of blue smoke, like those that followed classic Vespas everywhere) had enough power to move out smartly when the light turned green and was good for about 75 miles an hour -- the fastest Vespa ever, its advertisements say. The quick steering made it fun to thread through traffic, but best of all, it covered about 60 miles on each gallon of gas while I had it. 
 Like most scooters, the Vespa uses a continuously variable transmission, or C.V.T., a design that automatically adjusts the internal drive ratios according to the demands of the moment. No gear shifting is required. A downside of scooters is that they have small wheels (the GTS's are 12 inches in diameter), which can get snagged by deep potholes. The upside is that people turn their heads and smile when you whoosh by on a Vespa. It looks and feels cool. It makes you want to say ''ciao'' again and again. 
 The effortless twist-and-go riding style is a big part of a scooter's appeal. But for riders who like wicking up the throttle and shifting through a 6-speed gearbox, something like the 2009 Kawasaki Ninja 250R, a full-size motorcycle with 17-inch wheels, might be a better match. With a racetrack-ready look and a list price of $3,999, the junior Ninja was the bargain among the bikes I tried. 
 In 550 miles of testing I rode the Ninja 250R from New York to Boston and back, about 420 miles, and spent the rest of the time on suburban roads and city streets. Ridden with conservation in mind, the Kawasaki delivered an impressive 71 m.p.g.; keeping up with traffic on the Massachusetts Turnpike -- which seems to move at a minimum pace of 65 miles an hour -- kept the Ninja's 2-cylinder engine wailing at 7,500 to 9,000 r.p.m. and dropped the mileage to 49 m.p.g. Cycle World recorded a top speed of 96 m.p.h.
 Popular with new riders and the budget-minded, the recently redesigned Ninja 250R is Kawasaki's best-selling model in the United States. The company thoughtfully neglected to paste a 250 decal anywhere on the machine, leaving onlookers to think it might be one of those speed-demon 600 cc or 1,000 cc Ninjas. 
 Extracting highway-capable horsepower from a 250 cc engine (Cycle World measured it at 27 horsepower) requires spinning all the pieces at a furious pace; the redline is a lofty 12,500 r.p.m. 
 For those who find a scooter too lighthearted and a conventional motorcycle too serious, there is another alternative: single-cylinder dual-purpose bikes. Because they are so agile in cities, these on-road dirt bikes can make great commuters. 
 This has become an easy route to take, thanks to the supermoto phenomenon, which began in Europe. Dirt riders there began replacing the knobby off-road tires on their bikes with sticky pavement tires and carving a path through cities and towns on the lightweight, quick-steering machines. 
 Manufacturers took notice, and now you can buy an off-the-shelf bike like the Suzuki DR-Z400SM (SM stands for supermoto) and hit the streets. Derived from a rugged dirt bike, the $6,299 SM has a 400 cc engine with lots of torque, so you can idle it down in traffic and still pull away without downshifting. Riders commuting on Suzuki supermotos report that 60 m.p.g. is possible with a bit of restraint, and the suspension can negotiate horrible pavement without being overwhelmed. That's where the dirt-bike heritage shines.

HEADLINE: If Things Fall Apart, Who Gets the Ring?

BYLINE: By NADINE BROZAN

 BODY:
WHEN an engaged couple breaks up, does the ring go back to the one who bought it? Or does it remain in the hands -- and possibly on the hand -- of the recipient, especially if she was the one spurned? 
 Though a seemingly inconsequential issue when measured against the prospect of an unhappy marriage, the conflict over the ring has led couples to court.
 ''I probably get an e-mail every two or three weeks asking for my advice on this question,'' said Joanna Grossman, a Hofstra University law professor who has written on the subject.
 ''It is something that a lot of people dispute,'' Ms. Grossman said. ''People can spend an exorbitant amount of money on rings they cannot afford and then it is not uncommon for them to break up. But the rings are not usually worth enough to offset the cost of litigation.'' 
 One high-profile case that was headed to court but was diverted by an agreement earlier this year was that of Sharon Bush and Gerald Tsai, the billionaire investor who has since died. In December 2006, Mr. Tsai gave Ms. Bush (the former wife of Neil Bush, a brother of the president) an 11-carat canary-diamond ring he bought for $243,040 at Saks. In January, the engagement was called off, and when Ms. Bush did not return the ring, Mr. Tsai filed suit in Manhattan Supreme Court seeking its return. 
 Ms. Bush and her lawyer, Raoul Felder, took the position that the bauble was not an engagement ring but a gift, and therefore did not have to be returned. Mr. Felder said that terms of the agreement could not be divulged but that she has since been seen wearing the ring.
 ''This was one of the other presents given on Christmas,'' said Mr. Felder. ''It was a nonconditional gift. I can't understand how a man is not embarrassed to ask for his ring back. It always amazes me what happened to chivalry.'' 
 Chivalry aside, in recent years courts have almost always held that the ring goes back to the buyer, no matter the circumstances. The premise is that the engagement ring is a conditional gift -- the condition being that a marriage take place. And if it does not, the agreement is rendered null and void. Furthermore, courts have ruled that it does not matter who broke the engagement, the donor or the recipient. 
 ''If you have no-fault divorce, you must have no-fault engagements,'' said Joanne Ross Wilder, a principal in the Pittsburgh law firm Wilder & Mahood. In 1999 she won a ruling in a Pennsylvania case that is viewed as precedent setting: the ring should be returned to the donor. 
 ''Before this case, there was a split of opinion in the United States as to whether the donor should get the ring back if he broke the engagement without just cause,'' Ms. Wilder said. ''If you get into who was at fault in deciding whether the ring should remain with the donee or return to the donor, you do a counterintuitive analysis. Isn't the purpose of an engagement to be a trial period and isn't it better to break an engagement than a marriage? Whose fault is irrelevant.'' 
 But state by state, that view does not always prevail. Gary L. Nickelson of Forth Worth is president-elect of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers. He said that in Texas exceptions were sometimes made depending on who instigated the breakup. Although the courts there generally accept the premise that an engagement ring is a conditional gift, he said that in a 2003 decision: ''the court decided that if the donor was the one who broke the promise, then the recipient could keep it. It gets sticky if the groom calls it off. He has broken the condition, so some courts say that he should probably suffer and not gain rights to the ring.''
 Ms. Grossman noted that trying to establish fault can be tricky at best and painful at worst. ''Taking two people who decide they are not right for each other and putting their entire relationship on trial is usually not worth the economic or emotional cost,'' she said. 
 Ownership of the ring did not become a problem for Dean Fechner and his former fiancee when their wedding plans were canceled in June 2007. 
 ''The man should definitely get the ring back,'' said Mr. Fechner, 36, of Manhattan. ''It was intended to show that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with this person and that I put a value on our relationship.'' 
 Last month Mr. Fechner, who works on Wall Street, sold the three-carat custom ring for $15,000 ($3,000 less than he said he paid for it) on idonowidont.com, a Web site that sells rings for couples who have changed their minds.
 Letitia Baldrige, the etiquette expert, said the person who breaks the engagement is responsible for making good. ''If the woman breaks it, she should send the ring back immediately,'' Ms. Baldrige said. ''If it is the man, he should say, 'Of course you keep the ring.' '' 
 Should the ring be a family heirloom, Ms. Baldrige added, the woman should return it. ''But then he should buy her another piece of jewelry or simply give her a credit at a jewelry shop,'' she added. ''Nice people do that.'' 
 Even those lawyers who define the ring as part of the contract to marry, and therefore subject to return if the contract is voided, recognize the need for exceptions. 
 ''Assuming Mr. Wonderful is married to someone else and getting divorced and gives her a 4-carat ring, he is not legally able to become engaged,'' said Eleanor Breitel Alter, who leads the matrimonial department and is a partner in Kasowitz, Benson Torres & Friedman in New York. ''There are cases that say he cannot get the ring back because there was a legal impediment to the marriage at the time he gave it.'' 
 Citing cases where estates seek to recover rings, she said: ''Another complication occurs if the giver of the ring dies prior to the marriage and it is the death that prevents the marriage. Then the donee may keep the ring.'' 
 Even after the marriage has taken place and the ring is unequivocally the property of the wife, questions may still arise. ''Once the marriage occurs, the wife keeps it because the conditions were completed,'' Ms. Alter said, ''but if you upgrade the ring because one carat seems too puny, and get a 4-carat stone instead, that becomes marital property which can be divided in a divorce.'' 
 It did not occur to Nadia Sookram, 29, a finance manager with MTV, to keep the one-carat solitaire she had received from Michael O'Neil, her college boyfriend. Even though plans for their wedding in July 2005 were well in place -- a banquet hall had been booked, dresses for five bridesmaids chosen, and a photographer hired -- when they broke up. 
 ''There was no discussion about the ring, and he never asked for it,'' said Ms. Sookram, who gave it back. ''Throughout our whole relationship, he was broke and had been saving up forever to buy it. I asked my mother if she wanted money from the ring because we lost a lot of money on the wedding, but it's not about the money. It's about rebuilding and moving on. I feel proud of the decision.''

HEADLINE: The Smart Money, Foiled Again

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
SO far, the financial crisis on Wall Street has been as unpredictable as it's been severe. Consider some of the twists and turns we've already witnessed:
 A series of storied, blue-chip banks and brokerage firms with long track records of earnings growth suddenly collapse.
 The Dow plummets 777 points in a single day after one Wall Street bailout plan fails in the House of Representatives. And the Dow falls an additional 157 points on the day a second plan becomes law.
 Panicked investors renounce risk-taking, pushing the financial sector down by more than 20 percent since June. Yet there is enough of a gambling streak left to send shares of the perceived winners of this shake-up soaring, like Bank of America, up 54 percent; Wells Fargo, up 45 percent over the past three months; and JPMorgan Chase, up 30 percent. 
 It is hard to make sense of this market, which is precisely why you shouldn't assume that conventional wisdom is correct about how to play the crisis.
 The so-called smart money seems to avoiding three big investment categories: index funds, dividend-paying companies and small-caps. On paper, that seems to make perfect sense in these times. If you do a little homework, however, you will notice that some of these ideas haven't panned out. At least not yet. 
 TO INDEX OR NOT There is a simple reason for making the case that investing in index funds won't work in this crisis: Financial stocks represent one of the two biggest sectors in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, currently accounting for 16 percent of it.
 Actively managed funds would seem to have an advantage, since their managers have the freedom to step out of this losing sector and redeploy that money.
 That is the theory. In reality, most actively managed funds didn't have the foresight to avoid the meltdown in the financial sector. At the start of September, for example -- before the government's takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and its bailout of the American International Group -- the average actively managed large-cap fund invested nearly 15 percent of its assets in financial services. That was almost exactly the sector's weighting in the S.& P. 500 at the time.
 That may explain why active managers haven't been able to outperform basic index portfolios lately. Morningstar, the mutual fund tracker, did the calculations and found that the average large-cap index fund fell 26.8 percent over the past year through Sept. 29. That is almost the same as the 26.7 percent decline for actively managed large-cap funds. Over the past three years, their results were exactly the same: both active and index funds posted annualized losses of 2.2 percent.
 Among small-cap portfolios, index funds actually beat the average actively managed fund over the past year, three years and five years -- even though small-cap index funds maintain a far greater weighting in financial stocks than their actively managed counterparts.
 THE DIVIDEND QUESTION Financial stocks account for roughly a quarter of all the dividends paid out by the S.& P. 500 index, leading many people to say that investing in dividend-paying stocks isn't advisable now.
 As banks, brokers and insurers have run into hard times, many firms have cut or eliminated their dividends. This year, 30 financial companies in the S.& P. 500 have cut their payouts to the tune of $24.1 billion, according to Standard & Poor's.
 This certainly shows the dangers of betting on a handful of individual dividend-paying stocks. ''If you're trying to get income by owning just three or four high-yielders, you're taking a big risk that one or more will run into trouble,'' says Luciano Siracusano, director of research at WisdomTree asset management.
 But Mr. Siracusano noted that this doesn't mean that diversified dividend investing strategies will fail in this market.
 In fact, they are working. Not only did dividend-paying stocks in the S.& P. 500 beat non-dividend-payers in September -- the height of the financial crisis -- the dividend-payers have also outperformed over the past yearlong bear market. In the 12 months through September, around the market's peak, dividend-paying stocks have fallen 22.1 percent, versus a drop of 27.5 percent for nonpaying shares, according to Howard Silverblatt, S.& P.'s senior index analyst. 
 Some funds focus on dividend-paying stocks that have consistently raised their payouts, and these funds are performing particularly well. Consider the SPDR S.& P. Dividend E.T.F., an exchange-traded fund that tracks the S.& P. High Yield Dividend Aristocrats index. It includes only high-yielding stocks that have managed to raise dividends for 25 consecutive years, and it is down just 6.8 percent since the start of the year. Compare that with the 25.1 percent year-to-date loss for the S.& P. 500. 
 LARGE VS. SMALL STOCKS Many economists and market watchers believe the financial crisis will push the economy into a recession, if it's not already in one. ''I can't think of anyone who thinks there's not going to be a recession now,'' said Michael P. Balkin, co-manager of the William Blair Small Cap Growth fund. 
 If that is the case, the market could be in for a sustained period of volatility, which naturally drives investors to the safety of large, industry-leading companies. This may turn out to be the safest strategy. But here's a surprising twist: Since the middle of March, small-company stocks are holding their own. Since March 10, the Russell 2000 index of small stocks is down 3.7 percent.
 To be sure, small-cap stocks were punished in September, when the financial crisis really started to frighten the markets. But even then, small stocks lost 8 percent in the month, versus a drop of 9.5 percent for their large-cap cousins.
 EARLIER this year, the small caps' superior performance was regarded as a sign that this economic downturn might be short-lived. Today, few people think that the economy is on the verge of accelerating. But the real reason for this performance could be simpler than that: small-stock earnings have just held up better in this crisis.
 Steven G. DeSanctis, small-cap strategist at Merrill Lynch, noted in a recent report that small-cap earnings were expected to climb nearly 2 percent in the third quarter, versus an expected decline of 5 percent for the S.& P. 500. If this happens, it would be the fifth consecutive quarter when small-company earnings have held up better than those of large firms.
 Nevertheless, in the short term, small-cap stocks may not perform as well as they have recently, Mr. Balkin warned. ''They could just mark time, '' he said, especially if economic concerns come to the fore. But if the recession ends sometime in the first half, he said, 2009 could turn out to be a decent year for small stocks.

HEADLINE: For Two Longtime Bank Rivals in Charlotte, Competition Turns to Concern

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- No sooner had construction begun in the late 1980s on the 42-story bank headquarters -- the tallest building in North Carolina -- than its biggest rival announced it would build a taller building right up the street.
If one bank gave $50,000 to the Chamber of Commerce, the other wrote a check for the same amount. When one built a performing arts center, the other built a museum. For decades here, it has been thus: the two banks, homegrown Wachovia and the larger Bank of America, gleefully one-upping each other, and Charlotte coming out the winner.
With Wachovia dominating the south end of Tryon Street, uptown's main thoroughfare, and Bank of America dominating the north end, Charlotte became the second-largest banking center in the nation, behind New York.
But last week, as Wachovia, which employs 20,000 people here, became the latest financial institution to succumb to the credit crisis, the long spirit of competition between the two banks swiftly turned to concern. 
''When you go to a boxing match, you want to win in the ring,'' said John Gachora, a managing director at Bank of America, ''not because all your opponents had a car crash on the way to the ring.''
With the financial crisis vividly in evidence, the mood on Tryon Street was palpably glum. Last weekend, after long hours of work trying to save Wachovia, one middle-aged employee had a fatal heart attack. In Raleigh, executives at RBC Bank canceled the parachuters that were supposed to appear at the grand opening of its new headquarters, saying it was not an appropriate time to have people jumping off a bank building.
Between the announcement on Monday that Wachovia would be forced to sell much of the company to Citigroup for an amount equal to $1 a share and the news on Friday of a more significant counteroffer from Wells Fargo, it has been a roller-coaster ride for the city. Even those who knew Wachovia was in trouble were shocked at the speed of its decline. At happy hour, the casual attire of those already laid off stood out against the dark suits of the still-employed but nervous. On Wednesday night Morton's, one of a herd of steakhouses catering to the banking crowd, was virtually empty.
Like many Wachovia shareholders, Tom Dunn, 64, who was a lawyer for Wachovia for years and is now at a law firm, was rethinking his retirement date after losing more than $1 million in Wachovia stock -- about half his savings. ''I'm very disappointed,'' Mr. Dunn said Wednesday. ''I'm telling myself that anger probably is not healthful.''
His disappointment was tempered a bit by the news about Wells Fargo -- long regarded as a better geographical match for Wachovia because it is based on the West Coast and could benefit from Wachovia's large East Coast footprint -- stepping in with a $7 a share offer. Citigroup is contesting the deal, and on Saturday night it said that a judge in New York issued an emergency order temporarily blocking the merger with Wells Fargo. Many in Charlotte have hopes that a sale to Wells Fargo would help preserve jobs.
Even if the jobs stay, said Bob Morgan, president of the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce, ''From a civic perspective, we can no longer walk across the street and see the C.E.O. of the fourth-largest bank in the country.''
The banks' respective territory is so jealously guarded that when Wachovia installed its first A.T.M. on the north end of Tryon Street, it was front-page news in The Charlotte Observer.
The two banks had different cultures. Wachovia, which started in Winston-Salem and was acquired by Charlotte's First Union in 2001, was regarded as a laid-back, collegial place where, even in this crisis, top-ranking executives have kept their jobs.
Bank of America, which has 13,000 employees here, is widely viewed as a more aggressive culture, flavored by the style of its longtime leader, Hugh L. McColl Jr., an ex-marine. ''My boss used to work at Bank of America,'' said a young Wachovia investment banker who declined to give his name because of insecurity about his job. ''She said she'd go in every day putting on her armor.''
But social life was a different story. Wachovia and Bank of America executives live in the same neighborhoods, their children go to the same schools and their junior associates frequent the same uptown bars.
On Tuesday Robert Stickler, a senior vice president at Bank of America, said a Wachovia executive would be joining his family for Rosh Hashana dinner. ''In business they were very fierce competitors, but that ended when the business day ended,'' Mr. Stickler said. ''There's a lot of concern inside our headquarters over the last couple of days because a lot of us have friends at Wachovia. They were working as hard as we were, they just made a bad decision.''
When the banks were smaller, their contest was fiercer, said George V. Hanna III, a lawyer at Moore & Van Allen and a longtime Charlotte resident. ''If you were for one, you were against the other,'' Mr. Hanna said. ''It was very difficult for providers of professional services like law firms to work for both of them. As the banks got larger, the competition within Charlotte lessened.''
Both viewed Charlotte as an important investment. Led by the banks, the city poured money into sports facilities and graceful streetscaping, making Charlotte -- the largest city in North Carolina -- a magnet for young college-educated professionals and keeping its real estate market strong even as the rest of the country suffered.
When the forced sale of Wachovia was announced Monday, Mr. McColl, who is no longer with Bank of America, called it ''a body blow'' to the city.
Everywhere, the conversation centered on the details of the sale. Would the buyer retain Wachovia's name, with its reputation for sterling customer service, or jettison it as tainted by financial failure? Would the retail banking division stay in Charlotte?
What would happen to the new Wachovia tower, with its state-of-the-art trading floors, under construction on South Tryon Street, and the arts complex that was part of the project? ''The cranes are still working,'' said Micheal Shook, who works at an agency that provides staff for the two banks.
The uncertainty was not limited to the south end of Tryon. Bank of America is also in flux after its purchase of Merrill Lynch last month, prompting worries that much of the company's investment banking would move to New York. A significant drain of financial jobs from the city would affect real estate values, recruitment, support companies like law and accounting firms and other issues that have a bearing on both banks.
One executive at Bank of America said the mood was evident when he announced that he would be leaving for another job.
''If I went last year to resign, my boss would have said, 'What can I do to get you to stay?' '' he said, declining to use his name because he was quoting another employee. Instead, his boss told him, ''I want you to stay, but congratulations, because I don't even know if I'll be here myself.''

HEADLINE: Boswell to the Bluebloods

BYLINE: By CAROLINE H. DWORIN

 BODY:
EACH morning, David Patrick Columbia looks online to check the price of gold. Then he reads the financial pages in newspapers here and abroad. He reads The Financial Times, The Guardian and The Telegraph. He reads Page Six of The New York Post; he reads the obituaries. 
 For a self-made social chronicler of the city's ruling set, its socialites and its power brokers, all this reading serves to indicate how his work will proceed. 
 Now, with a nation mired in financial ambiguity, eyes turn to the very well-to-do for some hint of what lies ahead. And the very well-to-do are a demographic that Mr. Columbia has watched and studied and documented for many years. 
 His signature New York Social Diary began in 1993 as a monthly society column in Quest magazine, a publication for the city's upper crust, and in 2000 made its first appearance online as an independent project. In the diary, with the help of his business partner, Jeffrey Hirsch, Mr. Columbia combines society pages with personal reflection, resulting in an often giddy, celebratory chronicle of galas in gilded ballrooms, opening nights at the opera and annual picnics on Long Island lawns. 
 This first-person essay offers a remarkable portrait of what it was like to be present at the dawn of the millennium, as the stock charts peaked, trembled and plunged, and as the drinks flowed on late into the night, before the party ended. 
 At 6 feet 4 inches, Mr. Columbia stands out in a crowd. Well dressed, with light hair parted at the side, and round glasses, he displays a courteous curiosity that draws secrets from socialites' lips. He listens intensely. But when he speaks, his eyes widen, his eyebrows rise, and his long-fingered hands sketch images in the air; he conducts conversation as one might conduct an orchestra. 
 His Web site bristles with society news beneath a blue, white and fuchsia header that is flanked by high-rent advertisements (Diane von Furstenberg, Bergdorf Goodman). Prose is punctuated by photographs: little groups of smiling socialites caught cocktail in hand for a frozen moment, the light of the flash touching golden brocade, a diamond earring, the chalk-white teeth of a smiling tycoon. Last month, on Mr. Columbia's calendar: a post-symphony dinner in a tent next to the Metropolitan Opera; a gala at Cipriani for New Yorkers for Children; names like Muffie Potter Aston, Whitney Fairchild and Bronson Van Wyck, echoes of stately Old World class. 
 ''No, I am not Gatsby,'' Mr. Columbia once said of himself. ''I'm Nick Carraway. I live in the little house next door.''
 In recent weeks, as financial fears trump a presidential election, reporters from news organizations like Reuters and The Los Angeles Times have contacted Mr. Columbia to see what he could tell them about how the crisis has affected New York's rich. 
 ''What these people are asking is what has happened,'' he said. ''What has happened? Nothing had happened. It's too soon to determine what's happened.'' 
 Yet his tone between parties grows grim. ''Financial stress in a community, if widespread enough,'' he wrote after Congress initially voted down an economic bailout, ''can be like spilled gasoline and easily ignite.''
 One evening in late September, Mr. Columbia attended a dinner party with a number of extremely rich guests who had suddenly lost a good deal of their assets. 
 ''The conversation went on about the summer,'' he said, ''about the children, about travel. Actually, no one was talking about it. They really don't know how to even assimilate that information.'' His loud, clear voice deepened: ''We have been drinking champagne for a long time.''
 ON a Wednesday in August, when many of those who make things happen in New York were in the Hamptons or abroad, Mr. Columbia, wearing a seersucker blazer with four cream-colored buttons at each cuff, took lunch at Michael's, the celebrated restaurant on West 55th Street, just off Fifth Avenue. 
 Mr. Columbia keeps a table on the periphery, at once a part of the fray and removed from it. 
 Across the room, a gentleman with a thick head of white hair raised his hand to Mr. Columbia, who waved back. ''That's Harry Benson,'' he said. ''He's taken some of the most iconic photographs of our age.
 ''Bill Rondina,'' he said, peering around at the tables. ''He owns a company called Carlisle, which sells women's clothing.'' Regulars include the billionaire Ronald Perelman, Barbara Walters and the gossip columnist Liz Smith.
 A woman from Sotheby's paused to chat; a man invited him to spend a weekend at his house in Bridgehampton; hardly a diner passed by without stopping at his table to shake his hand or touch his arm. 
 But between pleasant pockets of small talk, Mr. Columbia spoke of financial turmoil, and how we all got ourselves into this mess. In this credit card era, he sees a nation and its people mistaking debt for money, with no idea of the consequences.
 ''That's a phenomenon in our society,'' he said, ''of people just standing facing danger and not moving. I remember the footage I saw of the tsunami, of people standing on a hillside watching it at the ocean's edge, and they were startled and astonished and amazed. And then the ocean came and took them all away. They didn't know how to get out of the way.'' 
 Several weeks later, the federal government took control of the nation's two largest mortgage lenders, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy; the Fed loaned $85 billion to American International Group; and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson proposed a $700 billion life raft to save a sinking financial system.
 ''We are about to go from adolescence to adulthood,'' Mr. Columbia had said that summer day at lunch. ''The way the American people have been living for the last 25 years -- some say it's going to come to a crashing end.'' He smiled and picked up his spoon. ''I don't mean to be apocalyptic.''
 THE funny thing about The New York Social Diary is that no one seems to read it. ''Oh, yes, I've been in it,'' a woman at a party said. ''Three times, I've been told.'' 
 Nevertheless, the site is visited by some 600,000 individual users every month; regular readers are those featured in its pages: business leaders, philanthropists and socialite doyennes. Then there's a toll clerk named Mahogany, who writes from her booth in Houston, commenting on the dresses and the hair, curious to know if Muffie Potter Aston is still married to that doctor.
 In addition to the diary, for which Mr. Columbia produces all the content, and the photographs, most of which are taken by Mr. Hirsch, who works from his loft across town, the site includes sections on travel, philanthropy, shopping and art.
 In the House column, the writer-designer team of Sian Ballen and Lesley Hauge conduct interviews in subjects' homes, perched side by side with a tape recorder, as Mr. Hirsch roams about shooting pictures. 
 Guest diarists contribute their own memories. Peter Evans, a journalist and biographer, wrote: ''Christina Onassis once told me that she wore diamonds at breakfast because 'they look so pretty in the morning sun. You have no idea how erotic men find dew on the rocks.' '' 
 But along with its photos, The New York Social Diary is best known for Mr. Columbia's effervescent musings on the city's bold-faced names. 
 ''Around two, two-thirty ayem,'' Mr. Columbia wrote not long ago, ''they were setting up for the breakfast menu although by 3 o'clock in the morning, the crowd had begun to thin out, heading back to their lairs high above the canyons of Manhattan, done in, sated, satisfied and ready to lay their little heads down for some sleepy time. The boy from South Africa who came to the Big Town quite some time ago to make his fortune, had ushered in his 7th decade (the 7th decade begins at age six-oh) with a big bang and a good time to be had by all. It'll be a while before he one-ups himself after this one.''
 The Web site Gawker once described Mr. Columbia as its ''favorite sycophant diarist,'' mocking him for suggesting that ''The Real Housewives of New York'' were not real Society (capital ''S''), when his own father was a chauffeur. 
 Mr. Columbia had written: ''An expensive apartment, a limo and a house in the Hamptons does not society make.'' And he stood by it, never claiming to want any social status but his own.
 ''If you hang out with a bunch of champion tennis players, it doesn't make you a champion tennis player,'' he said. ''It's the same with society. You don't get it by declaring, 'I am.' ''
 Among those who criticize him for pandering to the upper class is Remy Stern, the creator of Cityfile.com -- a ''Zagat's guide to people,'' as he describes the site -- who considers The New York Social Diary too gentle and too polite. ''Younger people,'' Mr. Stern said, ''are less inclined to be interested in very fluffy editorial.''
 Yet, more sociologist than sycophant, a writer and student of the game of power, Mr. Columbia has little patience for snark.
 ''I'm very interested in extracting what it is like if you are really there,'' he said. ''What it feels like. And often it doesn't feel like anything.''
 WERE he to print all he knew, all he had witnessed of the nature of power, he might not be invited to so many parties. He remembers once, at a summer wedding, seeing a young guest kneeling beside the chair where his father-in-law sat. The two men spoke quietly together, after which the older man removed a fist-size wad of cash from his pocket and handed it to the son-in-law. Mr. Columbia watched the young man's face. 
 ''Wide-eyed lust,'' he remembers. ''Almost a sexual lust. I never wanted that money.'' Nor the things it could buy. ''I don't want the house. I've seen that house, I know that house, I've been inside that house, I've danced in that house.''
 David Patrick Columbia grew up in a little house in Westfield, Mass., in the foothills of the Berkshires. His father was the chauffeur for ''Black Jack'' Bouvier, the wild, womanizing father of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. These were the upstairs people. ''We were downstairs people,'' Mr. Columbia said. 
 His father gambled, and as a result, his mother, an industrious, creative woman, had to work. His older sisters left when he was small, so it was he who listened: When she cried over the sink washing dishes, he was there. ''That was kind of an onus, in a way,'' he said of her suffering. ''But the reality was it strengthened her. Growing up with this woman who was very, very unhappy about her life made a very deep impression on this little boy.'' 
 His parents argued constantly, and perhaps the only thing that soothed their quarrels was their intimate, involved discussions about the exotic lives of the ''upstairs people'' that theirs just grazed. David listened in on these fairy tales, and they soothed him, too. He asked for, and was given, a typewriter and a dollhouse.
 Over the years, Mr. Columbia moved through many phases, many careers. He was married for nine years, divorcing to pursue a relationship with a man; and for a time in the 1970s he owned a head shop in the Westchester town of Pound Ridge. He spent 14 years in Los Angeles, writing anything he could, then collaborated with Debbie Reynolds on ''Debbie: My Life,'' her 1988 memoir. 
 In 1992, he began writing society profiles for Quest magazine, a looking-glass for Manhattan's well-to-do. Mr. Columbia, it seemed, could don a well-tailored suit and fit into whatever environment he chose. He remembers what his mother used to say, a fleck of envy in her voice: ''You always thought you could do anything.''
 Since 1996, he has lived in a modest one-bedroom rental on the Upper East Side, with a balcony overlooking East End Avenue. The place is packed with books and photographs -- Mr. Columbia with childhood friends, Mr. Columbia as a little boy outside his sister's high school, Mr. Columbia smiling next to Hillary Rodham Clinton, Mr. Columbia smiling next to the Dalai Lama -- and two excitable Shih Tzus named Missy and Byron. 
 One afternoon, wearing blue jeans and loafers, he stood in his nook of a kitchen cutting up chicken for the dogs.
 ''I have a lot of opinions about a lot of things,'' Mr. Columbia said. ''And a lot of insight into a lot of things. I don't really comment on a lot of things. Because my responsibility is to leave a record of what it appears to be like at the scene. I can't tell you what that will mean later on.''
 THE benefit last month shut down 73rd Street between Lexington and Third Avenues at rush hour, drew hundreds of people and encased the street in a party tent hung with sequined apple-shaped ornaments. At the entrance to the tent, a woman painted teal and dressed as the Statue of Liberty posed for photographs as white-coated waiters shuttled drinks and hors d'oeuvres.
 This was the fifth year of the Fete de Swifty, a fund-raiser named for a restaurant named for a dog. Last year, the event raised about $750,000 for the Mayor's Fund to Advance New York City, with the money going to a program that fights domestic abuse. 
 When Mr. Columbia arrived, late, wearing a blue jacket with gold buttons, a blue shirt and a butter-colored tie, two middle-aged women called to him in little-girl voices. They toyed with their hair, adjusted their dresses and posed. He took their picture. Others approached: couples, groups, all of them kissing his cheek and touching his arm, sharing details of their lives, and asking after his.
 ''He thinks he knows the A-list,'' said Joseph Fichera, the chief executive officer of a financial advisory firm on Wall Street, as Mr. Columbia passed with an elegant mob. ''Actually, I think he makes the A-list.''
 A young blond woman who worked at Sotheby's stumbled about on the arm of a friend. A dark-haired woman sat alone with a drink, opening fortune cookies one at a time.
 ''I have to go stand up there with him,'' Mr. Columbia said with a sigh as Mayor Bloomberg took the stage. Disengaging himself from the throng, he made his way to those gathered for a group photo with the mayor, who had reminded the guests of the need for philanthropy, that ''not everyone is as lucky as us.''
 Cameras flashed, lighting lavish clothes and perfect hair. When they stopped, the group broke up, and the stage was quickly dismantled.

''What these people are asking is what has happened,'' Mr. Columbia says of the current financial crisis. ''What has happened? Nothing had happened.''

 BODY:
THE NEWS The House of Representatives unexpectedly rejects the $700 billion economic rescue plan negotiated by the leaders of both parties, the Treasury and the White House. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS Efforts by central banks before the vote to loosen up straitened credit markets with big injections of cash fell flat, so when the bill's defeat becomes clear, stock markets spiral downward; the Dow industrials fall nearly 7 percent, their worst day in decades. The defeat reflects broad public anger over the rescue package, which is criticized as an undeserved bailout of Wall Street high-flyers. House Republicans, in particular, defy their leaders to vote no. 
 THE NEWS A day of behind-the-scenes scrambling in Washington yields a new version of the rescue package for the Senate to consider, with added provisions like tax breaks for businesses and alternative energy and an expansion of deposit-insurance coverage. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS The additions to the bill are meant to make it more politically palatable, but they promise to add billions to the cost of the rescue package while adding little to its effectiveness. Equity investors are relieved at the progress, and major stock indexes retrace about half of Monday's losses. But nervous banks are still reluctant to lend either to customers or one another, and credit markets remain tight.
 THE NEWS The Senate approves the revised rescue bill by a comfortable 75-24 margin. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS Signs of worsening problems in the broader economy begin to pile up, as a political consensus gathers around the revised plan. Automakers report double-digit percentage falls in sales; an index of manufacturing activity deteriorates; and a major injection of capital into General Electric by the billionaire investor Warren Buffett fails to buoy its shares. After sliding in the morning, major stock indexes climb back to roughly where they started the day. But little relief is seen in credit markets, prompting calls for more coordinated action by central banks. 
 THE NEWS Though both the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve signal that they are giving new consideration to interest-rate cuts, neither takes action on rates. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS Mounting anxiety about the economy sends stock indexes tumbling again, while party leaders in Washington try to wrangle enough votes in the House to pass the revised rescue bill. Ripple effects of the continuing constriction of credit are seen in the insurance industry, state and municipal finance, construction, Silicon Valley and other sectors afield from Wall Street. One silver lining of sorts for consumers: The prospect of withering demand pushes oil prices down.
 THE NEWS The House of Representatives passes the revised rescue package by a comfortable margin, and President Bush quickly signs it into law. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS The sweeteners added to the bill win over some opponents, though more Republicans still vote no than yes. Stocks rally strongly before the vote but slump afterward, as investors turn attention to a gloomy employment report and to the specter of a legal battle over the fate of Wachovia, a major bank. The credit markets stay frozen, awaiting the implementation of the rescue plan; though officials promise quick action, experts say it will be weeks before the Treasury can actually start buying up troubled assets.
