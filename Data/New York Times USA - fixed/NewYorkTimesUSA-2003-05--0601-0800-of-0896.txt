HEADLINE: Few Doctors At Protests On Insurance In New York 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
Doctors and their supporters held demonstrations across New York State yesterday, calling for state and federal legislation to limit lawsuit awards that they contend are driving up health care costs.
 The drive to limit civil jury verdicts is an evergreen issue in Albany and Washington, perennially stalled by Democratic lawmakers and their close allies, the trial lawyers. While there has been no sign of change in the State Capitol, doctors and their allies have been heartened by movement on legislation, backed by President Bush, in the Republican-controlled Congress. 
 But yesterday's events in New York were sparsely attended, and New York doctors have given no indication of a revolt of the kind staged by doctors in New Jersey, Florida and Nevada, who have staged work slowdowns and walkouts to protest high malpractice premiums. And while doctors in some states face what even skeptics concede is a crisis of sharply rising premiums, consumer advocates and lawyers' groups insist that is not the case nationally or in New York. 
 About 200 to 250 people, many of them in white lab coats, attended the demonstration on the steps of the State Supreme Court building on Foley Square in Manhattan. In Albany, 150 people took part in the protest, but most were not doctors -- rather, they were people who work in medical offices, construction company managers and others who support lawsuit restrictions. Turnout was lighter in other upstate cities like Buffalo, where about 20 protesters rallied.
"New York is in chronic crisis when it comes to any sort of liability," Dr. Jeffrey A. Ribner, president of the Medical Society of the State of New York, said at the Manhattan rally. Dr. Donald J. Palmisano, president-elect of the American Medical Association, said, "Doctors are disappearing across the country" because of high premiums and damage awards.
But Blair Horner, legislative director of the New York Public Interest Research Group, a consumer advocacy group, called the demonstrations "part of a national strategy, coordinated by the A.M.A., to push the Bush bill" through Congress. "There is no malpractice crisis in New York," he said.
 Doctors in New York have long paid higher premiums than most of their counterparts around the country, but consumer groups say that mostly reflects the generally higher cost of doing business in the state. Critics contend that high premiums are due primarily to doctors' own mistakes, and that recent increases around the country have been caused mostly by insurance companies' investment losses in a weak economy -- a claim challenged by the insurers and doctors.
 In New York, increases in insurance premiums must be approved by the State Insurance Department. While the department has granted increases in some high-risk specialties, it has not allowed a general increase in malpractice coverage in several years.
 Unlike most states, New York actually helps its doctors buy insurance. Doctors have to buy their own malpractice coverage, up to certain dollar limits, and then can obtain "excess" coverage through a state-subsidized pool for any damage awards above those limits.
 What has raised doctors' costs in the last year, state officials say, is a state law raising the amount of coverage doctors must buy on their own before they can qualify to buy the state-run excess coverage. But the state limited the corresponding premium increase to 5 percent.
 Evidence from the National Practitioners Data Bank, a program run by the federal Department of Health and Human Services, is inconclusive.
New York has more malpractice awards, either in court verdicts or out-of-court settlements, than any other state, but the total number of such awards has remained about the same in the last decade, both in New York or nationwide, according to the databank. The databank shows steady increases in the size of malpractice awards over the last decade, but they rose no faster than the overall cost of medical care.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Terror Alert and Case of Mad Cow Disease Hurt Stocks

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks edged lower yesterday, pressured by renewed fears of a terrorist attack in the United States and a sell-off in shares of McDonald's on news that a cow tested positive for mad cow disease in Canada.
 Earlier, the federal government raised its terror alert status to the second-highest level. The decision to change the color-coded alert to high, or orange, from elevated, or yellow, followed a warning from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that an attack on American soil was possible, though it had no specific threat information. 
 "You had the terror alert earlier and some people sold on that, but then cooler heads prevailed," said Bob Basel, senior trader at Smith Barney. 
The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 2.03 points, or 0.02 percent, to 8,491.36. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edged down 1.04 points, or 0.11 percent, to 919.73. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index also slipped, dropping 1.68 points, or 0.11 percent, to 1,491.09.
Advancers outnumbered decliners 9 to 7 on the New York Stock Exchange, but losers outnumbered gainers on Nasdaq 8 to 7. Trading was heavy, with roughly 1.50 billion shares changing hands on the Big Board, and 1.67 billion on the Nasdaq.
Wall Street was also waiting for the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, to testify on the economy before Congress today. Mr. Greenspan's speech will be his first on the economy since May 6, when the central bank warned of a risk of deflation.
"The stock market has been consolidating lately, but the trend is still definitely up," Louis G. Navellier, a money manager who runs his own firm in Reno, Nev., said yesterday. "Trading volume is softening today as investors wait for Greenspan's speech tomorrow."
Shares of McDonald's tumbled 6.66 percent on news that one cow in Alberta, Canada, tested positive recently for mad cow disease. McDonald's shares sank $1.21, to $16.95, and were the Dow's biggest percentage loser. Tyson Foods, the largest United States beef processor, fell 4.86 percent, or 46 cents, to $9.01.
Mad cow disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, has killed more than 100 people in Europe. It was the first confirmed case of the disease in a cow raised in Canada. The United States, which has never reported a case of mad cow disease, issued a temporary ban on beef imports from Canada.
Among the market's gainers, Home Depot leaped more than 9 percent and helped underpin the Dow. The retailer reported higher-than-expected earnings, helped by demand for new products and store upgrades. Its shares rose $2.60, to $30.67.

Treasury Prices Rise
(By Bloomberg News)
Benchmark 10-year Treasuries had their biggest gain in eight weeks yesterday as traders speculated that the Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan would suggest today that he was growing more concerned about the declining rate of inflation.
The gains extend a two-week rally that has provided investors with a 4.5 percent return on the benchmark 10-year note and driven yields to the lowest level in 45 years. Traders are buying Treasuries as a bet that the Fed, concerned that slowing inflation may turn into a decline in prices and deepen an economic slump, will cut interest rates.
The 10-year note gained 1 1/32, to 102 8/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, dropped to 3.36 percent from 3.48 percent on Monday.
And the 30-year bond gained 2 5/32, to 116 11/32. Its yield dropped to 4.36 percent from 4.48 percent.
Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills and six-day cash management bills:

HEADLINE: Asian Nations Gain Indirectly From Dollar's Declining Value 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, May 20 

 BODY:
The most unlikely winners from the dollar's slide in value are some of the countries compiling the biggest trade surpluses with the United States, especially China.
 China and most Southeast Asian nations have linked their currencies to the dollar in one way or another, so its slide has pulled down the value of their currencies as well. This has made their exports more competitive in Europe, where the dollar has fallen more than 20 percent against the euro over the last year, and even in Japan, where the dollar has dropped 10 percent against the yen in the same period despite the Japanese government's repeated interventions in currency markets. 
 At the same time, companies in China and Southeast Asia have lost none of their competitiveness in their main export market, the United States. 
"Everything we buy or sell, materials and finished products, is all denominated in dollars," said Bruce Grill, a middleman here who helps American stores buy shoes from Chinese factories. When it comes to the dollar's decline, he said, "We're not affected by it."
The biggest beneficiaries are Asian exporters to Europe like Trimex Holdings, a Hong Kong company that buys power tools from factories in China and exports them to hardware stores in the European Union. Trimex has continued to charge the same prices in euros to many of its European customers and has converted the proceeds into more and more dollars as the dollar declined. But the cost of buying the tools from China, transacted in dollars, has barely increased. "It is a very good thing for our gross profit margins," said Thomas van Duinen, Trimex's general manager of Asian operations.
European retailers are also profiting. El Corte Ingles, a chain of high-quality Spanish department stores, buys electronics, garments, food and beverages from China and has been able to persuade many of its suppliers over the last year to accept payment in euros, said Alejo Rodriguez, the general manager of its Hong Kong purchasing office.
The switch to negotiating contracts in euros should provide some protection for El Corte Ingles if the dollar rebounds. At the same time, the chain has been negotiating new contracts at lower and lower prices in euros because Chinese factories are still incurring costs either in dollars, for oil and oil-based materials like plastic, or in Chinese yuan, for labor and many other costs.
"That the euro is stronger makes life easier for us," although it hurts exporters back in Spain, Mr. Rodriguez said. "It's easier to negotiate; it's easier to get better prices."
Some currencies in Southeast Asia, like the Hong Kong dollar and the Malaysian ringgit, are officially pegged to the dollar, rising and falling in lock step with it. China's central bank informally but effectively ties the yuan's value to the dollar.
Other currencies in the region -- like the Singapore dollar, the Thai baht, the Indonesian rupiah and the Taiwan dollar -- are loosely pegged to the dollar and have crept up slightly against it in recent months, but have fallen against other currencies because of the dollar's decline.
The dollar slipped some more today after dropping notably on Monday in response to weekend remarks by Treasury Secretary John W. Snow that suggested weakening support from the Bush administration for a strong-dollar policy. Late this afternoon in New York, the euro settled at $1.1738, up from $1.1643 late Monday. The dollar dropped to 116.71 yen from 117.40 yen on Monday despite remarks from Finance Minister Masajuro Shiokawa that Japan might again intervene in the markets and sell more yen.
To limit or prevent their currencies' rise against the dollar despite substantial trade surpluses, Asian governments have been buying dollars from exporters, paying with more of their domestic currency. They have accumulated hoards of foreign exchange reserves as a result, with the world's top five holders of such reserves all in Asia.
According to figures from the International Monetary Fund and the Chinese central bank for March, the most recent month available, Japan had reserves of $496.2 billion, China had $316 billion, Taiwan had $171 billion, South Korea had $124 billion and Hong Kong had $114 billion.
The extra competitiveness from what is effectively a fixed exchange rate has been particularly great for China. The Chinese have been experiencing mild deflation, with prices falling nearly 1 percent a year until this spring, while the United States still has modest price increases. So the Chinese yuan has actually been depreciating against the dollar on a price-adjusted basis.
There have been periodic calls for China to allow the yuan to rise in value, especially from Japan. Officials in Tokyo accuse China of manipulating its currency rate to export unemployment to other countries -- something that Japan has been accused of doing for decades.
William Belchere, an economist at J. P. Morgan Chase, said the yuan had depreciated by nearly 11 percent in export-weighted terms since the dollar reached its peak in early 2002. But with international attention on Iraq, North Korea and the dollar, there seems to be little pressure for China to act soon, he said.
The Chinese central bank currently maintains the yuan at a rate around 8.28 to the dollar. Chinese production costs are so low that even a modest revaluation may not have much effect on its steady gains in world markets, Mr. Belchere said, adding, "Is moving from 8 to 7 going to do anything?"
European Union countries bought only 15 percent of China's exports last year. Consumer confidence in other markets, especially the United States, will be more important to China than the yuan's decline against the euro, said Fred Hu, an economist at Goldman, Sachs.
In the first three months of this year, the United States ran a trade deficit with China of $24.67 billion, a deficit with Japan of $16.37 billion, and deficits with Taiwan, Thailand and Malaysia of $2 billion to $4 billion each. The American trade deficit with all countries using the euro totaled $16.41 billion, according to the Commerce Department.
Andy Xie, an economist at Morgan Stanley, predicted that the dollar's slide against the euro would do little to help the American trade deficit. "It's deflating," he said, "against the wrong currency."

HEADLINE: Breaking the Mideast Deadlock 

 BODY:
Israelis buried the victims of the latest terrorist outrage yesterday while Palestinians stayed sealed off in their towns and villages, each side seething with resentmentand despair. This may seem like the least likely moment to move forward on Middle East peace. But it is precisely the time for President Bush to increase his involvement. He has been saying the right things, and he took a small but significant step yesterday when he telephoned the new Palestinian prime minister, Mahmoud Abbas, for their first conversation. He also called Ariel Sharon, the Israeli prime minister. Far more is needed. Unless Mr. Abbas and his more moderate agenda succeed, radical Muslim forces will hijack the Palestinian national movement, and hopes for a two-state solution could disappear. 
 There are two urgent needs. The first is for Mr. Abbas and his security chiefs to confront the militant Islamic groups that carried out five terrorist assaults in 48 hours. There is little mystery as to who some of the key planners and perpetrators are, or where they live. They must be arrested and their arms confiscated. Mr. Abbas has to commit himself to acting. He has the power to do so in the Gaza Strip, and with quiet Israeli compliance, he could make progress in West Bank towns as well. 
 At the same time, Prime Minister Sharon has to embrace the new peace plan outlined by the United States and other parties and offer the Palestinians evidence of a desire to move forward. The conditions under which they live are intolerable, with unemployment and poverty spiking. Roadblocks and curfews imposed by Israel should be lifted. If Israelis feel they cannot do much to reduce the pressure on Palestinians without exposing themselves to risk, they can dismantle the dozens of settlement outposts constructed over the past two years. These outposts violate Israeli law and require troops to protect them.
Mr. Bush should encourage negotiations by inviting both leaders to the White House. Mr. Sharon postponed his visit because of the attacks, but he should come soon. Al Qaeda and its affiliates are reconstituting themselves. The last thing the world needs is for them to conquer more Palestinian hearts and minds.

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: SOVEREIGNTY; 
Iraqi Politicians to Issue a Protest of Occupation Rule

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, May 20 

 BODY:
Iraq's main political groups said tonight that they were drafting a formal statement of protest to the American and British authorities over their plans to declare an occupation authority in Iraq, which would delay the rapid turnover of sovereignty to an interim Iraqi government.
 Iraqi political figures who attended a meeting tonight with David Manning, the foreign policy adviser to Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, said they wanted to work in partnership with Washington and London. But they said they were strongly opposed to the reversal in policy announced to them Friday. 
 Hoshyar Zebari, who was speaking for Massoud Barzani, the leader of the largest Kurdish faction, told Mr. Manning that the allies needed "a political partner" in Iraq, but warned that failure to fill the political vacuum with a functioning Iraqi government could incite a strong backlash in the Iraqi population and interference from neighboring states seeking to move into the void. 
Several speakers warned that the allies, in delaying the formation of an Iraqi government, would provide ammunition to former Baath Party supporters of Mr. Hussein who might contend that the worst fears of Iraqis were being realized: a takeover of Iraq and its oil by Western powers.
Several Iraqi political figures said they now wanted to press ahead with the formation of an interim national assembly that could appoint a provisional government, despite resistance from the Bush administration and Mr. Blair's government.
In an account of the meeting provided by the Iraqi leaders, Mr. Manning said he would take their written protest and a report of their views back to Mr. Blair. 
At the same time, the political leaders seemed reluctant to break openly with the allies. Instead, they said they would pursue a strategy to exert political leverage to regain the momentum they had established toward forming a government. 
"We don't want to clash with them," one Iraqi political figure said tonight.
The change in political strategy for postwar Iraq was timed to gain support at the United Nations for a new resolution to lift sanctions and provide a role for the United Nations in the reconstruction effort. The policy was announced last Friday by L. Paul Bremer III, the new civilian administrator here, in a private meeting with Iraqi political leaders.
The shift in approach places the United States and Britain at the forefront as occupation powers and opens the way to a series of steps aimed at re-establishing security and rebuilding governing institutions with strong United Nations involvement. It would delay, perhaps for a year or more, the installment of an Iraqi government, allied officials have told the Iraqi political groups. Officials from those groups said the decision was already having a serious psychological impact on Iraqis.
Mr. Manning told the Iraqi political figures that the change in policy was forced by political pressures at the United Nations related to the draft resolution that Washington and London have tabled in New York. The allies want the sanctions lifted quickly, but for the United Nations to do so, there has to be an authority in place to do things like sell oil or unfreeze and distribute assets of the former government. An interim Iraqi authority was deemed insufficient for those purposes. 
"We want to be partners, and we want to leave just as soon as we can," Mr. Manning said. "But we cannot do that unless we leave behind structures that are worthy of you and that are properly assembled."
Several officials said Britain had taken the lead in delivering the message to the Iraqi political figures, hoping to persuade European members of the Security Council to vote to lift sanctions. But some Western officials said it was noteworthy that Mr. Bremer, who did not attend today's meeting, was keeping some distance from the dispute. These officials suggested that the White House might be giving Mr. Blair room to maneuver while reserving an option to resume support for the swift formation of an Iraqi government if political developments in Iraq and the Middle East demand it.
Earlier this month, Jay Garner, the first civilian administrator sent to Baghdad by the Bush administration, said he wanted to form an interim government quickly from the ranks of the main groups that opposed Saddam Hussein's government for more than a decade.
In the meeting tonight, the Kurdish chieftain Jalal Talabani alluded to Britain's past administrative role in Iraq by addressing Mr. Manning as representing "our former masters." He said the victory over Mr. Hussein "will not be consolidated" until "the right of self-determination of the Iraqi people" is secured by Iraqis stepping forward to manage the postwar process and preparations for the first democratic elections. 
Mr. Talabani said setting up a weak "interim authority," as now contemplated by Washington and London, "will deprive Iraq from independence, sovereignty and diplomatic relations, which is not good for you or for us."
Another leading political figure, Ahmad Chalabi, argued that the allies would be taking a negligible risk in forming an interim Iraqi government, "since no government would have complete authority in the presence of hundreds of thousands" of allied troops. Those troops, he said, will represent the real authority in Iraq for some time and are needed by the Iraqis to protect the country's borders, secure the economic base in the oil fields and deter neighbors from meddling in Iraqi affairs.
But as it stands, he said, the allies seem afraid to take a risk on an indigenous Iraqi leadership.
"Do you realize that what you are giving the Iraqi interim authority in 2003 is far less than you gave the Iraqi government when you occupied Iraq in 1920?" he said, adding, "You have done this before."
Mr. Chalabi asserted that when the Ottoman Empire fell after World War I, Britain formed a new Iraqi government and signed a treaty that effectively extended British dominion in the country, while establishing autonomy for the Iraqis who lived in the loose federation of Ottoman provinces of Mosul, Baghdad and Basra.
"We are your best friends here," Mr. Chalabi said. "We want to work with you" and want allied forces to "stay a long time" until the country can stand on its own feet economically and militarily.
But he also issued what seemed to be a warning that failure to create a sovereign government would backfire. "We do not want to make your presence here an issue," he said.
Meanwhile, several former Iraqi opposition groups meeting in Berlin echoed their counterparts' complaints, saying they feared that the occupation authority could evolve into an open-ended ruling mandate.
"If we don't give Iraq the sovereignty they need, this will create instability in Iraq and that instability will run through to the whole region as well," said Ali Bayati, the London representative for the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq.

HEADLINE: Bush Drug Proposal in Medicare Plan Faces Stiff Battle 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR and ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20 

 BODY:
As Congress begins drafting Medicare legislation, one of the most contentious and politically explosive issues is whether the same drug benefits should be available to all.
 The Bush administration and many of its allies on Capitol Hill say they want to use prescription drug benefits as an incentive to encourage older Americans to enroll in private health plans. People who stay with the traditional, government-run Medicare program would receive only modest drug benefits, while those who join private plans would be rewarded with much more extensive coverage. 
 White House officials and Republicans in Congress say the private plans would be more efficient than Medicare's lumbering bureaucracy. But the idea of using drug benefits to entice elderly people into those plans is in trouble on Capitol Hill. 
Democrats are almost universally opposed to the effort, which they deride as a move to privatize Medicare. More ominous for the administration is the opposition of many Republicans, including several moderates who bucked the White House on tax cuts and several powerful lawmakers from rural states.
The debate is gaining urgency as Congress begins an intensive six-week drive to pass Medicare legislation, potentially one of the most significant domestic policy bills of the legislative session and one that is already behind schedule because of the struggle over tax cuts.
Medicare does not generally cover drugs outside the hospital. Efforts to add outpatient drug benefits have been unsuccessful.
Senator Rick Santorum, Republican of Pennsylvania, spoke for many conservatives when he said that Medicare should offer "a higher drug benefit as an incentive" for recipients to move into private plans.
"We all understand that the old Medicare system is a very inefficient way to provide care," said Mr. Santorum, the chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, the formal organization of the 51 Republican senators. "It's lower quality, and it costs more."
A Congressional aide said White House officials had made it clear that "they really must have an unequal drug benefit."
On the other side are lawmakers like Senator Olympia J. Snowe, a Maine Republican who is a member of the Finance Committee, who insists, "Every senior should have access to comprehensive prescription drug coverage, regardless of which Medicare option they choose."
Congressional leaders have set an ambitious schedule, intended to get a Medicare bill to the president's desk by this fall. They plan to push the complex legislation through three committees in early June and through the full House and Senate before the Fourth of July.
Many on Capitol Hill say the legislation, a top domestic priority for President Bush, is doomed unless Congress acts this year, before the presidential campaign begins in earnest. Democratic presidential contenders are already campaigning hard on the soaring costs of health care and what they say is the failure of Republicans to address it.
The Medicare proposal favored by Mr. Santorum and the White House would encourage people to enroll in private plans known as preferred provider organizations. Such plans would receive larger federal subsidies and could therefore offer more generous drug benefits than the government-run fee-for-service Medicare program, which now serves 88 percent of the 40 million Medicare beneficiaries.
But several influential Republicans say such an arrangement would penalize the elderly in rural areas, where private health plans have historically been unavailable or inaccessible to Medicare beneficiaries. Their constituents, they say, have a right to stay in the original Medicare program and receive comprehensive drug benefits.
The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican who is up for re-election next year, has made his position clear, saying: "We need a universal drug benefit so seniors who want to stay in traditional Medicare get a prescription drug plan that's just as good as those who choose a new option."
Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the senior Democrat on the committee, has also denounced the idea of "differential drug benefits," saying it would discriminate against people in traditional Medicare. "That's just not fair," Mr. Baucus said. "In Montana, virtually all beneficiaries are in traditional Medicare."
Behind the fight on Capitol Hill is a struggle over the future of Medicare: Will it remain a traditional social insurance program, offering the same package of benefits, specified by Congress, to everyone on the rolls? Or will it embrace a larger role for private health plans, competing to control costs and offer innovative benefits to a generation of aging baby boomers -- but also, critics say, restricting their choices of doctors and hospitals?
The fee-for-service Medicare program allows people to visit any doctor, but does little to coordinate care. In recent years, Medicare officials have encouraged beneficiaries to join health maintenance organizations and other private plans, with limited success.
Along with the White House, Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader, has championed a market-oriented approach, arguing, "The Medicare delivery system is antiquated, fragmented and overly bureaucratic."
Dr. Frist said the disjointed fee-for-service system could not coordinate drug benefits with other services covered by Medicare.
A Senate leadership aide said Dr. Frist wanted to give some drug benefits to people in traditional Medicare, but favored "higher benefits" for those who enrolled in private plans. Another Senate aide said "political reality" would probably force Dr. Frist to accept equal benefits.
The House has twice passed Medicare bills offering equal drug benefits to people in private plans and in the government-run program, though neither bill became law. White House lobbyists have apparently not persuaded House Republican leaders to depart from that position, Congressional aides said.
Thomas A. Scully, administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said he realized Congress was leaning toward creating equal drug benefits for all.
"That's not where the administration is," Mr. Scully said in an interview. "But I believe right now the House bill is likely to have equal benefits and the Senate bill is likely to have equal benefits."
Asked whether the administration could accept such a bill, Mr. Scully replied, "It depends on the whole package." Still, he said he was optimistic that the administration and Congress could agree this year.
Under Mr. Bush's proposal, people in the traditional Medicare program would receive drug discount cards and protection against very high drug expenses. People in private plans would get comprehensive drug benefits worth about twice as much as the assistance given to people in traditional Medicare.
Doug Badger, the president's health policy coordinator, defended the proposal as a major improvement over what the elderly have now. "Adding a prescription benefit and a drug discount card to traditional Medicare, at no additional cost to the beneficiary, is a real improvement," Mr. Badger said.
But lawmakers have been promising comprehensive drug coverage for several years now, and many are nervous about delivering less.
The debate reflects the Republicans' struggle to balance two legislative goals: creating a new drug benefit and moving toward a new health-care marketplace in Medicare, with a more limited role for the government. Both goals cost money, and Congress has set aside a fixed amount, $400 billion over 10 years.
Many Republicans believe private plans will save money for Medicare. But many economists are skeptical.
Senator Santorum said he would go further than the Bush proposal. Congress, he said, should gradually end the traditional Medicare program as an option for new beneficiaries in the future, leaving them to choose from a variety of private plans. "I believe the standard benefit, the traditional Medicare program, has to be phased out," Mr. Santorum said.

HEADLINE: House G.O.P. Leaders Agree To Eliminate Dividend Tax 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE with DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20 

 BODY:
House Republican leaders agreed today to go along with the White House and the Senate and eliminate the tax on stock dividends, if only briefly, and Congressional Republican leaders promised to move swiftly to complete action on the bill this week.
 The agreement, which represents a concession by the House which had earlier voted to reduce but not eliminate the tax, comes as Majority Leader Tom DeLay acknowledged that the total tax cut would have to stay under the limit imposed by the Senate: $350 billion over 10 years. 
 Though Mr. DeLay's acknowledgement seemed to be a bow to the Senate, which sought a tax cut far less than many House Republicans would like, he said he hoped unusual methods could make the actual tax cut much higher, while nominally remaining less than the Senate limit. 
"Numbers don't mean anything," Mr. DeLay said. "In the tax code and dealing with a jobs-and-growth package, you can be very creative and still have a major impact."
President Bush had demanded at a meeting at the White House on Monday evening that Congressional Republicans stop bickering over the tax cut, so Congressional tax writers spent the day scrambling for a way to eliminate the tax on stock dividends, even if only temporarily. 
One way to do so, preferred by the Senate, would end the tax then restore it after a few years, making the overall tax cut appear much smaller over 10 years. Republicans say they would make certain the dividend tax never returns in future years.
Another method, favored by some House members, would eliminate the dividend tax for a short period, then reinstate it on dividends over a certain dollar amount every year. Another possibility is to exclude dividends from taxation only if the corporation paying them has fully paid the corporate income tax.
These and other possibilities were being discussed by tax writers from both chambers in a late-night session. Republican leaders said they hoped an agreement would be reached by Wednesday or Thursday, which would allow each chamber to vote on the final package by Friday.
That substantially accelerates a timetable that seemed stalled in bickering. Leaders said Mr. Bush had made it clear that he did not want philosophical differences among Republicans to delay the bill's passage, and that he wanted a bill headed to his desk before Congress leaves for a week-long Memorial Day recess this weekend.
"He reminded us how important this is to the economy and his domestic policy," Mr. DeLay said of Mr. Bush. "So what was agreed to last night was, we'll get this bill done by the end of the week."
But the agreement to move quickly does not provide a clear path to resolving the differences between the two houses. House Republicans, who would prefer an amount closer to $550 billion over 10 years, say that any new spending in the package should not be considered part of the tax cut amount.
In other words, the $20 billion in aid to state governments, which the Senate has insisted on, would not fall under the $350 billion limit, according to House calculations. The Senate has also demanded $27 billion in child tax credits that would be refunded to taxpayers.
But if the full tax plan, including those spending items, costs more than $350 billion, it would probably lose the votes of several senators whose votes are crucial to passage. 
At least one centrist Republican senator whose vote is crucial to securing a majority -- Senator George V. Voinovich of Ohio -- said today that the total cost of the package, including spending, would have to be less than $350 billion or he would oppose it. And a spokesman for a Democrat who supported the plan last week, Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana, said he would also be unable to support a plan that went substantially above the limit.
The Senate had also reduced the cost of its tax cut by increasing revenues elsewhere, including raising the taxes paid by Americans who work abroad.
But House members, including the chamber's chief tax writer, Representative Bill Thomas of California, the Ways and Means Committee chairman, said today that they could not accept a package that raised tax revenues in any way.
As a result, House and Senate negotiators faced a difficult task in satisfying widely varying demands within the Republican Party. House leaders, for example, still seek a cut in the capital gains tax. Asked how the bill could be tailored to fit within the $350 billion limit and still avoid the gimmickry he has criticized, Mr. Thomas, who is the lead House negotiator, shrugged his shoulders.
"Well, that's part of the job, isn't it?" he asked.
The meeting with Mr. Bush also had the effect of forcing House and Senate leaders to put aside their anger at each other at taking completely different paths toward the tax cut, unable to agree even on its size.
The negotiations were also complicated by the announcement today that Congressional staff members may have seriously underestimated the true cost of legislation eliminating the dividend tax that the Senate passed last week.
Democrats said they had discovered that staff members of the Joint Committee on Taxation, which provides the official cost estimates of tax bills, assumed that the Senate wanted to eliminate the tax on dividends paid by a single year's worth of corporate profits. In fact, the Senate bill would have allowed corporations to pay dividends tax-free using many past years of profits.
Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, said the difference could be in the tens of billions of dollars. "It was a significant error, and as a result, could complicate the conference," he said.
Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Finance Committee, acknowledged the error tonight and said it underestimated the true cost of the dividend tax cut by $70 billion. But he criticized the Democrats for not allowing his staff to correct the problem.

HEADLINE: A Weakened Treasury 

 BODY:
Somewhere, Alexander Hamilton must be having a fit. The once considerable prestige of his Treasury Department is much eroded these days. The Bush administration's pursuit of its reckless fiscal policy of tax cuts at any cost and its brazen willingness to embrace protectionist measures like farm subsidies have undermined America's ability to lead on global economic matters, one of a Treasury secretary's key missions. 
 It was often said in the first two years of the Bush presidency that there was a considerable stature gap between Mr. Bush's foreign policy and defense team, on the one hand, and his economic team. So halftime substitutions were made. Out went Paul O'Neill, the gaffe-prone Treasury secretary who lacked credibility because he made it known that he did not fully believe in the policies he was being asked to sell. In came John Snow, whose credibility is impaired by the fact that he may actually believe in those policies, which are now discredited by everyone from the chairman of the Federal Reserve to many on Wall Street. Even worse, if he does not believe in them -- Mr. Snow was once known as a deficit hawk -- he is still willing to act the part of committed salesman. 
 His credibility in question, Mr. Snow has had a difficult time in recent weeks explaining the administration's policy on the dollar, which has lost almost a third of its value against the euro in the past year. The greenback had been overvalued, and its slide is not all bad. It gives American exports a boost and helps counteract deflationary pressures. But the euro's rise may harm the continent's already struggling economies.
The Treasury is right not to intervene to prop up the dollar, but the secretary is antagonizing America's trading partners by erring in the other direction by suggesting -- without quite saying -- that the administration has abandoned its strong dollar policy and that the currency still has a way to fall. That sows dangerous confusion in currency markets. If foreign investors are sufficiently unnerved, they could cause a financial panic by taking their money and investing it elsewhere.
The extent of the dollar's decline to date certainly amounts to a vote of no confidence in America's future prospects -- it isn't as if Europe is attracting investment on its own merits. And an acceleration in our currency's decline would be a far greater threat than an overvalued dollar in light of our nation's reliance on huge net inflows of capital. This reliance will only grow with Mr. Bush's deficit-raising tax cuts. 
Cutting taxes in the face of rising deficits is the crucial factor behind the lack of confidence in the dollar, and indeed in the American economy. It is one thing for President Bush to travel around the country, repeating at pep rallies that unaffordable tax cuts will create jobs and prosperity. It is quite another for his Treasury secretary to make the same case with a straight face to his fellow economic ministers around the world. The real issue here is not a devalued dollar, but this administration's devalued credibility to lead on global economic issues.

HEADLINE: Will Congress Remember the Jobless? 

 BODY:
While the Republican-led Congress pours its energy into creating another windfall tax cut for the affluent, the toll of unemployed keeps growing, with temporary federal benefits about to expire for some of the most hard pressed. Unless Congress acts this week, the suffering will deepen for close to four million Americans. 
A fast extension of unemployment benefits is far more vital than the wrestling match over what mix of cuts in capital gains and dividend taxes will allow President Bush to proclaim another economic "growth" victory.
 The truly eye-popping growth of the past two years has been in the rising tally of lost private-sector jobs: 2.6 million and counting, a record for any modern presidency. The number of unemployed, 8.8 million, is the highest in a decade, while thenumber of jobs has slipped to a three-year low. The emergency help now expiring provides 13 weeks of extra aid to those who exhaust state benefits. Past recessions had more generous programs. The hard-core jobless are running through benefits well before job opportunities come along. 
 If "growth" be the mantra, then Congress will not find a stronger and more immediate stimulus for the economy than an extension of benefits to job-hungry Americans, eager to spend on basic needs. Each new dollar in the program quickly boosts the economy by $1.73, according to a study done by Economy.com, a research firm. In comparison, the study found the Bush cut in dividend taxes enriching the economy by only 9 cents per dollar. The better deal for Congress is obvious and urgent.

HEADLINE: From Work To Welfare Reversal Seen In City Layoffs 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
For seven years, Awilda Vazquez was treading water on welfare, struggling to raise her two daughters, but then she got her big chance, landing a job as a $30,000-a-year clerk in the New York Fire Department.
 But Ms. Vazquez, of Red Hook, Brooklyn, worries that she will soon land back on the welfare rolls because she was one of the 2,000 people who were laid off on Friday as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg sought to cut the city's $3.8 billion budget deficit. 
 Ms. Vazquez is one of the laid-off workers who did everything they were supposed to do to climb out of welfare, working so hard in the city's Work Experience Program that their bosses rewarded them with a full-time job. Once she made the grade, Ms. Vazquez, 41, never expected to be laid off. 
"I feel very angry about this," she said. "I've tried so hard to get a good job, and then to kick me out of a job like this after three years is very frustrating. I don't want to go back to the welfare system. I really don't."
Officials from Ms. Vazquez's union, District Council 37, have questioned how much Mr. Bloomberg will save by his wave of layoffs. Union officials acknowledge that the city will save money by no longer having to pay their salaries, but these officials assert that much of these savings will be erased because the city may soon start paying their welfare checks.
"You spend a few years on workfare, you get a decent job, you're doing good, and then this is a real slap," said Eddie Rodriguez, president of the clerical workers' local in District Council 37. 
He estimated that several hundred of those laid off last week used to be on welfare. "They're not going to save money by laying these people off," Mr. Rodriguez said. "You're going to put more people on welfare. Some of these people will become homeless, and then the city will have to pay for their families to go to a hotel. Do you know how much that costs?"
Jordan Barowitz, a City Hall spokesman, asserted that the municipal unions were to blame for the layoffs of Ms. Vazquez and many other workers. Noting that the order of the layoffs was dictated in part by civil service laws and union contracts, he said the mayor would not have laid off the 2,000 workers if the unions had agreed to $600 million in concessions, like agreeing to fewer vacation days.
"Layoffs are a last resort," Mr. Barowitz said. "But the city's municipal unions chose to lay off their members instead of producing cost savings and productivity that would have saved their jobs."
This finger-pointing between the union and City Hall does little good for Ms. Vazquez. She was so proud to have a job and to be off public assistance -- each month she had been receiving a $280 welfare grant, $300 for rent, and $225 for food stamps.
When the city's Work Experience Program, part of the welfare system, placed her in the Fire Department, she so impressed her managers there she was given a permanent job, receiving a promotion last year. Last Friday was her final day answering phones for a Fire Department district office in Downtown Brooklyn and typing fire inspection information into the computer system. 
Now she worries about how she will afford clothes, food and movies for her daughters, 17-year-old Diashira and 10-year-old Amarilys.
"Right now I'm going to go on unemployment," she said. "That will be my first option. I don't want to go back on welfare. I don't like how they stereotype people on welfare. I want to work. You can ask my boss."
Her supervisor, Masood Ahmed, said, "She was an excellent worker. We're just very sorry she's going. She was very excited that she was making it on her own. She doesn't want to depend on public assistance."
Marvin Washington of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is in the same predicament, having been in Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's Work Experience Program for three years. During that time, he received a welfare check of $68 every two weeks and was living with his sister, working as a clerk at the Department of Sanitation in Brooklyn, with hope of being rewarded with a permanent job.
Mr. Washington, a 45-year-old Army veteran who hurt his hip badly in a truck accident while serving in Germany, praised workfare, saying it helped push him back into the job market. But he is distraught about being laid off.
"I've never experienced anything like this," he said. "It's really rough. I guess I'll go on unemployment."
But he worries that once his jobless benefits run out, he, too, may fall back into the welfare rolls. He once worked as a fraud investigator for Chase Manhattan but was laid off when it merged with another bank.
For Annette Whitley, who is eight months pregnant, the big worry about being laid off last Friday from her data entry job at the Fire Department in Brooklyn is that she will lose her health insurance. 
"Of course, it's going to be hard," said Ms. Whitley, who moved from welfare to her $31,000-a-year job. 
Ms. Whitley, who has three children, was so depressed about being laid off after five years on the job and so bothered by spring allergies that she did not want to talk at length about her problem. 
"I don't know what I'm going to do now," she said. "I'm going to have to sort it out."
Union officials are hoping to persuade Mr. Bloomberg to rehire many of those laid off last week. 
"I don't think they should crush these people's dreams and hopes," said Mark Rosenthal, treasurer of District Council 37. "I know we have a budget crisis, but these are the city's poorest workers. Isn't it more cost-effective to have these workers make $9, $10 an an hour on a city job than to throw them back on welfare?"
Frank Sobrino, spokesman for the city's Human Resources Administration, said the layoffs of some former workfare workers who had moved into regular city jobs did not mean that workfare was a failure. 
"We were very successful last year in placing 130,000 public assistance recipients in positions," he said. "We're confident in our ability to continue to help place people in jobs."

 BODY:
 Gov. George E. Pataki is helping to organize a $2,000-a-person fund-raising reception on June 23 to aid President Bush's re-election effort. 
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and his predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, will also be present at the event, at the New York Sheraton. Those pledging to raise $20,000 or more will get their photographs taken with the president. Mr. Pataki said he was proud to be a part of Mr. Bush's re-election campaign. Herman Farrell, the state Democratic chairman, criticized the governor for helping a president whose economic policies "have contributed to New York State and City's massive fiscal crisis."

HEADLINE: CLOSE TO HOME; 
Out of the Showroom, Into the Wood Shop

BYLINE:  By MEG HENSON 

 BODY:
WHEN I realized what a small table designed and built for the entry of my apartment in Harlem would cost, I was more willing than able to spend thousands of dollars. I considered having it custom-built rather badly by a discount factory furniture maker, but I had an epiphany: why not build it rather badly myself and cut out the middleman?
 I've always felt more profoundly inadequate at the lumberyard than anywhere else. But the cabal of evil Gepettos I imagined conspiring against me with machines and noise is now exorcised. Watching Amy Wynn Pastor, a resident carpenter on "Trading Spaces," helped. I've also seen, on another show, tables and chairs Martina Navratilova made in her woodworking studio. 
 I know when a role model is being imprinted, and these women fed me infinite possibility. Was anything sexier than whipping up furniture on the fly? Clearly, working wood was utterly doable, with a little help. The next step was finding the equivalent of a Cliff Notes carpentry class.
There are several courses in New York for those who don't know a rip from a crosscut, but they require weeks and months, which is great for someone more serious than I am. I wanted a slam-bam course, the woodworking equivalent of a one-night stand. I was unashamed; taking what I wanted and getting out felt right.
I researched woodworking classes online and found Kim Carleton Graves, who designs and builds custom furniture at his loft shop in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. He encourages students to propose a project, limiting enrollment to two or three people. It seemed perfect. Then when we spoke he broke the bad news gently: I couldn't do the table I had envisioned as a first project. Who would have believed that a three-tiered, three-legged table of brushed aluminum and wood was too advanced for someone of my skill level? 
If I harbored any delusions, he speculated, accurately, three times during our conversation that I was a "rank amateur." Still, I wasn't insulted; he was just a little blunt. I realized that while he was unwilling to accept me on my terms, he had anticipated them. For a table and woodworking wisdom, $450 plus materials seemed quite reasonable. (Prices for each project are based on the time required, the student's skill and the size of the finished piece.) 
I couldn't wait to get started. We corresponded by e-mail and talked on the phone. He picked up my cherry wood and drew a plan for a small square Shaker table with tapered legs, all before our first meeting. The night before the first session, I recalled how my brothers brought home wooden boxes and birdhouses they made in industrial arts classes in seventh and eighth grades. They were exquisite. The blue and green polka-dotted skirt I made in home economics was not. How I felt about the disparity is no longer important, but it was satisfying to know that my project would be bigger than theirs, and sweeter, these decades later.
Carleton Woodworking is housed in an industrial loft with other furniture makers and designers. Well-lighted and clean, it seems to have every imaginable machine. Mr. Graves instructs in a pleasant hands-on manner. His attention to safety (including where to stand to observe his demonstrations) put me at ease right away. He described machines' functions, hardware and proper hand placement while working the wood. He spoke in a physics patois of vectors, torque, variables and resistance: we used a "triangle marking system" and "critical dimensions," and did everything we could to avoid "blowback." It all made perfect clever sense.
After I had digested the process, it seemed quite similar to dressmaking, particularly the dreaded do-over factor. Twenty minutes into the lesson, I confidently milled the cherry wood on a sliding compound miter saw. I measured, jointed, ripped, crosscut, glued, planed and clamped. I went home in the evening, filthy and exhausted. I did not dream.
The next morning, Mr. Graves set me to work sanding my pieces with progressively finer papers. As the sanding brought out the grain and the slight blush of the cherry, the wood became transcendently beautiful. The wood was becoming vibrant, as if I were rubbing life into it.
After that sanding, assembling and finishing, my well-made table only becomes more sublime with age. I love it, and stare at it constantly. I rub it with a tung oil mixture and allow no one to debauch it by using it. Its use is so clearly its beauty. I tote it around to keep it in sight. 
I no longer wonder why custom furniture is so expensive, because I now know it is worth the price. Making it yourself, however, might make it priceless. Perhaps I'll make another piece down the road, but it will never compare with my first.

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW; 
After the Holocaust, Devouring Life in Gulps

BYLINE:  By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
The stage adaptation of Isaac Bashevis Singer's novel "Meshugah" has some good things going for it. First, Emily Mann's script does a nice job of trimming Singer's urban picaresque tale almost to the bare bones without scarring the central narrative. And second, this production, which is directed by Loretta Greco and includes a trio of astute performances, deftly reproduces the wryly astonished tone of the novel. The problem with the show, on the tiny stage at the Kirk Theater through May 31, is that it is far more literary than theatrical. 
 Meshugah is Yiddish for crazy or loony, and in the context of this play it applies to the world that was wrought by the Holocaust. Set in 1952 in New York, the book was written serially in the early 1980's. It is narrated by Aaron Greidinger, a middle-aged bachelor who is, as Singer was, a prolific writer of fiction and nonfiction that appears in The Jewish Daily Forward and that has made him something of a celebrity among the Yiddish-speaking immigrants in New York after World War II. 
 The plot is rather wacky and racy; it involves Aaron, who was once a rake but has grown tired and self-critical; a charismatic older man named Max Aberdam, who Aaron had thought had died in the war; and Max's mistress, Miriam Zalkind, a breathlessly earthy young woman whose stealth and bravado helped her survive the German occupation of Warsaw and who takes on Aaron as her lover as well.
In the novel many other characters -- including Max's wife and Miriam's husband -- help establish a time-and-place-specific community of Eastern European Jews new to the city. Singer creates a powerful sense of their collective willingness to scarf down life experiences in greedy gulps, as if to obliterate their horrific memories of ghettos and Nazi camps. 
This is a social milieu in which the convention-flouting menage a trois at the novel's center is entirely understood and only slightly eyebrow-raising. And it provides the backdrop for the tortuous path followed especially by the relationship between Miriam and Aaron, which demands astonishing feats of forgiveness and sacrifice. 
The stage version of "Meshugah" lacks this social texture. Partly this is because Ms. Mann's economical storytelling has dispensed with community. Partly it is because, aside from some thoughtful period costumes by Valerie Marcus, the design for the show is minimal, focusing on interiors and not at all evocative of New York. And partly it is because, with the exception of one love scene in which Aaron and Miriam strain and writhe on the stage floor, Ms. Greco's ideas for directing individual scenes yield mostly static results. Much of the play is conducted like a creatively lighted staged reading.
That said, Ned Eisenberg as the rueful and writerly Aaron, Elizabeth Marvel as the voracious, divalike Miriam and the veteran Ben Hammer as the roguish yet somehow avuncular Max are all vivid enough to make you wish they were performing in a more complete theatrical context. All three handle their line readings beautifully, each managing a Polish-inflected English that properly flavors the dialogue without overburdening it.

HEADLINE: Americans Ever More Scarce in Tourist-Popular Spain 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: MADRID, May 20 

 BODY:
For a tourism powerhouse like Spain, the weak dollar is just one more in a cloud of worries overshadowing the hotels and restaurants, boutiques and department stores and other businesses that rely on visitors' spending.
 Not that Spain relies very heavily on dollars. Last year, more than 52 million foreigners traveled to Spain, making it the world's No. 2 destination after France, but fewer than one million of them were Americans. Most of Spain's visitors are Europeans, seeking the sun from, say, cloud-locked Germany, chilly Scandinavia or beachless Austria. And mostly, they spend newly muscular euros. 
 Though the erosion of the dollar's purchasing power here is a worry, European tourism industry experts say its effects are dwarfed by other factors.
For example, the number of Americans traveling to Spain last year fell by almost 20 percent from the year before, and more disconcerting, the figures for the first four months of 2003 were off another 19.5 percent, according to German Porras, director of the Institute for Tourism Studies, a government agency in Madrid. But the weak dollar, he said, had almost nothing to do with it.
Since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Americans have been hesitant to fly abroad, Mr. Porras said, and the trans-Atlantic airlines have responded to the fall in bookings by cutting capacity, not by cutting prices. "If you had good offers, people might overcome the fear," Mr. Porras said. 
Spain loves American tourists, Mr. Porras said. For one thing, many of them come in the off season, while Europeans concentrate their visits in the sunny summer.
Where the Europeans tend to stick to the beach resorts, American visitors are more likely to head for the cultural sights, which are mainly inland. While Spain has 32 percent of the Europe's sun-and-surf travel market by value, it gets only 8 percent of the cultural tourism, Mr. Porras said.
Some experts argue that Americans will find less sticker shock in Europe than the shift in the exchange rate might suggest. The introduction of the euro in 12 countries, including Spain, has tended to hold down prices in resort areas because the single currency has made it easier for European visitors within the euro zone to compare them at a glance with prices at home.
Moreover, the currencies of noneuro countries like Turkey and Bulgaria that compete for tourists have weakened lately, adding to the downward price pressure within the euro zone. "There is a strong devaluation element," that benefits Americans and their anemic currency, said Jose-Luis Zoreda, who publishes a quarterly analysis of the tourism industry here.
Still, preliminary figures from the other big tourist destinations in Europe, including France and Italy, suggest that American tourists are growing more scarce everywhere. But Deborah Luhrman, a travel industry consultant in Madrid, said that a pernicious trio of factors was keeping them home: the general economic slump, fear of terrorism and fear of SARS. "It's definitely not just a weaker dollar," she said.
Over all, the flow of visitors to Spain has held up compared with last year. Partly, that may be because Europeans who in other years may have traveled farther afield -- say to Africa or the Middle East -- are staying closer to home now.
So far this year, the Prado Museum, one of Madrid's biggest tourist magnets, has had more visitors than in the comparable period in 2002, according to Maria de la Pena, a spokeswoman for the museum, though she did not supply figures. Ms. de la Pena attributed much of the growth to changes at the Prado under a new director, who has expanded Sunday hours, overhauled the gift shops and organized striking new shows like one featuring the Venetian master painter Titian.
But extra European visitors do not quite compensate for absent Americans, because the Americans spend much more. 
"They use five-star hotels, they go to the best restaurants," Mr. Zoreda said. In fact, he said, only Japanese and Mexicans -- those Mexicans who are wealthy enough to visit Spain -- are as open-handed as American visitors to Spain, judging from the records of value-added tax reimbursements sent to each country.
Jacobo Fernandez of the department store chain El Corte Ingles said, "The Americans are the biggest spenders in numbers, but also the English." Their favored purchases, he said, are items of apparel, like shoes and clothing from young Spanish designers.
Without supplying figures, Mr. Fernandez said that 2002 brought a record number of foreign shoppers to the chain's stores. Thus far this year, they have continued to increase, he said.
Gema Sese, spokeswoman for the Thyssen Bornemisza Museum along the broad Paseo del Prado, said surveys done when the museum opened in the 1990's revealed that roughly 10 percent of its visitors were Americans. Their share of spending at the museum gift shop was far higher. "They like our bookshop," she said.

HEADLINE: For Home Theaters, Chairs Are a Blockbuster 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
THE $23-billion-a-year furniture industry is in a state of high excitement over an item of furniture that, in the average living room, looks like a huge Danish. Your local bakery would call it a bear claw. The furniture industry calls it home theater seating.
 With the ascent of DVD players, flat-screen and high-definition television and surround-sound home "theaters in a box" as standard equipment in American households, the furnishings of media rooms and movie theaters are descending into the mass-marketplace. 
 The new home theater seating is typically a free-standing unit of three or four reclinerlike modules attached at the hip by cup holders and eating trays, features more typically found in multiplexes or screening rooms. It is now generally available and affordable -- a question of hundreds or thousands of dollars and not tens of thousands. Since its introduction by Berkline, a furniture company in Morristown, Tenn., in 1999, home theater seating has proved popular enough to encourage most other major players in the business of "motion" furniture (a k a recliners) to jump into the fray. 
In July, La-Z-Boy, the big kahuna of motion furniture, will unveil its version, called the Matinee collection, in stores. Matinee, like its competition, will take a family room or a finished basement and turn it into something that looks and acts like a cross between Air Force One and David Geffen's pool house. A three-seat piece of home theater seating can easily be two-thirds longer than a full-size couch, and it's built like a balloon in Macy's Thanksgiving parade.
The furniture industry, like many of its domestic brethren, has been having a tough economic time lately. A more endemic problem is the fact that there is never much basic news in the business, aside from self-created excitements like issues of style. Whether Provencal or Shaker in inspiration, or branded by Martha Stewart or Humphrey Bogart, it is ever a chair or a table, a sofa or a chest of drawers. Distinct and novel categories, or true introductions, are rare.
But home theater seating is one of them, upholstery pundits say, though they add that it is too early to know if it is a first-run novelty that the houselights will finally come up on. Because many collections are arriving only now in stores, the category's overall performance has no track record yet.
"The furniture business is not exactly stellar right now, but the home theater seating is a star," said Eric Easter, president of Kittles Furniture, which operates 17 stores in Indiana and Ohio. "It's come out of nowhere, worked into the middle market, and it's growing."
Larry Thomas, who as the business editor of Furniture Today, a trade weekly, has followed the phenomenon closely, said: "It seems to be a real hot category right now, in the last 12 months. The traditional family room is becoming a media room, driven by the interest in DVD's."
The Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association estimates that 57 percent of American households now own DVD players, based on a March survey. The furniture industry, riding the coattails of the electronics market, has started exhibiting at big trade fairs like the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.
"Instead of a sofa sleeper, people are putting in more comfortable theater-type seating, because you're going to be sitting longer," Mr. Thomas said. "Even during this slump, motion furniture has done well."
If contemporary furniture is often a triumph of style over substance, home theater seating is a solid triumph of substance over style.
"It's not meant to be pretty," said Cabot Longnecker, vice president for merchandising at Berkline, whose 12 home theater collections exceeded $30 million in sales last year, 35 percent more than the year before. "It's meant to be comfortable and fun." Mr. Longnecker recalled that in 1999, when the first collection was shown, "everybody thought we were crazy."
MR. THOMAS said that the other driving force behind the Odeonesque seating was the much-reported trend toward spending more time at home, but with an emerging sociological twist.
"People are duplicating the things they like about going out, so they don't have to go out," he said. "Mom and Dad can go to the movies at home, when the kids go to sleep, without hiring a sitter. And taking the whole family out, even to the movies, is not now something you can afford to do twice a week."
Paula Hoyas, the product manager for motion furniture at La-Z-Boy in Monroe, Mich., concurred, explaining that changing expectations about the quality of experiences at home were part of the company's decision to enter the field.
"From cappuccino machines to built-in fryers for your stove and great stainless steel grills -- all that stuff out there -- the higher-end professional home appliances give you that now," Ms. Hoyas said of the rise of restaurant-level kitchen equipment. "People are thinking, 'If I'm going to spend more time at home, I'm going to make the experience better.' "
The other hot category in furniture sales, not surprisingly, is entertainment centers -- cabinets and pedestals struggling mightily with the time-honored problem of how to hide or transform the television, now a beast of mythic proportions. These units look less like furniture than they do billboard scaffolding or cherry-wood single-car garages.
Because home theater seating is sold by the seat, it can be configured by the customer into short or long rows, or into multiple rows, that curve in an arena before the television, enhancing the sensation of its being a theater.
"We have six friends who come over to watch movies," said Dr. Dianne Barnhart of Johnstown, Ohio, who with her husband, Matthew, owns eight seats in two rows of four. The back row sits on a raised deck, for cinemalike elevation, which the Barnharts, both veterinarians, built themselves.
"We've just moved into the house," Dianne Barnhart said. "We have no furniture yet except the media room. You can see where my husband's priorities are at."
In fact, though women are the proverbial decision makers in furniture purchases, men are the power behind the home theater throne.
"He's driving the electronics purchase," said Ms. Hoyas at La-Z-Boy. "He wants the 'home theater looking style' furniture. To her, with more choices, this is now acceptable. She'll put this in her house."
Mr. Longnecker at Berkline understands the boys-toys value of bells and whistles. Beyond its signature cup holders or trays, home theater seating stands to incorporate as many added features as a DVD itself.
Berkline already offers Tempur-Pedic cushioning that conforms sensitively to the body, as hospital mattresses do -- which might be more of an alarm than a bell and a whistle if you think about it too hard in relationship to the amount and quality of time you spend watching television.
"IMAX last year started spec-ing theaters with Tempur-Pedic," Mr. Longnecker said, explaining where he got the idea.
His next frontier, he said, will be "tactile." Given his position as a pioneer in the home theater seating category, it could throw a gauntlet down for the industry.
"You see the movie, you hear the movie," Mr. Longnecker said. "How do you feel the movie?"
If all goes well, as they say in Hollywood, you'll be on the edge of your seat.

HEADLINE: The Orphans of Invention 

BYLINE:  By Ellen Ullman; Ellen Ullman, a former software engineer, is author, most recently, of "The Bug," a novel.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Enormous sums of money were lost in the great Internet bust, and analysts are still wringing their hands over the industry's fall from grace. Has technology, one economist recently wondered, become "just another crummy factor of production"?
 But something more was lost in the bust. It has nothing to do with money, at least not directly. It has to do with people and history, with what might be called industrial memory. 
 The depth of this history was made clear on Dec. 9, 1998, when 1,500 people gathered in an auditorium at Stanford University to honor Douglas C. Engelbart, inventor of the computer mouse. By then he was 73 years old, and his fortunes in the industry had been uneven. In the 30 years since he had given his first public demonstration of the mouse, the lab he had worked in lost its government financing, and subsequent corporate life had not been kind to him. But that day, something remarkable happened: after Mr. Engelbart spoke, the audience rose to applaud him. The ovation went on and on, in waves, as Mr. Engelbart fought back tears.
What keeps the moment in my mind is not simply the joy of seeing this great inventor being honored, but the crowd that celebrated him. As Mr. Engelbart talked, all around me I heard exclamations of surprise from those in the audience, most of whom were less than half his age: "You mean 'booting' a computer comes from the word 'bootstrap'? Wow!"
Back then, Silicon Valley companies were hiring people in great numbers, and a tide of youthful energy entered the field. And for the few years of the boom, the industry was large enough to employ several generations of programmers, from 22-year-old Web-page coders to 50-year-old experts in C++. There was, in that moment, a passing on of generational memory. The audience became aware that computers, though innovative, were not exactly new.
With the bust came the scattering of those generations. The 25-year-olds were fired first, then came the ones in their 30's; soon came the layoffs of even more senior people. No one was immune. In 2001 and 2002, America lost 560,000 technology jobs. In Silicon Valley alone, 27,000 software positions disappeared between the spring of 2001 and the spring of 2002.
But more than jobs have been lost. To listen to Mr. Engelbart that day almost five years ago was to realize that the computer industry, when it started, was not simply about becoming a chief executive or retiring on stock options at 35. It was to remember that real innovation -- the stuff that made computers so much more than "crummy factors of production" -- comes from mysterious places, wild people, dreamers and tinkerers, and to remember all the skepticism they had to endure.

HEADLINE: DESIGN NOTEBOOK; 
The Stylish Seek Stars, but TV Seating Draws Crowds

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
RECENTLY released to video, "Equilibrium," a movie starring Christian Bale, is a sci-fi tale about the future. People's feelings have been declared dangerous and are being suppressed by the authorities.
 As always, the future is loaded with great-looking design. And as always, most famously in Orwell's "1984," the modern hero stumbles upon the lair of someone living in the past, amid the unlawful artifacts of emotion and memory. There Mr. Bale, working for the authorities and looking like a piece of high design himself, has a violent showdown with his feelings -- provoked by a lamp with a fringed shade. 
 It was hard, while walking down the aisles of the International Contemporary Furniture Fair at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center last weekend, not to be reminded of the sci-fi stance that contemporary design takes against the past. And it was hard to imagine what role it will play in the future. Most people's idea of modern furniture design is more than 50 years old -- the work of Ray and Charles Eames or the great 20th-century architects like Aalto, still on display and pulling them in, like a reunion tour, at the show. 
But design, no matter how good, will never, by itself, be able to invest an object with meaning. It will always be an artificial heart. And though new items on display at the 2003 fair, like Christopher Deam's handsome Glide chair for Lolah (www.lolah.com), which has the action of an old porch swing, cleverly go through the motions, will anyone ever feel nostalgic about them? If the house caught fire, would you grab Glide, or your childhood blanket?
There's a lot fogging design's pristine mirror right now -- an iffy economy, unease about security. In the world of design, where looks can be everything, vanity seems uncomfortably self-conscious this year. Though there were more exhibitors than last year, including an increase in newcomers, the fair was perceived by participants as a modest statement, with an apprehensive emphasis on biz, not buzz.
Jerry Epperson, an industry analyst with Mann, Armistead & Epperson in Richmond, Va., said that the businesses at the fair, generally smaller manufacturers, represented 10 percent of the furniture industry in the United States. The wider "contemporary" market is defined by anything that is not historically derivative (including recliners and home theater seating) and is strong in sales -- roughly 50 percent of the upholstered furniture sold.
But Mr. Epperson added that "nostalgia is the hottest category in the business right now." He characterized it as "your grandmother's furniture."
On a sleek island of black at the convention center, Bernhardt Design (www .bernhardtdesign.com) showed a vampirish collection of steel and white-leather furniture designed by Fabien Baron, the graphic designer best known for his makeover in 1992 of Harper's Bazaar magazine. 
The minimal-as-a-knife-edge design and dressed-to-kill attitude in the Bernhardt group were reminiscent of another Christian Bale movie, "American Psycho," based on Bret Easton Ellis's novel of 1991. Patrick Bateman, the protagonist, also believed in life as a perfect surface.
But many exhibitors were trying to make concessions to the comfort of the consumer -- if not physically, then emotionally or financially. That, and not form, function or finish, seemed to be what was newest and most hopeful. And meaning, a favorite conceit for designers, especially young ones, took a secondary role to the kind of friendly, easier allusions that make one feel lucky to have a home to furnish.
Pulse Requisite, an Oakland, Calif., outfit (www.pulserequisite.com), presented Juice, a wooden breakfast table with a scalloped-edge top that makes it look as if it has a cloth on it. The "cloth" edge has a daisy-flower cutout in it too. The table, $1,350, looks like the product of a happy childhood, not a design degree or a jigsaw.
Denyse Schmidt (www.dsquilts.com), a well-known contemporary quilt maker who has exhibited hand-sewn quilts for eight years, showed Denyse Schmidt Works, machine-sewn quilts that cut the price to $800 -- roughly a quarter of the cost of her hand-sewn quilts. She is also in licensing negotiations with Terence Conran Shops and Design Within Reach, which is developing a line of bedding.
Snowlab (www.snowlabdesign.com), a Canadian company that exhibited for the first time last year, returned with a much cheaper version of its well-received, flat-panel wall lighting and introduced blown-glass hanging lamps that were antithetical to its futuristic first collection. Snowlab did $27,000 worth of business at last year's fair, enough to bring them back. But the writing was on the wall as to what would sell -- and it wasn't phosphorous ideas alone.
Even at the "off-site" or "alternative" events staged in galleries and showrooms throughout New York City during the fair, which are typically more radical in concept, there were indications that design's unbroachable barriers -- the "you're either into it or out of it" thinking -- were being cracked by anxiety.
At Core77's "Canary in a Coalmine" presentation at Gallery 91, Todd Falkowsky, a Toronto-based designer (www.coroflot.com /tfalkowsky), showed his Toy chair, upholstered with stuffed animals. As comfort, it's proactive -- a chair that wants to give you a hug.
And at the convention center, student work, represented in booths set up by schools like Pratt Institute with large design programs, and a preview of problems to be solved by the next class of professional designers, was an uncharacteristically pacific mixture of acknowledging the present and appeasing the past.
Day Off by Kanjana Chaiwatanachai (at Pukan_07@hotmail.com) is a futonlike floor cushion with flexible extensions that relieve the stresses of a workweek by accommodating anything you might care to do on your day off -- read, eat, watch television. Past Lite by Geoffrey Young is a translucent resin table illuminated by neon (gyoungdesign@aol.com). An ornamental cast in the resin appears when the mantel-like table is lighted -- classical inspiration as a kind of night vision, like dreams.
The fair's 2003 Editors Awards were telling too. Blu Dot, the seven-year-old Minnesota company (www.bludot.com) that staked its success on practicalities like utility, attractive pricing and dependable shipping dates, not daring design, took the prize in the furniture category. Its new shelving, which sells for $279 for a 36-inch-wide unit, is raw particle board -- design has literally dropped its veneer. Anne Kyyro Quinn (www.annekyyroquinn.com), based in London, was named best new designer. Ms. Quinn creates pillows and throws.
"I'm much more cautious about my buying this year," said Douglas Burton, an owner of Apartment Zero, a design store in Washington, who was walking the fair.
As an independent retailer, Mr. Burton has recently felt the pressure of staying in business. Several exhibitors, including Blu Dot, reported losing accounts from design stores, once a measure of metropolitan sophistication and a staple of cities big and small, which are closing -- in part because of competition from design "chains" like Design Within Reach, a catalog and Internet company now also opening showrooms.
"I'm not writing as many orders," Mr. Burton said. "I'm getting all the materials, going back to the store and talking with my employees about what customers really want. There might be an amazing piece, but it might be a $6,000 chair. People aren't spending money on those pieces now. We need that great chair that's $500." Mr. Burton concluded, "They're coming to us for great design, but they're coming to us for pricing now, too."
Not inappropriately, the moment seems grounded in serviceable home furnishings. At the fair, there were pieces to admire with ambitions no greater than to be chests of drawers, like e15's mahogany model (www.e15.com), or stylish side chairs, like Hussl's ST6 (www.hussl.at), which is available in a variety of colored lacquers. Pure Design (www.puredesignonline.com) showed a bar stool ($305) that was as long as a love seat, for those who don't like to drink alone.
Cocktails were on people's minds, as were children, some indication that many younger designers at the fair, like Mr. Deam, are now older and beginning to act, if not like their parents, well then, like parents. Mr. Deam, 41, had twins this year. There was contemporary children's furniture on view at Truck (www.the-truck.com). Jennifer Carpenter, one of the company's three partners and its manager, also had a child this year. David Netto (www .nettocollection.com), a fashionable interior designer in New York, showed baby furniture, including a crib.
Down the aisle from Mr. Netto's nappy changing table, Bombay Sapphire was pouring martinis -- the first time that the fair has served cocktails. And at noon on Saturday, the impromptu lounge was crowded.
Generation X, it appeared, had discovered the business lunch.

Price of Crude Oil Jumps 2.2% As Inventories Show a Decline

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Crude oil prices rose 2.2 percent yesterday after an Energy Department report showed that inventories last week were lower than a year ago.
 Supplies rose 600,000 barrels, to 285.1 million barrels, in the week ended May 16. The increase left stockpiles 11 percent smaller than a year earlier, wider than the 10 percent gap reported last week. Supplies in the year-earlier week rose 4.6 million barrels. Inventories rose 2.5 million in the West Coast states Gasoline supplies unexpectedly fell last week. 
 "Outside of the West Coast, supplies were down," said Jan Stuart, head of research for global energy futures at ABN Amro in New York. "In coming weeks we could see further tightening of supplies."
Crude oil for July delivery was up 62 cents, at $29.03 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Oil prices, which have rallied 12 percent this month, were down 27 percent from a 12-year high of $39.99 on Feb. 27.
In London, the July Brent crude oil futures contract rose 56 cents, or 2.2 percent, to close at $26.21 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange. The American Petroleum Institute said in a separate report that oil inventories fell 4.5 million barrels.
"The A.P.I. numbers were stronger, which helped give the rally strength," Mr. Stuart said. 
Excluding the West Coast, oil supplies fell 1.8 million barrels, according to the Energy Department.
Gasoline supplies fell 200,000 barrels last week, to 208.4 million barrels, according to the government report. Reserves were 3.6 percent below year-earlier levels.
Aaron Kildow, a broker at Prudential Securities in New York, said: "Wholesalers and retailers were probably stocking up ahead of the Memorial Day weekend. A lot of gasoline probably moved into secondary storage last week."
Gasoline for June delivery rose 1.81 cents, or 2.1 percent, at 86.83 cents a gallon in New York. Prices were down 25 percent from a 21-month high reached on March 10.

HEADLINE: Rise of H.I.V. In Russia Is Quickening, Official Says 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 21 

 BODY:
Russia's top government AIDS expert offered a harrowing assessment of the disease's spread today, saying that at least a half-million Russians now carry the H.I.V. virus and that the true number could range as high as 1.5 million, or more than 1 percent of the overall population, which is about 147 million. 
 More ominous still, he said, foreign experts now say the total number of people infected could surpass seven million -- 1 in every 25 Russians -- in as few as five years. 
 The report, by Vadim V. Pokrovsky of the Russian Center for AIDS Prevention and Treatment, buttressed earlier warnings by global AIDS experts that the number of H.I.V. infections in Russia is in danger of rising out of control, with severe consequences for the country's demographics and labor force. 
Already, he said, the official totals of H.I.V. infections in some major Russian cities surpass 1 percent of the population, with unreported cases boosting the figures far higher. 
"Five to seven years from now, we will have the number of people dying of AIDS equal to that dying in different transport accidents," Mr. Pokrovsky said at a news conference here. "This is to say that it will become an ordinary phenomenon." Mr. Pokrovsky added: "The problems related to H.I.V. infection are like a snowball, and the longer we look at how it rolls down the slope, the larger it will be when it stops if we do not come out altogether to stop this avalanche." 
Russia first began recording H.I.V. infections only in the mid-1990's, some 15 years after the epidemic surfaced in the United States. Yet the high estimate of H.I.V. infections among Russians here -- 1.5 million -- already is nearly twice the 850,000 Americans believed by the Centers for Disease Control to carry the H.I.V. virus. The United States' population is almost twice that of Russia. 
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell raised public concerns about the spread of AIDS here during a visit to Moscow on May 15, and United Nations experts have repeatedly warned that Russia faces a potential catastrophe if H.I.V. begins to spread beyond the group that is most often infected, intravenous drug users, to the general population. 
The nation's health ministry said last November that reports of new infections had fallen by nearly half during 2002, thanks largely to a drop in heroin supplies caused by the war in Afghanistan. 
But Mr. Pokrovsky delivered an opposite message today. While reports of new infections among drug users have begun to tail off, he said, that is only because the disease has begun to saturate the population of addicts who share needles. 
"But the rate of sexual transmission of H.I.V. is growing," he said. "While in 2001 we knew exactly that 4 percent got the infection through sexual intercourse, in 2002 almost 12 percent got infected sexually." 
One result is that a third of new H.I.V. cases were recorded last year among women, up from a quarter in 2001. Another is that the number of babies born to H.I.V.-positive women at least doubled between 2001 and 2002. 
An unchecked spread of the AIDS virus poses unusually severe threats to Russia because of the country's skewed demographics. The country's population is inexorably falling -- experts say it could fall to 80 to 120 million by 2050 -- and Russia is expected to face a labor shortage in future decades in part due to already-high mortality rates among working-age men. 
Because H.I.V. infections are predominantly striking young Russian men -- most cases are recorded among males between ages 15 and 30 -- the drop in the work force should accelerate as these cases mature into AIDS and death rates start to rise in the next 10 years. 
In some major provinces, including Samara in southwestern Russia and Irkutsk in Siberia, up to 8 percent of people aged 15 to 25 already carry the H.I.V. virus, Mr. Pokrovsky said today. That could further crimp Russia's birthrate, which already has fallen to historic lows, as people in those age groups develop AIDS. 
The Russian government has allotted roughly $38 million in 2003 to combat H.I.V. and AIDS, and the World Bank has agreed to lend the government an additional $150 million for anti-AIDS programs.

HEADLINE: Portland Voters Approve Oregon's Only County Income Tax, Aiding Schools 

BYLINE:  By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore., May 21 

 BODY:
Turning back an anti-tax tide that has swept Oregon in recent years, Portland-area voters approved a ballot measure that will levy the state's only county income tax, channeling new financing to schools, law enforcement and other agencies.
 The tax measure won by a margin of 58 percent in Multnomah County, which includes Portland. In January a much smaller state tax increase was defeated in a statewide referendum. 
 The new, temporary, county income tax will raise at least $128 million annually for three years, government projections show. About $89 million in revenues are expected for schools in Portland and seven smaller school districts, while the rest would go to a variety of programs. 
The vote will change the political dynamic in Oregon, said Julia Brim Edwards, a Republican political consultant and member of the Portland Board of Education who helped organize the campaign for new school financing. 
Speaking in an interview at a celebration after the voting results were announced late Tuesday, she said, "Now cuts in other school districts across the state will be worse than Portland's, and state legislators will be under pressure to renew their support for public schools."
Strengthening the sense here that a tide may have turned, voters in Beaverton, a western Portland suburb that is outside Multnomah County, approved a parallel measure to impose a three-year property tax increase that will raise some $17.9 million for schools. 
At the same time, however, voters elsewhere in Oregon expressed a mixture of opinions about taxes in other ballot initiatives. Proposed new tax levies were defeated in six counties on Tuesday, and approved in three others. 
Even in Portland, where support for public schools has historically run deep, voter support for public schools was tempered by a growing insistence that money spent on schools is well-managed, said Patricia McCaig, who did opinion surveys for a consortium of politicians, unions and public school supporters that backed the Multnomah County income tax.
"Overwhelmingly, people in Portland value education and understand the role it plays in making their communities livable," Ms. McCaig said. "But people are questioning whether schools are handling their money properly. So this was not a slam dunk."
Portland voters approved the income tax initiative by almost exactly the same approval margin by which they supported the Jan. 28 statewide income tax proposal, which was defeated because rural voters opposed it by strong margins, Ms. McCaig said.
On the other hand, Beaverton voters on Tuesday seemed to change course on public school financing. A majority of voters in that suburban district, which includes employees of many high-tech firms like Intel, cast ballots against the Jan. 28 income tax proposal, but on Tuesday approved thelocal property tax increase by the lopsided margin of 60 percent.
"We just had a huge groundswell of community support," said Carol Robinson, whose children attend Beaverton schools and who was a paid organizer for the Coalition for School Funding Now, a statewide group.
Although the Oregon electorate had on previous tax initiatives in recent years split along urban-rural lines, that did not occur so neatly in Tuesday's voting, said Shannon Priem, a spokeswoman for the Oregon School Boards Association. Instead, school district in Wallowa County in the farm country of eastern Oregon voted to approve a new school tax by a margin of 58 percent, while another rural district much closer to Portland voted down an initiative to raise money for a new school by a margin of 75 percent to 25 percent in favor, Ms. Priem said.
School districts and local governments all across Oregon have been hard hit by a chronic state budget crisis. The state, which has no statewide sales tax, relies heavily on its state income tax, and revenues from it have plunged during the recession.
Over the last year, the Portland School Board was forced to carry out many painful cost-cutting measures, including the dismissal last summer of the district's entire force of 330 unionized janitors and the cancellation in December of a popular sixth grade science camp, as well as all spring athletics.
The latter measure was avoided after Damon Stoudamire, a Portland schools graduate who now plays for the Trailblazers, donated $200,000 and other sports enthusiasts pledged a similar amount. And after the Jan. 28 measure was defeated, Portland teachers agreed to work for 10 days without pay to avoid having the school year shortened by about two weeks.

HEADLINE: Other Nations Join the U.S. In Banning Canada's Beef 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS with SANDRA BLAKESLEE 

DATELINE: WANHAM, Alberta, May 21 

 BODY:
As Canadian health officials scrambled today to find out how an 8-year-old Black Angus cow became infected with mad cow disease, Mexico, Japan, Australia and several other nations joined the United States in placing a temporary ban on the import of Canadian beef and cattle.
 Today, officials found the cow's hide at a tannery in Alberta. It had a branding mark for a different ranch, which was promptly put under quarantine, along with a second ranch where the cow had previously lived, said Dr. Claude Lavigne, an associate executive director at Canada's Food Inspection Agency. The locations of these ranches are being kept secret, as required by law, he said. 
 But it is not known where the cow was born, he added, because many animals are not branded until they are older. It almost certainly did not come from Britain, the site of most of the world's cases of mad cow disease, because Canada banned British imports of cattle in 1990.
Officials in neighboring Saskatchewan said they were investigating the possibility that the cow might have come from there, and quarantined a farm there, Reuters said.
The stricken cow had last lived on a ranch on the outskirts of this town in a remote stretch of open prairies and farmland in northwestern Alberta. The cow was part of a herd of 150 owned by an American rancher, and it was used to breed calves for human consumption. 
Today, the ranch was deserted, and the holding pen empty, after 150 head of cattle were removed for quarantine, testing and slaughter on Thursday in southern Alberta.
The cow, slaughtered in January, was found to be infected after a routine inspection of the brain over the weekend. She bore five calves in recent years, Dr. Lavigne said. All have been located and are under quarantine, he added. Normally, however, the disease takes 5 to 10 years to develop, so the calves would be unlikely to show any signs of infection and would be safe to eat.
The remaining animals in the herd are scheduled to be killed in the next few days, Dr. Lavigne said, so their brain stems can be removed and tested for mad cow disease, formally known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or B.S.E. Results are expected early next week.
Several residents of the sprawling grain and cattle farms here said they were frustrated and angry that journalists were descending on the area, and expressed concern about their livelihood.
"It's scary because this is heavy cattle country, said Shirley Wells, 56, an owner of a bulk fuel supplier to local farmers. "It's totally paralyzed our cattle economy. Where did the problem start?"
A farmer who was loading cows in a truck to put them out to pasture, said: "I think you'll find one cow and that's it. But it already has hurt us, being blown out of proportion."
Another farmer, who also asked that his name not be used, said, "It's one of those isolated things -- it don't mean a thing."
For now, the source of the infection is a mystery. Most infections are caused when a healthy animal is fed meat and bone meal, derived from animals that carry the disease.
It is widely accepted that the infection spread in Britain, and to a lesser extent in other European countries, when contaminated meat and bone meal was fed to millions of animals in the late 1980's and 1990's. That led to an epidemic in which at least 132 people were infected and more than 180,000 animals were slaughtered or quarantined. Infected cattle are still being identified, though at a much lower rate. 
Canada has strict controls to prevent the introduction of B.S.E. onto its shores, said Dr. Cheryl James, a veterinarian at the Food Inspection Agency in Ottawa. No live animals have been imported from Britain or other affected countries since 1990. 
In 1997, ranchers were prohibited from feeding cattle any meat and bone meal made from other cattle. In any case, Dr. James said, Canada does not have endemic B.S.E., so all of the meat and bone meal produced locally should be free of the disease.
Dr. Lavigne said the task now was "to trace back where the cow came from and what it ate." 
Under a tracking system established in Canada three years ago in response to global concerns about mad cow disease, cattle wear numbered ear tags and have computer files that follow them from birth to the supermarket or rendering plant. The files include information on what they are fed.
The cow in question, however, was born in 1995, before ear tags andbefore the ban on feeding meat and bone meal to cattle. Where this cow went and what it ate might never be fully known.
Officials are now working with owners of all three ranches where the cow is known to have lived, to determine what she ate. Most beef cattle feed on grass and hay rather than meat and bone meal. 
It is possible that the animal ate illegally imported meat and bone meal several years ago, but Dr. Lavigne said that import controls were very tight. "Inspectors would have caught any illegal feed," he said.
Calves are sometimes fed supplements that contain blood products from adult cattle. But infection through that route is unlikely unless other Canadian cattle are infected. 
Confusion broke out at the United States border today when American customs officials at Fort Huron, Mich., blocked trucks carrying garbage from Toronto to a Michigan landfill because of concerns about mad cow disease. The garbage shipments were later resumed.
In Washington, the Department of Agriculture posted on its Web site a list of 22 products banned from importation from Canada, including live cattle, pet foods containing animal protein, animal vaccines and fats and oils produced from ruminant animals like cattle.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 27, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about SARS misstated the name of the Michigan border city where American customs officials temporarily blocked garbage trucks headed from Toronto to a landfill. It is Port Huron, not Fort Huron.

Needs Other Than Hunger Fill Pantries

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
THEY are everywhere and increasingly insistent: warnings of growing hunger in New York, of demand outstripping supply, of shortages at food pantries. "Not since the Great Depression has there been a time of such hunger," says City Harvest in a recent fund-raising letter. Are thousands of New Yorkers hungry? Is one of every four city children not getting enough to eat, as a magazine ad featuring Whoopi Goldberg contends?
 Two weeks of visiting food programs and of talking to their directors and their clients has made clear that the portrait of hunger in New York, while sobering, is not as dire as the ad campaigns and alarms suggest. It is, like most matters involving politics, advocates and people's lives, complex and nuanced. 
 Plainly, more New Yorkers began visiting food kitchens and pantries after Sept. 11, and it is evident that demand is high and growing, reflecting the weak economy. No question, some people need the programs to stave off hunger -- especially homeless men, substance abusers and many illegal immigrants who cannot get work or government assistance.
But most patrons of food programs are needy, not hungry, say those who work with them.
"We have an extreme number of people uneducated who can't work, and we have so many undocumented people," said Sister Mary Alice Hannan, executive director of Part of the Solution, a social services agency in the Bronx that is seeing more and more clients, including more children. "But I don't honestly think people are starving. What we hear most is, 'I need the food to save the money for rent.' " Or for clothes, school supplies, subway fares.
Food programs, once an emergency system, are now a form of continuing, supplementary assistance.
For how many?
Frank Sobrino, a spokesman for the Human Resources Administration, said city figures showed a decline this year, but acknowledged that his agency merely tallies numbers from half of the city's food kitchens, which serve meals, and food pantries, which provide groceries.
Julia A. Erickson, the executive director of City Harvest -- who invoked the Depression in a May 1 fund-raising letter -- paints an unrelenting picture of increased demand, declining donations and shortages.
ALL true, several program directors testify -- but. They say they have avoided stinting on food, and when forced to turn people away to prevent overcrowding, could usually accommodate them within a few hours or refer them to another program. So far, many report, they have avoided cutting services despite declines in contributions and government aid with help from foundations, especially the Robin Hood Foundation.
Ms. Erickson's most urgent point is statistical. "We're seeing more than 1.6 million New Yorkers forced to go to food pantries and soup kitchens across the city," she wrote in her letter. That's one in five.
The source? Ms. Erickson cited a nationwide study done in early 2001 for America's Second Harvest, a network of food banks. The section on New York City was based on questionnaires answered by 632 food programs and interviews with 367 clients, conducted by volunteers and by employees of the food agencies themselves.
James Ohls, a senior fellow at Mathematica Policy Research of Princeton, N.J. -- which supervised and wrote the study -- said the company stood by its results. He expressed some reservations, however, and cautioned that "there's fair amount of statistical sample error" because of the small sampling. "If we did it again, would we do some things differently? Yes. But I think we used methods that the policy research community would agree were reasonable and yielded reasonable results. But it is a very hard thing to measure."
Joel Berg, executive director of the New York City Coalition Against Hunger, argued that at least one million New Yorkers use food programs but said that statistics aside, the point is that need is increasing.
It is, agreed Doreen Wohl, executive director of the West Side Campaign Against Hunger on West 86th Street. She noted that demand at her food pantry grew, even in the thriving 1990's, in part because the prosperity was not universal. But also because everywhere, the nonprofit food network expanded, got more efficient and more sophisticated, paralleling cuts and shifts in federal social programs.
The charitable impulse built what people needed -- and they have come. "Emergency food has become institutionalized," said Ms. Wohl.
Next: The food network.

HEADLINE: Masks Become a Taiwan Must-Have, With Bootlegging and Price Gouging 

BYLINE:  By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan, May 21 

 BODY:
Until this week, the hottest contraband in Taiwan was not even illegal.
 It is something that Americans buy when they have a lot of sanding to do: an N95 mask. 
 Recently, genuine N95 masks, which can be found in American hardware stores for $1 or so in boxes of 10, were fetching $4 to $6 in the "night markets" here, right next to knockoffs with Hello Kitty logos.
Prices rose in early May as rumors spread that an N95 was the must-have product against severe acute respiratory syndrome. The "95" means that it filters out 95 percent of all particles. 
Suddenly, 3M was a hotter brand than Nike.
As shelves emptied, Chinese-Americans in the United States began shipping them to relatives here, but some of the shipments disappeared. Rumors spread that they had fallen prey to airport thieves or corrupt customs agents.
The government tried to crack down, but in a strangely uncoordinated fashion. Two weeks ago, as the Fair Trade Commission was fining a pharmacy $4,300 for selling masks for $20, about 10 million masks were stockpiled in airport warehouses.
Prime Minister Yu Shyi-kun was furious.
"He said strong measures had to be taken," said Michael Chen, a government spokesman. Mr. Yu threatened to seize all masks not claimed within 48 hours.
Within a day, Mr. Chen said, all were claimed, and the shortage was over. Last Friday, the government went further, driving the market down by selling thousands cheaply at state-owned gas stations. By Tuesday typical prices had dropped to less than $3, which the government had set as the legal limit.
Public health experts say that the roaring underground market for N95 masks had been based largely on misunderstanding. There is, they said, no reason for anyone except hospital personnel and those living with a SARS patient to use an N95 mask. 
Where masks are required, on subways and buses, for example, a paper surgical mask will do. President Chen Shui-bian made headlines this week when he wore a mask in public for the first time, and his spokesman pointed out that it was a simple surgical mask, not an N95.
"If you're walking on the street, in the open air, no mask is necessary," said Dr. Lee Ming-liang, the former health minister leading the fight against the epidemic.
In Taiwan's muggy climate, thick N95's are a sweaty bother. But doctors and nurses need lots of them. In hospitals, virus-laden droplets collect on the outside, and breathing makes them soggy, so they must be thrown away. Doctors sliding a breathing tube into a pneumonia patient may wear three at once, because the patient may cough or vomit, and changing a mask is dangerous.
But Taiwan is mask-mad now. Legally, one cannot ride the subway without one. Young women often wear two: a paper mask topped by a cloth one that matches an outfit or has a stylish pattern, like zebra print. 
Lesser officials than President Chen wear them in public to set an example. Some N95's are shaped like duckbills, which can make it a bit hard to take a row of stern-faced legislators seriously.
Moreover, the point of masks does not always seem to be understood. For example, Taiwan's TV correspondents -- most of whom are young women -- wear them on the street, where breezes protect them, but take them off during news conferences, where they sit crowded between cameramen who have filmed in hospitals and doctors who have worked with SARS patients.
There was never a shortage serious enough to threaten hospital workers, said Dr. Chen Tzay-jinn, former director of Taiwan's Center for Disease Control. Temporary ones caused by ordering delays "were amplified by the media," he said, adding, "But when the public panicked, they started to stockpile."
Importers ordered truckloads. But medical equipment for government hospitals has to be cleared by several agencies: the health and finance ministries, the Fair Price Commission and the government purchasing agency. As 30 million masks flowed into the airport in early May, customs officials were overwhelmed.
Moreover, importers sensed that government might cancel the 10 percent import duty, and delayed picking up their goods.
Masks sent in small parcels were, meanwhile, getting in. "My brother-in-law sent two packages," said Wei Hsian, a public relations consultant. "We received them with no difficulty." (Personal parcels worth less than $86 escape import duties.)
Also, explained Shih Yen-shiang, vice minister of economic affairs, some generous overseas souls shipped crates marked simply "Donation to the government." But no agency had the authority to accept them.
"It was a real traffic jam," he said.
Early this week, word got out and politicians smelled blood. Legislators trailing camera crews and crying "profiteering" invaded warehouses, popping open boxes and waving the contents around as if they had smashed the Cali cartel.
Finally, Mr. Yu's seizure threat emptied the warehouses. The government took all the N95's it found abandoned, which should keep it supplied for quite a while.

PERSON: Sabato F. Catucci 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
For King of Brooklyn Docks, It's All About Family

BYLINE:  By CHRIS HEDGES 

 BODY:
THERE are 120 acres of the Brooklyn waterfront that Sabato F. Catucci calls his own. The big orange and red containers, the huge forklifts, the warehouses, the enormous wood-paneled office with leather furniture and the collection of carved bald eagles are spread around him like toys.
 This is Mr. Catucci's world. It has been his world for more than 40 years, since he first came to the piers as a young truck driver in 1956. He has watched the docks change, with most of the piers going out of business, and his own fortunes rise. 
 He is a rich man now. He has a big house in Westchester and seven Mercedeses, a Harley-Davidson motorcycle and a summer house in Spring Lake, N.J. He and his second wife, Lorraine, make their own wine. He employs more than two dozen of his relatives among his 1,000 or so employees. He has the rounded, bulky build of a man who has spent a lifetime lifting weights. He has the flashy diamond pinky ring, with his initials in diamonds, that speaks of success. And he is proud: of his company, of America, of the largely Italian-American neighborhood around the docks and of a new treatment he is undergoing for baldness. 
"Look," he said, bending in the sunlight outside his office to show the long strands of gray hair combed across his head, "it is growing back."
Mr. Catucci, 64, owns American Stevedoring Inc. He leases space at Red Hook. He is negotiating a lease extension with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the city's Economic Development Corporation even as those two groups study how best to use the waterfront.
He runs a personal fief that is about loyalty and family and the cloistered community that fiercely protects its character and way of life. Nearly 40 percent of his employees, he said, walk to work from the brownstones that hug the cobblestone streets that stretch up from the pier and into Carroll Gardens. Many of the workers are related. Most are Italian-American.
"The whole neighborhood is for us," he said, "because we create jobs."
He grew up in a world in which bravado and fists often resolved disputes. He was thrown out of his Roman Catholic high school for hitting one of the brothers who taught him. And he did not make it through public high school because of "the same thing."
"I had a run-in with a teacher," he said, taking a drag on a slim cigarillo. "I picked him up by his throat."
He never returned to school. He began, after a brief stint as a civilian chauffeur for the Army, as a trucker on the docks, working for his father's small company. He married when he was 20. At night, he worked as a waiter and a short-order cook so he could save money to buy his own trucks.
"I was working 100 hours a week," he said. "In those days the waterfront was rough. If you did not get into a fight once a week you did not stand up for your rights."
Later, seated in a small Italian restaurant where he goes to eat three days a week with several of his employees, he announced over a glass of red wine that he could take on anyone at the table. No one disagreed. As he spoke, Guy D'Anna, 36, a waiter who also works for him as a longshoreman, came up and kissed him.
"Without Sal," he said, using Mr. Catucci's nickname, "we would all be out on the street."
Mr. Catucci beamed.
"I run my company like a family," he said, as he sat with his arm around Mr. D'Anna's waist. "They got a problem, I got a problem."
He bought some trucks when he was in his 20's. He rented his first pier about 15 years ago. He began to build his business, unloading coffee, lumber, glass, nails and other bulk items. By 1994, the terminal was his playground. He was the only stevedore company left on the pier. And he now unloads more cocoa than any port in the country and is negotiating with Carnival Cruise Lines to berth its huge passenger ships at Red Hook. He says he runs 14 different companies and does $200 million in gross billing.
"I am the last of the Marlon Brandos," he said, referring to "On the Waterfront," which he says captured the lives of longshoremen decades ago. "It is 50 years later and we are still fighting for our jobs."
He does not want to take his companies public. He likes to make decisions with speed, without going to committees and boards that can stymie decisions for months. And he trusts his three sons, his brother, his nephews, two brothers-in-law and his son-in-law to keep an eye on every aspect of the business. 
"I have about 25 relatives working for me," he said. "If you call the operator and ask for Mr. Catucci you will get about 10 people. It is more than having a hand on the pulse. I am pumping the blood through."
He could retire, he said. He has made enough money. He loves his home and said he had just put in 200 tomato plants. 
"I have 20 animals," he said. "I used to have 150. I had sheep, goats, cows, ducks, geese and chickens. Now I have 2 horses, 2 cats, one goat, 2 ducks and 15 geese. I love animals. I love looking out the picture window and watching them graze. It is like some people who like to look at the lights and people on 42nd Street."
But he will never retire, he says. 
"I have 50 guys who will kiss me like that," he said, when Mr. D'Anna left. "It's not the money. It's the power trip."

HEADLINE: Increasing the U.N. Role in Iraq 

 BODY:
Earlier this year, the United States gave up on getting approval from the United Nations Security Council to invade Iraq and acted without it. Now Washington is running Iraq and its oil fields but wants the U.N.'s seal of acceptance. The Security Council is expected to vote today to give that approval. Most Council members remain understandably unhappy with the unilateral nature of the occupation but recognize that trying to block it is futile. They realize that at this point, it is better to wring the most out of the arrangement by maximizing U.N. involvementand helping Washington see the value of outside help. The American resolution has been modified in recent days and is the better for it. Shortcomings remain, but it can serve as a framework for renewed international cooperation in Iraq. 
 When American and British officials first presented the resolution earlier this month, it contained a minimal role for outsiders. It called only for a "special coordinator" from the U.N. and entirely bypassed the international body on weapons inspection. Moreover, by asking to end the U.N. oil-for-food program abruptly, it would have withdrawn billions of dollars in contracts already granted to companies in Russia and other countries. 
 The modified resolution upgrades the U.N. official to that of "special representative," includes the U.N. weapons monitors by pointing to "the intention of the Council to revisit the mandates" of the inspection teams and enhances the U.N.'s authority to honor existing contracts. It also calls for a review within 12 months. 
In some ways, these changes seem cosmetic. American power in Iraq remains nearly overwhelming. But by opening the door to a bigger and more independent role for the U.N., Washington acknowledges that it cannot and should not seek to rebuild Iraq on its own. 
Under the rules, Iraqi oil revenues, earmarked for Iraqi reconstruction, remain largely under American and British control, overseen by a committee of outsiders. But they should not be the only source of income. A stable, prosperous and democratic Iraq is a top international priority and will require additional financial aid.
The resolution's vagueness remains a problem but may provide an opportunity. For example, it calls on the U.N. to promote "the protection of human rights." This is insufficient. There should be a U.N.-created commission of experts to gather evidence of human rights abuses that will lead to war crimes trials. Neither Americans nor Iraqis should preside because Americans are the conquerors and Iraqis do not have an independent judiciary. The best plan would be for a U.N.-sponsored tribunal to take on this task.

HEADLINE: BASICS; 
Are We There Yet? No, but We're Not Lost

BYLINE:  By JEFFREY SELINGO 

 BODY:
IT used to be that only high-priced luxury cars came with satellite navigation systems to help drivers find their way around unfamiliar places. Everyone else on the road was left to fumble with old-fashioned road maps or to print out turn-by-turn directions from Web sites like MapQuest.
 But today more carmakers, including Honda, Nissan and Toyota, are offering buyers optional in-dash navigation systems, most for about $2,000. The systems are available in more than 60 car models today, up from just seven in 1998. The research firm J.D. Power & Associates estimates that 300,000 cars with navigation systems were sold last year in the United States, compared with 175,000 in 2001. 
 For drivers who are not ready to replace their cars, several options are available for adding navigation systems. Several car-audio manufacturers offer navigation receivers that can be installed in the dashboard, or for more money, can be integrated with a stereo system. For drivers with more than one car, there are portable navigation devices that can be easily transferred from one vehicle to another. 
 All the navigation units are based on the Global Positioning System, or G.P.S., which uses precise timing signals from satellites to determine the vehicle's location. Although the features of the factory-installed models and the aftermarket devices differ, all of the systems provide onscreen electronic maps and turn-by-turn directions, as well as directions to the nearest automated teller machines, gas stations, hotels and hospitals.
 Of course, like paper maps, the software on these devices must be updated to account for new roads and other changes. Such upgrades normally cost $150 to $300.
 Drivers who spend most of their time in familiar surroundings may not find the navigation systems useful. The systems are popular, however, among sales representatives, repair people and real estate agents who frequently drive to unfamiliar places. 
 "It saves me hours of time a week," said Tom Ryan, a Washington-area real estate agent who uses a portable unit in his Jeep Cherokee. Before Mr. Ryan bought the device, he mapped out routes to houses by using the Internet or road maps, but those directions proved useless if his plans changed during the day. Now, his G.P.S. unit automatically plans a new route when he strays from his intended course.
 "It sometimes takes me out of my way," he said. "But it has never gotten me lost."
 That was my experience when I tested several G.P.S. units recently while driving in and around Washington, although on one occasion a portable device did lead me to make a turn the wrong way down a one-way street. 
 In general, while the G.P.S. units got me where I wanted to go, they rarely provided the most efficient route even when I chose the "shortest route" option (all of the systems offer a choice between the shortest and fastest routes).
 The devices were also distracting at times. While most units encourage users to enter destinations while the car is in park, doing that can slow your progress if you are making several stops. (Some of the factory-installed units allow the driver to give voice commands, which minimizes the distraction.) And although all the units I tested provided voice directions and visual prompts, I was often tempted to double-check by glancing at the on-screen map while driving. 
 The two most popular portable G.P.S. units are the Garmin StreetPilot III (www.garmin.com, list price: $1,116, but available for around $900) and the Magellan 750M Plus (www.magellangps.com, list price: $2,399, with retailers selling it for about $2,000). The StreetPilot fits on the dashboard and comes with a beanbag-like cradle to hold it in place, which is surprisingly resilient in stop-and-go city traffic. Without reading the manual, I set up the StreetPilot, plugged it into the cigarette lighter and entered an address, point of interest or intersection by pushing the "find" button.
 But like all portable G.P.S. devices, the StreetPilot is slower than built-in units in locating the satellites and mapping out a route. Usually, the brief delay was not a problem, except when I missed a turn. By the time the unit recalculated the route, I had sometimes missed the turn for a suggested detour.
 While the StreetPilot was effective at helping my wife and me navigate our way around Northern Virginia on a recent Saturday afternoon, when we programmed it to take us home from the grocery store, it led us onto the Pentagon grounds and told us to make a wrong turn onto a one-way street. We made a U-turn, and once we started driving home along our usual route the StreetPilot was able to catch up. 
 The StreetPilot's compact size does result in one disadvantage: limited memory. The 128-megabyte memory card that comes with the unit can hold detailed maps for only a few cities. While the single card can get you from, say, New York to San Francisco on major highways, if you want detailed maps for different regions of the country you must either download them along the way from a CD-ROM that comes with the device or buy more memory cards.
 A 128-megabyte memory card costs about $223. The CD-ROM contains maps for the United States and Canada, and updates cost about $150 for those who already own StreetPilot. The CD only works with Windows-based computers.
The Magellan750M Plus, meanwhile, contains detailed maps for the entire United States and Canada. It is about the size of a laptop computer and fits underneath the front seat. While that makes the Magellan bulkier than the StreetPilot, the only part drivers need to worry about is the control unit, which is about the size of a hand-held computer and hooks to the dashboard.
 Entering an address into the Magellan also takes less time than with the StreetPilot, which uses an alphabet-based menu, because of an onscreen keyboard that users navigate with directional push buttons. It also speaks each letter as it is pressed, making the unit much easier for the driver to use while moving.
 Consumers interested in testing the Magellan without buying the device can do so by renting a car from Hertz. Its NeverLost system is similar to the Magellan750M Plus. 
 The Magellan gave me several problems when I first used it. For one, it took several minutes for the device to find the satellites and map my route. A few times, the device gave me directions in Kansas City even though I had clearly entered a Washington address. Company officials blamed my difficulties on the location of the G.P.S. antenna. On the StreetPilot, the antenna is attached to the top of the device, but on the Magellan, the antenna is a separate small disc connected to the main unit by a long wire.
 I placed the disc on the top of my dashboard, but company officials said that the antenna worked best outside the car, on the trunk or the roof where it can get a clear line of sight and avoid interference from the car radio. Putting the antenna on the roof solved my problems. 
 For consumers interested in larger monitors and features like touch screens and voice commands, the best G.P.S. units are those that are built into the dashboard, either at the factory or as an aftermarket add-on. Alpine's PowerNav system (www.alpine-usa.com, $2,000) has a 5.8-inch widescreen monitor, much bigger than the 2-by-3-inch screens that are common in the portable units (even larger screens are available, including some that retract into the dashboard). Installation of the system is extra and can cost $150 to $350. 
 With the Alpine system, drivers enter the destination with a hand-held remote. The larger monitor on the Alpine allows users the option of viewing their current location on a split screen. One part of the screen shows a wide view of the route, while the other offers a close-up of the car's current location.
 Another feature shows drivers the restaurants and other facilities at each exit on a highway, a nice option for those who might be wondering if there is another McDonald's farther down the road. 
 Among the navigation devices installed in new cars, I tested the system for Acura (www.acura.com, $2,000) and the one made for Nissan (www.nissanusa.com, $2,000 if purchased separately but included with option packages on some models). While the factory-installed systems were superior to any of the aftermarket devices I tested in terms of speed and integration into the car, the Acura system was the better of the two.
 For one, the Acura system (which is also available on some Honda models) accepts voice commands from the driver, who can ask it to "find the nearest Italian food" or "find the nearest parking garage" (Nissan offers voice activation on its Infiniti Q45 and M45 models).
 Another difference between the two models is that for safety reasons, the controls of the Nissan system freeze when the car is in motion. You cannot override that feature, even if you have a passenger in the car who can enter the information.
 The final thing to remember about all these navigation systems is that G.P.S. is only accurate to about 10 feet or so. Limited accuracy can become an issue when, for example, two streets run nearly parallel to each other. The system is unable to discern which street the driver is actually on.

HEADLINE: Computing's Lost Allure 

BYLINE:  By KATIE HAFNER 

DATELINE: BERKELEY, Calif. 

 BODY:
ON a sunny May afternoon, Brian Harvey's introductory computer science class at the University of California convened for the last time before the final exam. By the time Dr. Harvey was full tilt into his lecture, reviewing recursive functions and binary search trees, the cavernous hall was lightly peppered with about 100 students, backpacks at their sides, a few legs slung over the backs of empty seats.
 Sparse attendance is, of course, an end-of-semester inevitability. Many students viewed the lecture by Webcast, if at all. But more significantly, just 350 students signed up for the course this spring, in striking contrast to enrollment in the fall of 2000, when the same lecture hall was engorged at the start of the semester with 700 students sitting and standing in every available pocket of space. 
 So full was the room the first few sessions that a fire marshal showed up to size up the situation as a potential hazard. "Even the corridors were jammed," recalled Dr. Harvey, who has taught the introductory course for 16 years. The following semester was little different, with 600 students hoping to enroll in the class. 
 Today, empty classroom seats, like the vacant offices once occupied by high-flying start-ups, are among the unmistakable repercussions of the dot-com bust.
 At the height of the Internet boom in the late 90's, computer science talent was in such demand that recruiters offered signing bonuses to students who agreed to drop out of school. Now, spooked by layoffs and disabused of visions of overnight riches, many undergraduates are turning away from computer science as if it were somehow cursed. 
 "They overreacted to the boom, so why shouldn't they overreact to the bust?" said Anne Hunter, an administrator at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who tracks application and enrollment figures. 
 Berkeley's experience is mirrored elsewhere. At Carnegie Mellon University, applications to the School of Computer Science for next fall are down 36 percent from their peak in 2001; applications to Virginia Tech's computer science department have declined 40 percent since 2001. At M.I.T., renowned for its computer science curriculum, 20 percent fewer freshmen declared electrical engineering and computer science as their central focus this springthan did in 2001 or 2002.
 "People aren't seeing the glory in computer science that they used to," said Nirav Dave, 20, a senior and an electrical and computer engineering major at Carnegie Mellon who has seen the ranks of his fellow majors decline. "It used to be that you would do this and you would be a millionaire."
 Shaun McCormick, 19, who will be a sophomore next fall at the University of Texas at Austin, started out in computer science but switched at midyear to communications and plans to focus on advertising.
 Not only was he daunted by the difficulty of the coursework, Mr. McCormick said, but his job prospects also worried him. 
 "You have to be a very good programmer with lots of experience under your belt," he said. "Even if you have a good G.P.A., it's hard to get a good job."
 If enrollment in the field remains sluggish, some computer scientists warn, technical progress could be jeopardized. 
 "Our department will be hurt," said J Strother Moore, chairman of the department of computer sciences at the University of Texas, where interest in the field has also diminished. "But more importantly, when the economy recovers, we're going to need computer programmers, and many more of them than we'll be producing at the current rate of input. It's a serious problem for the national economy." 
 Still, in the absence of a recovery, opportunities in the computer field are contracting. In 2000 Intel hired 2,378 recent college graduates. Last year it hired 566, one-fourth that number. The chilly job market has had a converse effect on graduate school enrollment: applications to computer science graduate departments have risen sharply over the last two years as discouraged students remain at school or try to return to it. 
 The number of graduate students entering Ph.D. programs in computer science rose 21 percent last year, according to the Taulbee Survey, an annual report compiled by the Computing Research Association, a nonprofit research group. M.I.T. officials said that the graduate program in computer science had received about 3,000 applications for next fall for 120 places, up from 2,000 applications four years ago. 
 To be sure, there are still many enthusiasts at the undergraduate level. Eugene Chung, a sophomore at Berkeley, is pursuing a double major in computer science and business. Although he worries about getting a job when he finishes, he is studying computer science because he enjoys it. "Personally I like it, whether there's a job or not," he said.
 According to the Taulbee Survey, enrollment in computer science departments nearly doubled between 1995 and 2000. So great was the demand for programmers that many students enjoyed the luxury of not even having to prepare a resume.
 "It used to be that even before students had graduated they had three job offers and by the time they had to make a decision, they had 10," said Gabby Silberman, program director for the Centers for Advanced Studies at I.B.M.'s T.J. Watson Research Center, who spends much of his time recruiting. 
 Undergraduates who might otherwise have chosen computer science appear to be fanning out to related yet more applied fields like business information technology, biotechnology and bioinformatics, which involves managing and manipulating databases of genetic information. 
 "Computer science was a very focused degree, and lots of people were entering the program because the hot jobs available were dot-coms and Internet jobs," said Stephen W. Director, dean of the engineering school at the University of Michigan. 
 Now, Dr. Director said,students seem to be migrating toward electrical engineering, a degree that gives them the know-how they need to enter a Silicon Valley software company yet a more general education that they can use for other fields, like biotechnology. 
 At the University of Texas, pharmacy appears to be a popular alternative, a phenomenon that mystifies Dr. Moore. "All these kids need a lot of chemistry courses, so it's put a real load on the chemistry department," he said. Many others have shifted to biology. 
 Dr. Moore suggests that students who reject computer science in favor of biotechnology are making some incorrect assumptions about the latter industry. "If you look at what happens in a biotech firm, you need a lot of database and specialty programming skills," he said. "The truth is, the people who have these programming skills will end up getting those jobs." 
 Dr. Silberman said that while the hiring frenzy of the boom years had disappeared, talented programmers were always in demand. "The craziness is over and it's back to business as usual," he said. "But to go from there to saying there are no jobs in the industry is just too much of a leap." 
 "Would you rather have a degree in computer science or English?" he continued. "You might not get the dream job that you wanted right off the bat, but you'll find a job that uses your skills." 
 Andries van Dam, a professor of computer science at Brown who has been teaching introductory computer science there since 1965, agreed. "When kids say, 'Is there going to be a job for me when I graduate?' I essentially have to laugh," he said. "That's like saying, 'When Maxwell discovered the rules of electromagnetism, was physics over?"' 
 For the undergraduates who do stick with computer science, some mental adjustments are necessary, not just about job prospects but about how to approach computer science as a discipline as well. 
 Jennifer Li, a junior at Carnegie Mellon who is majoring in computer science, said that more people in her field were choosing second majors to enhance their job prospects in other fields like graphic arts and bioinformatics. For her part, Ms. Li has chosen two minors: business administration and multimedia production. 
 Dr. van Dam said, "We are encouraging it because it is the kind of intellectual broadening, career broadening that will really help students." 
 Latika Kirtane, 18, a freshman at Carnegie Mellon, said she was thinking of combining computer science with graphic arts. She said that she and other freshmen she knew were trying not to dwell on job prospects. 
 "People are generally afraid, but since we are freshmen, we are not really thinking about the future," she said. "We just do it because we love it." 
 Mr. Dave echoed her view. "I would say that everyone who still loves the field is still there, but there aren't the people who were doing it just for the money," he said.
 Randal Bryant, head of the computer science department within Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science, said that even though the school is receiving far fewer applications, gaining admission remains difficult. He said the motivation of students entering his department was a refreshing change from four years ago. "Many of the students we see coming in are very enthusiastic about computers," he said. "They aren't looking to become millionaires by age 25." 
 Thomas H. Cormen, an associate professor of computer science at Dartmouth College, agreed that while the quantity has decreased, the quality has improved. "The advantage of this is that the students who are taking our courses, we have some confidence that they're taking the courses because they're genuinely interested," he said.
 Dennis Gannon, chairman of the computer science department at Indiana University, where enrollment in computer science has dipped about 10 percent since last year, said most of the faculty members there felt somewhat relieved. "Prior to this drop we were under siege by students wanting in to our courses and the major," he said. 
 Still, concerned about what could happen if a downward trend continues, companies like I.B.M. are intensifying their programs to reach out to potential computer scientists, efforts that are aimed at children as young as elementary school age. Intel has spent $700 million on its outreach program, which is intended for students in kindergarten through high school.
 Dr. Silberman of I.B.M., who is 49 and has been in the computing field for more than 25 years, said he was concerned about the enrollment decline. "I know what it takes to develop a technology and produce something that is usable, so people can count on it," he said. "We've seen how much all this progress we've made over the last five years depends on computing technology -- when you go into a hospital and see all these machines or even an amusement park. All these things depend on computing technology." 
 Dr. van Dam argues that computer science is far from irrelevant. "We are just at the very beginning of the computer revolution," he said. "People should realize that not only is it not over, but it's scarcely begun."

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: UNITED NATIONS; 
U.S. WINS SUPPORT TO END SANCTIONS IMPOSED ON IRAQ

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 21 

 BODY:
The final American concessions on the resolution to end nearly 13 years of sanctions against Iraq won the support of France, Russia and Germany today, ensuring the overwhelming approval of the measure, which is set for a vote on Thursday morning.
 The measure grants the United States and Britain an extraordinary amount of authority over Iraq's political and economic affairs until a representative, internationally recognized government is installed. The resolution would give a limited but independent role to a United Nations special representative to help the occupying powers and Iraqi groups create a new government. 
 In a final concession, Washington agreed to a Security Council review within 12 months to examine how the resolution has been put into effect. The French had sought to give the Council power to rescind the mandate later. 
The French foreign minister, Dominique de Villepin, appearing at a news conference with his German and Russian counterparts, Joschka Fischer and Ivan Ivanov, said last night that the latest version of the resolution put the United Nations "back in the game," adding that the United Nations special representative will now have a "tangible and independent role."
It is not clear if the Bush administration's choice for the job, Sergio Vieira de Mello, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, is willing to take on the job, diplomats said, but he was expected to arrive in New York soon for talks.
The swift and cooperative nature of the negotiations over this resolution clearly soothed the raw edge of emotion that had characterized Security Council relations in the struggle over a resolution that would explicitly authorize war against Saddam Hussein's government.
"I think that people do want to move forward and they want to contribute to getting the occupation period over and done with as soon as possible and getting the Americans and us out," the British envoy, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, said in a telephone interview this evening.
He added: "It's tempered by the fact that they know the U.N. couldn't have handled everything on the ground. So realism has crept in, as well as a desire not to go through all that again."
In a statement this morning before the declarations by France, Germany and Russia, John D. Negroponte, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, said: "If consensus were possible, that would be very desirable. Our impression is that the Council members have welcomed this resolution and it enjoys strong support, but I would hesitate to predict for you at this moment exactly what the precise vote count is going to be." 
The resolution has had an aura of inevitability since its introduction 10 days ago, but the breadth of authority granted to the United States and Britain over Iraq's caused quiet consternation here because, international lawyers and United Nations experts said, the mandate given the United States and Britain in the original version of the resolution exceeded anything contemplated in existing treaties.
European diplomats here indicated that the American willingness to move quickly on these concerns was welcome, even though some felt that it had not moved far enough. In Paris, Mr. de Villepin said, "Even if this text does not go as far as we would like, we have decided to vote for this resolution."
Other concessions, political and financial, cemented European support. The resolution left the door open for the return of United Nations weapons inspectors to certify the disarmament of Iraq.
Sir Jeremy said his government saw verification of Iraqi disarmament as a natural function for both the International Atomic Energy Agency and the biological and chemical weapons inspection teams.
Washington this week signaled its willingness to have the atomic energy agency return to Iraq, after the looting of some significant nuclear facilities. But Washington's attitude toward Mr. Hans Blix's team remains frosty, Sir Jeremy said. "The U.S. has signaled, 'Don't press us on this now,' " he said.
The financial issues involved the control of Iraqi oil revenues, the disposition of $400 billion of debt owed by Mr.Hussein's government, and contracts approved and financed through the United Nations' oil-for-food program.
The oil revenues will be controlled by the United States and Britain, but the management of the new Development Fund for Iraq, which will hold these funds in the Central Bank of Iraq, will be monitored by an advisory board with representation from international financial institutions and the United Nations, which can hire auditors to examine accounts.
The measure also guarantees the sale of energy products immunity from legal attachments or garnishment. It also suggests that Iraq's creditors work through mechanisms like the Paris Club to agree on the disposition of the old debts. 
A major concern of Moscow's has been the fate of oil-for-food contracts. Under the resolution, the program will be phased out over six months. But by restricting the United Nations to honoring only contracts for nutritional and health supplies, the draft made it likely that only a fraction of the $1.7 billion due to Russian companies would be paid.
The final version gives the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, discretionary power to determine which contracts will be honored, not just on food and medical supplies but also for industrial goods.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
Just because prices are falling, it doesn't mean there's deflation.

BYLINE:  By Virginia Postrel; Virginia Postrel is the author of "The Future and Its Enemies." Her book on the increasing economic and cultural importance of aesthetics will be published in September by HarperCollins. E-mail: vpostrel@dynamist.com.

 BODY:
"PAY Less for Almost Everything," blares the cover of Reader's Digest, conveniently positioned next to the supermarket cash register.
 Wouldn't it be great if the article lived up to its billing, if you really could pay less for everything? 
 Or would it?
A generation after inflation battered the economy, Americans are being told to worry about its opposite: deflation. Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve sent a carefully worded signal that its central bankers were now less concerned about their traditional problem, avoiding inflation, than they were about deterring deflation. 
"The probability of an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation, though minor, exceeds that of a pickup in inflation from its already low level," the Fed governors said.
On the heels of that statement, the federal government last week reported first a 1.9 percent drop in wholesale prices and then only a modest increase in consumer prices. The "core" rate, which excludes food and energy, was 1.5 percent.
Soon talk of deflation was everywhere, much of it highly misleading. Macroeconomics is a slippery, often contentious, field, and much of the popular discussion of deflation has been confused about the nature of the potential problem and, hence, of its solutions.
Deflation, as one Fed governor, Ben S. Bernanke, explained in a November speech, "is defined as a general decline in prices, with the emphasis on the word 'general.' "
Like inflation, deflation affects the nominal prices of all goods and services -- the numbers on every price tag. Deflation is independent of underlying relative values like how many bananas equal a shirt or how many freelance articles equal a new laptop computer.
In essence, inflation and deflation describe changes in the value of money compared with everything else.
When the price of toys falls because Chinese suppliers make them cheaply, or the price of computer chips falls because of new designs or the price of manicures falls because there is a nail salon on every corner, that is not deflation. These are changes in relative prices, not the overall price level.
These relative price changes mean consumers have more income to use elsewhere, bidding up the price of college tuition or fancy coffee, new houses or prescription drugs. (Conversely, the increasing price of education or health care, relative to other categories, is not inflation.)
People often confuse lower prices in some industries with economywide deflation.
"Pricing power is receding right across the board," David Rosenberg, Merrill Lynch's chief economist, told Bloomberg News in response to the Labor Department's latest consumer price index report. In the context of deflation, this statement is a non sequitur. Even if there were tough competition in every industry, that would just mean low profit margins, not falling prices throughout the economy.
Analysts who respond to questions about inflation and deflation with talk about the "pricing power" of businesses are confusing real and nominal prices. Not being able to charge more because the value of your products isn't rising relative to other goods is different from not being able to charge more because the value of each dollar, regardless of how it is spent, is rising. Only the latter is deflation.
Tough price competition may keep managers and investors up at night, but those industry-specific problems are different from the problems posed by deflation (or, for that matter, by inflation).
Falling prices in a single industry may push resources, including jobs, out of that business into other sectors. That change can certainly disrupt the lives and fortunes of people who have invested their careers or money in that industry. But those falling prices don't depress the economy as a whole. To the contrary, they raise the overall standard of living.
Unexpected changes in the overall price level, by contrast, effectively rewrite all sorts of contracts. Dollar amounts specified today have a different value tomorrow. In the case of deflation, the promised sum buys more than expected.
That sounds great if you are a worker whose salary is fixed or a lender who is collecting on long-term debts. But what happens when the employer or borrower has to come up with the money?
If widgets are selling for fewer dollars than expected, the widget maker has a hard time meeting its payroll and debt service. If the company can't just cut everyone's salary to correct for deflation, it will lay off workers. And if it can't renegotiate its loans, it may default.
The same thing can happen in an industry facing tough competition, of course. But when the cause is deflation, it happens not just in one sector but throughout the economy. Resources don't move to more productive uses. They simply disappear.
As a result, unexpected deflation can lead to a downward spiral, where each round of cutbacks brings others. (If the deflation is expected, people will write contracts to take account of the changes, just as today's mortgage rates include a premium for expected inflation.) The problem is intensified if, as in Japan, financial institutions and labor markets are rigid and slow to adapt.
Fortunately, that prospect isn't likely in the United States. If anything, trends are moving in the opposite direction. The falling dollar raises the cost of goods, while the growing federal deficit creates inflationary pressures.
"I've never known an economy -- I doubt that there is one -- that has a falling exchange rate and a large and rising deficit and that has deflation," said Allan Meltzer, an economist at Carnegie-Mellon University, in an interview.
That may not reassure businesses that can't raise their prices because of competition. But it's good news for the rest of us.

HEADLINE: 10,400 Students Graduate At Rainy Columbia Rites 

 BODY:
Lee C. Bollinger, the president of Columbia University, told graduates yesterday that they had lived through a period of extraordinary changes for the nation, and that they now must help shape how America addresses those changes.
 Mr. Bollinger, speaking at his first commencement as the university's president, referred to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 and conflict around the world, saying: "You have attended the university at a remarkable and possibly even momentous period. For nearly all of you, that period of time spans a world that seemed to flourish in nearly every way to one when the world is struggling to come to terms with threats and instabilities, economic, political and social." 
 He urged the graduates to ask themselves what he called future-shaping questions. "What are our responsibilities?" he asked. "What should be the character of our relationships with other parts of the world? Do we have the right international institutions to deal with the problems we face?"
Since he arrived at Columbia last year, Mr. Bollinger has pushed to expand the campus and remake the journalism school's curriculum to include more academic theory. He has also stressed the importance of affirmative action. Two cases challenging affirmative action filed against the University of Michigan while Mr. Bollinger was president there are now before the United States Supreme Court.
"Today more than ever, we are being called upon to extend our sympathy well beyond what has happened in the past," Mr. Bollinger told the crowd of 38,000.
Among those receiving honorary degrees was Constance Baker Motley, the United States District Court judge who, as a civil rights lawyer, successfully argued before the Supreme Court to integrate the University of Mississippi.
Other recipients of honorary degrees were Maya Angelou, the writer and poet; Julian Hochberg, a psychologist; Sir Frank Kermode, the literary critic; Mary-Claire King, a geneticist; Cecil Taylor, a jazz pianist; and Andrew Wiles, a mathematician.
A spokesman for the university said that higher than average enrollment at both Columbia College and the School of Engineering had increased the number of graduates to 10,430, a record.
Coming just a day after the authorities raised the terror alert level to orange, the ceremony had tight security, although a spokesman for the university, Joseph J. Kennedy, said it was the same as in previous years. "They basically lock down the campus, whether it's a pink or green alert," he said. 
Despite the specter of terrorism and intermittent rain, the graduates made light of the occasion, batting inflatable balls into the crowd and cheering boisterously. Some wore flip-flops and leis, while others pulled plastic ponchos over their blue gowns. One young woman, seated in the front row before the university administrators, chatted on a cellphone.
At one point, when some graduates had received their degrees, they showered apple cores on the stairs in front of the dais in an unexplained but no doubt deeply symbolic act. 
Mr. Bollinger, who also told graduates of the importance of free and uninhibited speech in an open society, did not appear to object.

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: WARNINGS; 
New Tape, Linked To bin Laden Aide, Urges More Attacks

BYLINE:  By NEIL MacFARQUHAR and DON VAN NATTA Jr. 

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, May 21 

 BODY:
An Arab television network broadcast an audiotape today said to have been recorded by Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, the second most powerful figure in Al Qaeda after Osama bin Laden. It called on Muslims to attack Western interests with the same ferocity as the Sept. 11 assaults and derided Arab governments that aided the war on Iraq, even as they claimed to oppose it.
 "Learn the lesson from your 19 brethren who attacked America with their planes, in New York and Washington, wreaking on it unprecedented havoc from which it is still reeling," said one segment of the tape, which was played on Al Jazeera. 
 The sudden appearance of a Qaeda recording, after suicide attacks here and in Morocco attributed to the group, heightened already elevated security concerns about the threat of a terrorist attack. 
As with previous recordings from Qaeda leaders, intelligence analysts warned that it might contain a coded signal to sleeper cells to begin a new wave of attacks. Senior American and Saudi officials have been warning this week that global intelligence monitoring indicated that another attack was "imminent." 
Those concerns were in evidence on Tuesday, when officials from the United States, Britain and Germany announced plans to close their embassies in Saudi Arabia temporarily, while the Bush administration said it was raising the nation's color-coded threat alert to orange, its second-highest level.
Fears of an attack here were compounded by contradictory reports about three Moroccan men arrested Monday at the Jidda airport. The authorities said they suspected the men were Qaeda members preparing to hijack a jet and crash it into a landmark in the kingdom.
Both Saudi and American officials confirmed the account, but late in the day it was called "baseless" by Prince Nayef bin Abdel Aziz, Saudi Arabia's interior minister renowned for discouraging public pronouncements about any security matters. 
"The fact is that two Moroccan people were arrested and they were wanted for previous security issues," the Saudi Press Agency quoted the minister as saying. 
Concern about an attack prompted a flurry of increased security measures in Riyadh. Highways were snarled by traffic backed up behind frequent checkpoints, numerous expatriate schools and diplomatic missions were temporarily closed, and concrete obstacle courses were implanted in front of major hotels. 
Western residential compounds were locked down. Suicide bombers attacked three such residential compounds last week, killing 25 residents and guards.
A senior Saudi official said earlier this week that at least one Qaeda cell remained active in the kingdom and that another had dispersed with its members heading to Europe or North America.
The tape thought to be made by Dr. Zawahiri, an Egyptian physician and intellectual force behind Al Qaeda, made no specific references to events that would indicate when it was recorded. It seemed to have been made right around the beginning of the war against Iraq, as the speaker did mention demonstrations and conferences against the war. 
But he did not mention the fall of Baghdad or last week's terrorist attacks. One theme of the tape was to encourage Iraq to develop an Islamic opposition to the American presence.
In Washington, a senior American counterterrorism official said the tape "needs to be authenticated," and that analysts were struck by the fact that there were no time elements on the tape to indicate when it was made.
The official also noted that often in the past, taped messages from Mr. bin Laden were followed by terrorist strikes. 
At a minimum, analysts consider the tape an attempt by Al Qaeda to emphasize that it is still a force to be reckoned with, despite pronouncements by the American administration that its campaign against terrorism was succeeding. 
Dr. Zawahiri, like Mr. bin Laden, has eluded capture despite a $25million bounty on his head. Western intelligence officials believe he may be hiding in Pakistan, along the border with Afghanistan. 
"The only thing that will do you any good is to carry weapons and attack your enemies, Americans and Jews," the speaker on the tape said. "The Crusaders and Jews understand only the language of killing and blood. They can only be persuaded through returning coffins, devastated interests, burning towers and collapsed economies."
Some words on the poorly recorded message were difficult to understand. A spokesman for Al Jazeera, a satellite network based in Qatar, said it received an 11-minute tape on Tuesday. He would not specify how, but added that the producers found only about three minutes that were worthy of broadcasting. 
The tape urged Muslims to attack Western embassies and companies. 
"Kick those criminals from your lands and do not allow the Americans, British, Australian and Norwegians and other crusades, killers of your brothers in Iraq, to live in our countries, enjoying its prosperous resources and spreading corruption," it said.

HEADLINE: Edwards Makes Rural Voters A Focus of His '04 Campaign 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21 

 BODY:
Senator John Edwards of North Carolina said today that the Democratic Party and President Bush had failed to address the needs of rural Americans and that he would make an appeal to such voters a central part of his campaign for president.
 Mr. Edwards, one of nine Democrats running for president, offered several proposals intended to help rural Americans, whom he described as struggling even more than urban dwellers with a bad economy. They included providing financial aid and tax credits to encourage development in rural areas, increasing salaries for teachers in rural areas and guaranteeing the installation of broadband Internet service in every rural community in the country. 
 He described his views in a speech in Nevada, Iowa, and in telephone interviews with reporters in Washington.
"Too many Democrats too often act like rural America is just someplace to fly over between a fund-raiser in Manhattan and a fund-raiser in Beverly Hills," Mr. Edwards said in his prepared remarks, adding, "Rural America and small-town America are in trouble, and George W. Bush just doesn't get it."
"In small towns and rural communities, our lifestyle and all the values it represents, are under siege," he said. "While the rest of America grapples with an economic downturn, recession has become a permanent way of life for much of rural America."
The speech came as Democratic candidates have been struggling to win attention in a crowded field. Mr. Edwards's aides described it as a centerpiece of his candidacy, and compared it to the proposal Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri made three weeks ago to finance universal health care.
That speech lifted Mr. Gephardt's profile, to the evident consternation of some of his less-noticed rivals.
Mr. Edwards's advisers invested a good amount of attention in seeking the right setting for his own speech: a patch of rural Iowa, a state where, in January, the Democrats will hold their first nominating caucus. Rural voters are likely to prove pivotal in the general election. 
The prepared text for Mr. Edwards's speech that was e-mailed to reporters included stage directions for the senator -- instructing him to "point if you can see" windmills in the distance, as he talked about their potential to generate inexpensive power for farmers.
Mr. Edwards, a successful trial lawyer, painted himself as a product of rural America, in Robbins, N.C., talking about sweeping floors at the mill and working at a mobile home factory. "When I was growing up, Robbins was a textile mill town," he said. "My dad worked in the mills, and he worked his way up to plant supervisor. My mom's last job was in the post office. I was the first member of my family to go to college."
Reflecting a growing argument among Democratic strategists today, Mr. Edwards said in an interview that rural voters would be crucial in the presidential election and suggested that Democrats had ignored them at their peril. "This goes to the heart of what a lot of Democrats think is one of things we need to win a national election," he said. 
"I want my party to return to its roots," he said. "I want the Democratic Party to champion the forgotten America, not just in the metropolitan areas, but also in the small towns that lie between."
Jim Dyke, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, suggested that Mr. Edwards would have a tough time presenting himself as the candidate of rural America.
"I guess they wrote that speech at John Edwards's Georgetown mansion," Mr. Dyke said.

HEADLINE: Bush and Japan Leader Share Concern Over Deflation 

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH with KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 21 

 BODY:
When the Japanese prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, pays an overnight visit to President Bush on his Texas ranch on Thursday, there will be much friendly talk about Japan's support for American policies from Afghanistan to Iraq and much concern expressed about a nuclear North Korea.
 It is far less clear how frankly the two leaders will discuss another immediate and potentially devastating threat: deflation. 
 Like a spreading virus, a five-year decline in prices has worked its way deep into Japan's economy, ravaging the nation's banks, eroding corporate profits and stripping savers of interest income. 
After years in denial, the government here is finally confronting the crisis but is doing so amid widespread disagreement over the cure and skepticism about whether the deflationary spiral can be broken. 
Three years after the collapse of global stock prices, America too is starting to wrestle with what is potentially the same set of thorny problems. The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, made that clear when he said recently that deflation, while a distant threat, was of greater concern now than the historic enemy, inflation. 
While Mr. Bush and Mr. Koizumi would have plenty to discuss along those lines, chances are they will avoid the topic altogether. The specter of a wealth-destroying beast like deflation is so frightening and the tools for fighting it so limited, that both men are likely to feign confidence and talk of things they have more control over, like their shared commitment to stopping North Korea from accumulating nuclear weapons. 
"The global economy is in a particularly delicate position, and Japan is in the deepest trouble, but it's difficult to figure out what levers Japan should pull," Kenneth Courtis, vice chairman at Goldman Sachs Asia, said. 
Prices in Japan fell a record 3.5 percent from January to March, suggesting that deflation is accelerating despite efforts by the Bank of Japan, which has already pushed interest rates to zero. 
Falling prices have increased corporate bankruptcies and created hundreds of billions in non-performing loans, ravaging the financial industry. 
The government funneled $80 billion into the banks in 1999, hoping that would ease the crisis. But last weekend, the nation's fifth-largest bank, Resona Holdings, said it would need a cash infusion of $17.3 billion to survive. 
Although the American financial industry is in far better shape than Japan's, and policymakers have been far more proactive in promptly cutting taxes and interest rates, the United States and Japan have a common challenge: China. The world's most populous nation has turned into the world's factory floor, churning out goods in such quantities and so cheaply that America and Japan have little choice but to shop there for imports. 
While a boon for consumers who can now buy computers for half of what they paid two years ago, the flood of cheap products has triggered a vicious price war that has destroyed balance sheets on both sides of the Pacific. 
In years past, that would have led to calls for tariffs and bans. But that response is no longer appropriate because American and Japanese companies operate the same factories in China that produce the deflation in the first place. 
"Deflation in Japan is the expression of this country not moving as quickly as it should to the emergence of China," said Robert Feldman, a managing director of Morgan Stanley based in Tokyo. 
For years, Japan has kept people working by borrowing heavily and spending the proceeds on construction projects and other public works. But there is a limit to that. At 150 percent of gross domestic product, Japan's debt already is the highest in the developed world. 
The heart of Japan's problem, many experts say, is that it has not managed to find ways to invest its excess capital in profitable businesses. 
"It is not enough to build roads and bridges, to print money and lower interest rates, or spend money on defense," Mr. Feldman said. "You also have to move money resources into new areas and retrain people, which is very hard." 
While financial experts agree that prolonged bouts of deflation are debilitating, they disagree about whether the United States and others are learning from Japan's unprecedented woes. 
Optimists say that policymakers are better prepared to battle deflation because they have studied Japan's experiences and can use them as a powerful cautionary tale to motivate action. 
But pessimists say that although the United States has acted quickly to head off deflation there are signs it may have already exhausted many of the conventional tools, from aggressive interest rate reductions to tax cuts, and so far without great effect. 
Japan was slow to cut interest rates, and in recent years has raised taxes and fees for pensions and health care, cutting into consumer demand just when it is most needed to get the economy rolling. 
"Japan was complacent, basically did everything wrong and is now stuck in a deflationary cycle, with the malaise spreading, which is very worrying," said Peter Tasker, director of Arcus Investments, an equities firm based in Japan. 
"They had no one else's example to follow, whereas the rest of the world now has Japan to look at. The problem is, it is very difficult to say that the American economy is responding, even after quite a few bullets have been shot." 
With interest rates at zero, the Japanese central bank has lost its major tool against deflation. Rock-bottom rates have also failed to spur new bank loans, the lifeblood of any economy, because few companies have any confidence that the money can be profitably invested, and many others fear the prospect of being forced to pay it back when prices, revenues and income are falling. 
The stock market has fallen to 20-year lows, destroying pension funds. Weakened companies are also laying off more workers and cutting wages, which leads consumers to think twice about making big purchases. 
The long slide in real estate prices, which have fallen 75 percent from their 1991 peak, has also hurt homeowners, who are stuck with mortgages priced at much higher rates. Personal bankruptcies have quintupled in the last decade.
"In a deflationary environment like this, everyone who borrows money finds it harder to service their debt, not just the so-called zombie companies, but everyone from the government down to the smallest borrower," Mr. Tasker said.

HEADLINE: Bush Links Europe's Ban on Bio-Crops With Hunger 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: NEW LONDON, Conn., May 21 

 BODY:
President Bush charged today that Europe's ban on genetically modified food had discouraged third world countries from using that technology and thus undermined efforts to end hunger in Africa.
 Mr. Bush's accusation was made during a graduation speech at the United States Coast Guard Academy that dwelled on initiatives to combat AIDS and poverty. 
 It is almost certain to exacerbate the divisions between Washington and Europe that emerged before the war in Iraq. While Mr. Bush has made the case before that Europe should stop obstructing the sale of genetically modified food, today was the first time he linked that policy with world hunger. 
The speech signaled the tough stance Mr. Bush is likely to take when he goes to France in 10 days for the annual economic summit meeting of seven major industrialized nations and Russia. White House officials have already said Mr. Bush plans no reconciliation with the leaders of France and Germany, beyond what they call a perfunctory "courtesy visit" to President Jacques Chirac during the summit meeting, to be held in the French town of Evian.
In a speech that the White House said would put forward what aides called a positive agenda that would show a far softer side to American foreign policy, Mr. Bush insisted that widened use of "high-yield bio-crops" would greatly increase agricultural productivity in some of the poorest nations.
"Yet our partners in Europe are impeding this effort," he said, clearly meaning France and Germany, though he named no countries. "They have blocked all new bio-crops because of unfounded, unscientific fears." 
The result, he charged, was that African nations that fear being shut out of European markets are not investing in the technology. He appeared to be referring to countries like Uganda and Namibia.
"European governments should join, not hinder, the great cause of ending hunger in Africa," he said.
Mr. Bush made no mention of the United States' own strong economic interest in the outcome of the dispute with Europe. American corporations lead the world in biotechnology and are anxious to open the lucrative European market.
Last week the administration filed the equivalent of a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization to force Europe to lift its ban on genetically modified food, a step that Mr. Bush had delayed during the debate on Iraq. 
Inside the White House, the emotions about the countries that tried to stop the invasion are still raw; recently a senior administration official told reporters that diplomacy to disarm Saddam Hussein had been going well until, in the official's view, France stabbed the United States in the back. The French have complained that such comments are part of a concerted effort by the administration to turn the American public against France and its goods.
Today the United States trade representative, Robert B. Zoellick, wrote an op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal accusing the European Union of disregarding scientific evidence and sending "a devastating signal to developing countries that stand to benefit most from innovative agricultural technologies." 
He charged that some African countries were refusing American food aid "because of fabricated fears stoked by irresponsible rhetoric about food safety."
The European public has been highly reluctant to purchase any genetically modified products, citing unknown long-term health and environmental risks. European officials have said that the Bush administration can argue over the openness of the European market but that they reject as underhanded the implication that their stricter rules on genetically modified food are somehow responsible for hunger in Africa.
Tony van der Haegen, the expert for food safety at the European Union, said administration officials had been "a bit unfair to whip Europeans" when they had never blocked food aid. Last week European officials charged that the administration was manufacturing its claims. 
"The U.S. claims that there is a so-called moratorium," Pascal Lamy, the top European trade official, said last week, "but the fact is that the E.U. has authorized G.M. varieties in the past and is currently processing applications. So what is the real U.S. motive in bringing a case?"
Yet as a practical matter, the European Union had an unwritten moratorium on new varieties of bio-crops until last year. Since then it has approved only two applications for new imports.
Europeans have also demanded that any genetically modified foods be labeled, a move that American farmers say would condemn the products to the back shelves, where they would sit unsold. The United States suit has been joined by a number of other nations, many of which are seeking free trade agreements with the United States.
Mr. Bush's speech here, delivered in a drizzling rain as Coast Guard vessels bobbed in the waters behind him, marked a return to the state where he was born -- a native status that the adopted Texan rarely talks about, identifying himself more with Midland, the Texas town in which he grew up. 
But his birthplace was just too close today to be ignored, and Mr. Bush opened his speech by saying, "You know, I was born in this state, just down the road." He was greeted by laughter, then applause. "I've still got relatives living here," he said.
In his speech, Mr. Bush commended Congress for passing legislation authorizing greater spending around the world on AIDS treatment, a bill he said he would sign next week. 
He called anew for financing for the Millennium Challenge Account, a new approach to development aid that would grant money to nations that demonstrated a commitment to remaking their justice systems, spending more on health and education, and adopting market-opening measures.
"When I'm in Europe," he said, pointing to another likely subject of contention, "I will call on America's partners to join us in moving beyond the broken development policies of the past, and encourage the freedom and reform that lead to prosperity."

HEADLINE: Back Campaigning, Bush Raises $22 Million 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21 

 BODY:
President Bush flexed his political muscles tonight for the first time since declaring himself a candidate for re-election, raising $22 million for Republican House and Senate candidates in his initial fund-raising appearance of the 2004 election cycle.
 The evening's take was an early indication of Mr. Bush's ability to raise record-setting amounts of money for his own candidacy and for Republicans further down the ticket. 
 In what amounted to his first overt campaign appearance since last fall's midterm Congressional elections, Mr. Bush made clear, if any doubt remained, that he would seek re-election by meshing his role as commander in chief in a continuing war on terrorism with his push for conservative domestic policies, most notably his drive for tax cuts. 
Speaking to an audience of 7,500 donors in the cavernous new Washington Convention Center, Mr. Bush said the last two and a half years had shown Americans to be "courageous, resolute, tough when we have to be and a compassionate people" -- the same attributes that the White House has sought to attach to the president after a terrorist attack, two wars, a recession and a corporate scandal.
Reprising a line from his 2000 campaign, he spoke of progress in restoring "honor and dignity" to the presidency. He hailed Vice President Dick Cheney and applauded Congress for passing much of his agenda. But he said there was still "a lot to do," especially in fighting terrorism and righting the faltering economy.
Casting the war on terrorism as an epic struggle, he said the United States "will not stop until the danger to civilization is removed." 
Having said that, he also seemed to acknowledge that his political fortunes will hinge on his ability to make the economy more vibrant and stop the steady erosion of jobs.
"Our most urgent mission in the months ahead is to strengthen the economy," he said.
Mr. Bush, who formally established his re-election committee last week, will begin raising money for his own candidacy next month with events in Washington on June 17 and New York on June 23. His postwar popularity and proven fund-raising prowess have led some Republicans to predict that he and Vice President Cheney could raise as much as $200 million for their campaign, twice the record-setting $100 million Mr. Bush raised for his race in 2000. 
The money Mr. Bush raised tonight will go to the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee, the fund-raising organizations for House and Senate races. It is all so-called hard money -- mostly from $2,500 per-person tickets -- that can be used for any purpose. Under the new campaign finance law -- which is about to undergo review by the Supreme Court -- individuals can give up to $25,000 to a party committee per year, up to a maximum of $57,500 per two-year election cycle.
Although the same dinner last year raised $30 million, about two-thirds of that was largely unregulated contributions known as soft money, which has been banned under the campaign finance law.
For Mr. Bush, it was an efficient appearance. He listened to the Oak Ridge Boys sing the National Anthem and then, at his request, "Amazing Grace." He spoke for half an hour, and although the evening was billed as "the President's Dinner," he did not stay to eat the filet mignon, hustling out after a few brief handshakes with donors on the dais, including Steve Case, the former chairman of AOL Time Warner.
Republicans at the dinner said it was taking more work to raise money this year, given the weak stock market and the soft economy.
"It took a lot more calls than were made a year ago to get this amount of money," said Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi.
Mr. Lott, who stepped down late last year as Senate majority leader after making remarks that appeared to embrace the segregationist platform of Strom Thurmond's 1948 presidential bid, was one face in a sea of Republicans, from Cabinet members to small-town mayors.
Indeed, Mr. Lott, who was seated near the back of the room about a football field away from Mr. Bush, noted that he was at table No. 742, "a drop of 741 in one day" from his seat of honor last year.
Mr. Lott said the evening was the opening of an 18-month campaign season that was probably too long for everyone involved, but that it demonstrated the party's ability to raise money under the new law.
"This is what John McCain always said would happen, that we'd be better off under the new campaign finance laws because we have a better ability to raise hard money," Mr. Lott said.

HEADLINE: The Republicans Party On 

 BODY:
Against some of the best economic advice in the land, President Bush and his Republican Congressional leaders have concocted a benighted final tax-cut plan that will do far more to deepen the nation's deficits and debt than to stimulate the wallowing economy. In a rush for approval by Memorial Day, the leaders have cannibalized parts of competing packages into a tentative $318 billion grab bag that again offers the most significant relief to the upper-bracket Americans so dear to the administration. Dividend taxes will be cut, not eliminated as the president hoped, but so will capital gains taxes. The latter was a conservative chestnut rejected two years ago when the first Bush cuts were enacted in the long-ago euphoria of an actual budget surplus. 
 This time, with the budget hemorrhaging red ink, the G.O.P. takes care to include $20 billion in much needed fiscal relief for battered state and local budgets, whose problems can be traced in part to the first Bush cuts. And the leaders are wrapping their package in middle-class sweeteners like child-care credits and relief for married taxpayers. But those boons are cynically "sunsetted" to expire after three years to fit into fictitious limits of fiscal responsibility. In contrast, there is no such asterisk on the accelerated cut in all tax rates, including the most controversial drop in the top rate, to 35 percent from 38.6 percent -- a windfall of scores of thousands of dollars annually for wealthy Americans. 
 This version of the president's "growth" plan will increase the deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars across the next decade. To help pay for it, the G.O.P. budget hawks of yore, born again now as deficit spenders of record proportions, will soon have to raise the national debt limit by almost a trillion dollars from the current $6.4 trillion. This is particularly urgent now that the current year's deficit is ballooning beyond estimates, toward $400 billion, with the two Bush tax cuts expected to add well over $2 trillion in deficits by 2013. "Deficits do matter," the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, warned Congress, sounding like a Dickensian wraith ominously foreseeing a future of red-ink borrowing and rising interest rates. But the Republicans appear set to party on now and roll the tab over the far horizon.

HEADLINE: $15 Billion AIDS Plan Wins Final Approval in Congress 

BYLINE:  By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21 

 BODY:
The House gave final approval to President Bush's $15 billion global AIDS initiative today, clearing the way for Mr. Bush to sign the measure before he leaves next week to meet Western leaders for an economic meeting in Evian, France.
 The bill, which gives the federal government the authority to triple spending on global AIDS over the next five years, is an important symbol for Mr. Bush, who has made spending to combat AIDS a centerpiece of his "compassionate conservative" agenda at home and abroad. It is intended to prevent and treat AIDS in 12 nations in Africa and 2 in the Caribbean. 
 "The AIDS virus is a moral challenge to our civilization," Representative Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, chairman of the House International Relations Committee and the chiefRepublican sponsor of the measure, said today in the House chamber. "I know that today my colleagues will be animated by the compassion and vision that has always defined what it means to be an American."
That is the message President Bush wants to take to next week's forum, where he will meet with European leaders who are still irritated with the United States over the war in Iraq. The White House is seeking to use the AIDS initiative to demonstrate Mr. Bush's commitment to moral causes as well as military ones. At the same time, the president plans to make the argument that other nations should follow the lead of the United States and increase spending on AIDS.
Today's action, by voice vote, brought Mr. Hyde's measure -- which passed the House this month by the overwhelming vote of 375 to 41 -- into line with a version the Senate passed last week. That bill added a provision encouraging the Bush administration to begin negotiations that could lead to debt relief for nations hardest hit by AIDS.
The overall measure makes good on a promise President Bush made in January in his State of the Union address. The White House says it will prevent 7 million new infections, provide antiretroviral drugs for 2 million infected people and care for 10 million patients and children who have lost their parents to the disease. 
But the measure does not provide the money to pay for the initiative; that will be left to House and Senate appropriators. And it is not without controversy; some advocates for AIDS patients say it provides too little money for a global fund to fight the disease, while others are upset about a provision that requires one-third of the prevention money in the bill to be set aside for programs that exclusively promote sexual abstinence until marriage.
But the initiative's backers say it is an important step toward curbing the global AIDS epidemic, which has claimed 23 million lives since 1981, when the disease was first recognized. Today nearly 10,000 people in Africa are infected each day with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.
"It's rare that we pass legislation that has the true power to save the lives of millions of people worldwide," said Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the Republican majority leader, who has been a major proponent of increasing spending on AIDS.
Mr. Frist called the bill a "truly historic leap that may very well turn the tide of this devastating disease."
Despite bipartisan support for the increased spending, the initiative proved contentious. Conservatives worried that the money would be steered to agencies that provide abortions and tried, unsuccessfully, to draft legislation that would have included language prohibiting AIDS money from going to such programs.
Instead, the White House brokered a compromise in which agencies may provide abortions and also receive federal AIDS financing, as long as the programs are separate and the money is strictly accounted for.
Republicans and Democrats were also at odds over whether money should be steered toward programs that promote sexual abstinence only, and they had difficulty agreeing on how much should go to the new global fund, set up two years ago by the United Nations. Republicans said the fund was untested; Democrats said it needed more money.
The disagreements were so severe that Mr. Frist was unable to reach a compromise in the Senate; that task fell to Mr. Hyde in the House.
Mr. Hyde said of AIDS, "Left unchecked, this plague will further rip the fabric of developing societies, pushing fragile governments and economies to the point of collapse."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
A Muddled Day on Wall St. Ends Close to Where It Began

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Wall Street stumbled through an uneven session yesterday and closed mixed after the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, said he was unable to make a firm judgment about the health of the economy.
 In testimony to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, Mr. Greenspan said economic signals remained mixed; his comments increased the concerns of some investors about the pace of recovery and sent stocks falling. But prices rebounded as some traders took advantage of lower prices after three days of selling. 
 There were also undercurrents of caution after reports that a case of mad cow disease had been identified in Canada and as the federal government raised the terror alert level.
At the end of the day's trading, the major stock indexes had moved relatively little. The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average, shaking off early declines, closed up 25.07 points, or 0.3 percent, at 8,516.43. It was the Dow's first gain in four sessions. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.69 points, or 0.4 percent, to 923.42. But the technology-focused Nasdaq composite index, in its fourth consecutive decline, dipped 1.22 points -- less than 0.1 percent -- to 1,489.87.
On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues outnumbered those declining by a margin around 3 to 2. Volume eased to 1.46 billion shares from 1.52 billion on Tuesday.
Strategists seemed hard pressed for a consistent explanation of stock behavior. "The strength in the market is still there," said Peter Cardillo, president and chief strategist at Global Partner Securities. "We are looking at a market that still wants to go higher."
But others thought that the market would have trouble rallying further until there were new signs the economy was rebounding and stocks were fairly priced. Richard A. Dickson, senior market strategist at Lowry's Research Reports in Palm Beach, Fla., wrote, "Lacking any clear evidence of a market bottom, any near-term rally is likely to be, in our opinion, short lived." 
Shares of tobacco companies rose after a Florida appeals court overturned a record-setting $145 billion award against Philip Morris USA and othercompanies. Wall Street also seemed unfazed by agreement at the World Health Organization on the severe terms of a treaty intended to discourage smoking.
The stock price of the Altria Group, the parent of Philip Morris, rose $3.39, or 9.7 percent, to $38.30; R. J. Reynolds gained $1.57, or nearly 5 percent, to $33.28; and Loews rose $1.82, or 4.3 percent, to $44.10.
Among stocks advancing yesterday, McDonald's rose 35 cents, to $17.30, recouping some of the $1.21 it lost on Tuesday amid the fears of mad cow disease. Lehman Brothers upgraded the company's shares and minimized the severity of the situation in Canada. Officials said the infected cow did not enter the food chain and its calves are quarantined.
Among technology stocks, Hewlett-Packard rose 89 cents, to $17.94, having reported earnings late Tuesday that surpassed analysts' expectations and indicated that the absorption of Compaq Computer was almost complete.
But Cisco Systems declined 29 cents, to $15.70, after Deutsche Securities lowered its recommendation on the company to hold from buy.
Eaton Vance, a mutual fund and investment company, fell $1.10, to $29.10, after its second-quarter earnings missed analysts' estimates by 3 cents a share.

Treasury Prices Vary
By Bloomberg News
Treasury notes fell yesterday, pushing two-year yields up from 53-year lows, after Mr. Greenspan, the Fed chief, expressed optimism that a forecast for faster economic growth was "not unreasonable."
His testimony led traders to lower expectations of another cut in interest rates next month. Ten-year yields rose less as some traders interpreted Greenspan remarks to mean that the Fed might buy longer-maturity securities to spur growth.
Yields on the two-year notes rose to 1.36 percent from 1.26 percent on Tuesday. The price, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped 5/32 , to 100 16/32 .
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 11/32 , to 101 29/32 . Its yield rose to 3.40 percent from 3.36 percent.
But the price of the 30-year bond gained 3/32 , to 116 14/32 ; its yield eased to 4.35 percent from 4.36 percent.
Here are the results of the Treasury's auction of four-week bills:

Price: 99.915

HEADLINE: Greenspan, Broadly Positive, Spells OutDeflation Worries 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21 

 BODY:
While offering a generally optimistic view of the economy, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, issued his strongest warning yet today about the dangers posed by deflation.
 "We at the Federal Reserve recognize that deflation is a possibility," Mr. Greenspan told members of Congress. "Even though we perceive the risks as minor, the potential consequences are very substantial and could be quite negative." 
 The Fed, he said, is closely monitoring deflation, a sustained decline in prices, for ways to combat it if it takes hold.
Mr. Greenspan emphasized that growth was likely to improve this year. If it did not, he said, the Fed could inject money into the economy to halt any deflation -- which can cripple an economy by causing people to reduce their spending in anticipation of future bargains -- and by effectively increasing debt loads. He said that the prospect of deflation had created an unusual degree of uncertainty because "we never dealt with this before."
Reiterating his concern that the rising federal budget deficit could harm the economy by driving up interest rates and raising the cost of money for consumers and businesses, Mr. Greenspan also gave political support to policy makers who have argued for a smaller tax cut.
"Deficits do matter," he said. "In any evaluation of a program, what happens to deficits is an integral part of the analysis."
Mr. Greenspan avoided taking positions on specific parts of the tax-cut legislation before Congress, instead lamenting the lack of discussion about reductions in government spending. He offered general praise for the elimination of taxes on dividends and capital gains, a Republican priority, and for unemployment benefits, which Democrats want to extend.
Stock and bond prices were mixed today, with most gauges only slightly changed. Bonds had fallen during Mr. Greenspan's testimony, before the Joint Economic Committee, as traders seemed to interpret his remarks as a sign that the Fed was unlikely to raise its benchmark short-term interest rate any time soon and might cut it at its next meeting in June.
But Mr. Greenspan's overall evaluation of the economy was consistent with the optimistic message he had been delivering in recent months, a period when some other Fed officials grew more concerned about the possibility of a new economic downturn. Mr. Greenspan and other optimists have argued that interest rates are low enough to encourage spending and lift the economy, while some officials in the Fed's 12 regional banks favor a precautionary rate reduction to keep prices rising.
The Fed's main policy tool is its ability to set the interest rate on overnight loans between banks, which affects the rate on many other loans and the pace at which consumers and businesses spend money. But officials have emphasized that if they lower the rate -- now at 1.25 percent, a 40-year low -- to zero, and the economy remains weak, they can buy long-term bonds or take other steps to stimulate growth. 
Mr. Greenspan said today that low interest rates, the decline in oil prices, the end of the war in Iraq and a recent overall rise in stock prices suggested that the economy would emerge this year from its long slump. But calling recent data about employment and production "on the weak side," he said that growth had not yet picked up and that he remained uncertain about when it would and how strong the rebound would be. The central question, he added, is when companies will increase their spending on new factories and equipment.
Richard J. DeKaser, chief economist at the National City Corporation in Cleveland, said, "The message is that there are very hopeful leading indicators, but we have scant evidence of any real traction in the economy."
Although the subject of deflation has attracted attention recently, before today Mr. Greenspan had rarely used the word in public. And the Fed's statement after its most recent meeting discussed the minor possibility of "an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation." 
During a speech in December, when he last spoke of deflation in detail, Mr. Greenspan said, "The United States is nowhere close to sliding into a pernicious deflation."
Since then, some measures of inflation have dropped to their lowest levels in decades, raising fears that weak demand for new products could push the country into the kind of spiral that has afflicted Japan. 
In an exchange today with Senator Robert F. Bennett, Republican of Utah, Mr. Greenspan acknowledged the scrutiny that his often murky discussion of the recent decline in inflation receives -- interrupting Senator Bennett after he had said that Mr. Greenspan mentioned deflation the last time he testified to Congress.
The Fed chief interjected, "Did I use the word 'deflation?' "
Mr. Bennett responded, "You kind of danced around it, but that's the way it came across."
Mr. Greenspan, smiling broadly, said, "It was my interpreter."
Today, he showed little such reticence, giving a detailed history of the successful battle that central bankers had fought against inflation and saying that they now had to study the causes of deflation to learn how to defeat it. Fed officials have made "very substantial progress," he added, but the matter continued to warrant "very close scrutiny" and "maybe action."
Yet, in an encouraging sign, surveys show that consumers do not expect prices to begin falling, Mr. Greenspan said, suggesting that they would not curtail their spending. 
If inflation continues to decline or the economy does not show signs of improvement in coming weeks, economists predict that the Fed will cut its benchmark rate.
Asked by senators about the value of the dollar, Mr. Greenspan declined to comment, saying that only the Treasury secretary, John W. Snow, should do so. A decline in the dollar's value, which has accelerated since Mr. Snow suggested that the Bush administration was comfortable with the fall, has made deflation less likely by increasing the price of imports, economists say. 
The Fed chief did mention a sharp rise in the cost of natural gas, which he said had not received enough attention. In the last year, natural gas prices have risen 65 percent, according to Economy.com in West Chester, Pa., as demand for it has increased faster than production. "It is a very serious problem," Mr. Greenspan said.
Asked about jobless benefits, Mr. Greenspan said that they should be "temporarily generous" during economic downturns, when people are forced out of work, but that if Congress decides to extend them -- a subject of current debate -- it should do so only briefly and then revisit the issue. In other countries, where benefits are bigger and last longer, people sometimes have an incentive not to work, he said.

HEADLINE: TAKING THE CHILDREN; 
Men Without Paychecks, Now Minding the Children

BYLINE:  By Peter M. Nichols 

 BODY:
Daddy Day Care
Eddie Murphy, Jeff Garlin, Steve Zahn, Regina King, Khamani Griffin, Anjelica Huston
Directed by Steve Carr
PG 93 minutes
 Trying to promote a vegetable-based breakfast cereal called Veggios, the marketing man Charlie Hinton (Mr. Murphy) winds up on unemployment. Charlie has a Mercedes convertible and a nice house. Soon he will have a monthly day care bill that his wife, Kim (Ms. King), at first mistakes for an annual rate. Chapman Academy is expensive, but the 4-year-olds wear blazers and learn German. The headmistress, Miss Harridan (Ms. Huston), assures the Hintons that there is no more enriching place for their son, Ben (Khamani Griffin). 
 Lower-priced alternatives seem to be run by America's most wanted. "If somebody opened a decent day care around here, they'd make a killing," says a woman on a park bench.
By now Charlie and his friend Phil (Mr. Garlin), another Veggios casualty, are at the park every day with their children. Why not tend kids for money? Charlie and Phil will open Daddy Day Care in Charlie's house. Neighborhood children are recruited, some of them from families fed up with Harridan's mini-Harvard. Prospects express their views about daddies in this kind of work: unnatural, says one; sicko, says another. Soon, though, a group of children is gathered and ready to wreck Charlie's place.
A sugary lunch gets things hopping. In subsequent days Charlie and Phil struggle but survive. Charlie says they need games and activities; Phil advocates Ritalin and leashes. Gradually the children calm down and get interested. One little boy sheds the Flash Gordon outfit he has worn for weeks. Others develop skills and self-confidence. With Charlie at home, he and Ben develop a new closeness.
A fellow ex-employee, Marvin (Mr. Zahn), joins the staff. He wore the carrot suit in the Veggios promotion. Soon Daddy Day Care needs larger quarters. An open house is part circus, part rock concert. Charlie gets his old job back at twice the money, but how can he walk away from all these other rewards?

VIOLENCE -- None.
SEX -- Marvin unwittingly utters some very mild double entendres when talking to a mother.
PROFANITY -- Some potty talk.

For Which Children?
AGES 3-6 -- This category will relate to children in the film, who are about their age. It's hard to find anything too objectionable.
AGES 7-10 -- A sweet film doesn't work very hard at fresh insights, but it's full of good feelings and intentions. Mr. Murphy is an appealing dad.
AGES 10 AND UP -- Fine, if they like.

Down With Love
Renee Zellweger, Ewan McGregor, David Hyde Pierce, Sarah Paulson, Rachel Dratch
Directed by Peyton Reed
PG-13 100 minutes
It's 1962 and a spankingly fresh day in Mr. Reed's naughty candy-
colored spoof of the Rock Hudson-Doris Day movies ("Pillow Talk," "Lover Come Back," "Send Me No Flowers").
Recently arrived from Maine, the hugely enthusiastic Barbara Novak (Ms. Zellweger) checks in at her Manhattan publisher, meets her frenzied editor (Ms. Paulson) and marvels at the whirl and bustle of the fast-track New York scene.
Barbara has written "Down With Love," a provocative blockbuster that is about to change the way the world does things. It's Barbara's contention that women should enjoy equal participation in the workplace, and to do this they should exclude themselves from relationships with men. Sex is still allowed, but it should be casual and with no strings.
The book takes off after Judy Garland helps promote it on "The Ed Sullivan Show." Soon every woman on the planet is out looking for a job. Across town at Know Publications, Barbara and all the hubbub catch the attention of a sleek cad of an ace reporter named Catcher Block (Mr. McGregor). Know's publisher, Peter McManus (Mr. Pierce), has been pressuring Catcher for his next big scoop, and Barbara has the makings.
But after Catcher stands her up at one too many interview appointments, Barbara drops out. Catcher is miffed and decides to turn his profile into an expose. He and Barbara are unacquainted at this point, so he disguises himself as an astronaut, and the two fall into a coy romance.
Would they, should they, will they have sex? Barbara wants to, as long as it's casual. Catcher plays hard to get. Will these two ever have a Las Vegas wedding?

VIOLENCE -- None.
SEX -- Male endowment is discussed through double entendre, and there is much sexual suggestion and talk about sex.
PROFANITY -- Risque talk.

For Which Children?
UNDER AGE 11 -- Many parents will decide not.
AGES 11-13 -- The film is fun and harmless.

The Matrix Reloaded
Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Laurence Fishburne, Hugo Weaving, Jada Pinkett Smith, Gloria Foster, Harold Perrineau
Directed by the Wachowski Brothers
R 138 minutes
Zion, the underground last refuge of the human species, is under attack by an army of machines chewing their way down with devices that resemble whirling octopuses. Morpheus (Mr. Fishburne), Zion's most respected sage, and Link (Mr. Perrineau), the humans' best computer jockey, barely make it home.
Morpheus tells the assembled throng that if they stand up and resist, deliverance is at hand. In the dingy underworld, that sets off drums and begins a torchlight dance of celebration reminiscent of the rites in "King Kong." But salvation is in the hands of Neo (Mr. Reeves), called the One, a supposed messiah with ultimate powers.
Neo, however, has doubts. In a recurring dream, his lover and right-hand wonderwoman, Trinity (Ms. Moss), is killed by a machine operative named Agent Smith (Mr. Weaving). This upsets Neo and makes him tentative about doing his best against the machines. Morpheus says they must consult the Oracle (Ms. Foster), a grandmotherly type on a park bench.
As was the case in "The Matrix," the first film in the series, the Oracle has no easy remedy. She tells Neo that his decision to act or not has already been made. Now he must understand why he made it, or Zion will be destroyed. "To be concluded," reads the caption announcing the third "Matrix" installment, scheduled for November.

VIOLENCE -- Spectacular action sequences introduce much hand-to-hand and mechanized violence. It's highly stylized and not very believable, but very violent nonetheless.
SEX -- The nude Neo and Trinity make love in an extended scene.
PROFANITY -- Strong language but relatively few obscenities.

For Which Children?
UNDER AGE 12 -- The violence and sex rule it out by most parental guidelines.
AGES 12-14 -- Parents might disagree, but by now children should be old enough.
AGES 15 AND UP -- Tolerable by most standards.

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. At many museums children under 12 and museum members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.

Museums

* "ART OF THE FIRST CITIES: THE THIRD MILLENNIUM B.C. FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN TO THE INDUS," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Aug. 17). The most timely exhibition in years, as well as diplomatically dexterous and beautiful. It surveys the culture of the third millennium B.C., mainly centered in Mesopotamia, the crucible of Sumerian civilization, where art, architecture, law and writing developed with the rise of the earliest cities. The beginnings of a cosmopolitan art are in tiny cylinder seals and in figurines. The show is full of small objects that are monumental in concept. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $7 (Michael Kimmelman).

* "MATTHEW BARNEY: THE CREMASTER CYCLE," Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through June 11). The most anticipated show by any American artist to emerge in a decade or more. "Cremaster," Mr. Barney's nine-year, five-film project, here presented whole for the first time, is an inspired benchmark of ambition, scope and forthright provocation for art in the new century. I recall Elizabeth Murray's describing how Philip Guston's crazy late works gave her heart to do her own mature paintings. Mr. Barney has brought to the art world a new freedom to explore narrative. He has introduced a new repertory of materials -- gooey, strange, malleable and synthetic -- that nobody thought of as germane before. Never mind that the films and many (not all) of his related sculptures, installations and photographs are very beautiful. The show, an installation itself, brings them together. The earliest "Cremaster" sculptures are film props, cobbled into installations that don't jell. But the latest are better: twin steel towers framed in plastic, a suite of abstract sculptures derived from automobile chassis. Vaseline and plastic combine with cement and steel -- pink and gray, rough and smooth, hard and soft -- the materials sustaining a narrative of formal eloquence. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $15; students and 65+, $10 (Kimmelman).

"BEALS, HERVEY AND HEWITT: WOMEN PIONEERS OF ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN PHOTOGRAPHY," New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400 (through July 13). Three female photographers, saluted for their successes in early-20th-century New York. The artistic oddball was Antoinette Bryant Hervey (1857-1945), who carried out an obsessive 40-year photographic documentation of the construction of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine and produced an epic of great artistry as well as historical value. Greenwich Village was the stamping ground of Jessie Tarbox Beals (1870-1942), the best known of the three, who engagingly turned her lens on Village haunts, architecture and personalities. Mattie Edwards Hewitt (circa 1870-1956) did homes and gardens designed for the era's rich and famous, like Conde Nast and Margaret Bourke-White. Although this mix is a little forced, individually each woman is worth a salute. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $5; students and 65+, $3 (Grace Glueck).

* "EGYPT REBORN: ART FOR ETERNITY," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (permanent installation). The second and final phase in the museum's reinstallation of its world-
renowned holdings of ancient Egyptian art, this dazzling display rounds up more than 600 objects -- from king-and-queen-size monuments to tiny rings and amulets -- from the predynastic period to the 18th dynasty. Together with the first phase, which opened in 1993 and covers later Egyptian art, visitors will now be able to trace the entire course of this brilliant and complex civilization from its beginnings to its absorption by the Roman Empire in 30 B.C. The heart of the new installation is an introductory gallery that provides a wonderful summation, with a survey of sculptural styles and displays of weapons, pottery, cosmetics, jewelry, furniture and funerary arts. The adjacent galleries are devoted to an extensive chronological survey. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 11 p.m. the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $6; students and 62+, $3 (Glueck).

* "MANET/VELAZQUEZ: THE FRENCH TASTE FOR SPANISH PAINTING," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through June 29). The Met has clearly called in every chip to make this show spectacular. The first rooms are a virtual survey of great Spanish painting of the 17th and 18th centuries; after that comes a virtual Manet retrospective, with some Degas and Courbet thrown in for good measure; then a virtual 19th-century American overview of the most gifted portraitists influenced by Spanish painting via Manet, Degas and Courbet: Eakins, Chase, Sargent and Whistler. The thesis of Spanish influence on French art is hardly new, but it is explored in such precise and fresh detail, discreetly, without pushing comparisons (in that respect it's not like "Matisse Picasso" at the Modern, notwithstanding the coincidental titled pairings) that you would have to be churlish not to leave edified and amazed. Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman).

"MATERIAL DIFFERENCES: ART AND IDENTITY IN AFRICA," Museum for African Art, 36-01 43rd Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-7700 (through Aug. 15). Part Art Methods 101, part Advanced Connoisseurship, this handsome, thoughtful show examines the potent connection between matter and meaning in diverse African cultures and shows them to be organically connected. The material is spiritual in these cultures, and the show's 130 mostly ceremonial objects, arranged strictly according to materials and techniques, reflect the power of that belief. Hours: Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; students and 65+, $2.50 (Roberta Smith).

"ELIE NADELMAN: SCULPTOR OF MODERN LIFE," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600 (through July 20). Despite the clarion title, this exhibition is too monotonous, stiffly installed and short on drawings to do full justice to the erudite, polymorphous achievement of the Polish-born American sculptor Elie Nadelman (1882-1946). Still, don't miss this opportunity to see his work in quantity, especially the streamlined wood figures from the 1920's and the small truculent plaster figurines, which were found in his studio after his death. Their suave economy, ineffable stillness, delicate gestures and seamless blend of historical and popular sources place them among the most complex, fully visual sculptures in Western art. Hours and admission: See above Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 62+, $9.50 (Smith).

* "CHRISTIAN SCHAD AND THE NEUE SACHLICHKEIT," Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200 (through June 9). Schad's career effectively lasted only 15 years, from around 1915 to 1930, and for just two or three of those years was he doing what deserves to be remembered now. Not much time. But just enough. Schad at his mordant best precisely captured an anxious culture affected by war and the threat of it: his bloodless portraits in Vienna and Berlin suggest deep unease and foreboding beneath porcelain surfaces. They are explicitly unemotional, even when they are frankly erotic, as they frequently are. His drawings, akin to some done by Dix and Grosz, shy away from the issues of class conflict that inflamed both of those other artists. To the end, Schad remained aloof. Hours: Fridays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; students and 65+, $7 (Kimmelman).

ROSEMARIE TROCKEL, "Spleen," Dia Center for the Arts, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 989-5566 (through June 15). This German Conceptualist is known for machine-knitted fabric works patterned with corporate logos. Her installation consists of five massive, freestanding walls covered on one side by grids of painted metal plates. Short films projected on the reverse sides are mystifyingly oblique. The Dia curator Lynne Cooke says they allude to gender roles, hysterical pregnancy, grassroots politics of the 60's, Bertolt Brecht's play "Mother Courage," the cold war and much more. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $6; children, students and 60+, $3 (Ken Johnson).

ROBERT WHITMAN, "Playback," Dia Center for the Arts, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-5566 (through June 15). Mr. Whitman, who was born in 1935, was a pioneer in the use of new technologies in art and performance. In his work from the 1960's and 70's on view here, he was less a technical wizard than a Surrealist poet. Like the paintings of Rene Magritte, his combinations of sculptural installation and film play with illusion and reality to perceptually disorienting and mystically exciting effect. Hours and admission: See above (Johnson).

Galleries: Uptown

"SALLY MICHEL, MILTON AVERY: A PORTRAIT," Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550 (through May 30). Also known as Mrs. Milton Avery, the widow of the artist, Sally Michel used her own name as a painter in her own right. This warm memorial tribute to Michel and Avery mounts a group of informal, private portraits of each artist done by the other. A wall of Avery by Michel, who died in January, shows him painting, napping, smoking, reading, thinking, leaning. A facing wall of portraits by Avery (1885-1965) shows Michel smiling, mothering their daughter, March, wearing a new hat and painting a portrait of her husband. This small show is an engaging celebration of a highly productive relationship (Glueck).

GEORGE SEGAL, "Bronze," Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 744-7400 (through June 14). There was always a Hopperesque ennui about Segal's plaster-cast figures. Late works cast in bronze are truly lugubrious. Four chunky women in balletic poses perform a ponderous dance; three dark gray people with the closed eyes of sleepwalkers meet under one-way street signs pointing in two directions; and in "Street Crossing," seven blind souls painted white wander aimlessly in a modern purgatory (Johnson).

HELEN TORR, "Out of the Shadows," James Graham, 1014 Madison Avenue, at 78th Street, (212) 535-5767 (through June 8). Torr, the wife of Arthur Dove, was an accomplished if not highly original painter and an excellent draftsman in her own right. This retrospective, organized by Anne Cohen DePietro of the Heckscher Museum on Long Island, is studded by gems in a range of styles, from ecstatic Dove-esque abstractions to delicate yet sumptuous still lifes that Georgia O'Keeffe might have envied (Johnson).

* "WEAVING CHINA'S PAST: THE AMY S. CLAGUE COLLECTION OF CHINESE TEXTILES," China Institute Gallery, 125 East 65th Street, (212) 744-8181 (through June 7). This gallery has a sterling record in presenting small, fine-tuned scholarly shows and this one, imported from the Phoenix Art Museum, exactly fits the description. With precious examples of silk brocades, tapestries and embroideries, including Buddhist ritual pieces, dating from the Jin to Qing dynasty, it gives a vivid sense of the material past in a powerful imperial culture (Holland Cotter).

Galleries: 57th Street

JOHN CEDERQUIST, "Furniture That Builds Itself," Franklin Parrasch, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 246-5360 (through June 7). Mr. Cederquist's beautifully made woodworks are simultaneously functional pieces of furniture and zany cartoons in two and three dimensions. With painted Mickey Mouse arms wielding drills and planes as if in the act of building, these funky sculptures are deceptively whimsical meditations on the mind's construction of reality (Johnson).

"HEAVEN AND HELL," Barbara Mathes Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 752-5135, (through June 6). This high-low meditation includes Stephen Balkenhol's rough, wooden Everyman twins as an angel and a devil; a leering antique silver Satan photographed by Robert Mapplethorpe; montages illustrating Dante's "Inferno" by Robert Rauschenberg; a big celestial photograph by Thomas Ruff; a terrestrial paradise photographed by Thomas Struth; painful signs by Jenny Holzer; and the convergence of an angel and a manhole cover in a luminous nocturne by Joseph Cornell (Johnson).

HENRY PEARSON, "Selected Drawings 1959-1969," Alexandre Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 755-2828 (through May 30). Breathing, pulsating surfaces of labyrinthine whorls and lines, these small-scale abstract drawings in color and in black-and-white suggest rippling water, the combings of plowed land, fingerprints, the heavings and foldings of earth and ocean. Usually their intricate striations cover rectangular areas, but sometimes there are circular fields coursed by wavy, irregular edged bands of repeated colors. Among the 17 works in this small show, those in black-and-white are the more arresting. As taut and pithy as good poems, they have a rich presence (Glueck).

TOMAS SANCHEZ, Marlborough, 40 West 57th Street, (212) 541-4900 (through May 31). Making fluent use of charcoal and pastel, this Cuban-born artist evokes his country in idealized land and waterscapes -- colored and black-and-white -- in which clouds and cascades figure prominently. But their tranquillity is sometimes invaded by figures or tornadoes. Paradoxically, he also depicts vast garbage dumps that disfigure the land with masses of urban detritus. Despite the artist's proficiency, there is a frozen, static quality to these scenes. Perfect as they are descriptively, they have a stifled, lifeless quality that soon turns off the eye (Glueck).

"SCULPTURE," Grant Selwyn, 37 West 57th Street, (212) 755-0434 (through next Friday). This surprisingly good, all-star sculpture show includes two beauties by Donald Judd, one in magenta and gold, the of other buttery Cor-Ten; a vintage John Chamberlain in crumpled chrome, brick red and pink metal; a big natural sponge saturated in electric blue by Yves Klein; plastic water glasses rendered in sumptuous colored waxes, by George Stoll; and a delicate small mobile threaded through a surrealistic little chair, by Alexander Calder (Johnson).

TOM WESSELMANN, "The Great American 60's," Maxwell Davidson, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 759-7555 (through June 13). This selection of works from the 1960's includes one of the Pop Art master's classic Great American Nude apartment paintings -- real telephone and radiator included -- and seductive small studies of female body parts: pillowy lips, nubile breasts and coy painted toes (Johnson).

Galleries: Chelsea

JAY BATLLE AND PAUL PAGK, Thomas Erben, 516 West 20th Street, (212) 645-8701 (through May 31). Mr. Batlle, a sculptor, and Mr. Pagk, a painter, have extremely different sensiblities, yet somehow their dissonant meeting works. The sculptor creates ramshackle works, like a tree with sheet metal leaves that grows up through a funky wooden fire escape. The painter makes sensuous, optically subtle abstractions, in which linear patterns are embedded in fields of lush, glossy color (Johnson).

"RUDOLF BAUER, HILLA REBAY, ROLPH SCARLETT AND THE MUSEUM OF NONOBJECTIVE PAINTING," Gary Snyder, 601 West 29th Street, (212) 871-1077 (through May 31). The surprise of this exhibition is that Baroness Rebay, founding director of what became the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, was not such a bad painter. Bauer and Scarlett look like dull Kandinsky imitators, but a survey of Rebay's work on paper includes abstract watercolors that are remarkable for their richly worked, luminous personality (Johnson).

* ATUL DODIYA, "Broken Branches," Bose Pacia Modern, 508 West 26th Street, (212) 989-7074 (through May 31). The centerpiece of Mr. Dodiya's haunting New York solo debut show is an installation of nine tall glass-fronted wooden cabinets filled with well-worn objects, including old photographs, tools and handmade prosthetic limbs. The cabinets are copies of those found in a museum at Gandhi's birthplace, and the meticulously composed still lifes inside are political and personal portraits of the texture of India itself, a nation rich in social and spiritual resources but crippled by sectarian hatred. The show also includes a series of beautiful large-scale watercolors, which draw connections between India, where Mr. Dodiya lives, and the larger world (Cotter).

CHERYL DONEGAN, "Junk Space," Oliver Kamm/Apartment 5BE Gallery, 504 West 22nd Street, (212) 807-0420 (through May 31). An artist known for videos of her own improbable performances directs her attention elsewhere. "File," an eight-minute loop, is a blurry, wide-angle pan of striped fabrics and mirror reflections -- a vague, floating daydream about abstraction. The same subject matter appears in Cubistic paintings so wispy and pale they are barely there (Johnson).

MAIRA KALMAN, "Just Looking," Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-2410 (through June 14). Ms. Kalman's sweet, sometimes mildly acerbic gouache paintings suggest Alice Neel under the influence of Indian miniature painting. Working on paper with a fine brush and cheerful colors, the prolific children's book illustrator and New Yorker cover artist (co-creator of the "Newyorkistan" map) paints goofy people in parks, portraits of famous designers' dogs and a green plastic pail captioned "Dear Bucket" (Johnson).

"KARAOKE DEATH MACHINE," Daniel Reich, 308 West 21st Street, (917) 408-9097 (through June 2). This is more like a visit to someone's tiny, dark and incredibly cluttered apartment than to a gallery exhibition; actually it is Mr. Reich's tiny, dark and incredibly cluttered apartment-cum-gallery. A stream-of-consciousness salon-style installation of more than 100 small works by more than two dozen artists as well as many images lifted directly from commercial media, the show is uneven, to say the least. But it has a grainy video copy of an early film by Niki de Saint Phalle and an excellent title (Johnson).

BLAKE RAYNE, "August Evening Walkout," Greene Naftali, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 463-7770 (through June 8). There is one lightweight knockout of a picture in this exhibition of semi-abstract paintings in a style you might call postmodern Impressionism. Across the 10-foot-wide sky-blue expanse of "Radically Casual Fridays" stretch two strings of white, green and orange pennants (like those decorating a used car lot). A merger of Pop and Color Field, it's as ephemerally perfect as a sunny spring day in New York (Johnson).

NADINE ROBINSON, "White We," Caren Golden, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 727-8304 (through May 31). In her New York gallery debut, a conceptualist known for socially provocative speaker installations sets up suggestive tensions between Modernist aesthetics and vernacular semiotics. White, the color of Modernist purity and racial supremacy, is the main signifier, as in braided ruglike circles made of white synthetic hair from which small speakers emit sounds from the movie "Mahogany." It's an obscurely fraught allegory of high-low prejudice (Johnson).

CLAUDE WAMPLER, "Vive la France," Postmasters, 459 West 19th Street, (212) 727-3323 (through May 31). When the white lights go off and the purple ones come on, sequences of fluorescent paintings of women performing modern dances appear. They disappear when the lights change again, and the exhibition quickly fades from memory once one has left the gallery (Johnson).

JIM ZIVIC, Leslie Tonkonow, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-8450 (through May 31). Unlike the works of Andrea Zittel or Jorge Pardo, Mr. Zivic's industrial-chic home furnishings don't blur the line between art and design, nor are they meant to. His chocolate-brown cowhide rugs, side tables made from polished chunks of coal and seats of natural rubber have a certain sculptural panache, while remaining decidedly utilitarian (Johnson).

Galleries: SoHo

ROBERT BECK, "Once Across the Mason-Dixon," Susan Inglett, 100 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0573 (through May 31). This multimedia conceptualist has come up with a device that may sound gimmicky, but it casts a noirish spell. Looking into a classic children's toy, the View-Master, you see startlingly dimensional, photographic scenes that could be stills from a David Lynch movie: yellow-striped pavement veering into the night, a hitchhiker's extended arm, a vintage Lincoln in a field. There's no clear narrative, but there is a feeling of exhilarating dread (Johnson).

MICHAEL GOLDBERG, "Over the Moon," Lennon, Weinberg, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 941-0012 (through May 31). Mr. Goldberg's paintings of snarly, all-over line and rough patches of acidic color recall paintings from the late 1940's by Pollock and de Kooning, butthe mood is playful, comic and hedonistic rather than tragic, furious or angst-ridden. The painter sometimes overworks his canvases and they get muddy. The better ones have a looser weave in which different modes of attack are more clearly discernible, creating a bracing dissonance (Johnson).

* "THE STAGE OF DRAWING: GESTURE AND ACT," Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166 (through May 31). It's not easy to assemble a truly engaging show from a vast collection of drawings like that owned by England's Tate. But this one, selected by a British artist, Avis Newman, with Catherine de Zegher, director of the Drawing Center, really works. Not a tiresome institutional tour but a vividly personal one, it views drawing as "an open-ended and exploratory activity," with exhibits ranging from a 295-foot line on a roll of wrapped paper to precise renderings of 19th-century hairdos. The mix of artists runs from J. M. W. Turner to Andy Warhol; the juxtapositions reveal affinities across centuries and cultures (Glueck).

Other Galleries

ANN SPERRY, "30 Pieces/30 Years," Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion Museum, 1 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 824-2205 (through June 26). Since the early 1970's, Ms. Sperry has been bending, shaping and welding metal into metaphorically suggestive abstractions. The best works in this retrospective have an industrial surrealism similar to, though not as surprising as, that of Donald Lipski (Johnson).

Last Chance

* "BRONZEVILLE: BLACK CHICAGO IN PICTURES, 1941-1943," International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000 (through Sunday). For much of the early 20th century, waves of black migrants traveled from a no-hope rural South to a some-hope urban North. One of the places they went was Chicago, which with its steel mills and stockyards seemed like a good bet for finding work. There they lived for the most part in the huge enclave on the city's South Side called Bronzeville. Like New York's Harlem, for a while it was a success story; then, with the Depression, it went into decline. Now it is the subject of this exceptional, complex show of photographs made under the auspices of the Farm Security Administration in the early 1940's. Hours and admission: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $9; students and 62+, $6 (Cotter).

ALEXANDER CALDER, Van de Weghe, 521 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-6633 (through today). This sampler includes a huge mobile that is too big for the gallery's main room and a bright red nonmoving abstraction of a winged lion. Best are the smaller mobiles, some hung from the ceiling, some balanced on low structures on the floor. These harmoniously choreographed, Miroesque constellations of sweeping lines and biomorphic shapes might be Platonic models for an ecology of mind and soul (Johnson).

* "SCANNING: THE ABERRANT ARCHITECTURES OF DILLER & SCOFIDIO," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through Sunday). This retrospective of the work of Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio, New York's brainiest architectural team, surveys 21 projects in a variety of mediums, including buildings, building additions, product designs, temporary museum installations, commercial interiors, public art and theater design. Aberrance is the last label I would slap on Diller & Scofidio, even in ironic jest. Their typical procedure is to slam opposite concepts together -- outside-inside, public-private, transparent-opaque -- and then explore the richly nuanced terrain that emerges from the overlap. Holding opposites together is a primary function of classical art, and Ms. Diller and Mr. Scofidio are classicists in this dialectical sense. The good, the true and the satirical are their stock in trade. Beauty slips in, too. Hours and admission: See above (Herbert Muschamp).

* "KURT SCHWITTERS: COLLAGES, PAINTINGS, DRAWINGS, OBJECTS, EPHEMERA," Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444 (through today). The German artist Kurt Schwitters (1887-1948) made artful arrangements of found scraps -- torn photographs, ticket stubs, labels, newspaper clips and other discarded bits -- into abstract compositions that balanced colors, forms, textures and printed matter to dazzling effect. More than 60 of his works, Dada-oriented but also much influenced by Constructivism and Russian Suprematism, are brought together here in a museum-quality display that ranges in date from before 1920 to the late 1940's. One standout in this bountiful show is a gem from 1931, "Untitled (Red, Gray, Black)," a rigorously structured composition with all the elegant trappings of Suprematism-Constructivism brilliantly translated into "Merz," Schwitters's no-meaning name for his own visual language (Glueck).

JOAN SEMMEL, Mitchell Algus, 511 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-6242 (through tomorrow). Ms. Semmel made an enduring name for herself in feminist art history with paintings of her naked body viewed from her own subjective perspective. In new paintings, based on images of the artist with a camera taking her own photograph in a mirror, her nude self, painted with matter-of-fact realism, is considerably matured. One thinks of John Coplans's photographs of his own aging, corpulent body (Johnson).

AMY SILLMAN, Brent Sikkema, 530 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-2262 (through Wednesday). The artist brings her unconscious to the canvas in fanciful, watery, half-abstract, half-readable images that conjure up dreamlike lands and beings in a seemingly narrative flow. Boats, water, semblances of people with pipestem limbs and balloon heads, creatures and ghosts of creatures, wayward lines and markings together with descriptive ones, bursts of activity and empty passages inhabit these ephemeral works, welding some discernible influences into a language of the artist's own. Enshrining the artist's every wayward mood and thought, the work comes off as more than a little glib, not to say loosey-goosey. Still, with its bubbleheaded beings and oddities of place and event, it's not without charm (Glueck).

A House for the Summer? Rents Drop Around the Nation

BYLINE:  By WALECIA KONRAD

 BODY:
STILL haven't found a place for the summer? You're in luck. The economy has devastated much of the seasonal rental market around the country, which means there are great houses left for procrastinators. Whether you are looking for the whole season or just a week or two, homeowners out there are panicking. They want to make a deal.
 The reason for the downturn, say real estate agents from coast to coast, is as simple as supply and demand. Sales of second homes in popular vacation communities like Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts and the Hamptons in New York have exploded in the last three years. Buyers, looking for investments more stable than the troubled stock market, are taking advantage of record low mortgage rates. But this new crop of second-home owners are buying at peak prices, and many count on renting their new houses at least part of the season to help cover the mortgage and taxes. 
 The result is an increase in available rentals, just as worries over terrorism, the economy and job security have made potential renters jittery and indecisive. 
Here is a look at what is still available in popular vacation spots near four major cities, as of yesterday.

New York
In years past, the best of the Hamptons summer rentals were locked up just after the Presidents' Day weekend. Anyone who waited until May could still find something, usually the dregs -- old houses, shabby interiors, bad locations. But last year renters didn't show up until May, often picking up great houses for reduced prices from desperate landlords.
This year, after a disastrous Presidents' Day blizzard and a generally cold and nasty spring, renters waited even longer to make decisions. "This past weekend things finally picked up and now we've just about caught up with last year," said Diane Saatchi, the president of Dayton-Halstead Real Estate in East Hampton. "But before that we were having a lot of trouble getting homeowners and renters to make a deal."
Lower prices help. A one-story contemporary in East Hampton, with air-conditioning and a heated pool a block from the bay, was recently reduced from $36,000 for the season to $29,000, according to Bill Williams, an agent in the East Hampton office of Devlin McNiff Real Estate. Mr. Williams said the number of rental houses available in his area has grown 10 percent to 15 percent in the last two years. As a result, "really good houses are still available," he said. "And homeowners are still calling me asking to list their property." Another desirable house that is still available: a large four-bedroom on fashionable Huntting Lane in East Hampton, for $75,000 for July and August. "Normally something that nice would have been long gone, even at this price," Mr. Williams said.
The scene is the same on Fire Island. "It's much slower this year," said Bonnie Nolter, an agent with Red Wagon Realty in Ocean Beach who has several rentals still available for the season and for July and August. Last-minute bargain hunters can also find rentals in Saltaire. That is because the village has an ordinance against outdoor grilling, a rule that has become an issue in today's mayoral and trustee election. "If I have a prospective tenant, they would just as soon rent a house in another community rather than forgo barbecuing," said Grace Corradino, who owns Fire Island Living, a real estate company. As a result, she has a three-bedroom, two-bath house on the bay for the month of August available for $25,000 and a three-bedroom, one-bath cottage available for two weeks in August for $7,000.
In the Berkshire Mountains, renters have also been slow to sign contracts, said Scott Sawyer, an agent with Stone House Properties in Stockbridge, Mass. Houses usually rent for July and August and can cost anywhere from $2,500 a month for a small country cottage to $25,000 a month for the 7,000-square-foot estate house with mountain views that is still available. A three-bedroom contemporary with a guest apartment is still open for July and August for $12,000 a month, and a three-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath house is available for July and August at $8,500 a month.

Boston
Real estate agents on Cape Cod and Martha's Vineyard, two of the most popular beach destinations for Bostonians and other Massachusetts residents, are biting their fingernails wondering when the summer rental season is going to start in earnest. Like the Hamptons, Cape Cod is seeing plenty of empty houses and very few renters. "We've got a book of listings sitting here three or four inches thick," said Sheila Bolton, a broker with Foley Real Estate in Falmouth, Mass., last week. "I recently got a phone call from a homeowner who was desperately looking to rent the house she had just bought this year. I had to tell her that I've never seen it this bad."
Why the market collapse? "Some people blame the economy or the war; if it isn't one thing it's another," Ms. Bolton said. "Personally I think people have gotten greedy in the past few years and jacked up the prices too much."
That may be about to change. Ms. Bolton and other Cape Cod real estate agents estimate that homeowners are negotiating up to 20 percent off last year's rates. A five-bedroom, two-bath beachfront house, for example, is booked for all of August and part of July partly because its $3,500 weekly rate is less than last year's rate.
Prices are also dropping on Martha's Vineyard. Susanne Faraca, an agent at Kelleher Real Estate in West Tisbury, said she recently showed a potential renter several homes. "The woman was interested in several, but then came back to me and said she found a homeowner willing to take $800 off of her $4,800 two-week rental. That's a big discount. I couldn't match it."
Ms. Faraca said she had about a third more rental houses in her inventory than she did last year at this time. On the Vineyard, the increase is mainly attributed to a growing number of full-time residents who, watching property values skyrocket, decided to cash out. They sell to someone who needs the rent to cover the purchase costs and suddenly there are a lot more rentals on the market. "I might have a fabulous house on the water," Ms. Faraca said. "But guess what? Now there are 30 of those fabulous houses on the water. Five years ago there were only 15." For example, a five-bedroom house on the ocean with its own dock in Oak Bluff is available for all of July for $7,500 a week. Off the water, a three-bedroom in Vineyard Haven a short walk from town is available almost all summer for $2,300 a week.
If Cape Cod's legendary traffic jams and the Vineyard ferry schedule are not your thing, there are also plenty of rentals available in Mount Washington Valley in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Susie McDougal, a broker at Coldwell Banker Wright Realty in the village of Conway, N.H., said the rental market was "slower than usual but not worrisome." Seasonal rentals have picked up in recent weeks, she said. Ms. McDougal said she did have one attractive listing left, a three-bedroom with a deck, a sun porch and a large yard available from June 17 to Sept. 15 for $6,000. Meanwhile, there are plenty of weekly rentals available. They range from $600 for a woodlands cabin to $1,200 for a house on Silver Lake. "We try to keep it affordable," Ms. McDougal said. "That's part of why people come here."

Washington
For decades, people have escaped the summer heat of Washington and Baltimore by flocking to the Delaware and Maryland beaches. Until about three years ago the best of the weekly rentals in the Delaware towns of Rehoboth Beach, Dewey Beach and Bethany Beach and in Ocean City, Md., were snapped up by April, said Jim Waggoner, director of resort rentals at Long & Foster, a real estate and rental management company with more than 1,200 rental properties in Delaware beach towns. "But now the trend is to book later and later," he said. Mr. Waggoner said rentals were down anywhere from 9 percent to 20 percent from last year in his areas in the beginning of May, with the exception of Rehoboth Beach, which was running about even with last year. A flurry of activity in the last two weeks has brought those numbers up. As of yesterday, bookings in most areas had caught up to last year's and in Rehoboth Beach they were actually higher than at this time last year. Prices throughout the area, he said, are not declining, but they have stopped rising.
"During most of the 1990's, homeowners increased their rents 10 to 12 percent a year," Mr. Waggoner said. "Now, with this economy, that's over."
Available weekly rentals in Rehoboth Beach range from a seven-bedroom, five-and-a-half-bath house a block from the ocean for $4,500 to a five-bedroom, two-bath cottage in a woodland area for $2,400 a week, to a two-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath condominium six blocks from the beach for $850 a week.

Chicago
The brightest spot in this informal survey is Door County, Wis. Located on the easternmost point of the state, Door County is a peninsula surrounded by Green Bay and Lake Michigan that draws summer visitors mainly from the Chicago and Milwaukee areas. The rental business is actually better than it was last year, according to Andrea Lundquist, owner of Lundquist Realty and Vacation Rentals. She said that reservations were up about 10 percent and that prices were about the same as last year.
Door County covers a lot of ground, however, with almost 500 square miles and 250 miles of shore, and has housing that ranges from condos to estates. So there are still some rentals available. A three-bedroom, three-bath house called the Beach Road House, in Sister Bay, still has five weeks open in July and August. It is on a bluff overlooking the water and rents for $2,200 a week. The Elm Log Cabin (houses tend to have names in Door County), in Egg Harbor but away from the water, sleeps five comfortably and rents for $800 a week.

HEADLINE: McDonald's Chief Stresses Food Safety 

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

DATELINE: OAK BROOK, Ill., May 22 

 BODY:
In his first face-to-face meeting with shareholders, James R. Cantalupo, McDonald's new chief executive, tried today to play down concerns about mad cow disease in Canada and focus instead on his plan to revitalize the McDonald's brand.
 "McDonald's has tremendous experience in food safety," said Mr. Cantalupo, addressing shareholders at McLodge, a hotel on McDonald's corporate campus here. "We have a proven track record in dealing with concerns like this." 
 In recent years, sales at McDonald's restaurants in Japan and Europe fell sharply after outbreaks of mad cow disease. But so far, the company said, sales at North American operations do not appear to be affected by the discovery of a single case of the disease in a dead cow in Alberta. In Canada, McDonald's said sales increased a few percentage points at its restaurants on Wednesday, the day after the announcement.
Mr. Cantalupo, who worked at McDonald's for 27 years, came out of retirement in January to succeed Jack M. Greenberg. Because his predecessor was unable to reverse slumping sales, Mr. Cantalupo has focused much of his efforts since then on rebuilding the McDonald's brand. Like many burger chains, McDonald's has had declining sales in recent years as consumers have begun to favor healthier food, upscale restaurants and ethnic food.
To reignite interest in McDonald's, which though struggling is still the No. 1 hamburger chain in the nation, Mr. Cantalupo and his management team have pledged to slow the building of restaurants in favor of cultivating relationships with new and old customers. The goal, Mr. Cantalupo told shareholders, is to significantly improve customer service, food offerings and the overall cleanliness and appearance of restaurants. While some of the McDonald's menu will be eliminated, several products will be added, including McGriddles, which are breakfast pancake sandwiches. The company is also trying to shed its image as a purveyor of unhealthy food with new premium salads topped with warm chicken and Newman's Own salad dressing and healthier Happy Meals for children, which are available in some countries with the option of milk and sugarless juice instead of soda, and miniature bags of fresh fruit. 
The company will also reorganize its marketing campaigns to include greater participation from Ronald McDonald, update its hamburger seasonings and buns and trim operating costs by installing automatic beverage machines and self-ordering kiosks, executives said. 
Mr. Cantalupo also renewed his pledge to achieve 3 percent to 5 percent growth in sales and a 6 percent to 7 percent increase in operating income by 2005. He said the company would buy back shares and increase the dividend. 
After his presentation, shareholders used the time allocated for questions to offer suggestions on improving the everyday coffee and introducing specialty coffee shops in some stores.
Among the questions was one on how the company was being affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome. Mr. Cantalupo said only a small percentage of McDonald's business was in markets that had been affected by SARS. Business in those markets was rebounding, he said.
Mr. Cantalupo also sought to dispel rumors that the company's partner brands, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Boston Market and Donatos Pizzeria, are on the auction block.
"There's no for-sale signs on the partner brands," said Mr. Cantalupo, who insisted that the company was performing a strategic review of its entire business. "Everything is on the table, and we're looking at everything. We continue to do that."
Bob Ryan, a shareholder who worked as a McDonald's executive with Ray Kroc, the company's founder, was pleased. "This guy's really got the right idea," Mr. Ryan said of Mr. Cantalupo, adding, "I think we're on the right track." Mr. Ryan said that Mr. Cantalupo was following the ideas of the company's founders. Other shareholders doubted that Mr. Cantalupo would be able to return McDonald's to performance results it achieved in its heyday.
"If he's been in the company for 30 years, why is the situation the way it is now," Judith M. Koenick, a retired teacher from Maryland, said of Mr. Cantalupo and his plans. "Do I really think it's going to be any different? I'm not sure." Ms. Koenick came to the meeting to complain about dirty restrooms and the misuse of handicap parking spaces at her local McDonald's.
Analysts said it was too early to tell whether Mr. Cantalupo would be successful and if McDonald's, which said sales at stores open at least a year improved in April, is in the midst of a true turnaround.
"The question is, is he taking the right actions and is he taking them rapidly enough to achieve that kind of a turnaround in two years," said Darrell K. Rigby, the director of global retail at Bain & Company. "I have not yet seen the operating milestones that will allow outsiders to track whether he's on that path or not yet."

HEADLINE: Phone Companies See Their Future In Flat-Rate Plans Of Many Services 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS THOMPSON 

 BODY:
Fifteen years ago, Arthur C. Clarke in the science-fiction novel "2061: Odyssey Three" predicted a future as follows: "With the historic abolition of long-distance charges on 31 December 2000, every telephone call became a local one, and the human race greeted the new millennium by transforming itself into one huge, gossiping family."
 That future may be at hand, only a few years behind schedule, as a result of the telephone industry's declining economic fortunes, increasing competition and recent technological advances. Starting with MCI, which introduced its Neighborhood plan in April 2002, most leading phone companies -- AT&T, BellSouth, Qwest Communications, SBC Communications and Verizon -- have rolled out programs that allow customers in some states to make unlimited local and national calls for one flat monthly price. 
 These unlimited-use plans offer callers the advantage of predictability and less time spent checking monthly bills. They commonly cost $50 to $60 a month with services like voice mail and caller ID bundled in, making the price only slightly higher than the $48 that American households typically spend on local and long-distance calling, according to the Federal Communications Commission. 
The introduction of the flat-rate plan at MCI, formerly WorldCom, a company currently going through bankruptcy proceedings, is "exceeding expectations," according to a spokeswoman, Claire Hassett.
A spokesman for Verizon, Jim Smith, calls his company's program a "ripping success." 
Such positive responses from customers are good news for an industry that faces a number of incipient threats, including the loss of market share to calls made over the Internet, cellphone-addicted young customers who spurn land lines, and families who swap their second telephone lines for high-speed Internet connections. 
In its last quarterly statement, Verizon, for example, reported that its total telecommunications revenue was down 3 percent but that its bundled plans had helped prevent a greater loss.
Jeffrey Kagan, an Atlanta-based telecommunications analyst, calls the unlimited plans "the defibrillator for the industry." 
The move toward unlimited access plans stems from the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which created a regulatory process that allowed local phone companies to enter the long-distance market.
It has taken years for these companies, the so-called Baby Bells, to win federal approval in many areas, and they can now offer long-distance service in 41 states and the District of Columbia.
Over all, the Bell companies provide about 16 percent of residential long-distance service, according to the F.C.C.
In the meantime, the long-distance carriers -- which hold about 9 percent of the local service market, according to the New Paradigm Resources Group, a Chicago-based research firm -- are hoping that unlimited bundled programs will enhance their business. MCI, for example, provides 3.5 million customers with local service, but 2 million of those are signed up with its Neighborhood plan.
The Bells and the long-distance companies both see growth in bundled plans, made possible by technology and changing consumer habits, as a way to secure market share. 
Most calls now travel most of their journey over fiber optic lines that connect the whole country. A company's expense in routing a call depends very little on the distance the call travels, but largely on whether a call needs to travel across lines owned by other phone companies and the access fees charged for that use. In most cases, calling a friend across the country now costs your phone company about as much as calling your next-door neighbor. 
New customer habits also make selling unlimited plans easier. Consumers have become accustomed to paying a flat fee for other services like cable television, regardless of whether they watch it 3 or 30 hours a week. 
For generations, telephone companies have billed calls individually, taking into account both the geographical distance between those talking and the length of the call. But with the wireless phone industry selling plans with unlimited access, customers have become used to flexible plans and have started to demand them from their land-line providers.
"Wireless plans started to tear down the thinking of distance-dependent calling," says Charles Golvin, a senior analyst with Forrester Research. 
For phone companies, bundled plans create a predictable revenue flow and decrease the paperwork involved in separate billing systems and itemized phone bills. The plans have not been around long enough to show how they affect the churn rate, the percentage of a company's clients who leave for a competitor during a given period. Still, managers of most companies think that customers who buy these packages are more loyal.
"It's human nature," said Eileen Connolly, a spokeswoman for AT&T. "People have less desire to move away from you if you have all their business." 
The companies are also hoping that these customers will be more likely to buy other bundled services -- like cellular, digital subscriber lines for connecting to the Internet, and other future services.
The bundling strategy is particularly important as cable companies start to offer phone service along with high-speed Internet access. Mr. Smith of Verizon said he did not worry about customers who may end up paying less under unlimited-use plans than under standard plans. "We'll end up selling them more sooner or later," he said.
No one is certain how customer use will change as people switch to these plans. But evidence from other industries suggests that it will increase significantly. "Usage more than doubles on unlimited wireless-calling plans," said Berge Ayvazian, a senior research fellow at The Yankee Group, a market research firm, "and if broadband is always on, the Internet is always in use."
But there will be a limit, of course. There are only 24 hours in a day and unlimited-use plans for cellphones, land lines and broadband Internet access will all be competing for consumer time.

Market-Rate Rents Continue Downturn

BYLINE:  By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
Rents for market-rate apartments in and around New York City have continued to slip this year, according to rental brokers and landlords, but not as steeply as they had during their nose dive from a breath-catching peak two years ago.
 "It's not good for landlords, but it's certainly good for people entering the rental market," said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. 
 Dr. Hughes pointed out that along with the city's loss of more than 200,000 jobs since the start of the recession in 2001, a key factor in the rental market has been a 40-year low for mortgage interest rates. "That makes owning much more affordable and undercuts the rental market," he said. 
"There certainly has been slippage," said Nancy Packes, president of Halstead/Feathered Nest Leasing Consultants, which markets new buildings. According to its year-end report, the average rent for studios in Manhattan below 96th Street was $1,705 in December, down 16.2 percent from their peak of $2,036 at midyear 2001. After surveying about 200 leases handled by her company so far this year, Ms. Packes said the average for studios now stands at $1,680, down 1.47 percent since December. 
In the one-bedroom category, the average Manhattan rent was $2,331 in December, down 18.4 percent from a high of $2,859 at the end of 2000. "And since January, the average has been $2,290," Ms. Packes said, a 1.76 percent slip since December. 
For two bedrooms, the average was $3,527 at the end of 2002, down 19.8 percent from $4,400 at the end of 2000. "So far this year the average has been $3,375, down $148, or 4.31 percent" since December, Ms. Packes said. 
A similar pattern was reflected in statistics gathered by Citi Habitats, a Manhattan brokerage firm that says it handles about 8,000 leases a year. According to Citi Habitats, the average rent for studios during April was $1,574, down 3.1 percent from $1,624 last December, and down 13 percent from the peak of $1,810 in April 2001. 
Rents for one-bedroom apartments averaged $2,200 in April, the report said, down 3.6 percent from $2,284 in December and 15.2 percent from $2,596 two years ago. For two bedrooms, the average was $3,350 in April, barely up from $3,344 in December, but down 16.6 percent from $4,020 in April 2001. And for three bedrooms, the average in April was $4,291, up 2.9 percent from $4,170 in December, but down 18.6 percent from $5,277 in February 2001. 
Pointing to the traditional boost in the market as college graduates seek work and rental housing in the city, Andrew Heiberger, the president of Citi Habitats, said, "I think the market has found its bottom." 
But Christopher Thomas, president for Brooklyn at the William B. May Company, was not so optimistic. "We have about 20 percent more inventory now than we had at this time last year, and that brings rents down," Mr. Thomas said. "There's so much vacancy because there's so much market-rate rental construction in Manhattan that still hasn't been absorbed." 
Mr. Thomas said that his company's statistics for Brooklyn Heights and Cobble Hill show that "rents for studios this year have ranged from $1,100 to $1,600; last year, they were $1,250 to $1,800." 
"For one-bedrooms," he said, "it's $1,300 to $3,000 this year; a year ago, $1,450 to $3,500. And two-bedroom apartments are currently $1,900 to $5,000; last year, $2,200 to $5,500."
Gerard Longo, president of Madison Estates and Properties in Brooklyn, said: "A one-bedroom in Park Slope that was renting for close to $2,000 two years ago is now around $1,800. A two-bedroom on Shore Road in Bay Ridge gets $2,800, down from $3,100 two years ago. And now we would even take $2,700." 
Across the Hudson River, along what some people now refer to as New Jersey's "gold coast," the Lefrak Organization owns 10 rental buildings with about 4,000 apartments. "Our rents went through big fluctuations after Sept. 11," said Jamie LeFrak, the company's executive vice president. "It came down and then stabilized." 
Currently, studios in those Lefrak buildings are renting for $1,250 to $1,350. "At their peak, they were maybe 5 percent more," Mr. LeFrak said. One-bedrooms range from $1,500 to $1,850, and were "7 or 8 percent higher at their peak, during the summer before Sept. 11," he said. "And two-bedrooms sort of follow, $1,850 to $2,400, down from $2,000 to $2,600."
Putting it in perspective, Dr. Hughes at Rutgers said: "We're coming off rents that were propelled to artificial heights during the boom years. So, in that sense, they are returning to more realistic levels."

HEADLINE: THE SARS EPIDEMIC: ECONOMIC FALLOUT; 
Market for Chinese-American Delicacy Plummets

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY 

DATELINE: MODESTO, Calif., May 17 

 BODY:
For many Chinese-Americans, no wedding banquet is complete without a serving of squab, a young pigeon that is slaughtered before it can fly. The tender meat symbolizes a lifetime of peace for the newlyweds and eating a bird represents being set free by their parents.
 For decades, sales have soared among squab farmers here in central California, home to the country's largest squab cooperative. Every week, the cooperative sends three refrigerator trucks to San Francisco's Chinatown, the biggest in the West. 
 "It is an expensive dish that when I was a child, we couldn't even afford," said David Deng, a chef in San Francisco.
But these days, the delivery trucks are rarely filled. More and more of the birds are packed away in cold storage at a processing plant here. The problem is not with the squabs, but with the empty restaurants in many Chinatowns across the West because of the fear of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS.
California has had more cases of SARS than any other state, with 68 suspect or probable cases reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
"We have double the number of birds in the freezer today than we did a year ago," Bob Shipley, president of the cooperative, the Squab Producers of California, said in a telephone interview. "I have been involved for 23 years, and it is the most severe hit I have ever seen."
For nearly two months, all types of Chinatown businesses have reported big drops in foot traffic because of SARS. Much attention has focused on losses by establishments that cater to tourists, with busloads of out-of-town visitors skirting Chinatowns. 
But the specialty market in squab, a dish not always popular with tourists, has been among the hardest hit in places like San Francisco and Los Angeles. It seems many Chinese-Americans are avoiding Chinatowns and doing without the delicacy.
"Everything dropped," said Michael Lau, a salesman at the Sun Duck Market in San Francisco's Chinatown, which counts 30 restaurants among its customers. "Even vegetables dropped."
Mr. Shipley said the squab cooperative had been successfully courting new customers, especially some expensive specialty restaurants where the bird has become a popular novelty item.
Poultry shops outside traditional Chinatowns also seem less affected by the slump, apparently because of the missing specter of SARS. Some of the market has also been sustained by the Chinese belief that eating the bird, which is typically deep fried, roasted or boiled in soup, has health benefits, including helping women become pregnant. 
But so far there are still more squabs than buyers, Mr. Shipley said.
"We had customers who didn't miss a Wednesday delivery for 20 years," he said, adding that since SARS emerged, "at one point, we didn't even send out a truck because nobody ordered."
"Is it catastrophic?," he asked. "No. Am I concerned? Yes, if it continues."
Outside Ming Kee Game Birds, a butcher shop in San Francisco, the owner, Stella Gong, tried to drum up business by shouting at passers-by, "Squabs -- $12 for two!"
Her shop offers live birds as well as frozen ones, including some from the cooperative here in Modesto. "Because there are a lot fewer customers, I have to reduce prices and canvass for business," Ms. Gong said.
Before the SARS outbreak in China, Ms. Gong said she would typically take delivery of 300 squabs a week. She would then sell most of them to restaurants in Chinatown. But this week, she said, she ordered just 175. And in a recurring sign of the times, she received a telephone call asking if she would deliver some of the birds out of town, this time an hour's drive across San Francisco Bay.
"I ask them why don't they come themselves," Ms. Gong said. "They said that they are really scared to come to Chinatown."
Mr. Lau, the Sun Duck Market salesman, said Mother's Day was a good indication of how bad the downturn had been. The holiday, he said, is typically big for squab sales, as Chinese-American families take their mothers out for dinner or splurge for a special meal at home.
But Mr. Lau said his shop sold only 25 birds this Mother's Day weekend, compared with 75 to 100 in previous years. "I know restaurants are putting money out of their pockets just to get by," Mr. Lau said.
The squab's problems have come at a difficult time for the poultry industry in California. Bill Mattos, president of the California Poultry Federation, said squab had been one of the exports hardest hit by restrictions imposed by Canada on poultry from the state.
The Canadians imposed the restrictions because of an outbreak of exotic Newcastle disease among chickens in Southern California. The poultry federation is trying to get Canadian officials to accept poultry from other parts of the state, like Modesto, where there have been no reports of the disease.
"The squab producers have always had a shortage," Mr. Mattos said. "This is the first time they have more than needed. They will get it sold, they just have to find another home for it."
Mr. Shipley said that sales had been slowly picking up and that he suspected that the worst was over. "I am trying to stay as optimistic as I can," he said. 
Though he would not disclose sales information about the cooperative, the 77-member farms and their main competitor, the Palmetto Pigeon Plant in Sumter, S.C., are said to account for about half of the squabs sold in the United States. Annual estimates of squab sales are two million to three million.
Tony Barwick, president of the South Carolina company, said squab farmers on the East Coast were not experiencing the Modesto farmers' problems because most Chinatowns in the East had recovered from the initial SARS scare.
"Right now, we are selling every squab we produce," Mr. Barwick said by telephone. "The West Coast is different. You have all that Vancouver traffic coming down, and all that air traffic from Asia. They always feel it worse."
But like many things related to the SARS outbreak, squab sellers across the country worry about the voracious rumor mill. One bad rumor, many fear, could send the squab industry everywhere back to mid-April, when deliveries to some Chinatowns came to a near halt.
Though a scientist from Canada this weekend told a gathering of the World Health Organization in Geneva that there was no evidence that animals were spreading SARS, there had been unsubstantiated rumors that eating certain foods could expose people to the virus.
When the Chinese news media first reported that possibility, some seafood shops in San Francisco had to throw away rotting fish for lack of sales, Ms. Gong said.

HEADLINE: Study Says China Is Decades Behind U.S. in Military Power 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
Despite its growing economic power, China is at least two decades behind the United States in military technology and ability, according to a report released yesterday by the Council on Foreign Relations.
 The report also says that China is far from becoming a global military power, and that the United States would ultimately prevail if a conflict over Taiwan broke out with China. 
 While China has the world's largest standing army and continues to acquire advanced weapons systems, the task force said China did not have enough advanced equipment to rival the United States. 
"There is a significant group of people out there who say that China is going to be a military super power and it will be an adversary to the United States. And it may well turn out that way, but not in the near future," said Harold Brown, who served as Secretary of Defense under President Jimmy Carter and was a member of the task force that drafted the report. Other members included John M. Deutch, a former director of central intelligence, and Thomas S. Foley, a former speaker of the House of Representatives.
In recent years, some military experts have warned that China poses an imminent threat to the sovereignty of Taiwan. Those experts fear that the United States is underestimating China's military strength and China's resolve to reunify Taiwan with mainland China, possibly through a surprise military attack.
The report took issue with those theories, saying that even though China has become a center for software and semiconductor research and its acquisition of advanced weapons systems should not be underestimated, the United States clearly has superior air, naval and technological power. It added that this military lead could last for decades.
The task force also said it was unlikely that China would attack Taiwan. The Chinese military buildup, the task force said, was more likely a way to coerce Taiwan into negotiating reunification.
Critics, however, denounced the report, saying that it underestimated how rapidly China was modernizing its military capabilities and positioning itself to dominate the South China Sea.
"It's sort of a feel-good report," says John Tkacik, a fellow at the Heritage Foundation in Washington. "It doesn't jibe with a Pentagon report last year. And it's a mistake to underestimate the Chinese ability to amass a high quality military force close to their shores."
Many military experts believe that China is seeking to dominate the region. They say China spends an estimated $60 billion a year on its military, second only to the United States.
Some experts want the United States to help strengthen Taiwan's military, and to be prepared for a defense or rescue mission.
Richard D. Fisher Jr., a visiting fellow at the Center for Security Policy in Washington, also said the report missed the point about Taiwan.
"The basic purpose of the report is to convey that there is not yet enough Chinese power to threaten American security interests at this time. But China doesn't need American-level military technology to beat us to the punch in Taiwan."
Members of the task force, however, said their findings were not cause for alarm, but for a more calm, judicious response, since China does not yet appear to be capable of matching American military might.

HEADLINE: House Passes Bill Extending Aid to Jobless By 13 Weeks 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22 

 BODY:
The House overwhelmingly passed a bill tonight to extend jobless benefits by 13 weeks for workers who exhaust their state benefits this year. Those workers' benefits would have begun expiring next week under current law.
 The proposal would both help many of the nation's large number of long-term unemployed workers and could muffle Democratic attempts to use the issue for political advantage. After criticizing Republicans in recent weeks as eager to cut taxes for the affluent but reluctant to extend unemployment benefits, Democrats said today that the measure did not go far enough but that they would support it. 
 The Senate is expected to take up the measure on Friday, and President Bush supports it, Claire Buchan, a White House spokeswoman said. The bill passed the House 409 to 19 with only Republicans opposing it. 
At a $7.9 billion cost, the extension will affect the 2.1 million workers who will exhaust their state unemployment benefits, which typically last 26 weeks, from June 1 to the end of the year, according to a Congressional estimate. The government will recover about $1.4 billion in taxes paid on the benefits.
The bill does not extend benefits for workers who have already used up their state benefits and the federal benefits they have received as part of one of the two extensions enacted since last year.
"When you're experiencing job weakness, it's a time when you want to be temporarily generous," Representative Jennifer Dunn, Republican of Washington, said today, repeating a phrase used on Wednesday by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, in describing his view of the ideal unemployment-insurance system. "But you do not want to create a program where people lean on unemployment" insurance.
"You want people to go out and get jobs," she said.
Ms. Dunn, a sponsor of the bill, was among the moderate House Republicans who pushed for the extension, which had broader support in the Senate.
The nation is in its worst hiring slump in 20 years, with more than two million jobs lost since employment peaked in March 2001. At 6 percent, the jobless rate remains lower than it was during other recent downturns, but many of the job losers of the last two years have remained out of work for months. 
The portion of unemployment-insurance recipients who exhausted their state benefits recently reached 43 percent, its highest level on record, according to the Labor Department. 
The average benefit is now about $260 a week, according to the National Employment Law Project, which represents jobless workers. 
For unemployed workers in six states considered to be particularly hard hit by the economic slowdown, the bill would provide an extension of 26 weeks, rather than 13. The six states, designated under a complicated formula, are Alaska, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Washington. 
Democrats criticized the formula, saying that it excludes workers in states with some of the highest unemployment rates in the country, like California, Michigan and Utah.
Some also said the extensions for all states should be longer than 13 weeks, as they were during the downturn of the early 1990's. In the House and Senate, Democrats have proposed a 26-week extension, saying it would help more than one million people who have already exhausted their federal benefits.
"They're really not dealing with a significant part of the problem," Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, said of Republicans. "People can't get jobs. It's not like they're not looking." 
Ms. Dunn said Congress would extend benefits again if the economy did not improve in the coming months. 
In his testimony on Wednesday before the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, Mr. Greenspan praised jobless benefits but said extensions should be kept brief to give people an incentive to find new jobs.
Under the most recent extension, which Mr. Bush signed in January, workers who exhausted their state benefits before May 31 were eligible for an additional 13 weeks of payments. The House bill would push the deadline to Dec. 31.

HEADLINE: There Is Enough Electricity For Summer Cooling, if . . . 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
As people in and around New York City prepare to rev up their air-conditioners, the electricity industry says there will be enough power to keep all that cool air pumping all summer. Probably. Unless something happens. Like it gets really hot.
 A report released yesterday by the organization that operates the state's high-voltage power system said that the supply of electricity in the city should be "marginally adequate" if temperatures are normal. 
 But the organization, the New York Independent System Operator, warned of problems if there is "a repeat of the 2002 summer heat waves, or increased generation and/or transmission outages."
At a news conference yesterday, William J. Museler, the president of the system operator, said, "New York City does have what it needs, but it does not have any excess."
A similar warning was sounded earlier this month by the North American Electric Reliability Council, a related national electricity group. It said that while the rest of the country has enough power to meet its needs, that is not necessarily the case in southwestern Connecticut, New York City and Long Island.
In the metropolitan region, transmission systems cannot easily bring in all the power needed, and the amount of power generated within the area is also limited. So while local utilities try to develop long-term solutions, their spokesmen said in interviews, they are relying on various stopgap measures to squeak through the summer surge in demand for power.
The Long Island Power Authority, for example, is adding another small generating plant this summer, its fifth in two years, said Richard M. Kessel, the authority's chairman. It also has several programs to cut residential and business power use during peak times.
So while the situation on Long Island is better than it was a couple of years ago, he said, "the worry is that if you have an extremely hot summer and a major piece of equipment goes down, things are going to be extremely tight."
Little more than a year ago, some energy experts were saying that the city and surrounding areas had all the power they needed, and more. Those forecasts were based in part on the assumption that the softening economy would mute any increases in the demand for power.
It did not quite work out that way. Last summer, power use in New York City set a record of almost 17.5 million megawatt hours, an increase of almost 4 percent from the previous year, according to Consolidated Edison.
And demand is likely to continue to increase this year, said Michael Clendenin, a Con Ed spokesman. "Our load-growth forecast is 250 megawatts above last year's peak," he said, adding that the increase was being driven by a growing number of air-conditioners, an increase in housing units and population, and perhaps a decline in summer travel.
The company said it would meet its regulatory requirement to be able to provide 8,816 megawatts in the city, but only by using programs that induce big power consumers to cut back when necessary. The rest of the power the city needs -- at its all-time peak last July 3 it used 12,086 megawatts -- flows into the city from other areas over transmission lines.
While there were several blackouts in parts of the city last summer, Mr. Clendenin said those were not related to supply shortages, but were caused by equipment problems
The tight supply of power may also help drive up electricity prices, some industry experts said. "The entire state of Connecticut is seeing it," said Frank Poirot, a spokesman for Connecticut Light and Power. The price increases, he said, are coming from new "congestion charges," which penalize utilities -- and ultimately consumers -- for inadequate transmission capacity.
The company is adding two generators and installing new technology. But, Mr. Poirot added, "If one transmission line goes out on a hot day, if one power plant goes down, we could find ourselves in serious trouble."

HEADLINE: Canada Quarantines Six More Ranches in Mad Cow Case 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS with SANDRA BLAKESLEE 

DATELINE: WANHAM, Alberta May 22 

 BODY:
Tracing the winding trail of a single cow found to be infected with mad cow disease, Canadian agricultural officials quarantined six more cattle ranches today across two northern prairie provinces where she and her offspring had lived, in an effort to stem mounting economic damage.
 Canadian leaders and health authorities continue to express confidence that the first outbreak of the disease in Canada in a decade is a limited event. But they were hard-pressed to answer lingering questions about where the cow was born and where, how and when it contracted the disease. 
 Officials today suggested that the Black Angus cow, which was either 6 or 8 years old, was probably born in Canada, which would make it the first homegrown case in North America. 
"The risk to human health is low," said Dr. Claude Lavigne, a senior official for the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.
Still the uncertainties that have swirled around the single cow, which had been slaughtered in January but not tested for mad cow disease until last week, prompted Russia, Singapore and Indonesia today to join the United States, Japan, Australia and a raft of the other nations in banning imports of Canadian beef.
The cattle industry represents $7 billion in annual sales and is the source of tens of thousands of jobs in western Canada. Packing plants and auction markets have ground to a near halt through much of the country since the announcement Tuesday of the outbreak of the disease, technically known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or B.S.E.
The Canadian Beef Export Federation estimates that Canada is losing $8 million a day because of the scare. So far, about nine herds have been quarantined.
The stock prices of Canadian and American beef and restaurant companies have been hit hard out of fear that consumers could turn away from hamburgers and steaks, as they did in Britain and much of Europe in the 1980's and 1990's when outbreaks led to the slaughter of 3.7 million cattle. About 130 people, mostly British, died from a human version of mad cow disease called new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which scientists believe can be caused by eating infected beef.
Authorities began slaughtering 150 cows Wednesday from a ranch here that owned the sick cow, and tests of those animals are expected to show by early next week whether the infection is more widespread than authorities now believe. 
It is all part of a painstaking effort to trace where the cow and five or more of its calves have lived. About seven herds in Alberta have been located so far, and another two in neighboring Saskatchewan.
The effort has been set back by an incomplete paper trail for the cow, which has lived on at least six ranches. Some or all of her progeny have probably already been eaten.
"If there were better records, this type of investigation would be easier," Dr. Lavigne conceded. "The quicker we get all the answers, the quicker we can reopen our borders and reassure Canadian consumers."
Officials say they want to know what the animals in the herds in question were fed, because disease is usually spread through the consumption of feed contaminated with meat and bone meal made from animals that were afflicted with B.S.E. They also plan to look at the feed mills and renderers. The infected cow, last owned by an American-born Mennonite rancher who lives here, could well have been sick when it was purchased about three years ago. 
Ranchers in nearby Fairview said they were confident the crisis would blow over, and they would simply wait for beef prices to rebound before selling their cattle.
"This will be shown to be an isolated case," said Walter Doll, 68, owner of 47 head of Herefords. "It will be addressed and eradicated."
Those feeling the most immediate effects are the large feedlots along Alberta's border with the United States and the processors and truckers who depend on them. Inventories are mounting as prices at auction have dropped by two-thirds.
Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who was criticized for remaining on vacation during much of the SARS outbreak in Toronto last month, has been photographed through the week eating beef. He has guaranteed that Canada would conduct a thorough and transparent investigation.
While meeting with the French prime minister, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, today in Ottawa, he used the French official as an advertisement for Canadian beef.
"The prime minister of France will have beef today -- Canadian western beef," Mr. Chretien told reporters. "I had it yesterday and look how healthy I am this morning."
The United States has imported 900,000 head of cattle from Canada since January, when the infected cow was slaughtered. But no attempt will be made to trace any of these animals back to quarantined herds in Alberta and Saskatchawan, said Bobby R. Acord, administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service in Washington
Mr. Acord said that until Tuesday's ban, animal feed routinely went back and forth across the Canadian border.
"The only way the disease is transmitted is through feed," he said, so investigators need to find out what the animal ate when it became infected. "My sense is that it will be almost impossible to trace back. Imagine trying to trace back the food you ate six or four years ago. How could you ever do that?"

CORRECTION-DATE: May 24, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about attempts to determine when a cow on a Canadian farm was exposed to mad cow disease misattributed a comment made at a briefing in Washington that reporters monitored by telephone. It was Dr. Stephen Sundlof, an acting assistant deputy administrator for a unit of the Food and Drug Administration -- not Bobby R. Acord, administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service -- who said: "The only way the disease is transmitted is through feed. My sense is that it will be almost impossible to trace back. Imagine trying to trace back the food you ate six or four years ago. How could you ever do that?"
The article also misstated the number of cattle imported from Canada so far this year. The F.D.A. says it was 341,969 between January and March -- not 900,000.

HEADLINE: Indonesia Says It Will Press Attacks on Separatists in Sumatra 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, May 22 

 BODY:
The Indonesian government has vowed to push ahead with its military offensive against separatist rebels in Aceh Province, the Foreign Ministry said today. 
 The foreign minister, Hassan Wirayuda, told a meeting of ambassadors that Indonesia had pursued negotiations with the Free Aceh Movement for three years, and was not prepared to revive the talks. The government now felt justified in pursuing a military solution, the minister's spokesman, Marty Natalegawa said after the meeting today. 
 "We feel we have a clear conscience and have exhausted all efforts at dialogue," Mr. Natalegawa said. He accused the Free Aceh Movement of failing "to place a single weapon" in storage, as called for in a peace agreement reached last December. "They try to gain their legitimacy through the barrel of the gun," the spokesman said. 
The government's uncompromising position was expressed on the fourth day of an army offensive in Aceh Province. More than 30,000 soldiers and police officers have been deployed in Aceh to confront an estimated 5,000 guerrillas who have been fighting on and off for independence for nearly 30 years.
The province is rich in minerals and natural gas. Exxon Mobil operates a major natural gas plant in Aceh that exports to Japan and South Korea. One of the major grievances of the rebels is what they consider to be an unfair distribution of wealth by the central government. 
The army, which opened its campaign with a highly publicized drop of paratroopers on Monday, said it fought rebels in six different areas of the province today.
So far, the most intense damage has been suffered by schoolchildren -- an estimated 200 schools have been burned since Monday. Each side accused the other of destroying the schools. In some cases, schools that were rebuilt last year after being burned were burned again earlier this week. 
Western diplomats said it was most likely that the rebels had burned the schoolhouses as a way to single out government property. United Nations agencies said they would send 50 tents to Aceh for use as temporary schools. 
 Reuters reported early Friday morning that Indonesia's military said it had killed 38 rebels in Aceh since the offensive had started, but it added that the campaign was tough and that separatists were melting into the civilian population.
"Reports are still coming in, most of them from Bireun where fights are intensifying," the military spokesman in Aceh, Firdaus Komarno, told Reuters. He said another 11 rebels had been captured. 
The government's military action began after last-ditch talks in Tokyo, led by the United States, Japan and the World Bank, broke down last weekend. Indonesia presented nonnegotiable demands to the rebels at the talks, including a demand that they rescind their program of independence, diplomats involved in the talks said.
The Bush administration said it believed both sides could have done more to keep the talks alive, and encouraged the parties to convene again. Washington "does regard the problem of Aceh as one that is not amenable to a solution by use of military force," the State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said earlier this week. 
But Indonesian officials made little secret of their belief that in the aftermath of the war in Iraq, the United States, as well as other countries, would be less critical than in the past of the decision to resort to military force.
"Iraq may cause some pause in criticism against us among governments who readily used force" there, Mr. Natalegawa said. 
A senior adviser to President Megawati Sukarnoputri said in an interview that the American campaign against terrorism helped Indonesia justify its stance in Aceh. 
"This is a blessing of Sept. 11 -- that we now know terrorism has two sources, God and nation," said Rizal Mallarangeng, the adviser.
By sourcing terrorism to "nation," Mr. Mallarangeng said he meant that separatists like the Free Aceh Movement could be classified as terrorist groups and as such should be dealt with militarily. 
Indonesia has drawn little criticism from its neighbor, Australia, which now works more closely with the Indonesian military, particularly on terrorism, despite its history of human rights abuses and corruption. The Australian defense minister, Robert Hill, said the decision to resume military action in Aceh would not affect Australia's cooperation with the Indonesian special forces. 
"Indonesia has got the perfect right to maintain its internal integrity and we regret those who are in armed revolt," Mr. Hill said. 
The Indonesian government is also buoyed by opinion polls that show popular support for military action against Aceh. Many Indonesians believe that the separatist cause in Aceh encourages separatists in other parts of the country, including in Irian Jaya and the Malukus.

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES; 
Underground Economics Equals Money to Be Made

BYLINE:  By MICHIKO KAKUTANI 

 BODY:
REEFER MADNESS -- Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market
By Eric Schlosser
Illustrated. 310 pages. Houghton Mifflin Company. $23.
 What do marijuana, pornography and illegal immigrants have in common? They are all black market commodities, Eric Schlosser says in his new book, "Reefer Madness," and business in all of them is booming. 
 America's underground economy spans a vast array of enterprises -- from paying nannies off the books to running sweatshops and smuggling guns -- and much of its growth, Mr. Schlosser says, has occurred in the last 30 years. One study cited in this book credits it with 9.4 percent of the gross domestic product; another suggests that in 1997 Americans failed to pay about $200 billion in federal taxes that were owed.
While many conservatives attribute the growth in the black market to high income-tax rates and excessive government regulation, liberals tend to blame declining wages, unemployment and the business deregulation of the Reagan years. Mr. Schlosser suggests that "a growing sense of alienation, anger at authority, and disrespect for the law" have also played important roles in driving economic activity underground.
He says that "the underground is a good measure of the progress and the health of nations," that "when much is wrong, much needs to be hidden," that black market activity recedes "in importance when our public morality is consistent with our private one." In brief opening and closing chapters he raises such intriguing questions about the relationship between the underground and the mainstream, but in the remainder of the volume he fails to develop such ideas.
"Reefer Madness" feels exactly like what it is: a collection of three stand-alone essays, portions of which originally appeared in Atlantic Monthly, Rolling Stone, The New Yorker and U.S. News & World Report. The subjects of these three essays -- the growth of the domestic marijuana business, the plight of illegal immigrants working the strawberry fields of California and the development of the pornography business in the last half century -- are poorly situated within a larger narrative; connections among them are only cursorily explored.
The section titled "An Empire of the Obscene" -- which chronicles in tedious detail the career of a little-known pornography entrepreneur named Reuben Sturman, who was convicted of tax fraud in 1989 after a drawn-out battle with federal agents -- is a dry canned history of the American pornography industry, from the days of Playboy's greatest success through the age of seedy bookshops and movie theaters to the current era of amateur-run sex Web sites. It displays none of reportorial verve that Mr. Schlosser demonstrated in his last book, "Fast Food Nation," none of that volume's instinct for the telling detail. 
The people Mr. Schlosser focuses on -- like Nina Hartley, who is described as a radical feminist from "a long line of American iconoclasts," and Philip Harvey, a former Exeter and Harvard student who is described as having "the bearing of a patrician and the slightly rumpled, tweedy appearance of an Ivy League professor" -- are hardly representative figures in the pornography business, and yet the essay feels like a tired retread of familiar observations.
For the other two essays Mr. Schlosser has clearly done more legwork, and he uses his keen eye to give the reader a palpable sense of his subjects' experience: the painstaking and often nerve-racking work of being a marijuana farmer, and the physically debilitating and poorly recompensed job of being a strawberry picker, a job so unforgiving that it is done mainly by illegal aliens unable to find other work. 
Mr. Schlosser rails against the absurdities of a justice system that can give a person more jail time for marijuana possession than for murder, and he laments the unfairness of labor laws that rarely hold employers responsible for hiring (and often grossly underpaying) illegal immigrants.
But while Mr. Schlosser is impassioned and articulate about these inequities, he never pulls his thoughts together into a larger thesis about underground economies and their relationship to mainstream society. His book remains a slapdash if intermittently absorbing collection, a volume published, the reader hopes, simply to mark time between "Fast Food Nation" and another more substantial book.

HEADLINE: Chrysler Ends Plan to Build Canada Plant 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON With MICHELINE MAYNARD 

DATELINE: TORONTO, May 22 

 BODY:
DaimlerChrysler has canceled plans to build a $1.5 billion assembly plant in Windsor, Ontario, that would have produced a new line of small pickups under an innovative manufacturing arrangement with suppliers.
 The decision is a blow for Canada, which has been trying to attract new automotive investment but has lost out on several recent plant projects, which went to sites in Mexico and the southern United States. The last new assembly line built in Canada, at a plant for the Honda Motor Company in Alliston, Ontario, opened in 1996, and Canadian plants' share of new vehicles sold in North America has fallen to about 12 percent from 15.9 percent in 1999. 
 Dieter Zetsche, the chief executive of the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler, said today that the decision to shelve the Windsor project was forced on the company by intensifying competitive pressure and an excess of manufacturing capacity in North America. "It would not have been responsible to make any other decision," Mr. Zetsche said, adding, "We had to face reality." 
Chrysler's sales in the United States fell by 7 percent in the first four months of 2003 compared with the same period last year. Sales in April were down 10 percent.
However, the president of the Canadian Auto Workers Union, Buzz Hargrove, said the Canadian government and the province of Ontario were to blame because they did not provide enough financial support. "Chrysler needs this product; they want this product," Mr. Hargrove said, referring to the line of pickups the plant would have built. "If you put enough money on the table, you can make this a viable project."
DaimlerChrysler had asked the provincial and national governments for a package of incentives totaling 350 million Canadian dollars ($259 million). Mr. Zetsche said the company was "very satisfied with their contribution and their willingness to come to the party to try something new."
Allan Rock, the Canadian industry minister, said in a telephone interview: "We know this is a highly competitive process. We showed great flexibility in the discussions." Mr. Rock said he viewed DaimlerChrysler's decision as "an opportunity to live to fight another day."
The sporty pickup model intended for the Windsor complex would have been sold under the Dodge brand and marketed toward young first-time buyers. "From Day 1, we said this will be a very difficult business case because of the customers we're trying to attract and their buying power," Mr. Zetsche said.
According to Jeff Schuster, director of North American forecasting at J. D. Power & Associates, the Detroit research and consulting firm, "The outlook for the program is grim right now."
Earlier this year, Chrysler, the Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan and the Hyundai Motor Corporation of South Korea announced plans for a joint-venture factory outside Monroe, Mich., to build a new family of small engines that the companies would share. That project is unaffected by the plans for Windsor.
The Windsor complex would have included an assembly plant and several factories built on the grounds by suppliers to DaimlerChrysler. The suppliers would have been responsible for manufacturing functions like assembling the chassis or painting the vehicles. The suppliers would have fed parts to the assembly plant just when they were needed, keeping inventory to a minimum and lowering costs.
Plants arranged this way are in vogue in other parts of the world, especially in Europe, where DaimlerChrysler and its suppliers work side by side at the Smart car plant in France.
The new complex was meant to replace another assembly line in Windsor, known as Pillette Road, which builds large Dodge vans. In 1999, DaimlerChrysler promised to retool that plant after production of the vans end this year. But in 2002, the company said that, following a corporate restructuring, it had no new product for the plant to build.
A Chrysler official said today that about half the Pillette Road plant's 1,000 workers had accepted early retirement packages.
The new assembly plant would have employed about as many workers as the old, and suppliers were set to hire another 1,500 workers. The Canadian Auto Workers Union reached a special agreement with Chrysler last year that cleared the way for the project.
Mr. Zetsche said that Chrysler still intended to invest 2.6 billion Canadian dollars in its Canadian operations by 2005, including tooling up a factory in Brampton, Ontario, outside Toronto, to build a new series of rear-wheel-drive sedans starting next year. Now, the Brampton line is the only one that builds Chrysler Intrepid, Concorde and 300M sedans for the North American market.
Chrysler also operates a minivan plant in Windsor, an aluminum castings plant in Toronto and an auto trim factory in Ajax, Ontario.

HEADLINE: The Green Old Party? 

BYLINE:  By William K. Reilly; William K. Reilly, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in the George H. W. Bush administration, is president of Aqua International Partners and chairman of the World Wildlife Fund.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Lee Atwater, who was the Karl Rove of George H. W. Bush's 1988 presidential campaign, once explained to me why he supported one of my controversial decisions as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency: "To me," he said, "your appointment is about suburban women. We need 'em. And they care a lot about your issue."
 As Christie Whitman, the most prominent suburban woman in the Bush administration, steps down at E.P.A., the coverage primarily concerns the issues on which she was overruled. This ignores some of her significant achievements -- the "brownfields" legislation that will return thousands of derelict urban sites to productive use, and the decision to reduce the pollutants from diesel fuels. Yet again a Republican administration is widely seen as unfriendly to the environment, and its E.P.A. administrator as a casualty of neglect. 
 There are political strategists within the party who say it doesn't matter, that environmentalists won't credit a Republican administration no matter how green, and certainly won't vote for one. That may well be true. Nevertheless, there are many good reasons for the Bush team to give the environment a higher priority.
For three decades polls have consistently revealed lopsided majorities -- 80 percent-plus -- in favor of maintaining or strengthening clean air and water laws. Whether people vote the environment or not, and I admit most don't, they still want it protected and improved.
The problem, of course, is that vigorous environmental protection involves regulation, which is suspect if not anathema to many conservatives. And E.P.A. decisions necessarily hit elements of the Republican base hardest: manufacturers and other businesses, farmers, land developers. In fact, the first thing an E.P.A. administrator learns is not to antagonize more than one major industry at a time: if big oil is to be hit this week, big autos had better be deferred until next week.
Nonetheless, there are several fronts on which the Bush administration could address growing problems that not only affect people around the world, but also threaten American economic productivity.
For example, I agree that the Kyoto protocol on greenhouse gases, as drafted, is incomplete. However, the United States could come back to the table and reshape the protocol. A sustained effort to make realistic and affordable United States greenhouse gas reductions, accompanied by mandatory monitoring and reporting of emissions by our utilities and other major emitters, would have the support of key United States companies. American re-engagement in Kyoto could also help prompt fast-growing developing countries like China, which are not now constrained by Kyoto, to sign on.
New studies have come out with shocking information about the depletion of the world's oceans, driven in large part by European subsidies to fleets and the scouring of the seas by Japan and other countries. It would benefit America's fishing industry, as well as the planet, to push for new marine sanctuaries and new international conservation agreements to end overfishing and phase out subsidies.
America's lakes and estuaries are major sources of drinking water and vital economic generators through tourism. Washington could do more to get states, localities and nongovernmental organizations to reduce pollution runoff, control overfishing, preserve wetlands and protect shorelines. Especially vulnerable are Chesapeake Bay, Long Island Sound, the Gulf of Mexico and the Great Lakes.
And while the Bush administration has played a serious role in conservation efforts in the Everglades and national parks, it could build on that to preserve more of our country's special places. For one, it could give more support to local land trusts, which can help keep family farms and ranches in business while ensuring that the land won't be turned into subdivisions.
To suburban mothers -- not to mention young people, Europeans and much of the rest of the world -- to be anti-environment is to be on the wrong side of history. The Bush administration can reclaim Republican leadership on an issue that should not be seen as belonging to one ideology or one party.

HEADLINE: Bush Cuts Taxes but Lets Reform Ideas Die 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
TAX cuts come and go. It is tax reform that endures.
 George W. Bush clearly wants to be remembered as the second Ronald Reagan, not the second George Bush, and this year's tax proposal at first appeared to be a move in that direction. 
 Mr. Reagan cut taxes at the beginning of his term, but in later years he went the reform route, in 1986 pushing through a plan that really did simplify the tax law while getting rid of a generation of tax shelters that had brought the tax system into disrepute. 
Unlike the first President Bush, Mr. Reagan also made it clear that he did not much care about spiraling budget deficits, except as a reason to oppose spending he did not like anyway.
The current president seemed to be following the Reagan script. His dividend taxproposal -- to stop taxing dividends that are paid out of profits on which corporations have already paid taxes -- offered the hope of real reform in corporate America.
First, it would reduce the incentive for corporations to borrow money rather than issue stock -- an incentive that comes because interest payments are tax deductible while money paid in dividends is taxed twice, once at the corporate level and once when investors receive it. The overleveraging of America makes companies more vulnerable in bad times and could leave many gasping if interest rates ever rise sharply.
Second, it dealt, in a clever way, with the reality that companies have been doing a better and better job of avoiding corporate income taxes. While the proposal did nothing to close the loopholes that have come to exist -- or the tax strategies that the Internal Revenue Service has trouble identifying, let alone stopping -- it did raise the possibility of a market solution.
Had Mr. Bush gotten what he said he wanted, companies that did not pay taxes would not have been able to hand out tax-free dividends. Investors would have reasons to prefer tax-paying companies. It would become clear to the public which companies regularly managed to make lots of money and not pay taxes. Eventually some corporate loopholes might have been closed.
To be sure, not everyone liked such reforms. Liberals complained that the major beneficiaries would be people who collect dividends and noted that they tended to be richer than the average taxpayer. Some thought it made more sense to let companies deduct dividend payments while still taxing the recipient. People concerned about slow economic growth argued that eliminating dividend taxes would provide little if any stimulus.
But the debate did not turn on such arguments. Instead, an artificial number -- $350 billion -- became the key. To get that number, various parts of the final bill will expire as early as 2005. Dividends are to be taxed at 15 percent for most taxpayers, less than half the current rate, until 2008. Then they will revert to current levels.
There is no meaningful reform. Dividend tax rates are to be cut even for companies that avoid paying corporate income taxes. Corporate tax shelters may continue to proliferate. Companies will have little incentive to stop borrowing and issue stock instead. There may even be a rush by some companies to borrow money to pay dividends before the tax rate might go back up.
Pam Olson, the Treasury's assistant secretary for tax policy, argued yesterday that there is reform in the bill, thanks to the temporary equation of capital gains and dividend tax rates. But it will still be more tax efficient for companies to buy back stock rather than pay dividends. That change is likely to have minimal effect.
Mr. Bush is on his way to outdoing Ronald Reagan in cutting taxes and raising budget deficits. But when it comes to tax reform, he appears to have backed down without really trying.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS; 
Home Builders and Tobacco Companies Lead a Rally

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday on optimism that earnings growth would pick up as a survey of business economists reinforced the Federal Reserve chairman's statement that the economy might accelerate.
 The Altria Group contributed the most to the advance in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average after Credit Suisse First Boston recommended buying shares of the company, the parent of Philip Morris, in the wake of a court ruling favorable for tobacco companies. 
 Home builders including Centex and the Pulte Corporationsurged to 52-week highs after Freddie Mac, the buyer of mortgages, said 30-year mortgage rates were the lowest ever.
"The market is undervalued relative to interest rates," said Edward Hemmelgarn, who manages about $1 billion as president of Shaker Investments in Cleveland. "You can buy the best names at some pretty great prices, and earnings have been growing." 
The S.& P. 500 gained 8.45 points, or 0.9 percent, to 931.87, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 77.59 points, or 0.9 percent, to 8,594.02. The Nasdaq composite index climbed for the first time in five trading days, advancing 17.68 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,507.55.
Two stocks rose for every one that fell on the New York Stock Exchange, while eight gained for every five that dropped on the Nasdaq.
The economy will expand 3.6 percent in the second half and in all of next year, according to the National Association for Business Economics. That would be the fastest pace since 2000.
In testimony to Congress on Wednesday, the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, said a recovery in financial markets and gains in productivity "augur well for the future." The S.& P. 500 has rallied 16 percent since March 11, while the Dow has risen 14 percent.
Stocks gained even after a government report showed more workers applied for initial unemployment benefits last week. Jobless claims climbed to 428,000 from 421,000 the previous week.
Some investors said they were more focused on the government's efforts to increase growth. Republican Congressional leaders reached agreement late Wednesday on a $318 billion plan to reduce taxes over 10 years.
"The market doesn't buy what's happened; it buys what's going to happen," said Ian Rogers, who helps invest $6 billion at Strong Capital Management. Congress is "moving along on this budget stimulus package, and that's a positive thing."
Altria rose $2.75, or 7.2 percent, to $41.05, a day after a Florida appeals court threw out a $145 billion punitive damage award against tobacco companies.
Pressure on the companies from product liability lawsuits will abate over the next 12 to 18 months, wrote Andrew Conway, a Credit Suisse First Boston analyst, in a note to clients. He upgraded Altria to outperform from neutral.
The company's smaller rival, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings, added $1.03, or 3.1 percent, to $34.31. Judy Hong, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, raised her rating on tobacco stocks to attractive from neutral, citing reduced risk from lawsuits.
Centex, the largest home builder in the United States, rose $4.23, or 6 percent, to $74.30. Pulte, the parent of Pulte Homes, advanced $2.80, or 4.7 percent, to $63, and KB Home climbed $4.15, or 8.1 percent, to $55.36. All were record highs.
The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 5.34 percent this week from 5.45 percent, Freddie Mac said.
Dynegy surged 31 cents, or 6.8 percent, to $4.88. Fitch Ratings removed the company from its rating watch list, citing lower near-term default risk on its debt.
Treasury bond prices rose yesterday. The price of the 10-year note climbed 22/32, to 102 19/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 3.32 percent from 3.40 percent.
And the 30-year bond jumped 1 16/32, to 117 30/32. Its yield dropped to 4.27 percent from 4.35 percent.

HEADLINE: Officials Want Federal Bailout to Find Its Way to Localities 

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22 

 BODY:
New York State stands to receive at least $2 billion from an aid package that Congressional leaders have put together to help states grapple with the worst fiscal crisis they have faced in decades, lawmakers announced today.
 In all, the package calls for providing $20 billion to state governments over two years. Half the money is set aside to help them cover budget shortfalls; the rest would reimburse them for rising Medicaid costs. 
 The bailout money was part of a larger tax-cut bill that House and Senate leaders agreed to on Wednesday night. The money was included to win the minimum number of votes needed to get the politically charged tax cut, totaling $318 billion over 10 years, through a divided Senate. 
Both New York senators, Charles E. Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton, have said they will not vote for the tax-cut bill, arguing that it will do little to jump-start the economy, as Republicans contend.
But like other Democrats, Mr. Schumer and Mrs. Clinton have argued for months that any tax-cut package Congress approves this year should also include money for states and localities struggling to close budget gaps.
The infusion of federal aid could not have come at a more opportune time for New York. It is facing a financial crisis marked by anemic tax collections and the prolonged sluggishness on Wall Street.
George E. Pataki, the three-term Republican governor, proposed a budget plan in January that cut state aid to schools and sharply curbed the money the government now spends on health care to help close an $11.5 billion deficit.
But the state's two top legislative leaders, afraid that those cuts on core state services would foist huge property tax increases onto localities, drafted their own budget over the objections of the governor. True to his word, Mr. Pataki then vetoed the Legislature's $92.8 billion budget. But for the first time in two decades, the Legislature then overrode Mr. Pataki's vetoes of its spending plan.
In doing so, the lawmakers revived a budget that increases state taxes to restore billions of dollars in spending on schools, hospitals, nursing homes and localities. Fiscal purists said that both the Legislature's and the governor's budget plans were flawed, mainly because each relied on $4.2 billion in borrowing to pay for day-to-day operating costs, which would lead to deficits in later years.
Under the plan announced today, New York will receive $1.4 billion from the $10 billion set aside to help states and localities cover additional Medicaid costs. The $1.4 billion will be divided between the state and local governments; New York City stands to receive about $270 million.
Of the $10 billion set aside for so-called fiscal relief, New York will get about $650 million. But none of the money will go to cash-starved local governments, including New York City. Instead, the money will go directly to state officials in Albany, who can decide whether to pass any money to local governments, according to lawmakers.
By contrast, a similar fiscal relief package approved by the Senate last week would have given $6 billion to states and $4 billion to local governments. New York City, in turn, would have received approximately $100 million under the Senate plan, according to estimates provided by city lawmakers on Capitol Hill.
As the details of the bailout package were being negotiated today, lobbyists for New York City and other localities urged lawmakers on Capitol Hill to insert a provision guaranteeing that localities would get a share of the money designated for fiscal relief. But as things now stand, it is unclear how much money, if any, Albany will send to localities.
Edward Skyler, a spokesman for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, said the mayor was troubled that Congress did not guarantee that some of that money would go to localities like New York City. "It's very disappointing that cities have been cut out of the aid package since municipalities like New York are bearing the brunt of the economic slowdown and have a lot less flexibility than states do to solve their fiscal problems," Mr. Skyler said.
In separate interviews late this afternoon, Mr. Schumer and Mrs. Clinton urged lawmakers in Albany to provide New York City and other local governments a substantial share of the money that Washington provides.
"The local governments are hurting as much as the state government and deserve these dollars," said Mr. Schumer, who said localities should get at least half the money.
Mrs. Clinton prepared a letter to the governor, urging him to give local governments their fair share of the funds. She also noted that many local officials in New York have complained that Albany has refused to release other forms of federal aid that were intended for local governments. "The money needs to get to local communities," she said.
But it is anyone's guess how the governor and the State Legislature will respond, since the state faces its own financial troubles.
Kevin Quinn, a spokesman for the governor's budget office, said, "We're hopeful that these funds allow us to repair some of the damage that the State Legislature's fiscally irresponsible budget caused and also provide aid to local governments that are facing their own fiscal challenges." 
Mr. Pataki and Mr. Bloomberg have clashed over federal aid. In April, Mr. Pataki urged Congress to change a funding formula that sought to give New York City 80 percent of any antiterrorism money that the federal government sent to New York State. The governor wanted a larger share for the state, though he ultimately backed away from his demand after a storm of protests from city officials.

HEADLINE: U.S.-Utah Land Accord Incites Unlikely Critics 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY, May 22 

 BODY:
Two recent agreements between Utah and the federal government, making the state the latest template for the Bush administration's public lands policy, drew a rapid and predictable response from environmental groups around the country.
 They zeroed in on Gov. Michael O. Leavitt, a third-term Republican. They accused him of opening more pristine backcountry to off-road vehicles, economic development and natural resource exploration and of positioning himself for a cabinet-level job after the 2004 elections. 
 Mr. Leavitt said he had expected all of that. What he did not anticipate was a frontal attack from a trade group with a long history of friendly relations with the state.
The Outdoor Industry Association, a coalition of 1,100 retailers that holds Utah's biggest conventions, pumping $24 million into the state economy each year, has threatened to take its business elsewhere, to a state more sensitive to wilderness protections.
"Our biggest concern is that the outdoor recreation industry has become second-class for policy makers," said Frank Hugelmeyer, president of the association, whose members are part of an $18 billion industry. "We passionately believe that has to change. In Utah, recreation is one of the state's biggest economic drivers, particularly around public lands. But public policy does not recognize that, and it's a bit perplexing, to the point we're annoyed."
The turn of events stems from the fact that within two days last month, a pair of longstanding disputes between Utah and the federal government ended with negotiated settlements.
One agreement, which ended a bitter dispute over who has jurisdiction over historic rural roads, created a process to identify whether the state or federal government actually owns those roads. In effect, the agreement preserves the state's control over roads that were used for more than a century through 1976, a period before proof of ownership was needed for road maintenance and improvement. 
The second agreement ended a 1996 lawsuit brought by Utah against the Clinton administration after the president unilaterally identified an additional 2.6 million acres in Utah to be designated as wilderness, putting the land off limits to vehicles and development. At the time Utah already had 3.2 million acres set aside.
The new agreement underscores Utah's legal argument that only Congress and not the executive branch can make such designations. As a result the acres will now be open for wider use.
The two efforts reflect the strong desire of the Bush administration -- and of Western Republicans -- to place more control of public lands in the hands of states and counties and to make federal lands outside of parks and monuments more accessible for a wider range of uses. 
"These are attempts to bring common sense to contentious issues that have languished for far too long," said Eric Ruff, a spokesman for the Interior secretary, Gale A. Norton. Interior Department officials call the deals with Utah models for other states.
But here, the deals have caused Mr. Leavitt a bigger political headache than he expected. He had known he faced a balancing act between those in his party who want the federal government out of Utah and liberal Democrats who would prefer larger areas of the state be declared off limits to development.
But he had not anticipated a struggle with an important business group. Like other states, Utah is fighting the national economic slowdown. Business development has been a hallmark of Mr. Leavitt's administration.
To lose the outdoor retailers, who gather in Salt Lake City twice a year, would be a severe blow, and Mr. Hugelmeyer insisted he needed to see evidence of the governor's willingness to create new wilderness protections or the group would consider moving. Already, Denver is waiting in the wings.
"He's been more active in relaxing protections," Mr. Hugelmeyer said of the governor, emphasizing the importance of wilderness areas to customers of his members. "Our goal is to get him to understand that when it comes to wilderness, you can be negative, passive, a steward or a champion. At the moment, we've only seen negative and passive from Governor Leavitt. We've yet to see him act like a steward."
Mr. Leavitt, currently the nation's longest-serving governor, is to meet with the trade group on June 4. He said in an interview that the agreements with the Bush administration had been misunderstood. He said he had been a strong supporter of wilderness areas and would ask Mr. Hugelmeyer to help him get a bill through Congress to win permanent wilderness status for the 3.2 million acres that are still set aside. 
The state's lawsuit was filed, Mr. Leavitt said, because he believed that the Clinton administration, which angered many in Utah by circumventing Congress and declaring the Grand Staircase-Escalante a national monument in 1996, had acted improperly in setting aside more Utah land for wilderness protection.
"We were saying to the federal government, 'You can't do that,' " Mr. Leavitt said. "Only Congress can authorize an inventory of lands if they are to be managed as wilderness. So I'm saying now, let's get down to business and start with these 3.2 million acres."
Mr. Leavitt also said the roads agreement was vital for the state to maintain a transportation system that would serve, among others, outbackers eager to get closer to wilderness areas they cherish. And that is what he intends to tell the outdoor group, he said.
It might not be enough. Mr. Hugelmeyer said a recent poll of his members found that 92 percent favored protections for existing areas designated as wilderness and 80 percent favored creating new wilderness areas. 
"There's no doubt where our members are on this issue," he said. "Within our industry, this has gone to a national debate."

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: PARIS; 
Powell Says to the French, Yes . . . but Not All Is Forgiven

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: PARIS, May 22 

 BODY:
Sending a mixed message to the French on his first visit here since before the war in Iraq, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said today that France's support for lifting United Nations sanctions against Iraq was "a step in the right direction," but cautioned that "the disagreements of the past" have not been forgotten.
 Mr. Powell, who is in Paris for meetings of foreign ministers from the major industrial countries and Russia, insisted that the Bush administration did not plan to punish France for its bitter dispute with the United States over invading Iraq. 
 But he said the Pentagon was reviewing its plans for joint military exercises with France and other countries "in light of the changed circumstances," and acknowledged that the French would not be invited to an Air Force exercise in Nevada next year known as Red Flag. 
Referring to France's yes vote in the United Nations today on a resolution to lift sanctions on Iraq, Mr. Powell said: "Does it mean that the disagreements of the past simply are totally forgotten? No. That was not a very pleasant time for any of us, and we have to work our way through that."
Mr. Powell's remarks come at a tense time in French-American relations, when both countries are struggling to move beyond their differences over Iraq, yet when neither seems willing to acknowledge the validity of the other's position.
In Washington, anger with France's opposition to the war still runs deep in the Pentagon and among conservatives, who feel that new revelations about the brutality of Saddam Hussein's government have validated the American-led invasion.
But in Paris, pride in the French opposition to the war seems no less adamant in the aftermath of Mr. Hussein's fall. Explaining France's vote to lift sanctions today, Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin said support for the resolution did not translate into support for the war.
"In voting in favor of this resolution, France stays faithful to its principles," Mr. de Villepin said in an interview published in Le Monde. "The text does not legitimize war. It opens the way to peace, a peace that we must build together." 
Ivo H. Daalder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said of the French: "They are not in the mood to come on bended knee and say, 'We're sorry.' It's not even clear to me that they are serious about wanting to patch things up. In that sense, the clash of perspectives that came to the fore in mid-March is still there." 
The friction between the countries is likely to be evident in the coming days. Mr. Powell is scheduled to have a working breakfast with Mr. de Villepin on Friday. Next week President Bush, who spoke to President Jacques Chirac from Air Force One today, will visit France next week for a summit meeting of the Group of Eight nations. 
There are also signs that the two countries have different priorities for the summit meeting. The State Department has said Mr. Powell intends to focus on the reconstruction of Iraq, the Middle East peace process, international terrorism and nuclear weapons programs in Iran and North Korea.
While the French share some of those concerns, particularly Iraq reconstruction and peace in the Middle East, they will also want to discuss the environment and development in Africa. Some French officials have expressed concerns that their priorities will be set aside in favor of the Bush administration's agenda. 
Mr. Powell began his remarks, made in the same room where the Marquis de Lafayette implored Marie Antoinette to help the revolutionary aspirations of the fledgling United States, by praising the long alliance between the two countries. 
"What will never change is that there is this tie between the United States and France, a tie that has been created by shared values, created by working with each other in times of war and by being part of a great alliance," he told reporters at the French American Press Club. 
In meetings last week with senior officials in Russia and Germany, two other countries that opposed the war in Iraq, Mr. Powell also made a point of noting the differences over Iraq. But his tone today seemed harder, his determination to hold the French accountable for their positions more firm. Asked if the United States intended to punish the French, Mr. Powell, who once said the French would face consequences for their opposition to the war, said no. 
"But," he continued, "you take note of those who disagree with you and you try to find out why and if it is appropriate to draw some conclusions. And consequences follow those conclusions." 
Mr. Powell said tensions between France and the United States would not affect America's commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which he called "the greatest political and military alliance that the world has ever seen." 
He said that despite the end of the cold war, new countries continue to apply for NATO membership. At the urging of the United States, the alliance voted this week to admit Poland, whose troops fought beside Americans in Iraq and will play a role in peacekeeping operations. "It's a little hard to close down a club that has a waiting line," he said of NATO. "The future is going to hold a world that will still have a strong trans-Atlantic community."

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's appearance at a meeting of ministers from the major industrial countries and Russia misstated an action taken by NATO last week. It agreed to help Poland conduct peacekeeping operations in Iraq. The vote was not on admitting Poland; that occurred in 1999.

HEADLINE: Bush Chooses White House Adviser as Budget Director 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22 

 BODY:
President Bush chose a little-known but highly influential White House adviser, Joshua Bolten, today as the director of the Office of Management and Budget.
 The appointment comes at a time of record federal deficits, the most expensive military buildup in a generation and coming election-year fights with Congress over taxes and spending. 
 Mr. Bolten, 48, is to replace Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. as overseer of the nation's $2.23 trillion federal budget, one of the most powerful and difficult jobs in the capital. In a brief, rare public appearance with Mr. Bush this morning, he promised to be a "tight-fisted custodian of the people's money," and then noted that budget director "is not the easiest job in government." 
Nonetheless, Republicans close to the White House said that the genial Mr. Bolten was not as likely to antagonize Capitol Hill as Mr. Daniels, who once told reporters that the motto of Congress was "don't just stand there, spend something." With the smooth Mr. Bolten, one senior administration official said, "you won't feel the knife going in."
Republicans said today that Mr. Bolten, a single-digit millionaire from his days at the Goldman Sachs investment banking firm, would probably bring even more power to the budget director's job. As deputy chief of staff to Mr. Bush, Mr. Bolten has been in charge of all domestic policy at the White House and was critical to the formulation of the administration's two rounds of tax cuts and the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. He is a central player on the White House economic team, with his former Goldman Sachs colleague, Stephen J. Friedman, and has frequently closed legislative deals for Mr. Bush on Capitol Hill.
Mr. Bolten almost never speaks to reporters, a valuable attribute in a White House that prizes secrecy.
"Josh Bolten is brilliant, he is tireless, he remains calm in any storm," Mr. Bush said in announcing the appointment. "He is a man of complete integrity. No member of my staff has served with greater skill or earned greater respect amongst his colleagues than Josh Bolten. I'm honored that he's agreed to join my cabinet."
Republicans said Mr. Bolten's appointment probably meant that domestic policy would be largely driven out of the budget director's office, particularly the administration's plans to overhaul Medicare, provide prescription drug coverage and push for a new round of tax cuts this fall. Mr. Bolten, they said, could emerge as an unusually strong budget director because of his previous White House experience and close ties to the president.
"Josh Bolten took over the White House domestic policy show and the economic policy show," said Lawrence Kudlow, an associate budget director in the Reagan administration who is the host of a CNBC-TV talk show and is close to Vice President Dick Cheney. "Now he's going to have the number-crunching influence of the agency. If you sit in the Roosevelt Room where these decisions are hashed out, the people with the numbers have tremendous advantage. They can price out in great detail any new program thought that comes out of the West Wing." 
But Karl C. Rove, the president's powerful political adviser, said in a telephone interview today that Mr. Bolten "won't be doing two jobs" -- that of budget director and chief White House domestic policy adviser. Mr. Rove also said Mr. Bolten was "one of the most personally popular and widely respected members of the West Wing staff."
"I cannot say enough good things about the guy," Mr. Rove said.
It was unclear if Mr. Bolten would emerge from his West Wing office, where he displays a series of photographs of Mr. Bush's hands, to speak to the press. Today an aide said Mr. Bolten would not comment until his nomination was confirmed by the Senate, where Mr. Bush's choice for deputy budget director, Clay Johnson, has been held up for months by Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia. Mr. Byrd, the senior Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, is protesting an administration jobs policy, but his office had no comment today on whether the senator would also block Mr. Bolten. 
Mr. Bolten's appointment was welcomed with reservations by Senator Jon Corzine, Democrat of New Jersey, a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs. For a short time in the 1990's, Mr. Bolten worked as Mr. Corzine's chief of staff at Goldman Sachs. Mr. Corzine said he remembered him as a pragmatist who liked tax cuts, but not a supply-side true believer like many of the economists who have influenced Mr. Bush's tax-cutting plans.
"He is conservative," Mr. Corzine said, "but I don't think he's ideological on much of anything."
Nonetheless, he said, "he will be in a position of defending policies that I think are on the wrong side of the tracks." 
Mr. Bolten grew up in Washington, the son of a Central Intelligence Agency officer who worked in the agency's covert espionage arm. In keeping with the policy of the agency, he was instructed to tell his friends that his father worked at the Pentagon, not the C.I.A. He went on to graduate from St. Albans, the exclusive private boys' school in Washington, then Princeton University and Stanford Law School. 
In the first Bush administration, Mr. Bolten was the general counsel to the office of the United States trade representative and then worked for Goldman Sachs in London. In 2000, he was the policy director of Mr. Bush's presidential campaign. 
A recent financial disclosure form of Mr. Bolten lists assets of as much as $4 million, including a house in Key West, Fla. He owns two motorcycles, a Harley Davidson and a Victory. In a White House of early risers, staff members say he makes it to the 7:30 a.m. senior staff meeting with only a few minutes to spare.

HEADLINE: Growing the Political Economy 

 BODY:
After helping the Republican Party collect a cool $22 million for its House and Senate candidates at a dinner on Wednesday, President Bush is ready to turn his attention to his own re-election drive with fund-raising events in New York, Florida and Washington next month. Solicitations have gone out at $2,000 per ticket, with chrome-plated options for the big money raisers, likea $50,000 "leadership luncheon" with Karl Rove, the White House campaign guru. 
"Make your commitment now," exults Gov. George Pataki in handing out ascending V.I.P. slots, with those who raise $200,000 at the top. A tenth of that garners a photo-op with the beaming president, presumably in mufti, not "Top Gun" costume.
 The timing for testing the party faithful's generosity could not be better, as the president's latest tax-cut victories are cheering upper-bracket Americans. The president could easily score $200 million for a primary season in which he has no challenger, but G.O.P. officials are now discreetly talking about restraining themselves and aiming a little lower. 
 While money is already pouring in for a president on a crest of postwar popularity, Democratic aspirants have been aching for attention. They hope to negotiate a detente on monthly debates to stir some TV air time. Republicans suffered similarly during Bill Clinton's 1996 re-election drive, but unlike Mr. Bush, Mr. Clinton chose to accept public financing limits that restricted the amount he could spend.
The formidable Bush machine is already approaching hegemony in the money-raising duel with Democrats, with better than a three-to-one edge. Feted lawmakers poured into Wednesday's dinner after a hard day of negotiating the latest tax cuts, hailed by one House leader as rich with opportunity for all Americans, including "aspiring capitalists."

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: UNITED NATIONS; 
Security Council Almost Unanimously Approves Broad Mandate for Allies in Iraq

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 22 

 BODY:
The United States and Britain won an international mandate today to occupy and rebuild Iraq, as the Security Council voted to end nearly 13 years of sanctions. It was a significant diplomatic victory for the Bush administration, as France, Germany and Russia, the principal opponents of the American-led war, lined up in support of the measure.
 The resolution passed by a 14-to-0 vote this morning while the chair set aside for Syria, the lone Arab nation on the Council, remained empty. This afternoon, the Syrian charge d'affaires, Fayssal Mekdad, said at a later Council meeting that his government would have voted for the measure had it more time to deliberate. 
 Today's vote gives international legal standing to the allied forces' sweeping assumption of authority over Iraq's political development and its billions of dollars in annual oil revenues. But American concessions slightly enhanced the powers of a new United Nations special representative, ensuring he can deal directly with Iraqi groups while assisting the allied authorities in establishing a new government in Baghdad. 
Although an arms embargo on Iraq will stay in force, the resolution ends, for all practical purposes, an era of aggressive United Nations intervention in Iraq that began with Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Since then, the Security Council has passed at least 65 resolutions designed to contain Saddam Hussein's aggression, to prevent his development and deployment of unconventional weapons and to feed his people.
President Bush and Tony Blair, the British prime minister, both hailed the vote as a signal of international unity on the issue. "The nations of the world have demonstrated their unity in their commitment to help the Iraqi people on the path to a better future," Mr. Bush said in a statement. 
He added, "I also look forward to the establishment of an Iraqi interim administration that is broad-based and represents all of Iraq's people so that Iraqis can participate as quickly and as fully as possible in the revitalization of their country." The mandate granted under the current resolution would expire when an internationally recognized representative government takes power in Baghdad.
The United Nations, along with international financial organizations like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Arab Fund for Social and Economic Development, will have a seat on an advisory board that can monitor and audit the Development Fund for Iraq, which is controlled by the allies. While there is no requirement for the periodic reauthorization of the allied forces' extraordinarily broad mandate, the Council will review the matter within 12 months.
The near-unanimity of the vote belied the early difficulties of a foreshortened, 12-day negotiation. Diplomats here said the process seemed strewn with obstacles, even as most countries were professing a desire to end the bitter divisions of March, when the allied countries failed to muster a Council majority in support of the war.
But the deep reservations about granting a postwar mandate more sweeping, and with less United Nations control, than ever before in the world body's history, diplomats said, were trumped by two realities. First, a vote against a measure lifting sanctions could have been interpreted as a vote against the interests of ordinary Iraqis. Second, stiff opposition could have perpetuated Security Council divisions, severely compromising the United Nations' effectiveness.
Beyond that, Washington and London offered critical concessions, like the withdrawal of a provision that would have automatically renewed the unusual mandate; the addition of language that allows for the restructuring of Iraq's $400 billion in debt; and the eventual return of United Nations weapons inspectors. With that, France, Germany and Russia dropped their opposition.
"The war that we did not want, and the majority of the Council did not want, has taken place," the German ambassador, Gunter Pleuger, told reporters after the meeting. But, he continued, "we cannot undo history." He added, "We are now in a situation where we have to take action for the sake of the Iraqi people."
During the session, the French envoy, Jean-Marc de la Sabliere, told his colleagues that the resolution "provided a credible framework within which the international community will be able to lend support for the Iraqi people."
Later, the Russian ambassador, Sergei Lavrov, told reporters: "I don't see anything in this resolution which would be legitimizing the war. The resolution, rather, draws a line under the attempts to act in relation to Iraq bypassing the United Nations Charter. And it clearly brings the situation back within the international law area." 
For Secretary General Kofi Annan, who sat in on the Council session, the important point was that the Council members acted in concert. "We should all be gratified that the Council has come together to chart the way forward in Iraq," he told reporters.
"I have always held that the unity of this council is the indispensable foundation for effective action to maintain international peace and security and international law," Mr. Annan said, adding that he will name a special representative "without delay."
The leading contender for the job of special representative, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Sergio Vieira de Mello, was in New York today for consultations with Mr. Annan. 
International experts expressed intense interest today in the legal implications of the resolution, which gives the United States and Britain authority far beyond that envisioned for occupying powers in existing international treaties.
"The central role for the occupying powers is a first in the history of U.N. postconflict reconstruction," David Phillips, a senior fellow at New York's Council on Foreign Relations, said this afternoon. "Instead of power-sharing with U.N. agencies, the authority will be able to do as it sees fit to rebuild Iraq and accelerate its democratic development."
But others were focused on the daunting task of reconstruction. For that purpose, Mark Malloch Brown, the administrator of the United Nations Development Program, said: "It's a very good resolution. The coalition wants to burden-share the business of reconstruction, and other countries want to get in on it." But the process, he said, is "going to take years -- both a huge physical reconstruction to bring the oil industry up to today's standards, and bring the rest of the infrastructure up to par."
In Washington today, the World Bank issued a statement saying that for weeks, "a team of World Bank experts has been assessing the most pressing needs in the potential reconstruction of Iraq, mainly in the areas of health, education, power, water and economic management."
The morning Council meeting began well after its scheduled 9:30 opening, as diplomats chatted with one another, occasionally looking expectantly at the chamber door, through which the last envoy, the Syrian ambassador, was to arrive. But he never did. After 40 minutes and increasingly frequent cellphone calls, the Council president, Munir Akram, who is the Pakistani ambassador, began the meeting.
In addition to its other provisions, the new resolution allows for the return of United Nations weapons inspectors. It also calls for phasing out over six months the oil-for-food program, which has provided basic sustenance for more than 60 percent of the Iraqi population. 
During that time, Mr. Annan can complete the purchase of food, medicine and approved industrial products currently under contract. When the program is concluded, the unspent portion of the $13 billion in its account will be transferred to the new Development Fund for Iraq.

HEADLINE: Israel and Arafat Frustrate the New Palestinian Premier 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: GAZA, May 22 

 BODY:
It seemed a perfect way for the first Palestinian prime minister, Mahmoud Abbas, to connect with his skeptical public. He planned on Wednesday to visit the Gaza town of Beit Hanun, just after Israeli armored forces withdrew, to witness the destruction, show compassion and renew his call for ending violence.
 But shortly after Palestinian officials said they had coordinated their plan with the Israelis, the armored vehicles moved back in, blocking the roads. The army said its troops were trying to stop the militant Islamic group Hamas from firing rockets at Israelis. 
 Israeli officials say that if they "hug" Mr. Abbas his standing with his people would be undermined, but Mr. Abbas's allies say a bit more warmth would be welcome. 
"They could have given the man a chance," said Ziad Abu Amr, a minister in the new government.
Mr. Abbas, a critic of the armed uprising, has been on the job for three weeks. With opponents and doubters on all sides, he is having a hard time being heard and a harder time becoming popular.
As he met on Saturday with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel for the highest-level talks in more than two years, Palestinian suicide bombers embarked on a five-attack spree that undercut his demand that Israel accept a new peace plan, known as the road map.
This evening Mr. Abbas met here with political leaders of Hamas to try to work out a truce, a step Israel calls no substitute for arrests and weapons seizures. The meeting ended after two hours with an agreement to keep talking, and the Hamas members saying they would not stop suicide bombings or other violence.
"Nobody asked us to stop," said Dr. Mahmoud Zahar of Hamas. But a senior Palestinian official said Mr. Abbas had asked just that. The official said Mr. Abbas had pointed to the American war in Iraq, and the pressure on Syria and Iran, and asked the Hamas men if they believed that they could be immune.
Meanwhile, the head of the governing Palestinian Authority, Yasir Arafat, who reluctantly appointed Mr. Abbas under international pressure, has not rushed to support him.
Palestinian television, controlled by Mr. Arafat, has shown little interest in covering the prime minister. Though its technicians were set up for a live broadcast of Mr. Abbas's news conference with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell earlier this month, it chose not to do so.
As Mr. Abbas tries to consolidate control, subtle but significant rules keep changing. This week Mr. Arafat ordered the Palestinian governors to begin reporting directly to him, not to the Interior Ministry as they had in the past. Mr. Abbas now controls Interior.
Mr. Abbas' ministers have been a bit off message. He took his government from the West Bank to Gaza this week to show the isolated Gazans that he also cared about them. But by midweek some ministers who live in the West Bank had slipped back home.
New government or no, for Gazans life goes on, though in a way that they consider deeply strange. Fenced in by Israel, brooded over by posters of suicide bombers, gunmen and children shot dead in the conflict, they somehow keep this sprawling city alive. In a striking violation of social taboo here, a few beggars, including women, now ply the sidewalks. But sleek new Audi sedans dodge donkey carts along rutted streets. 
Enough money seeps in through relief agencies and civil service salaries, and enough commerce takes place with Israel, to keep stores stocked with toothpaste, tricycles and wedding dresses. In the markets, smells of mint and fresh peaches beat back the stench of sewage.
Muhammad Sharif, 32, returned eight months ago after 12 years in Fresno, Calif., to take care of his aging parents. At least temporarily trapped by tightened Israeli closings of Palestinian-ruled areas, Mr. Sharif has just opened a Web design and development consulting firm. 
With international assistance, a few businesses are creating electronic catalogs, hoping that calm will come, the closings will ease and they will be able to export wicker furniture and other products.
But Mr. Sharif had a big laugh when asked if the new government of Mr. Abbas, known as Abu Mazen, and his security chief, Muhammad Dahlan, had changed anything.
"Abu Mazen, Dahlan -- that's the 'new' government?" he asked. Both men are longtime fixtures in Palestinian affairs.
He argued that Israel was not interested in having the government succeed, because, he said, it did not want to make the concessions that would lead to lasting peace. "If it doesn't work," he said of his new business, "the first time they open the borders, I'm back to California."
Mr. Abbas is plugging away, and there are signs of change. Palestinian security forces, carrying guns and wearing new uniforms, have reappeared in the streets. Some policemen ride gleaming white Honda motorcycles, donated from abroad.
American officials in "Matrix" sunglasses and buzz haircuts, driving armored German cars and concealing bulky objects beneath baggy shirts, have been crossing the boundary with Israel for meetings with Palestinian security officials. Two of the Americans declined to talk to a reporter, but Palestinians identified some as members of the Central Intelligence Agency.
"They are very active, moving back and forth," observed Hassan Asfour, a Palestinian official who is close to Mr. Dahlan. He called the C.I.A. a busybody with little effect -- "like the mother of the bride: moving for nothing."
Yet Mr. Asfour, a Marxist with a car and driver and a marked cynical streak, says the new government is bringing about some change. It has acted to bring some corrupt government-run businesses under the control of the reform-minded finance minister, Salam Fayyad. 
Mr. Asfour said it would restore law and order. "We need people to respect the police," he said. "If you don't respect the police, you don't respect the Authority. If you don't respect the Authority, it's chaos." 
He said the government would be strong enough to begin halting violence against Israelis once Israel formally accepted the new plan, which Mr. Sharon is trying to amend substantially.
After meeting tonight with Mr. Abbas, Dr. Zahar said, "He absolutely said 100 percent there would be no violence against Hamas from the Palestinian side."
Yet some Palestinian officials say there is a mailed fist forming inside the velvet glove with which Mr. Abbas is handling Hamas. They worry that Mr. Abbas may not have time to gather his political and security strength before another major terrorist attack forces his hand, or Israel's.
Mr. Asfour predicted that Israel would not accept the peace plan without intense American pressure. "The success of Palestinians is failure for Sharon," he said, an analysis regarded as axiomatic in Gaza. Mr. Sharon has often said he would make "painful concessions" for peace.
Some Gazans say Mr. Abbas should be doing more to reach out to his people. "They need a campaign, this government," said Salah Abdel Shafi, an economist.
Mr. Abbas did speak briefly to reporters on Wednesday as he emerged from a meeting with legislators here. "We wanted to visit our brothers in Beit Hanun, but the bulldozers and tanks closed the door in front of us," he said. As he spoke, Palestinian television was nowhere to be seen.

HEADLINE: A Tax Cut Without End 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Friday, May 23 

 BODY:
True, the price tag on the tax bill the House approved this morning is officially only $320 billion over 10 years, barely two-fifths of the $726 billion President Bush proposed in February.
 True too, it is even smaller than the $350 billion measure initially passed by the Senate that Mr. Bush ridiculed as "little bitty." 
 But the $320 billion figure, which is expected to clear the Senate today, is artificial. 
No one expects that tax breaks for married couples and a bigger tax credit for children, popular features of the bill, will be allowed to expire after next year. This is what lawmakers call a sunset. It was put into the measure to hold down the 10-year cost.
Nor, barring a political upheaval that puts Democrats in the White House and in control of Congress, is it likely that the lower tax rates on dividends and capital gains will be allowed to expire after 2008, another sunset in the bill.
If these elements of the tax cut are calculated on a 10-year basis, the cost in lost revenue stands to be over $800 billion, more than what the president proposed, according to the first analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priority, a liberal research institute.
More important, the tax reduction this year and next year under the Congressional agreement is significantly larger than what the president originally proposed. 
The Congressional tax staff estimated that the agreement would lead to a tax cut of $61 billion in the 2003 fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30, and $149 billion in 2004.
The Congressional Budget Office reported that the president's plan would have lowered taxes by $35 billion in 2003 and $117 billion in 2004.
If, as the president says, the main purpose of the tax cut is to get the economy moving, the measure before Congress may provide more stimulus than Mr. Bush's proposal.
So for a president who seems to favor the largest possible tax cut in every circumstance -- whether the economy is strong or weak, whether the budget is running a surplus or a deficit -- this legislation was a substantial accomplishment.
Before this week's agreement, all the stars seemed aligned against another large tax cut.
The budget deficit, long the bugaboo of Republicans, could reach $400 billion this year, by far, the largest in history in dollar terms and growing with each new estimate.
The public is not clamoring for lower taxes. Just Thursday, The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed that only 29 percent of the public believes "tax cuts are the best way to increase economic growth and create jobs," while 64 percent said there were "better ways."
A survey this month by Deloitte & Touche, the accounting firm, found that few business executives thought a reduction in the tax on stock dividends, the centerpiece of the president's plan, would particularly help their businesses or the economy.
In the closely split Congress, Mr. Bush had almost no Democratic support and had to deal constantly with qualms of moderate Republicans.
So how did the president pull it off? How in the face of all these obstacles was he able to win Congressional approval of one of the largest tax cuts in history -- on top of the $1.3 trillion, 10-year cut adopted just two years ago?
Part of the answer, of course, is Mr. Bush's popularity, rooted in his stand against terrorism and success in the war in Iraq. At every turn, the White House and allies in Congress insisted to Republican holdouts that challenging the president on tax cuts amounted to disloyalty to a wartime president.
But even more, the president succeeded because of a set of tactics that involved remaining flexible in his goals, taking advantage of division among Democrats, campaigning vigorously in the states of crucial senators and knocking the heads of Congressional leaders who often seemed more interested in pride of authorship than in enactment of legislation. 
Then on Wednesday afternoon and again Thursday afternoon, Mr. Bush dispatched Vice President Dick Cheney to Capitol Hill to broker deals. On Wednesday, Mr. Cheney won the final votes needed for passage in the Senate. On Thursday, when a snag developed in the House, he brought recalcitrant Republican representatives aboard. 
Come the election campaign next year, the president can credit his tax cuts if the economy has improved. If the economy is still flagging, he can blame Democrats for opposing his initial proposal.
The tax bill, said Senator Robert F. Bennett, Republican of Utah, was the latest example of Mr. Bush's talent as a political strategist. Mr. Bennett, chairman of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, continued:
"The president looks at the economy and looks at the electorate and grasps that the electorate wants to see someone doing something. They don't care about the details. So here is Bush with the political smarts to understand that the best medicine is to be seen as a leader making bold strokes, moving out on an issue where others are temporizing."
In that vein, Mr. Bush remained focused on getting a bill passed, any bill, without fretting over the specifics. At first, he demanded a bill no smaller than $726 billion over 10 years. When that proved impossible, he lowered his sights to $550 billion, then to $350 billion and finally on Wednesday to the $320 billion that was agreed to.
As recently as Monday, when he called Congressional leaders to the White House, he was insisting that all taxes on dividends be eliminated, even if only briefly. When that proved not to fly, he quickly relented and accepted a measure that would reduce the tax rate on dividends and capital gains to 15 percent.
"By the force of his personality," Mr. Bennett said, "he stepped into the squabble between the House and the Senate and brought everyone into the room and said, 'You're going to get this done before Memorial Day.' Clinton would have stood at a board with a Magic Marker and worked through the details. Bush was more interested in getting a bill than he was in what was in the bill."
Bill Clinton might also have framed the tax cut as a choice from two things. You can cut taxes, or you get prescription drug coverage under Medicare. You can cut taxes, or you can save Social Security. At least that is the way he succeeded in blocking Republican tax cuts during his presidency.
This year, Mr. Bush was helped by the fact that Democrats abandoned that approach and offered tax cuts of their own -- smaller than Mr. Bush's, aimed at the middle class and not the wealthy, but tax cuts nonetheless. Democrats were never able to make the case that their way was the better way.
For sure, this is not the last Bush tax cut. Under the legislation, popular tax relief like the $1,000 tax credit for each child and tax bonus for married couples are to expire at the end of 2004. Congress will not want to let them lapse in an election year. So be prepared for another tax bill next year.

HEADLINE: House Passes Tax Cut Bill; Senate Action Is Set Today 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Friday, May 23 

 BODY:
Hours after President Bush made an unusual Capitol Hill appearance to urge them on, members of the House approved his signature domestic priority early today, passing a $350 billion package of tax cuts and state assistance intended to energize the economy.
 The vote was 231 to 200, with 7 Democrats supporting the tax cut and 1 Republican opposing it. The bill now goes to the Senate, which is expected to approve it later this morning and get it to the president by the weekend. 
 Mr. Bush praised the overall tax plan that was hammered out by tax writers on Wednesday and said he hoped to sign it soon. 
"The principle of the bill is pretty simple: that we believe the more money people have in their pockets, the more likely it is somebody is going to be able to find work in America," Mr. Bush said Thursday morning as he emerged from a pep talk with Republican leaders of both chambers. "This bill I'm going to sign is good for American workers, it is good for American families, it is good for American investors, and it's good for American entrepreneurs and small-business owners."
The $350 billion tax package includes $320 billion in actual tax cuts, an amount increased from the $318 billion that Congressional tax officials estimated on Wednesday. Officials with the Senate Finance Committee said the rest of the package consisted of $20 billion in state aid and $9.5 billion in refundable child tax credits to low income people who do not pay taxes.
The $320 billion represents a far smaller tax cut than the $726 billion Mr. Bush originally requested. After spending weeks exhorting Congress not to slash his original plan, the president bowed this week to the reality that only a far smaller tax cut could pass the narrowly divided Senate, and he told the two chambers to put aside their philosophical differences and pass a bill this week.
Though it is only a fraction of his proposal, the tax package on which the House and Senate began debate on Thursday still contains the core of the president's argument that reducing taxes on dividends will revive the stock market and prod the business investment that creates jobs. For all the misgivings that Republican members on both sides expressed on Thursday -- and many leaders are still angry at the compromises necessary to forge the bill -- Mr. Bush praised Congress for putting aside its differences and giving him a good portion of what he wanted.
"This is a Congress which is able to identify problems facing the American people and get things done," the president said, ignoring reporters' questions about whether he was truly satisfied with the size of the tax cut. "These are 'can do' people, and I'm real proud of the work they've done."
Democrats, lacking a majority in either house, were powerless to stop the tax cut, but on both sides of the Capitol they predicted the administration's fiscal policy would bring ruin to the economy and popular federal programs.
"They're taking money from working people -- Social Security taxes, Medicare taxes -- and they're using it to give to other folks in tax breaks," said Representative Gene Taylor, Democrat of Mississippi, in the early House skirmishing over the bill. "Then they're borrowing the rest to run our nation. This is the theft of the future of America."
Although the House and Senate were in basic agreement on the shape of the tax bill, a last-minute hitch developed late Thursday that once again required Vice President Dick Cheney to go to the Capitol to settle a dispute among Republicans. The issue arose over part of the bill that would send $20 billion in aid to state governments, half of which was earmarked to reimburse states for increasing Medicaid costs.
The Medicaid section was crucial to getting the votes of several centrist senators, but in the House, Representative Billy Tauzin of Louisiana, the Republican chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, told leaders Thursday morning that he and the other members of his committee could not vote for the final bill if the Medicaid reimbursements were included. The Medicaid system was so seriously flawed, he said, that providing money to the states with no structural changes was unacceptable.
The votes of the committee members might have sunk the entire bill, so Mr. Cheney came to the Capitol to repair the breach, just as he had on Wednesday when House and Senate tax writers were snarling at each other over the size of the tax bill. In this case, Mr. Cheney won an agreement from the Senate that the Medicaid payments would last only two years and would not become a permanent subsidy to the states. Mr. Tauzin backed off at that point, telling other Republicans that he would not embarrass the president over the issue.
Republicans in both chambers made it clear on Thursday that the final product was only minimally acceptable to them. To reach an agreement, Senate Republicans had to give up their hope of eliminating the dividend tax for all taxpayers, accepting the House plan to reduce the tax on dividends and on capital gains. The House had to accept a far shorter period for lowering those two taxes, along with the state assistance many members oppose, and it had to adhere to the Senate's $350 billion limit.
Tom DeLay, the House majority leader, said Thursday that the bill provided short-term stimulus to the economy, but lacked the elements to produce long-term growth. The growth section, he said, had been cut off by not extending the tax breaks further through the 10-year period, but he vowed that Republicans would try to repair that problem in future years.
Representative Bill Thomas of California, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, did not even sign the report at the conference meeting, and Republican officials said he was angry that President Bush had made a promise to Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, to increase Medicare money for rural providers in a future bill. Mr. Grassley had been forced by the House to drop that provision, a favorite of his, from the tax bill. Mr. Thomas eventually relented and signed the report Thursday evening.
Mr. Bush himself was not entirely pleased with the bill, saod his spokesman, Ari Fleischer, but given the disagreements among Congressional Republicans, he was glad to have a bill at all.
"The president is getting less than he would have liked," Mr. Fleischer told reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday. "He recognizes that. He wishes it could be more. But he is pleased, nevertheless, that an agreement was reached."
The strongest criticism of the bill came from Democrats, who noted with ridicule that the bill will be passed on the same day that the Senate will approve raising the nation's debt ceiling by nearly $1 trillion, the largest increase ever.
"Under this bill, the debt of the country is going to skyrocket," said Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee. "Under the president's plan, the national debt is going to double, and at the worst possible time, because we are right on the eve of the retirement of the baby boom generation, and we are already going to run a record budget deficit this year. And the president's response is increased spending and cut the revenue further, exploding deficits and debt."
Democrats also described the tax cut provisions in the bill as "yo-yo" or "roller coaster" reductions, because they rise and fall repeatedly over 10 years to make the bill's overall cost look smaller.

Rangel of Manhattan sat beside Mr. DeLay. (Paul Hosefros/The New York Times) Chart: "IN BRIEF: Tax Cut Takes Final Shape"These are the main elements of the $350 billion in tax cuts and new spending agreed to yesterday by a House and Senate conference committee. The legislation would cut taxes by $320 billion through 2013 and provide $20 billion over the next two years to state and local governments for Medicaid and other programs. It would also provide $9.5 billion in refundable child tax credits for low-income people who do not pay income taxes. Dividends and capital gains 10-year cost: $148.1 billionWould lower the top rate to 15 percent on taxes paid by stockholders on corporate dividends and the taxes on capital gains. Current top rate is 38.6 percent for dividends, 20 percent for capital gains. Both rates would be 5 percent for taxpayers in the lowest two brackets. HOW THEY WOULD CHANGE OVER TIME -- The new rates would run through 2007; in 2008, the lower rate would drop to zero. In 2009, the rates would revert to the current, higher rates. Personal income taxes $161.9 billionWould accelerate some tax reductions scheduled to occur later this decade: Increase child credit to $1,000 per child from the current $600. Would reduce highest income tax brackets: to 35 from 38.6 percent; to 33 from 35 percent; to 28 from 30 percent; and to 25 from 27 percent. The 10 percent tax bracket would be expanded. For married people filing joint returns, the 15-percent bracket would be expanded and the standard deduction increased. Would prevent more taxpayers from paying the alternative minimum tax. HOW THEY WOULD CHANGE OVER TIME -- Most reductions would last until 2004; in 2005, the current law would go back into effect. Business taxes $10.1 billion Would increase to $100,000 from $25,000 the equipment invest-ment that small businesses can write off. Many companies could more rapidly depreciate assets bought between May 5, 2003, and Jan. 1, 2005. Would increase through 2004 the percentage of investment expenses larger businesses could write off.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Early ad sales for the 2003-4 TV season turn into a 'runaway sellers' market.'

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
NEVER mind Ruben and Clay. Madison Avenue agencies are voting, with a record amount of client dollars, for their own American idol: broadcast network television.
 The agencies, on behalf of the marketers they represent, are agreeing to spend more than $9 billion to buy commercial time on the broadcast networks ahead of the 2003-4 prime-time season. Last spring, agencies committed $8.1 billion. The bargaining process, known as the upfront market, was more frenetic than usual and wound up a "runaway sellers' market," in the words of one tired participant. 
 "It's like being back in college and pulling those all-nighters," said another participant, Mike Shaw, president for sales and marketing at the ABC Television division of ABC.
The strength of the upfront market for broadcast television is reflectedin many deals being made at rates 15 to 23 percent higher than those last spring, in what is known as cost per thousand viewers. That strength is already being mirrored in the negotiations to buy commercial time on cable networks; those negotiations typically begin after the broadcasters complete their sales.
As the demand for television goes, usually, so goes the general advertising economy. That the broadcast upfront moved so fast, at prices higher than had been forecast even a couple of weeks ago, could prefigure an improved climate for agencies, media companies and advertisers after one of the most daunting periods for them in decades.
"There's an expectation of a more robust economy in '04, and people wanted to get their money down," said Jon Nesvig, president for sales at Fox Broadcasting, part of the News Corporation.
"We all knew it was going to be big," he added. "It just turned out to be bigger than we'd thought."
The dickering began in earnest Tuesday evening and proceeded almost nonstop through yesterday morning, pausing only for meal breaks heavy on fare from the greasy-food menu of Midtown Manhattan -- barbecue, pizza and Chinese takeout most prominently -- and for huddling in conference rooms Wednesday night to watch the "American Idol" finale on Fox.
"That had to help us with a lot of the 20-somethings" at the agencies, Mr. Nesvig said, laughing. "We said, 'Hey, you want to be there next year?' " The reference was to the next edition of "Idol," which begins in January.
"There were several people at the agencies who spent the night on the sofa," said Karen Soots, national media manager for one big advertiser involved in the upfront bazaar, the Red Lobster division of Darden Restaurants.
Restaurants, particularly fast-food chains, were among the marketers agreeing to make commitments, subject to change after the fall season gets under way, to spend more in 2003-4 than they did in 2002-3. Other categories that Mr. Nesvig and executives at other networks identified as fueling the increased demand for commercial time included beverages, especially soft drinks; entertainment, for theatrical films and films on DVD's; pharmaceuticals, for prescription drugs sold directly to consumers; packaged goods; retailing; and telecommunications.
Automobiles, a source of heavy spending in previous upfront markets, was described as flat to down slightly.
Mostly, though, the gains were "across the board," said Leslie Moonves, chairman and chief executive at CBS, part of Viacom. "I have no bad news here." CBS and its smaller sibling, UPN, are somewhat behind the pace of the other broadcasters, and are expected to complete their deals by today.
NBC, owned by General Electric, led the broadcast parade with estimated sales of $3 billion, compared with about $2.7 billion last spring. That would be the first time a network reached $3 billion in an upfront market. NBC's sales include some spots packaged as part of purchases of time during the 2004 Summer Olympics.
"When exciting shows come to the broadcast networks, they aggregate huge audiences," said Randy Falco, group president for the NBC Television Network division of NBC, "and if you want to sell product, you have to reach huge audiences."
CBS was second again, as it was last spring, selling an estimated $2.2 billion worth of spots, compared with $1.9 billion. Mr. Moonves said demand was robust for returning series like "C.S.I.: Miami" as well as new series like "Two and a Half Men," a sitcom with Charlie Sheen and Jon Cryer, and "Cold Case," a drama about an investigator of unsolved murders that he described jocularly as "Jessica Fletcher meets 'C.S.I.' "
ABC, part of Walt Disney, eked out a gain from last spring, according to estimates, selling $1.65 billion to $1.7 billion, compared with $1.5 billion. ABC has struggled to regain momentum after many reality series the network scheduled for 2002-3 fell short in the ratings.
"We've gotten the message out that we're going heavier with comedies" and other scripted programs for 2003-4, Mr. Shaw said, "and that resonated."
"I think people are betting there's a little upside here," he added.
ABC's total does not reflect sales of commercial time for "Monday Night Football" and other prime-time sports coverage, handled separately from the upfront.
Fox, basking in the success of reality fare like "American Idol" and "Joe Millionaire," along with scripted series like "24" and "That 70's Show," sold an estimated $1.6 billion, perhaps even a tad higher, compared with $1.3 billion last spring.
"Our schedule was well received," Mr. Nesvig said, "and what helped us gain in volume was that it's a more balanced schedule, with more shows for female viewers, which helped draw more packaged goods."
One such new series is "The O.C.," a serialized drama with a young, attractive cast that, Mr. Nesvig said, "puts us back in the 'Melrose Place'-type business that advertisers would like us to be in."
Another strong performance was turned in by WB, owned by AOL Time Warner and the Tribune Company. WB sold an estimated $700 million to $750 million, compared with $575 million last spring. During presentations of its 2003-4 schedule last week, WB executives stressed the preponderance of scripted series they planned, and that paid off, said Jed Petrick, president and chief operating officer at WB. The increases in cost per thousand viewers, upward of 20 percent, are the highest for any of the six networks.
"Advertising is an investment, not an expense," Mr. Petrick said, and marketers are reluctant to invest in "objectionable material" like unsavory reality shows. New scripted series that appealed to buyers included the sitcom "Like Family," the variety-comedy show "Steve Harvey's Big Time" and the romantic drama "Tarzan and Jane," he added, along with returning favorites like "Charmed," "Everwood," "Gilmore Girls" and "7th Heaven."
Finally, UPN, as noted, is not finished, so estimates for its sales are less precise than for other networks, ranging from $250 million to $275 million. Last spring's tally was about $225 million.
All six networks have sold or are selling in the upfront market about the same percentage of available commercial time, estimated at 80 to 85 percent. The remaining time will be sold during the 2003-4 season in what is known as the scatter market.

Dollar Plunges Against Euro, Drawing Close to Record Low

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The dollar plunged against the euro yesterday, spurred by lingering speculation that the United States is content to see the dollar fall to help the economy.
 "Our jaws dropped to the floor when we arrived this morning," said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at Bank of New York, which holds $6.8 trillion of assets in custody. 
"Traders won't stop until they see the dollar at $1.20 per euro." 
 In New York, the euro settled at $1.1827, up from $1.1699 on Thursday. It is now trading well above the $1.16675 rate at which the currency was introduced in 1999 and is flirting with its all-time intraday high of $1.1884. 
Declines in the dollar have accelerated since comments last weekend from Treasury Secretary John W. Snow were interpreted by investors as an end to Washington's strong-dollar policy. The dollar has fallen 21.4 percent against the euro in the last 12 months. So far this month it has fallen 5.2 percent, the biggest monthly drop since December.
A comparison of the economies in the United States and other countries makes the dollar's fall perplexing, some economists said. Gross domestic product in the United States is expected to grow about 2.4 percent this year. In Europe, the economies of Germany, Italy and the Netherlands are shrinking, and no growth is expected in Japan.
"This decline goes far beyond the economic fundamentals of the U.S. in relation to Europe or Japan," Mr. Woolfolk said.

HEADLINE: THINK TANK; 
How Noblity of Purpose Can Square With Meanness and Lies

BYLINE:  By Felicia R. Lee 

 BODY:
The life of Justice William O. Douglas reads like a novel. He was on the Supreme Court of the United States for over 36 years, longer than anyone else, going through four wives, seven presidents and four impeachment attempts. His image has been that of an antigovernment idealist pitted against an establishment that blanched at his much younger wives and his stand against the Vietnam War.
 Now that a new book about Douglas says he lied about (or at least embellished) many parts of his life -- from having had childhood polio to graduating second in his law school class -- some scholars are again asking what such information reveals about the legacy and work of judges, especially those on the Supreme Court. 
 In "Wild Bill: The Legend and Life of William O. Douglas" (Random House, $35), Bruce Allen Murphy, a professor of civil rights at Lafayette College in Easton, Pa., argues that Douglas's sloppiness in framing and writing Supreme Court decisions and his penchant for falsehood stemmed from boredom with the high court and a deep need to invent the person he wanted to be: a politician.
Yet after romping through more than 700 pages about Douglas's lies and his meanness to his wives and children, some scholars take issue with the idea that Douglas's -- or any other judge's -- personal biography is crucial in determining a judicial legacy.
"These traditional biographies are pointless if you're interested in understanding the significance of the judge as a judge," said Richard A. Posner, a judge for the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and a senior lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School.
Citing a book of his, Mr. Posner continued: "I said what are needed are critical studies, as opposed to biographies. The relation between personal character and professional reputation is often nonexistent. People operate on different tracks. Very successful people, when you look at them, they very often turn out to be psychological basket cases. They were successful in part because they were driven by some deep personal insecurity."
Mr. Posner recently gave "Wild Bill" a mostly favorable review in The New Republic but said Professor Murphy did not adequately interpret Douglas's judicial work. He wrote that none of Douglas's personal failings would have mattered except that Douglas "presented his life to the public as exemplary of American individualism and achievement."
Melvin I. Urofsky, a professor of history and public policy at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond and an editor of a book of Douglas's letters, agrees to an extent. He said: "Douglas's primary legacy was as a Supreme Court justice. In the end, that's what really counts" -- not whether he was a scoundrel, a liar, a womanizer.
Still, he says that looking solely at the judicial record is too narrow. "If you believe a person's life informs their work, it does matter."
"Clearly, Thurgood Marshall's background had a great deal to do with his position on capital punishment, seeing how blacks were disproportionately sentenced to death in the South," he said. He added that Justice Sandra Day O'Connor talked about how she faced discrimination in her law career because she was a woman and therefore had a special interest in sex discrimination cases.
Professor Urofsky noted that other biographies had hinted at Douglas's lies and that it was long known in academic and legal circles that he was a womanizer and made things up in his autobiographies. Professor Murphy's book, he said, documents even more lying.
David J. Danelski, a retired professor who is working on his own Douglas biography, and some of Douglas's former associates contend that although Douglas exaggerated, he was basically a decent, smart man. In particular, they say, Professor Murphy does not prove that Douglas never had polio as a child or that he lied about his class rank or whether his first wife supported him in law school. (Still percolating is a debate that hinges on technicalities over whether Douglas was legitimately buried in Arlington Cemetery. "Wild Bill" says that Douglas lied about serving in the war.)
Professor Murphy stands by his work, saying: "I tried to look at Douglas's life and connect the image with the decisions he was writing. They do connect.
"If you read who he says he was in his autobiographies, you can see the iconoclast, left-wing, anti-government jurist. But much of what he wrote about himself cannot be confirmed. Now, who was Douglas really? He was a very frustrated and disappointed politician."
That frustration translated into sloppiness on the high court, Professor Murphy said. Douglas's inattention to detail can be found even in one of his most influential opinions, Griswold v. Connecticut, which defended the right of marital privacy and is seen as a precursor to Roe v. Wade, which affirmed a woman's right to abortion, Professor Murphy writes.
The first draft of Douglas's opinion about the sacred association of marriage -- coming from a much-married and unfaithful judge -- was hastily written and narrowly constructed, he says. It was Justice William J. Brennan Jr. and his law clerks, he said, who expounded on the right of privacy in this case, which was brought to the court by the state's Planned Parenthood League. The league had been convicted of violating anticontraception law by dispensing advice and contraceptives to married couples. "As a result of Brennan's successful lobbying, Douglas was credited by his supporters with being even more activist, 'inventing' the right of privacy and 'finding' it in the Constitution," Professor Allen writes.
The question of the best way to make sense of the career of a judge pops up from time, as judicial biographies are written. Justices like Felix Frankfurter, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and Louis D. Brandeis have been puzzled over for decades in various biographies and studies.
In the case of Holmes, for example, scholars have tried to figure out how his Civil War experience formed who he was and how some of his misanthropic comments squared with his enduring reputation for being a passionate defender of the First Amendment.
"It is not easy to make a coherent story of a judicial career," Lawrence M. Friedman wrote in The New York Times in a 1984 review of "Brandeis and Frankfurter: A Dual Biography" by Leonard Baker. Mr. Friedman, a law professor, argued that understanding the work of the court required knowledge of the statutes and procedures; the social, economic and political milieu; and the personal life of the judge.
That's where biography comes in. "There is no substitute for a look at a justice's written work, but biographies like this can show why a judge did what he or she did," said James L. Swanson, a lawyer and editor in chief of the Cato Supreme Court Review, which is published by the Cato Institute, a libertarian research foundation in Washington.
"The book did change my opinion of Douglas," Mr. Swanson continued. "As important as the result is how the justice got there, what type of legal analysis the justice used."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: TRADE; 
Lifting of Iraq Sanctions Ends 13 Years of Isolation, but Immediate Relief Isn't Expected

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, May 23 

 BODY:
The United Nations' resolution to remove trade sanctions against Iraq will officially end 13 years of international isolation for this country. But business executives and other experts said today that it would bring little immediate relief to Iraq's battered economy.
 The new resolution will allow Iraq to export oil more freely, but Iraqi oil production is still only a fraction of its prewar level as a result of damage to refineries and pipelines. Production is so low that American military officials need to truck in more than a million gallons of gasoline a day to meet the country's domestic needs. 
 Prohibitions on most Iraqi imports had for all practical purposes disappeared as soon as American and British forces defeated the government of Saddam Hussein. For weeks now, American border guards have turned a blind eye to traders who are importing everything from cars and candy to satellite dishes from Jordan, Turkey, Iran and Persian Gulf countries like Abu Dhabi.
Contrary to frequent complaints by American officials here about the obstacles created by the sanctions, business executives say the biggest restraint on trade and investment has been fear about the current state of lawlessness and instability.
"Lifting the sanctions was an essential ingredient, but the other is establishing an environment of security and stability," said Joseph Braude, an Iraqi-American business consultant and the author of "The New Iraq," a book on Iraq's prospects for postwar renewal.
Iraq also faces wrenching economic adjustments, which will not be made easier by the lifting of sanctions. Today the American civilian administrator in the country, L. Paul Bremer III, announced that the Iraqi armed forces and the information ministry would be dissolved. That decision will add hundreds of thousands of people to the country's unemployment rolls at a time when a huge but undefined percentage of workers are already jobless.
Foreign investors remain reluctant to commit money to Iraq because of the security problems here. But Iraqi leaders are far from clear about how much they want to encourage such investment. Some of the country's leading business families are urging foreign investors to team up with Iraqi partners and let the Iraqi partners retain more than half the shares in a venture.
If that view becomes policy in the new Iraqi government, many foreign companies are likely to stay on the sidelines.
In a brief statement today, Mr. Bremer said that ending the sanctions had created a "new day" for Iraqis and would allow them to "take one giant step forward in its recovery and its future prosperity."
But increased oil production and exports, the main path to money for rebuilding the country, is still some time away. As of a week ago, Iraqi oil fields were producing only 300,000 barrels a day. By comparison, Iraq produced about 2 million barrels a day before the war and about 3.5 million barrels at its peak level.
Thamir Ghadhban, the interim chief executive of the Iraqi Oil Ministry, predicted two weeks ago that the production could reach a million barrels a day by June and more than two million barrels a day by the end of the year after sanctions were lifted.
In addition, Iraq has built up inventories of roughly seven million barrels stored at the Turkish port of Ceyhan, which could provide the government with a quick, one-time source of cash.
Still, one measure of the modest expectations surrounding Iraqi oil are prices on the world market. Global prices dropped sharply when traders realized that American forces would win a fairly quick victory and that the oil fields were not going to be destroyed by Mr. Hussein.
Since then, prices have climbed back to relatively high levels, about $26.50 a barrel, as traders scaled back their expectations of big output here and scaled up their expectations of global demand.
The bigger question is whether foreign investment and normal domestic business activity will accelerate. In Baghdad most stores have reopened, but many if not most of those stores close well before 5 p.m. for fear of being robbed by the increasingly brazen thieves who now roam the city.
"Initially, investment will come from highly entrepreneurial companies," said Frederick D. Barton, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. "The bigger players are much talked about, but their projects are more complicated."
Mr. Barton said business insurers are still reluctant to insure investments in Iraq. But he added that merchants and traders have already jumped at bringing in imported goods from nearby countries and that Turkish trucking executives are expecting traffic into and out of Iraq to be twice as much through June as it was for all of last year.
"From the beginning, I don't think people were counting on oil money to get the country moving again," said Hashim Hamandi, a vice president at J. P. Morgan Chase & Company and a founder of the Iraqi Economic Institute, a nonprofit association of Iraqi economists and business executives in New York.
That said, Mr. Hamandi predicted that foreign investment would accelerate dramatically in the coming months as people become more confident about security here.
For the immediate future, Mr. Hamandi and other experts believe that most of the private investment here will come from Iraq's roughly four million expatriates in the United States, Europe and neighboring countries in the Persian Gulf.
Entrepreneurs throughout the gulf region are beginning to salivate over the money to be made in Iraqi reconstruction and in new opportunities. But entrepreneurs in Iraq are bracing for tough times. Companies that often knew no competition from imports, including many in the food industry, are already finding that they cannot compete against a rising flood of imports from Iran, Jordan and Abu Dhabi.
If the experience of companies in post-Communist countries provides any guide, many if not most of Iraq's manufacturing companies will be lucky to survive as anything more than a shadow of their former selves as they scramble to replace outdated technology.

HEADLINE: In Switch, Money Leaves Junk Bond Funds 

BYLINE:  By Dow Jones/AP

 BODY:
High-yield bond fund managers reported their first outflows since February, losing $257.7 million in the week ended May 21, AMG Data Services said yesterday.
 The report, which comes amid indications that the bonds have become overvalued, ended 12 weeks of inflows that brought about $12 billion into the market, according to AMG data on funds that report weekly. 
 With investors seeking yield, junk bond funds had accumulated about $18.27 billion in the year-to-date period leading up the latest figure, including funds reporting weekly and monthly.
Inflows for the year are still ahead of the 1997 record of $17.875 billion, and are also above the $11.656 billion taken in last year.
AMG, which is based in Arcata, Calif., tracks the flows of money into funds.

HEADLINE: Kabul Announces Push to Gain Revenue and Combat Corruption 

BYLINE:  By CARLOTTA GALL 

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, May 23 

 BODY:
Afghanistan's finance minister announced an aggressive new campaign today to overhaul customs and finance departments countrywide, and to curb corruption in an effort to draw in customs revenue and other taxes for the central treasury. 
 Ashraf Ghani, a former World Bank official who has been struggling as finance minister to raise revenue from provincial governors and commanders and pay civil servants, laid out his plans after the 12 most powerful regional leaders signed a resolution on Tuesday to hand over their customs revenue and income from state enterprises in their areas. At a news conference today, Mr. Ghani explained how he intended to make them stick to their promises. 
 Finance Ministry delegations will set out on Saturday for the four main border regions to examine customs operations and report back to the Finance Ministry. Mr. Ghani said he would personally travel to the western town of Herat, in the nation's most profitable province, which is gathering hundred of thousands of dollars in customs revenue daily. 
"I'll stay as long as it takes to organize the flows of revenue to the central government and to determine allocations for the province of Herat," Mr. Ghani said.
It is a crucial moment for Afghanistan, which relies on international donors for most of its national budget and has almost no revenue of its own to pay government workers and lift the country out of penury. 
"I think the major results will be in a month, but the first initial changes will start next week," Mr. Ghani said. "By the end of next week we should be able to report on significant flows of resources, from the revenue of customs initially," he said.
He said he would change the finance directors and customs directors in all the provinces within the next month, and overhaul the customs houses in every province. The campaign would go hand in hand with a new campaign against corruption that was to be announced shortly by President Hamid Karzai, he said.
The two main figures who will be under the spotlight in coming weeks are Ismail Khan, the governor of Herat and self-styled emir of western Afghanistan, and Abdul Rashid Dostum, the general and deputy defense minister who commands much of northern Afghanistan. Both men preside over hugely lucrative regions, with Mr. Khan drawing in an estimated $400 million a year in customs from a busy trade from Iran, and General Dostum controlling Afghanistan's oil and gas fields and Soviet-built fertilizer and electricity plants. Both men say they support the idea of a federal Afghanistan and yet have only handed over small sums to the central government.
Under Tuesday's resolution, both men will also have to relinquish their extra titles, Mr. Ghani said. Mr. Khan will have to drop one of his roles as governor of Herat and commander of the Fourth Army Corps, and General Dostum will no longer bear the title of special representative of the president, which allowed him executive powers over appointments in the north.
Whether the two men, and other powerful regional warlords, keep their promises is an open question. Mr. Karzai has been urged to move against the regional commanders for months. Mr. Ghani insisted today that the government had the moral authority to implement the reforms. 
If the government fails, Mr. Ghani added, the president is serious in his threat to resign. He said he would also resign if it became clear that his efforts were going nowhere.

HEADLINE: Sports Authority's Earnings Fall Sharply 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Sports Authority Inc., the biggest sporting goods chain, said yesterday that its first-quarter profit tumbled 71 percent after an accounting change and a decline in sales.
 Net income fell to $489,000, or 1 cent a share, from $1.7 million, or 5 cents a share, a year earlier, the company said. 
Sales in the period, which ended May 3, fell 4.1 percent to $339.1 million. 
 Sales at stores open at least a year declined 5.7 percent from the year-earlier period as snowstorms and the sluggish economy pared consumer spending. The company, based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., had costs of $400,000 for a change in how it accounts for discounts received from suppliers and $600,000 for the restructuring of stores.
In February, Sports Authority agreed to merge with Gart Sports in a $182.6 million transaction. The merged companies will have 385 stores in 45 states.
Excluding the charges, Sports Authority said it would have earned 4 cents a share, better than a loss of 1 cent a share expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call.

HEADLINE: Fear of a Quagmire? 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; Paul Krugman's column normally appears on Tuesdays and Fridays. E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Suddenly the d-word is on everyone's lips. Last weekend the International Monetary Fund released a rather ominous report titled "Deflation: determinants, risks and policy options." The report made headlines by suggesting that Germany is likely to join Japan in the falling-price club. Alan Greenspan hastened to reassure us that the U.S. isn't at imminent risk of deflation. But alert Greenspanologists pointed out that he seemed to hedge his bets, and the fact that he even felt obliged to discuss the issue showed that he was worried.
 Though talk of deflation fills the air, most of that talk is subtly but significantly off point. The immediate danger isn't deflation per se; it's the risk that the world's major economies will find themselves trapped in an economic quagmire. Deflation can beboth a symptom of an economy sinking into the muck, and a reason why it sinks even deeper, but it's usually a lagging indicator. The crucial question is whether we'll stumble into the swamp in the first place -- and the risks look uncomfortably high. 
 The particular type of quagmire to worry about has a name: liquidity trap. As the I.M.F. report explains, the most important reason to fear deflation is that it can push an economy into a liquidity trap, or deepen the distress of an economy already caught in the trap. 
 Here's how it works, in theory. Ordinarily, deflation -- a general fall in the level of prices -- is easy to fight. All the central bank (in our case, the Federal Reserve) has to do is print more money, and put it in the hands of banks. With more cash in hand, banks make more loans, interest rates fall, the economy perks up and the price level stops falling. 
 But what if the economy is in such a deep malaise that pushing interest rates all the way to zero isn't enough to get the economy back to full employment? Then you're in a liquidity trap: additional cash pumped into the economy -- added liquidity -- sits idle, because there's no point in lending money out if you don't receive any reward. And monetary policy loses its effectiveness.
 Once an economy is caught in such a trap, it's likely to slide into deflation -- and nasty things (what the I.M.F. report calls "adverse dynamics") begin to happen. Falling prices induce people to postpone their purchases in the expectation that prices will fall further, depressing demand today.
Also, deflation usually means falling incomes as well as falling prices. In a deflationary economy, a family that borrows money to buy a house may well find itself having to pay fixed mortgage payments out of a shrinking paycheck; a business that borrows to finance investment may well find itself having to pay a fixed interest bill out of a shrinking cash flow.
 In other words, deflation discourages borrowing and spending, the very things a depressed economy needs to get going. And when an economy is in a liquidity trap, the authorities can't offset the depressing effects of deflation by cutting interest rates. So a vicious circle develops. Deflation leads to rising unemployment and falling capacity utilization, which puts more downward pressure on prices and wages, which accelerates deflation, which makes the economy even more depressed. The prospect of such a "deflationary spiral," rather than the mere prospect of deflation, is what scares the I.M.F. -- and it should.
 A decade ago all of these fears might have been dismissed as mere theoretical speculation. But in Japan the whole nasty scenario is playing out, just as the theory predicts. And about five years ago I and other economists began writing academic papers pointing out that what can happen in Japan can happen elsewhere. (Part of the I.M.F. report draws on my work on the subject.) 
 So how seriously should we take the risk that something similar will happen in the world's other major economies? Neither the United States nor Europe, outside Germany, is likely to experience serious deflation in the next year or two. But that's the wrong question -- and we should bear in mind that Japan's economic malaise took a long time to turn into all-out deflation.
 In fact, it's striking how gradually Japan's catastrophe unfolded. When the stock bubble of the 1980's burst, Japan's economy didn't fall off a cliff. By and large the economy continued to grow, if slowly, and the nation didn't have a severe recession until 1998. But year after year, Japan underperformed, growing less than its potential. Though the Japanese government tried to stimulate the economy using the usual tools -- deficit spending, interest rate cuts -- it was never enough. By 1995 or so the economy had slid into a liquidity trap; by the late 1990's it had entered into a deflationary spiral.
 Our own situation is strikingly similar in some ways to that of Japan a decade ago. Like Japan circa 1993 or 1994, the United States is now facing the aftermath of a huge stock market bubble -- the Nikkei and the Standard and Poor's 500 both tripled in the five years before their respective peaks.
Also like Japan, we face a problem not of sharp downturn but of persistent underperformance -- an economy that grows, but too slowly to prevent rising unemployment and falling capacity utilization.
 What's different is that we have Japan as a cautionary example. Is forewarned forearmed? 
 Whatever reassurances Mr. Greenspan may offer, the staff at the Fed is very worried about a Japanese scenario for the United States -- a concern reflected in their research agenda. In a major study of Japan's experience published last year, Fed economists reached two key conclusions. First, Japan could have avoided its current trap if policymakers had been aggressive enough, soon enough. But by the time they realized the danger, it was too late. Second, the Japanese weren't stupid: their relatively cautious policies in the first half of the 1990's made sense given not only their own forecasts, but also those of independent analysts. But the forecasts were wrong -- and the Japanese had failed to take out enough insurance against the possibility that they might be wrong.
 The Fed has taken these conclusions to heart. Once the U.S. economy began to falter, it cut rates early and often, trying to get ahead of the problem. Those cuts certainly helped moderate the slump; but at this point, with the overnight interest rate down to 1.25 percent, the Fed has almost run out of room to cut. (Fed officials believe, for technical reasons, that going below 0.75 would be counterproductive.) And the economy remains weak.
The Fed still has some tricks up its sleeve. Now would be a very good time to announce an inflation target. But it's also clear that the Fed could use some help, at home and abroad. Alas, it's not getting that help.
 The Fed's European counterpart, the European Central Bank, has been far less aggressive in cutting rates. There are economic, institutional and psychological reasons for this passivity, but the central bank's immobility is one main reason why Germany seems set to follow in Japan's footsteps. European governments aren't much help, either. Bound by the "stability pact," which limits the size of the deficits they are allowed to run, they have been cutting expenditures and raising taxes even as their economies falter.
 The Bush administration is, of course, notably unconcerned about deficits. Aren't the tax cuts in the pipeline exactly what the economy needs? Alas, no. Despite their huge size -- if you ignore the gimmicks, the latest round will cost at least $800 billion over the next decade -- they pump relatively little money into the economy now, when it needs it. Moreover, the tax cuts flow mainly to the very, very affluent -- the people least likely to spend their windfall.
 Meanwhile, state and local governments, which are not allowed to run deficits -- we have our own version of the stability pact -- are slashing spending and raising taxes. And both the spending cuts and the tax increases will fall mainly on the most vulnerable, people who cannot make up the difference by drawing on existing savings. The result is that the economic downdraft from state cutbacks (only slightly alleviated by the paltry aid contained in the new tax bill) will almost certainly be stronger than any boost from federal tax cuts.
 In short, those of us who worry about a Japanese-style quagmire find the global picture pretty scary. Policymakers are preoccupied with their usual agendas; outside the Fed, none of them seem to understand what may be at stake.
 Of course, it's possible, maybe even likely, that their nonchalance will be vindicated. Most analysts don't think we'll find ourselves caught in a liquidity trap. And even the Fed believes -- or is that hopes? -- that a surge in business investment will save the day.
 But few analysts saw the Japanese quagmire coming either, and there is now a significant risk that we will find ourselves similarly trapped. Even so, we won't have deflation right away. But by the time we do, it will be very hard to reverse.
 Like the Fed, I hope that doesn't happen. But hope is not a plan.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Is Running Out Of Open Land It Can Build On 

BYLINE:  By LAURA MANSNERUS 

DATELINE: GREENWICH TOWNSHIP, N.J. 

 BODY:
New Jersey, far more densely populated than any other state -- more crowded than Japan or India, for that matter -- is on course for another distinction: it will be the first state, land-use experts say, to exhaust its supply of land available for development.
 The prospect of running out of open space to build on, a phenomenon that planners call buildout, is at the heart of Gov. James E. McGreevey's well-publicized campaign against sprawl. In poll after poll, voters in this most suburban of states say they hate what they see, and elected officials on all levels have taken note. 
 Roughly two million of New Jersey's five million acres are developed, and a little over one million are protected by various levels of government. The state has promised to acquire or preserve enough land, including farmland, to bring the number of protected acres to two million by 2009. Some of the rest is unsuitable for development, leaving less than a million acres to be fought over. Since those estimates were made a few years ago, some of those acres have surely been developed. 
The pace of suburban development is a powerful issue in many other states after a 10-year onslaught of building, but the political and economic tensions are especially raw here, where more people are scrambling over less open space. Builders accuse the governor of thwarting the American dream, environmentalists say builders will kill agriculture, and many towns try to avoid the costs of growth, like developing infrastructure and building schools, by zoning out housing that would bring in children.
The pattern in New Jersey is the very definition of sprawl: land consumption is increasing faster than the population is growing. As in other parts of the country, land is consumed three to four times faster than the population grows. "We're taking bigger bites with each wave of development," said Barbara Lawrence, the director of New Jersey Future, a land-use planning organization.
Some project that buildout will occur within 20 years, while New Jersey's population of 8.4 million is expected to grow by 1 million in that period, but other estimates are that buildout could take many more decades. The timing depends on population and employment growth, which can swerve wildly with the economy. Government could hasten buildout by putting more land off limits to development through environmental controls.
The debate now under way will determine whether the population will continue to spread across the landscape or become more concentrated in the cities and older suburbs. It will determine, in short, what a built-out state looks like.
New Jersey officials do not know how much land has been consumed since the last statewide land surveys, taken in the mid-1990's. Estimates range from 16,000 acres to more than 40,000 acres a year. Mr. McGreevey says the state is losing 50 acres a day to development, a figure that other state officials describe as conservative.
But the rate of consumption may have increased in the late 1990's, many land-use experts say, in a pattern entrenched across the nation. American appetites for space have put ever-smaller families onto ever-larger lots.
"In the '50's and '60's, a quarter of an acre was a lot, and half an acre was huge," said James W. Hughes, the dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers. "Now it's one acre, three acres, five acres."
That change, Mr. Hughes said, portends self-perpetuating congestion. Each new resident, for example, adds 1.2 vehicles. "When you move into a McMansion you need three cars to fill your three-car garage," Mr. Hughes said, "and a big S.U.V. for the two snow days per year."
Each new resident spurs more commercial development, too. Since 1980, Mr. Hughes notes, retail space per capita has doubled and office space per capita has increased sixfold.
In northwestern New Jersey, Greenwich Township, bordering the Delaware River in the southern lobe of Warren County, was transformed by the completion of Interstate 78 and the office parks that came with it across the state from Newark. To look at the landscape here -- say, from the road between the new Home Depot and the new Lowe's -- is to see how New Jersey could quickly run out of real estate.
Splaying east and west on former farm fields are about 800 of the new houses that brought the population of Greenwich Township to 4,365 in 2000 from 1,899 in 1990, a 130 percent increase. A few miles north, off Route 57, big lumber skeletons are rising at the Grande at Scotts Mountain, a subdivision where the lots average 3.4 acres. 
"This is supposed to be a scenic highway, but it's all for sale," said Mike King, the chairman of a civic group that is promoting development in the sagging town of Phillipsburg, near Greenwich Township, and is fighting it in the outlying townships.
Mr. McGreevey inherited a program that spends about $200 million a year to buy open space and preserve farmland, which he rolled into a bigger "smart growth" campaign to steer development to population centers, mostly by making it difficult elsewhere. He issued an edict last month to restrict building near 15 reservoirs, rivers and streams, halting several projects just days from construction, and state officials are working on what they call "the big map," delineating areas where they will impose restrictions on growth.
As for the governor, Mr. King said, "he's thinking all those right things, but it's later than he seems to realize." 
Developers say they have been forced into rural areas as older suburbs, already built out, become prohibitively expensive. Even then, "we are not able to meet demand," said Joanne Harkins, the director of land use and planning for the New Jersey Builders Association. "When they open a new development we have waiting lists. Virtually everything is sold before it's built." 
According to the United States Department of Agriculture, 39 percent of New Jersey's land area was developed as of 1997, while the next on the list were far behind: Massachusetts and Rhode Island at 30 percent and Connecticut at 29 percent.
The department found that about 42,500 acres a year were developed from 1992 to 1997, the latest year for which figures were available. A 1995 survey by the state Department of Environmental Protection found a much lower rate of development, 16,000 to 18,000 acres a year, largely because it did not count open space attached to new buildings, like a wooded campus surrounding an office cluster, as developed.
The state is awaiting results of a new aerial survey and has compiled information from local governments, but those will not show thousands of projects that are in the pipeline.
Bradley M. Campbell, the state commissioner of environmental protection, said that when the aerial photographs are analyzed, "there's every reason to believe the rate will be higher" than the governor's estimate of 50 acres a day lost to development. 
First, Mr. Campbell said, the recent trend -- "a very grim pattern" -- has been accelerating land consumption. Second, he said, rapid economic expansion occurred in the late 1990's. "Third," he said, "there's been no real effort to strengthen regulatory controls on development" until recently.
"What's as troubling as the pace of loss is the location," he added. About 40 percent of new development, he said, is in areas the state classifies as rural or environmentally sensitive.
Mr. Hughes at Rutgers is doubtful that one million new residents will materialize by 2020. In a state that has no room left for new highways, he said, development is self-limiting. "As congestion gets worse, and it's going to get worse, and as it becomes expensive, these inhibitors to growth are going to kick in." 
But Jeff Tittel, the director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club, estimates that "we'll hit buildout within 20 years" in all but Cumberland and Salem Counties, in the far south of the state.
"There could be some pieces left," Mr. Tittel said, "but they would be environmentally sensitive or just junk property."
Environmental regulation is the governor's main means of curbing development, since the guidelines in the State Development and Redevelopment Plan are voluntary. "The time you reach buildout depends on what kind of regulatory controls you have to protect water and wildlife," Mr. Campbell said. "If the right safeguards are in place, buildout may be sooner rather than later."
Developers, while not disputing that, say the administration's anti-growth measures threaten the housing that the state most needs. "When Mr. Campbell's done, there will be no place outside the ghettos for middle-income and low-income New Jerseyans," said Patrick J. O'Keefe, the chief executive of the builders association.
Joseph J. Maraziti Jr., a former chairman of the State Planning Commission, said that builders could see that as a new business model: redeveloping cities instead of expanding the suburbs. "The consensus is like none I've ever seen about revitalizing our cities."
But he added, "It's in our genes as a country that began as a colony. You don't get it out of your system fast -- you should tame the land and expand. There's a lot of momentum behind the idea that goes back 300 years. It doesn't stop because of some speeches and legislation."

HEADLINE: Out of Money, Some School Districts in Oregon End the Year Early 

BYLINE:  By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: HILLSBORO, Ore., May 23 

 BODY:
This affluent Portland suburb shut down its schools today for the summer, three weeks early, becoming the first of 84 Oregon school districts to close ahead of schedule this year for lack of money.
 The early closing here left thousands of parents scrambling for emergency child care, hundreds of teachers seeking temporary jobs and at least a few of the students believing they were shortchanged. 
 "I feel kind of cheated," said Chris Pitts, a graduating senior who took his last English final, bought a yearbook and bade farewell to teachers at Glencoe High School here today. "I'm not going to be as prepared for college as I should be." 
Across the nation, schools have been struggling with budget cuts forced by the recession, and thousands of districts have laid off janitors, canceled school plays or shut down libraries. But only in Oregon, where there is no sales tax to compensate for declining state income tax revenues, has the recession caused such havoc that 84 of the state's 198 districts have been forced to lop off the end of the school year. Six other districts cut days from the year, but not from the end. 
Joseph Rodriguez, the Hillsboro superintendent, said each school day here costs $400,000, about 87 percent of which pays salaries. After the Legislature cut 10 percent of state school aid, Hillsboro's financial shortfall forced him to recommend that the local school board cut 17 days from the calendar, about 15 of which were instructional days. 
"We made the best decisions we could, given very poor resources," Mr. Rodriguez said. "The people of Hillsboro have every right to be upset. I certainly am."
Teachers have been forced to make compromises. John Gibbs, a high school science teacher, said the shortened schedule permitted him to discuss the solar system in his astronomy course but not the stars or the evolution of the universe.
Few students seemed upset by the premature onset of summer.
"Yaaaaaay!" shouted Justin Flock, a 7-year-old at North Plains Elementary School. "Sometimes the math they do in school is kind of hard, and now I won't have to get up early in the morning."
Justin's mother, Jamie Flock, the manager of a flower nursery who volunteers at her son's school each Wednesday by grading spelling tests, rushed to qualify his views. 
"He's a typical little boy with better things to do than go to school," she said. "But the rest of us think this is really a shame because the students needed the time in class."
Nowhere but in Oregon has the school calendar been so disrupted, but a majority of the nation's 15,000 public school districts are facing financial difficulties of varying severity, Dan Fuller, a lobbyist for the National School Boards Association, said. He estimated the 50 states' combined budget deficits at $52 billion to $82 billion.
"Those deficits are putting enormous pressure on school boards," Mr. Fuller said, adding that many local board members have been calling the association's office in Alexandria, Va., about federal help. "They're asking, 'How can I talk to my congressman so they'll understand our problem?' " 
But some national experts said unions and other special interest groups were exaggerating the financial crisis of the nation's schools, as well as the consequences of shutting some schools early.
"The sky is not falling," James Guthrie, a professor of public policy at Vanderbilt University, said. "As a nation we've lengthened the school year, and nobody can see that achievement has gone up. Twenty years ago the school year was, on average, 170 days long, and now it has risen to 180 days. But I haven't seen any startling increases in student achievement in that period."
Oregon law permits local districts to apply for waivers from minimum classroom instruction requirements, which are measured in hours and vary by grade level but are roughly equivalent to 175 days. In most states, laws require a minimum of 180 instructional days, so hard-pressed districts outside Oregon have mostly cut costs in ways other than shortening the school year.
In Hillsboro, 16 miles west of Portland, where 31 schools dot a landscape of rolling farmsteads of red clover as well as several high-tech plants, the early closing has meant a considerable cut in the pay of teachers, administrators and other staff members. According to the local teachers' union contract, a rookie instructor with a bachelor's degree earns an annual salary of $31,174. A teacher at the top of the pay scale, which requires a master's degree and at least 14 years of experience, earns $62,498, Margaret Doherty, an official at the Hillsboro Education Association, said.
But Scott Ellis, a Glencoe High School history teacher who has taught for 23 years and whose pay is at the top of the scale, said his monthly paychecks of April through August were to be reduced by $600 each because of a lost 17 days.
Like his colleagues, Mr. Ellis was obliged to cut back his curriculum, which is organized at Glencoe on a trimester system. Surmising by early spring that the authorities would shorten the school year, he eliminated a two-week overview of early American history that he has traditionally taught at the beginning of his third trimester American Studies course. That meant cutting out the American Revolution, the Civil War and Reconstruction, and picking up the nation's narrative at the beginning of the 20th century.
Five miles to the north, at North Plains Elementary School, Nancy E. Scheele, a second-grade teacher, said she had eliminated the study of magnets in science, monetary calculations in arithmetic and had shortened her lessons on telling time.
Such curricular triage has demoralized most Hillsboro residents, including not only the parent and student groups who have pressed for stable state education aid, but also the antitax campaigners who have helped to defeat ballot initiatives to raise school funds.
"Cutting the school year is a horrible idea," said Tom Cox, a Hillsboro management consultant who ran for governor last year as the Libertarian candidate and who helped to defeat a Jan. 28 ballot initiative that would have raised Oregon's income tax to finance schools, jails and other agencies. "Kids need to be in school. But our taxes are being eaten up by the educational bureaucracy. I would have gone after more concessions from the teachers and kept the schools open."
Ian Atkins, a graduating senior who has organized student protests against the school cuts at the Oregon Capitol in Salem, expressed mixed emotions about the shortened year, which eliminated his final exams.
"I have a giddy feeling that says, 'Great, no finals!' " Mr. Atkins said. "But the adult growing inside me says this won't be great for college transcripts."

HEADLINE: 8 Analysts Are Dismissed By Citigroup 

BYLINE:  By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
Citigroup dismissed eight research analysts yesterday and temporarily withdrew coverage of 117 companies, signaling a fresh initiative by Sallie L. Krawcheck and her research team to reduce costs.
 The cutbacks are the first to affect Citigroup's research operations in the United States since Ms. Krawcheck became chief executive of its Smith Barney unit last October. Other firms, including Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch, have made significant cuts in their research staffs this year, as weakness in trading persists and new regulations make research a more costly proposition. 
 An internal memo disclosed the changes in sector coverage, and Smith Barney analysts disclosed the identities of those being laid off. They include Michelle G. Applebaum, a top-ranked metals and mining analyst who covered Alcoa and AK Steel; Raymond C. Niles, who tracked utilities like El Paso and Duke Energy; Thomas C. Robillard, a wireless telecommunications specialist with responsibility for Motorola; Michael Millman, whose stocks included Harley-Davidson; and Deborah Lawson, a health care specialist.
While Wall Street banks have been aggressively cutting research staff members in the bear market, new rules imposed by regulators will curb the extent to which research departments -- a major cost center for investment banks -- can be subsidized by deal revenues from investment banking departments.
In the past, investment banking revenues have covered as much as 42 percent of research costs, with the rest covered by institutional and retail trading commissions, according to Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.
The combination of reduced commissions from smaller trading volumes and the new regulations have stanched the revenue stream that banks have used to support their research budgets, which exceeded $500 million at some firms during the stock market boom.
"It's about as bad as it can get for the research analyst," Mr. Hintz said. "The cuts so far have been related to Mr. Spitzer," he added, referring to Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general. "Now, though, we are seeing trading commissions drop. Heads of institutional equities divisions at the investment banks are saying I can't afford to pay for research."
Under this new regulatory regime, senior analysts with compensation packages set during the 1990's boom have become expendable, bankers and research officials say.
Ms. Krawcheck has already made a number of organizational changes this year, hiring three new research leaders who have been largely responsible for identifying the sectors and analysts to be consolidated. To oversee global research, she has named William Kennedy, a former co-head of equity research at Nikko Salomon Smith Barney. Jonathan J. Joseph, a former semiconductor analyst at the firm, runs United States-based research, and Jose Garcia-Cantera, a 37-year-old analyst covering Latin American stocks, has been tapped to run Smith Barney's research in Europe. The bank's Hong Kong office also announced yesterday that it had let go its deputy head of Asia Pacific research and three research analysts.
Last year, Ms. Krawcheck was plucked from her post as chief executive of Sanford C. Bernstein by Sanford I. Weill, Citigroup's chairman, and given the mandate to revamp Citigroup's research division.
Mr. Weill was looking for a fresh, young face to run Smith Barney after the firm's reputation was besmirched by revelations that Jack B. Grubman, the former telecommunications analyst, had written positive research reports in return for lucrative investment banking business. Mr. Grubman was fined $15 million by regulators and barred from the industry, as part of a settlement reached between investment banks and regulators
Hiring Ms. Krawcheck, now 38, was a deft move by Mr. Weill, counteracting regulatory pressures he was then facing. With her glittery smile -- Fortune magazine put her on its cover, calling her the last honest analyst -- and her quicksilver smarts, she combined a novel mix of glamour and quantitative skills in a Wall Street executive. That she was running a research company known for its independence made her even more compelling.
Not only had Ms. Krawcheck been recognized for her strong-willed, independent views as an analyst covering the investment banking industry at Sanford Bernstein, she had proved her administrative mettle by presiding over significant changes to Bernstein's research staff.
Now she is embarking on a similar effort at Smith Barney.
As it has been constituted under Ms. Krawcheck, the firm consists of Citigroup's 12,400-plus retail brokers and approximately 300 research analysts globally, with no investment banking whatsoever, making it a unique entity on Wall Street.
For Ms. Krawcheck, as for other executives on the Street, the challenge is to shrink a research bureaucracy that was largely designed to support Citigroup's investment banking and recast it to serve institutional and retail clients. Trading commissions from these sources are on the wane, though, making her charge all the more difficult.
Sectors where research coverage has been halted include airlines, metals and mining and specialty chemicals -- all of them out of favor with investors and thus seen as an unnecessary cost. Smith Barney officials pointed out that coverage of some companies in these sectors could be resumed.
Still Smith Barney expects many of the 117 companies dropped to remain uncovered. According to Mr. Joseph's memo announcing the cutbacks, Smith Barney research had covered 80 percent of the stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 index. That portion falls to 70 percent with the cuts.
Ms. Krawcheck has in the past criticized the widely held view on Wall Street that research is a cost center, incapable of generating its own profits. "Wall Street firms have for years gradually devalued their research," Ms. Krawcheck said in a March speech at the University of North Carolina, her alma mater. "Research became a cost center, like a Xerox machine. And the goal of a cost center is to keep costs down. That isn't necessarily conducive to quality research."
Analysts do not expect Ms. Krawcheck to turn Smith Barney research business into a profit center anytime soon. For that matter, any small profit that it did produce would be a drop in the ocean of Citigroup's $15 billion in net profit last year. More important for Mr. Weill is that Ms. Krawcheck clean up Smith Barney's image and prune what still remains one of Wall Street's larger research organizations.

HEADLINE: No Big Rush To Stocks After Cuts In TwoTaxes 

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON

 BODY:
Investors did not rush into the market yesterday after Congress agreed to sharp cuts in the taxes on dividends and capital gains. Stocks finished up slightly on the day and down for the week.
 But in the long run, the tax reductions could have subtle but significant effects on the financial markets, money managers and stock strategists said. Lower taxes on dividends will make stocks generally more attractive compared with bonds and will increase the appeal of big blue-chip stocks like General Electric, which have above-average dividends, they said. And if the cuts, which are set to expire in 2009, are made permanent, dividends will probably rise substantially over time as companies respond to investors' new desire for higher payouts. 
 The new law will lower the tax rate on dividends and long-term capital gains to 15 percent. Previously, capital gains on investments held for more than one year were taxed at 20 percent, while dividends were taxed as ordinary income at federal tax rates as high as 38.6 percent.
As a result, a taxpayer in the highest tax bracket can keep 85 cents out of every dollar of dividends, compared with 61.4 cents before the tax change. On the other hand, interest payments on bonds will still be taxed as ordinary income.
Deborah Kuenstner, the chief investment officer for value stocks at Putnam Investments, the giant mutual fund company based in Boston, said that she expected that the new law would accelerate the existing trend toward higher dividends. The average company in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index now pays a dividend of about 1.7 percent of its stock price. That yield is only half of the historical average but up sharply from 2000, when dividend yields fell to 1 percent, their lowest level ever.
In the aftermath of the corporate scandals of last year, shareholders are demanding higher dividends as a way for companies to prove that their reported earnings are real, Ms. Kuenstner said. Lower rates on dividends will bolster that process, she said.
"We're in the early stages of pushing the pendulum back to where it used to be," she said.
By allowing investors to keep more of the money that companies pay out, the tax cut should encourage the investors to pay higher prices for stocks, said Tobias Levkovich, the United States equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. Mr. Levkovich said he thought that the dividend tax cut could eventually lift stocks as much as 7 percent to 9 percent, assuming that higher budget deficits do not have broad negative effects on the bond market or the overall economy.
But Mr. Levkovich said the cut would have a more limited effect unless investors thought that it would be made permanent. "The market wants permanency," he said.
The S.& P. 500 rose just 1.35 points yesterday, or 0.14 percent, to 933.22, while the Dow Jones industrial average edged up 7.36 points, or 0.09 percent, to 8,601.38. But utility stocks, which pay some of the highest dividends in the market, rose sharply. The Dow Jones utilities average gained 8.42 points, or 3.6 percent, to 244.90.
For the year, the utilities average has risen 13.8 percent, while the S.& P. 500 index is up 6.1 percent and the Dow is up only 3.1 percent.
Lew Altfest, a money manager and financial adviser in New York, said he expected that stocks with big dividends would rise further over the next few months as small investors, who typically move more slowly than professionals, adjust their portfolios to take advantage of the new law.
"Even a stock like Con Edison, which in the old view would have been a dead company, now has new life because it can be viewed as having an attractive yield relative to bonds, and a tax-free yield as well," Mr. Altfest said. Shares of Consolidated Edison, the New York utility, rose $1.61 yesterday, or 3.9 percent, to $43.02. The company pays a dividend of $2.24 a year, or 5.2 percent.
"For all the skeptical people out there, they represent hard cash as opposed to accounting gimmickry," he said.
Nearly half of dividends are paid to pension funds, university endowments, foreign investors and other investors who already do not have to pay taxes on them, Mr. Levkovich said. Those investors may not change their behavior substantially as a result of the new law, he said.
But Tom Giovene, a Los Angeles hedge fund manager who oversees about $150 million, said he expected that even funds that did not pay taxes would increase the percentage of their assets invested in stocks to take advantage of the longer-term trend toward higher dividends.
"I think you're going to see pension funds pull money out of bonds and pull money out of cash and into attractively yielding dividend stocks," Mr. Giovene said. He said he thought that big companies like G.E., Pfizer and Philip Morris, which have above-average yields and make more than enough money every year to cover their payouts, would be especially attractive.
"I find it perplexing why investors are not paying a greater premium for blue-chip companies with a solid dividend yield, but I think it's a trend that is going to reverse itself," he said.
But Mr. Giovene warned against buying stocks simply because they have a high dividend. Companies that are not generating enough cash to cover their payouts are dangerous because if they do not increase their cash flow they will eventually have to cut their dividends.
Some utilities, especially those that have been hurt by efforts to expand into deregulated markets, fall in that category, he said. For example, his fund has sold short shares of Duke Energy, a North Carolina utility with a 5.9 percent dividend yield, betting that Duke's price will fall. Yesterday, Duke rose 73 cents, or 4.1 percent, to $18.60.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Japan Warn North Korea on Nuclear Standoff 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: CRAWFORD, Tex., May 23 

 BODY:
President Bush and Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi warned North Korea today that any steps it took toward building additional nuclear weapons would be met with a stronger response from the United States and Japan.
 Speaking to reporters at the president's ranch here, the two leaders did not define the tougher measures, and they emphasized their belief that the crisis could be resolved through diplomacy. 
 "We are confident that our diplomatic approach will bring a peaceful solution," Mr. Bush said. "Yet we agreed that further escalation of the situation by North Korea will require tougher measures from the international community." 
The meeting helped advance the White House strategy of a united front against North Korea, especially among the nations, including Japan and South Korea, seen by the administration as most willing to grant concessions to North Korea in the interest of averting a crisis.
Mr. Bush described Japan and the United States as standing "shoulder to shoulder" in their determination not to be "blackmailed by North Korean threats." Mr. Koizumi used almost identical language.
Still, there was some concern among Japanese officials here that some of Mr. Bush's more hawkish advisers would ultimately press him to take a hard line with North Korea and risk a military confrontation that Japan views as having potentially catastrophic consequences for other nations in the region.
Mr. Koizumi alluded to the Japanese concerns even as he emphasized his belief that Mr. Bush would not push North Korea so hard as to risk war. The president, Mr. Koizumi said, "was stating very clearly that our response to North Korea would be different from that to Iraq."
Mr. Koizumi added that the American position was that "all options will remain available," but that Mr. Bush was "confident that a peaceful resolution can be achieved."
Mr. Bush's meeting with Mr. Koizumi had a similar tone to his meeting last week with South Korea's new president, Roh Moo Hyun, who also pressed the United States to rule out military action in response to a North Korean provocation. Like South Korea, Japan fears that war would expose it to conventional, biological and chemical or even nuclear attack from North Korea.
Japan has signaled a willingness in recent months to take a tougher line with the North Korean government of Kim Jong Il, largely in responseto North Korea's admission that it kidnapped Japanese citizens decades ago. North Korea has so far refused to allow all of those who were abducted and their families to return to Japan.
Japan has already threatened to cut off the flow of money to North Korea from North Koreans living in Japan. Today Mr. Koizumi suggested that Japan was ready to do more to help battle North Korea's effort to counterfeit United States currency and cut off North Korea's trade in weapons technology.
"In any event," the Japanese leader said, "Japan will crack down more rigorously on illegal activities.""
White House officials said they had not yet determined what further measures the United States and its allies might take if North Korea takes another provocative step toward expanding its nuclear arsenal or selling nuclear material to other governments or terrorist organizations.
"There are various different ways in which they cannot be helpful, calling out for different sorts of responses," a senior administration official said after the leaders completed their talks.
American officials said they had not decided whether or when to seek additional talks with North Korea. But they said if talks went ahead, they should be expanded to include not just China, North Korea and the United States -- the three countries that participated in an exploratory round of talks last month in Beijing -- but also Japan and South Korea, and later perhaps Russia.
The two countries agreed to step up the pace of their joint efforts to develop missile defense systems. Japan has been conducting research with the United States on systems that could protect it from North Korea's short- and long-range missiles. But it has not yet decided whether to produce and deploy missile defenses, as the United States is urging it to do.
"Basically this is a question where we are sure the Japanese are going to do the right thing," the senior administration official said. "But they have to work it out within their own system."
Mr. Koizumi's visit to Mr. Bush's ranch lasted less than 24 hours, but the president gave him the treatment he reserves for his favorite allies. On Thursday afternoon, immediately after the Japanese leader's arrival here from Tokyo, Mr. Bush gave Mr. Koizumi a driving tour of the ranch, and then lounged by the pool with him for two hours before sitting down to dinner of smoked beef tenderloin.
Their discussions ranged over Iraq, global terrorism and the economy.
A senior administration official said Mr. Bush told Mr. Koizumi that the policy of the United States was to support a strong dollar, a position that has been increasingly in doubt in recent weeks as the administration has signaled its willingness to allow the dollar to weaken against major currencies, including the yen.
Mr. Bush encouraged Mr. Koizumi to continue dealing with his nation's banking crisis, even bringing up the Japanese government's handling of a specific bank.
"I shall tackle deflation," Mr. Koizumi told reporters at the joint news conference, referring to Japan's most intractable economic problem, a broad-based decline in prices and wages. "I shall never allow a financial crisis to occur."

HEADLINE: Love the Worker, Not the Union, A StoreSays As Some Organize 

BYLINE:  By AARON NATHANS

DATELINE: MADISON, Wis., May 23 

 BODY:
In just 23 years, Whole Foods Market has grown from a single store in Austin, Tex., to the largest natural foods chain in the nation. It is widely praised for its folksy style and high-quality goods, offering more than 20 kinds of granola, well-stocked wine shelves, attentive service and a hearty bow to Mother Earth.
 John Mackey, the chairman and chief executive, founded the company on the principles of open communication and empowered employees. Whole Foods workers here have found, however, that the principles do not include embracing labor unions. 
 The first -- and so far only -- successful union drive in Whole Foods' history took place last year in this liberal, pro-labor state capital. In the aftermath of the drive, there were allegations of dirty tactics by each side; a personal plea from Mr. Mackey for the Madison employees to "expand into love"; and the firing of two pro-union employees over what they say was, almost literally, spilt milk. 
Many supermarket workers count on unions for gains in salary, working hours and conditions. Sometimes these concessions drive prices up, and union campaigns often create bad feelings between labor and management. But the tension is especially striking at Whole Foods, which prides itself on social consciousness. Labor advocates now speak of Whole Foods in the same breath as Wal-Mart Stores, which has fiercely kept itself nonunion.
In a written statement, Michael Duffield, a company spokesman, said that Whole Foods fosters "a decentralized, nonbureaucratic environment, and this ability to be fast and flexible is a large part of our success."
"Work environments dominated by unionization are not often characterized in this way," Mr. Duffield added, "and that is why John Mackey, and Whole Foods Market, does not believe that representation by a union is in the best interests of team members" -- the company's term for employees. Mr. Mackey declined to comment.
According to Jennifer Chatman, a professor of management at the University of California at Berkeley: "The chain prides itself as a unionless utopia where employees are team members empowered to solve problems. Because it's a progressive company, it views unions as a sign the company isn't providing employees with all that they need. If you look beyond the immediate financial implications, there's a real identity issue here."
But the financial implications could affect Whole Foods' long-term profits. The company's "unique, labor-intensive culture is indicative of its emphasis on customer service," said Neil Stern, a senior partner for McMillan/Doolittle L.L.P., a retail strategy company. "With unionization comes higher labor costs, and Whole Foods could either absorb those added costs or pass them on to their customers."
Whole Foods opened its Madison store in 1996, and workers soon found themselves at odds with management over a host of issues, like rising health insurance costs. The rumblings grew louder last spring, when the company told store employees they would have to adhere to a dress and appearance code. In this casual-dress city, that meant losing the brightly colored hair, political buttons, and, for Debbie Rasmussen, a "juice bartender," the piercing from her upper lip. "It struck a nerve with a lot of people," Ms. Rasmussen said.
Mr. Duffield said the company does not require uniforms, and the Madison dress code had been more liberal than at other stores. Despite union claims to the contrary, he said, bringing the code into line with other Whole Foods stores did not change its commitment to celebrating individuality. 
Whole Foods acknowledged a larger breakdown in communication, blaming store managers for getting away from the company's culture. The store changed the top managers at the Madison store in May, but the move did not satisfy many workers who believed the problems came from higher up.
Salary issues also fueled the push for a vote. Both Whole Foods and union officials agreed that the store paid competitive wages. Mr. Duffield added that the company has more employees per store than many grocers and a substantially larger ratio of full-time to part-time workers.
Unlike union stores, however, where raises are given by seniority, pay increases are disbursed more subjectively. At the Madison store, workers with the same seniority found they were earning different amounts, and in some cases, new employees made more than existing ones, said Brendan O'Sullivan, a deli department worker who helped organize the campaign to join United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1444.
Soaring health insurance costs were also taking a bite out of paychecks. Many unionized grocery stores fully cover employee insurance, but Whole Foods does not, said Jim Hepner, organizing director of Local 400 in Landover, Md.
When Madison employees voted 65 to 54 in July to organize, Whole Foods executives appeared crestfallen.
In a memo to employees several days later, Mr. Mackey called the vote "a very sad chapter in the history of Whole Foods Market."
"Madison made a mistake in their choice. It may take time for them to realize it, but I believe that they eventually will. We all make many mistakes in life. It is all part of our growth process because that is how we learn, that is how we grow," Mr. Mackey wrote. "When confronted by great stress in life, we have but only 2 choices: 1. Contract into fear. 2. Expand into love."
The workers contend that since the July election, management has fought them and dragged its feet at every turn. A few days after the election, Whole Foods appealed the vote to the National Labor Relations Board, asserting that several workers sought employment at the store to influence the election, and that a different union unlawfully courted a Whole Foods employee by offering him a job elsewhere in exchange for his vote for the union. The union asserted that it did not offer the employee any job until after the votes were counted. The board rejected those claims, ruling the election valid, and collective bargaining began.
But Whole Foods' lawyers canceled two bargaining sessions, citing time conflicts. Local 1444's president, Dan Welch, said Whole Foods was trying to stall until a year after the election, when it would be legal for pro-management workers to petition to decertify the union. The company says it is bargaining in good faith.
"It's just kind of goofy, to be real frank with you," said Chris Sauter, the Local 400 organizing director in Maryland. "It's, 'Look, we want you to be a part of it, we want you to have some part to play in the decision-making process, take ownership of the store.' Yet when it comes to really getting a say and participating in collective bargaining, they fight it tooth and nail."
In November, two employees who were leaders in the unionization drive were fired over an incident that they say they thought was innocent enough. Ms. Rasmussen said she accidentally made a drink with soy milk rather than skim milk. Instead of pouring it down the drain, she gave it to a co-worker, Julie Thayer, to drink, they said.
Both were sent home, and they were fired the next day. They appealed to the National Labor Relations Board, which dismissed their claim. The union has appealed.
"They don't recognize the hypocrisy that this company has made billions on social and environmental consciousness," Ms. Rasmussen said. "It's so hollow."
Mr. Duffield said the two were fired for cause and the dismissals were unrelated to their views on unionization. Whole Foods employees, he said, are a largely happy bunch who appreciate perks like profit-sharing and 5 percent days, when that portion of after-tax income is donated to community organizations.
"A large part of the appeal of Whole Foods Market to our millions of customers and our team members, they tell us, is based on the fact that we are making the world a better place, and have been for over 22 years," Mr. Duffield said.
Things, meanwhile, have gotten ugly in Falls Church, Va., where a second Whole Foods store was set to vote last month on unionizing. After charges of union and management misdeeds flew back and forth, the National Labor Relations Board halted the election.
The labor board is investigating numerous union charges, including one that Whole Foods coerced and retaliated against pro-union employees. Whole Foods packed the store with workers from other locations to influence the vote, the union contends. Mr. Duffield would not comment. In an April 11 letter to employees, Mr. Mackey asserted that some workers did not know they were formally supporting the union when they signed their union cards.
Unions have also recently picketed the Chelsea store in Manhattan and stores in northern New Jersey, and union advocates are starting an organizing drive in Austin, Whole Foods' hometown.
Unions around the country have added Whole Foods to their boycott lists, which also include Wal-Mart.
Jeff Metzger, publisher of Food World magazine in Columbia, Md., said successful companies tend to become targets of organizers. "They've moved the needle forward in the last few years," he said of Whole Foods. "Success breeds interest."

HEADLINE: Republicans Explain an About-Face 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TIERNEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23 

 BODY:
As President Bush was fighting for tax cuts earlier this year, Bruce Bartlett, an official at the Treasury Department during the administration of Mr. Bush's father, went before Democratic legislators on Capitol Hill to acknowledge an awkward bit of history. 
 "Year after year," said Mr. Bartlett, a conservative economist who also served in the Reagan administration, "I heard my party's leaders attacking your party for running up deficits, which exacerbated inflation, raised interest rates, caused premature balding, brought on postnasal drip and all manner of social evils, they said." 
 Today, though, Mr. Bartlett and fellow Republicans are celebrating the passage of tax cuts that will widen the current deficit and could ultimately cost more than $800 billion. What happened to the evils of deficit spending?
Some Republicans, including President Bush, tend to dodge the question by asserting that the tax cuts will promote economic growth that erases the deficit. Many avoid the question altogether, apparently preferring to focus on the short-term political gains of tax cuts rather than the long-term costs to the Treasury. 
But other Republicans, especially ones not up for re-election, acknowledge the rising deficits and still say the tax cuts are warranted. They argue that stimulating the private sector today is more important than balancing the budget. They also argue that forgoing tax cuts would not reduce the deficit anyway because Congress would quickly find new ways to spend the money.
Mr. Bartlett said Republicans' former zeal for balanced budgets was mainly a strategy for reducing government spending.
"Republicans had a hard time explaining why spending is bad, so they seized on the deficit as a proxy," Mr. Bartlett said. "But there's a difference between a deficit resulting from a rise in spending and a deficit resulting from a cut in taxes. One takes resources out of the economy; the other puts resources back in." 
Representative Jim Nussle, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the budget committee, drew another distinction between present and past deficits.
"You can say these are the largest deficits in history in dollar terms," Mr. Nussle said, "but in relationship to the economy, they're smaller than the deficits of the early 90's, and we're now in a time of war and national emergency. We can absorb them."
A constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget was a central pledge in the Contract With America that helped Republicans win control of the House of Representatives in 1994. The amendment was ultimately voted down in the Senate, but it was passed by the House under the leadership of Newt Gingrich. Today Mr. Gingrich said he supported Mr. Bush's tax cuts even though they leave the budget unbalanced.
"Our amendment called for a balanced budget, but with exceptions during times of war or economic difficulty," he said. "I'm sure Congress would have suspended it right after Sept. 11."
Noting the moribund economy and the novel warnings about the risk of falling prices, Mr. Gingrich said, "You're in a period where you want to stimulate investment and consumption in the U.S. to ensure you don't end up in real deflation." 
But what about the warnings that deficit spending will drive up interest rates and leave future generations saddled with debts? Even Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman and no fan of big government, has criticized the notion of cutting taxes without offsetting cuts in spending. But the Bush administration has been loath to make any such cuts. 
"The Bush administration has been associated with unusually rapid spending growth even before the war," said William A. Niskanen, an economist known as a "deficit hawk" who is chairman of the Cato Institute. "There's been no significant spending restraint anywhere in the budget." 
Democrats point to the relatively moderate spending during the Clinton administration as evidence that theirs is the party of fiscal discipline, while Republicans say they deserve credit for restraining the Democratic spending once they took control of Congress. Dr. Niskanen said his analysis of the past half century of federal spending found that it was most restrained during periods of divided government in the 1950's and 1990's. Now that one party the White House and Congress, some conservatives see tax cuts as the only hope for discipline. 
"Unless there's gridlock from divided government," said Milton Friedman, the Nobel laureate economist at the Hoover Institution, "the fundamental fact is that Congress will spend as much as the tax system will raise plus as much more as it can get away with in the form of a deficit. Cutting taxes is the only effective way to restrain spending."
Republican leaders in Congress don't quite share his despair at Congress's fiscal discipline, but they acknowledge the difficulties of restraining their colleagues. The chairman of the Senate budget committee, Don Nickles of Oklahoma, scoffed at the argument by Democrats that Congress should not be cutting taxes at a time when the federal government should be preparing for the baby boomers' retirement needs. 
"Congress is not talking about saving money for anyone's retirement," Mr. Nickles said. "Members are talking about paying for prescription drugs and expanding unemployment benefits. There are plenty of demands to increase spending and a real appetite to do it. But that's going to change because there will be less revenue available."

HEADLINE: With Tax Cut Bill Passed, Republicans Call for More 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23 

 BODY:
The $350 billion package of tax cuts and state assistance approved by Congress today was still being printed when Republican leaders in Congress vowed to bring up more tax cut proposals later this year and extend today's measure for years to come.
 "This ain't the end of it -- we're going to have some more," said Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority leader, shortly before the 1:45 a.m. vote in which the House approved the tax plan. "Our budget says we're going to have $1.3 trillion in tax cuts, and you bet we're coming back for more." 
 The tax bill, which is less than half the size the president originally requested in January, was approved in the House on a vote of 231 to 200, with seven Democrats supporting the bill and one Republican opposing it. The vote in the Senate, just after 10 a.m., was 51 to 50, with Vice President Dick Cheney breaking the tie. Three Republican senators opposed the bill, and two Democrats supported it. 
Fulfilling a prediction that Democrats had made for weeks, Republican leaders said the tax cuts were smaller than they wanted -- shrunk to fit under a ceiling imposed by moderates -- and said they would make certain they eventually became much larger.
"The reason we have to sunset some of these taxes is because we had to fit within an artificial constraint of $350 billion," said Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas, referring to a large number of cuts within the bill that last for only a few years. "What we certainly hope to do is not to sunset these tax cuts, the tax relief for hardworking American families, but instead to allow these to go forward. We will pass new legislation to do it."
The bill includes $320 billion in tax cuts, $20 billion in aid to state and local governments and nearly $10 billion in child credits for low-income people who do not pay taxes. The most immediate effects of the bill will be a check worth $400 per child, for the first two children, that will be mailed to all but the wealthiest taxpayers, and a reduction in withholding rates that should make most paychecks larger this summer.
The reductions scheduled to expire in the bill include cuts in the tax on dividends and capital gains, along with provisions that reduce the tax penalty on two-income couples and increase child credits. Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Finance Committee, said that if those cuts were allowed to expire, they would represent one of the largest tax increases in history, and said Congress would almost certainly keep them from expiring.
Republicans may not even wait until next year to propose a bill to make permanent the new tax provisions on two-income couples and child credits, Mr. Grassley said.
But unlike today's bill, which had special budget protections allowing it to be approved by a majority vote, new tax bills proposed this year would need 60 votes for approval. Still, Mr. Grassley and other members said they believed they could get the votes for popular provisions, if not for the larger cuts favored by Mr. DeLay.
Any new proposals will run into the determined opposition of Democrats, who were furious today at Republicans for pushing through a tax bill they described as ruinous and unfair to the poor. If the Republicans are able to extend the cuts in the bill, they said, its actual cost would be closer to $1 trillion.
"This tax bill is one of the most dangerous and destructive and dishonorable acts of government that I've ever seen," said Senator Mark Dayton, Democrat of Minnesota. "It is a shameful looting of the federal treasury by the rich and powerful of America, compliments of their friends in Congress. It uses every trick in the budget book to line the pockets of the upper class."
Democrats said they were particularly incensed that today's tax cut vote came on the same day as the Senate voted to raise the ceiling on the national debt by nearly $1 trillion, the largest increase ever, to cover the escalating federal deficit. The 53-to-44 vote to raise the ceiling came as the Treasury Department said it had only a few more days before it would have to default on its obligations without a higher debt limit.
Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, compared the Republican fiscal policy to a family that kept asking for an increase in its credit limit.
"The fiscally responsible approach is that of the typical Montana family, who rather than just ask for an increase in their credit limit, sits down at the kitchen table and reassesses their budget," Mr. Baucus said. "And so should we."
Republicans attributed the deficit to previous years' spending by Democrats and said there was little point in arguing over the debt limit when it had to be raised to prevent default. They rejected an effort to reduce the debt limit increase, saying it could not be matched in the House, which had recessed for Memorial Day earlier in the morning. The House approved the debt increase last month using an automatic mechanism as part of its budget bill, and Democrats accused House Republican leaders of deliberately leaving town to avoid having an embarrassing vote on the ceiling.
Because of the sunset provisions in the 10-year tax bill, it is structured so that almost all of its effect will be in the early years. According to figures from the Joint Committee on Taxation, 83 percent of the bill's tax reductions will take place in the first three years, after which many of the taxes will rise to the current rate.
Representatives from manufacturing states had particular praise for provisions in the bill that would let businesses write off new equipment purchases and other investments, which they said would spur hiring. But that provision was criticized by environmental groups, who said it was structured to encourage businesses to buy large sport utility vehicles. The provision allows deductions for vehicles heavier than 6,000 pounds, which excludes most cars and smaller trucks.
Senator Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma, said the bill actually cuts taxes in the first three years even more than Mr. Bush first proposed, and he predicted it would have a larger initial stimulative impact than any of the previous proposals.
Many of the provisions in the bill were derided as "yo-yo tax cuts" by Democrats, but Mr. Grassley said that Congress would never let them rise again and that they would still provide more economic energy than anything proposed by the Democrats.
"We've had Democratic leaders complain about this being a yo-yo," he said. "Well, their plan is not even a yo."
Republicans criticized but did not refute studies showing that by far the greatest benefits of the tax bill would go to the wealthy, who tend to have the most dividends and capital gains. The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a nonprofit research group in Washington, calculated that 58 percent of the benefits of the bill would go to the 8.6 percent of taxpayers who make more than $100,000 a year. Although more than half of all taxpayers make $30,000 a year or less, they would receive only 5 percent of the benefits of the bill, according to the center.
This argument was repeatedly described as the "class warfare card" by Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California, the Ways and Means Chairman, during a House debate that became a caustic display of the essential economic platforms of both parties.
"We want to help Americans by letting them keep their own money," Mr. Thomas told Democratic members, "and we're going to have to fight you to do it, because you want to hang on to their money just as hard as you can."

HEADLINE: Detroit Mayor Fights Accusations of Misdeeds 

BYLINE:  By MONICA DAVEY 

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 23 

 BODY:
All the flash the Harley he rides, the hip-hop he listens to and the one-and-a-half-carat diamond that glows from one ear -- makes Kwame M. Kilpatrick, the youngest mayor this city has had in ages, popular on the streets.
 But those signs of his generation, Mr. Kilpatrick contends, may also help explain why seven investigators from the state attorney general's office and the state police are digging into his life. 
 The authorities say they are looking into reports of misdeeds by his team of police bodyguards, assertions that the mayor had a party with nude dancers and Mr. Kilpatrick's removal this month of a deputy police chief who says he was in the middle of investigating those very accusations. 
 Mr. Kilpatrick says that the allegations are all false and that he wants the inquiry because it is the only way to end the flood of rumors.
 "If I was 60 years old, if I came from the 'country club community,' if I came out of an established private firm or something like that, none of these would get the lift that they have," Mr. Kilpatrick said this week in his office. "I guess it's believable that a 32-year-old black man with an earring in his ear has parties like that. It's so unfortunate. I'm here to fight that stigma."
 But as twists emerge virtually daily in newspapers here -- by week's end, a bodyguard resigned -- people worried aloud about damage that the scandal might do to the nation's 10th largest city, a place that has long struggled with a ragged reputation and economic scars.
Officials and business leaders are asking whether business prospects might shy away and whether the city becomes tarnished and loses state aid and political support.
"Image is important," said Maryann Mahaffey, the president of the City Council, which asked for an investigation. "It's unfortunate, because we're doing a lot of great things. We don't need that to get lost in the furor over this situation."
 Some people here say Mr. Kilpatrick and his aides are immature. Ms. Mahaffey, who has been on the council for 30 years, said she did not believe that the mayor's troubles had much at all to do with his generation or his jewelry.
 "I don't think it's his youth," Ms. Mahaffey, 78, said. "I think that it is very heady being the mayor of a big city." 
 When he was 9, Mr. Kilpatrick visited Manoogian Mansion, the mayoral residence on the Detroit River. Mr. Kilpatrick, whose mother, Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick, is in the House of Representatives and whose father, Bernard Kilpatrick, is a former Wayne County commissioner, went to the mansion then to meet Mayor Coleman A. Young.
 "I was in shock, floored," Mr. Kilpatrick recalled. "It's kind of like somebody now meeting 50 Cent or Eminem or one of their heroes in the hip-hop industry. I walked in there and said, 'Wow, I've got to get this job.' "
 After playing football in college -- he still bears the imposing 6-foot-4 295-pound physique -- he taught seventh and eighth graders in the Detroit schools and then won a seat in the state legislature. At the end of 2001, Mr. Kilpatrick beat an opponent twice his age to become mayor.
 In the 11th-floor office where Mr. Young once sat, Mr. Kilpatrick wore a dark suit and slip-on sandals. He proudly rattled off his administration's efforts in a year and a half, new housing, development plans along the river and chain restaurants opening. Still, he said, the rumors will not go away.
 Political circles began whispering about his conduct months ago. The reports became public shortly after May 9, when Mr. Kilpatrick wrote a letter dismissing Gary Brown as a deputy police chief.
 Chief Brown, on the force since 1977, oversaw the professional accountability bureau, which investigates officers. After his ouster, Mr. Brown said that he had been looking into reports about Mr. Kilpatrick's bodyguards, the mayor and his family since March and that the administration had heard about it.
 "The fact is that I was conducting a public corruption investigation, which was my job," Mr. Brown said in an interview in his lawyer's office. "I was doing my job and I got fired for that." 
 Mr. Kilpatrick denied that. Without elaborating, he said that Mr. Brown had failed in other areas and that his removal had nothing to do with an investigation into the mayor's office. 
 Mr. Brown, 49 and soft spoken, said that until that Friday afternoon when his Police Department access card suddenly stopped working, he knew of no problems with his performance and had believed that he would soon be promoted to assistant chief. 
 His inquiry began, Mr. Brown said, after a former bodyguard for the mayor who had been transferred came forward in late March with complaints. Most of them focused on the bodyguards, a group that Mr. Kilpatrick says includes 19 people, although others have said he has more guards. Mr. Kilpatrick acknowledges that two old friends are on the team.
A memo by Mr. Brown dated in April, describes the former bodyguard as saying that other bodyguards drank and drove and had accidents that were not properly reported. He said that some submitted false overtime claims and that he had heard about a party at Manoogian Mansion attended, he said, by the mayor and the nude dancers. One dancer, he added, had a fight with the mayor's wife, who arrived unexpectedly, the memo said.
 Mr. Kilpatrick said that there was no party, that there were no strippers, and that there was no fight. 
"My home is a home," Mr. Kilpatrick said. "My wife, my twin 7-year-olds and my 17-month-old -- this is where they live. It's ridiculous to fathom."
 Of his bodyguards, a group that waits outside events for him with stern faces, Mr. Kilpatrick said he stood by them and did not believe any of the accusations. Yet one resigned on Thursday after questions were raised about his record. The Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press reported today that he was accused in shooting incidents several years ago.
 Meanwhile, the investigation continues. Even figuring out which agency would work on the investigation became a tangle. Eventually, the attorney general's office and the state police agreed to team up, but not before the head of the state police, Col. Tadarial J. Sturdivant, insisted on taking a lie detector test because of reports that he, too, had attended the party at the mansion. Colonel Sturdivant said he did not and passed the test, which the F.B.I. administered last weekend, his spokesman said.
Attorney General Mike Cox, a Republican who angered some Democratic leaders here by stepping into the fray and saying he would lead the investigation, said he planned to move swiftly.
 "Obviously," Mr. Cox said, "there's a bit of a cloud hanging over the city right now. We need to go as fast as the facts will allow."
 That, Mr. Kilpatrick said, is fine with him. 
 Again and again, he returns to the notion that his age and persona may be leading older people "to slide me in there as a misguided, misdirected child." Though he has been called "the hip-hop mayor," Mr. Kilpatrick said people should know that his tastes were not defined so simply. He said he also liked gospel, jazz and Frank Sinatra.

HEADLINE: Expectations of a Jump-Start Are Countered by Wait-and-See 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
The Bush administration is promising big things for the package of $320 billion in tax cuts and $30 billion in aid to states and families that Congress passed yesterday. But independent experts disagree about how much the measure will jolt the economy. 
 John W. Snow, the Treasury secretary, said the plan -- even at half the size of the President's initial proposal -- would "create and secure jobs" for millions of Americans. He did not say exactly how many. 
 For economists outside the administration, the devil is in the proverbial details. 
The most expensive provision of the plan is a five-year reduction in taxes on dividends and capital gains, set to cost $148 billion. In pushing for the elimination of taxes on some dividends, the administration consistently predicted a big lift for the stock market as an invigorating force in the economy. But the measure approved by Congress, which cuts roughly two-thirds of personal taxes on dividends and a quarter of taxes on capital gains, has not exactly sent the market through the roof.
"Ninety percent of the impact is already being reflected in the markets," said Jeffrey D. Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James & Associates. "Clearly it's not the blockbuster that everybody was looking for."
In addition, investors might still see the stock market as too much of a gamble, said Gail D. Fosler, chief economist of the Conference Board, a corporate research group.
"People are not going to buy stocks because of the cut in dividend taxes, because the yield on the stock market is still relatively minor," she said. "I don't think the dividend tax cut empirically changes their impression of the riskiness of making that investment."
Ms. Fosler predicted that the biggest short-term impact would come from the package's other big component: accelerating the tax rate reductions passed in 2001, at a cost of $121 billion in lost revenue from 2003 to 2005. The combination of bigger tax credits for families with children; reduced withholding from paychecks, beginning in July; and refunds for taxes paid in the first six months of this year would quickly ignite consumers' spending, she said. 
But Edward E. Leamer, director of the Anderson Forecast at the University of California in Los Angeles, disagreed.
"Most of these tax reductions accrue to individuals who have savings accounts or discretionary income," Professor Leamer said. Their spending, he said, would not be much affected by "relatively minor changes in their cash flow." Professor Leamer also pointed out that most of the rebate checks issued as part of the 2001 tax cuts appear to have been saved rather than spent.
For months leading up to the agreement in Congress, President Bush and his economic team asserted that only permanent cuts would encourage more spending, saving, investment and job creation. Yet speeding up the 2001 tax changes does not amount to another permanent tax cut. Taxpayers already knew that they would receive permanent rate reductions in a few years; the only new development is that they will have slightly more disposable income from 2003 through 2005.
According to economic theory, the incremental increase in consumers' spending from this discrete increase in income would indeed be small.
Ms. Fosler said she doubted that this theoretical logic would hold in reality, however.
"It's a very complex argument for the behavior of a group that usually tends to be very straightforward," she said. "No. 1, people don't walk around with a calculus, and No. 2, they never believe what the government's going to do in the first place." 
In fact, Ms. Fosler argued, the White House erred politically by calling more attention to the stimulative effects of cutting taxes on dividends than the effects of changes in tax credits and rates.
"The administration has done a very poor job of articulating exactly what the stimulus is in this package," she said. "I think a lot of people who have two kids will be shocked to get an $800 check in the mail."
Either way, Professor Leamer said, the effect on consumers may be of only secondary importance. More significant, in his view, is that the new tax cuts aim at the wrong target, if the goal is stimulating a weak economy.
"The focus on the consumer that both the Federal Reserve and the administration have made has not targeted the basic pathology in the economy right now, which is the weakness in business spending," Professor Leamer said. "Manufacturing jobs are just disappearing. If you wanted to treat the economy, you would try to figure out why it is that manufacturing is plummeting so severely."
The Bush administration has claimed that cutting taxes on dividends would increase corporate spending. And the new plan also speeds up about $55 billion in allowances that would reduce companies' tax burdens, both through early depreciation of assets and expensing of new investment.
Mr. Saut said he thought the new measures were "way too small" to jump-start spending by businesses. In sum, he said, "the stimulative impact in the economy is going to be de minimis."
He also warned that cutting taxes on personal investments to lower the cost of capital -- one of the Bush administration's stated goals -- could have unanticipated negative effects for American workers. Multinational companies, for instance, could take advantage of cheap financing primarily to pay for investment abroad, he said.
"The low cost of capital policy, all it's doing is fostering more capacity in India," Mr. Saut said. "What we need to do is soak up the excess capacity that's already existent in the world. We're eating our young."
Mickey D. Levy, the chief economist of Bank of America, predicted a more positive impact from the tax reductions. Because the business incentives and cuts in taxes on dividends and capital gains operate only for a short period of time, he said, companies and investors might change their behavior to take advantage.
"If you only have a two- or three-year window, you're going to hurry your investment plans into that window," he said. "If you look at the business expensing provision, there you put it on for two years and then take it off. If you're a businessman, you have to say, 'O.K., what do I do now?' "
Mr. Levy estimated that the plan would result in an increase in economic growth of 0.4 to 0.5 percentage points, along with some creation of new jobs in each of the next two years. Congress should have passed a more generous package, he said, but worries about the nation's fiscal position stood in the way.
"The whole process and the end result were unfortunately distorted by everybody's fixation on these silly budget forecasts," Mr. Levy said.
Professor Leamer took the opposite stance, contending that it was important to consider the plan's consequences in the longer term.
"The Bush administration is postponing taxes, not cutting taxes," he said. Future generations will still have to foot the bill, he said, for rising spending. And those demands will only add to the burden of supporting the baby boom generation's bumper crop of retirees with Social Security and Medicare.
"This is just amplifying problems that we already have," he said.

With a Brand Faltering, Prada Designer Returns

BYLINE:  By ERIC SYLVERS

DATELINE: MILAN, May 23 

 BODY:
In 1999, Prada, the Italian maker of luxury goods, was on a buying spree, snapping up fashion-related brands including the designer houses of Jil Sander and Helmut Newton, the Church Group shoe business and a stake in Fendi. Harmoniously integrating the acquisitions afterward was not always a top priority. 
 In Jil Sander's case, it showed. Within a few months of completing the deal, relations between Prada executives and Ms. Sander had grown so sour that she resigned, and the brand she left behind floundered and began losing money. 
 Now, three years later, Ms. Sander has made peace with Prada's chief executive, Patrizio Bertelli, and agreed to return to rescue the brand that bears her name. 
"Sometimes the time is right and sometimes it isn't," Ms. Sanders said in a joint interview with Mr. Bertelli at Prada's spartan Milan headquarters. "When we started the partnership, it wasn't right. We hope to show that you can make a mistake and recover." 
With her new six-year contract with Prada signed this week, Ms. Sander, 58, said she would once again create for the company the simple, elegant clothing that made her famous. Neither she nor Prada would say how much she was being paid to return as the head of creativity and design for the brand. 
She was clearly missed. The business she founded in Hamburg, Germany, in the 1970's, was steadily profitable until she left in 2000, but it slipped into the red in 2001 and lost 26 million euros (about $30.4 million) in 2002 on flat sales, in part because of the costs of adding retail stores in London and on East 57th Street in New York. 
Ms. Sander said she had been given a free hand by Prada to design her line as she liked. While she planned changes in the types of clothing she created, she said, she would remain true to the brand's "attitude and concept." 
"In the three years off, I stepped back and had more time to go out socializing, and I realized that we need to make more eveningwear," she said. "I'm also looking forward to moving more into accessories with the help of Prada." 
Accessories like handbags and shoes are Prada's strength: the company got its start in Milan before World War I as a leather goods maker. Miuccia Prada, granddaughter of the founder, revolutionized the market for high-fashion handbags and backpacks in the late 1970's when she began using nylon and silk in place of leather and canvas. Ms. Prada and Mr. Bertelli, who are married, jointly own the company.
Turning the Jil Sander brand around will not be easy now, when the worldwide economy is sluggish, consumer confidence is low and many upper-income people are sticking close to home. 
"Recent events haven't been very kind to the industry," said Mr. Bertelli, 57. "Americans aren't travelling because they are afraid of terrorism, and the Japanese don't want to leave their homes because they are afraid of SARS." Like most of its competitors, Prada counts on the habit of tourists and business travelers alike to indulge in luxury-goods shopping while far from home. 
Mr. Bertelli said that barring more unexpected economic shocks, the Jil Sander brand should be profitable again by 2005 with Ms. Sander's help. 
For her part, Ms. Sander said she was returning to the company with fresh energy after three years of travel and pursuit of interests in art and interior design. "I basically worked on my spirit," she said. 
Mr. Bertelli needs improved performance from Jil Sander and the rest of Prada's brands to achieve a goal he has been pursuing since 2001 -- taking the company public. Plans for an initial offering have been shelved several times when investor interest repeatedly proved too tepid to yield the offering price Mr. Bertelli wanted.
In the interview, Mr. Bertelli said that the next likely time to consider an offering would be in 2005, when a 700 million euro bond issue that is convertible into Prada shares will come due.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 28, 2003

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Saturday about the return of Jil Sander to Prada as the head of creativity and design for the brand that bears her name misstated the name of a designer house that the company bought in 1999. It is Helmut Lang, not Helmut Newton.

As the 'Next Jordan,' Should James Try to Be Unlike Mike?

BYLINE:  By HARVEY ARATON 

 BODY:
ONE day after news of LeBron James's staggering Nike deal worth a reported $90 million, America's most famous consumer advocate was wondering what the "next Michael Jordan" was going to give back.
 "People say it's unfair to burden an 18-year-old with demands of social consciousness," Ralph Nader said yesterday from his office in Washington. "My answer is that he's not getting an 18-year-old's salary. This contract proves he has enormous bargaining power, a superstar's physical image." 
 When Nader and his sports consumer advocacy group, the League of Fans, wrote James and his agent, Aaron Goodwin, last month, it was a gentle prodding to bargain for third-world workers, to avoid becoming the next Michael Jordan. 
"You are on the verge of choosing to immerse yourself in the world of international commerce," Nader wrote of James's negotiations with the merchandising giants Nike, Reebok and Adidas, "which inevitably brings with it a wide array of complicated and difficult challenges and decisions."
Not surprisingly, Nader was widely accused of maladroitly mimicking the more private mailing, from Martha Burk to Hootie Johnson, on the issue of female membership at Augusta National Golf Club. Goodwin, the agent, did not respond to the letter, or to a phone call yesterday for comment on the fairness of publicly pressuring his prodigy, who has yet to play his first professional game.
Fairness, Nader argued, applies first and foremost to society's victims, not its victors. "We live in a celebrity culture," he said. "This is a strategy based on necessity. There has to be social pressure because the reality is that the people who work in these horrible conditions could come here and call a press conference and not get any of the attention that this kid gets for making $90 million."
After years of being pilloried, Nike has implemented some labor improvements without Jordan's ever risking a dollar. Frankly, I am of the mind that activism must ultimately be more of a calling than a commandment. But beyond the specifics of third-world labor, Nader may unwittingly be making a wider statement that an attitude adjustment by the super sports pitchmen would, in itself, be a wise personal investment. 
In his letter to James, Nader wrote that Jordan has chosen "not to support justice" for improved working conditions in third-world factories that produce products he has richly benefited from. This doesn't mean Jordan has had no positive impact on the sports and entertainment culture. He alone cast the mold that now produces the likes of James, the corporately leveraged soon-to-be Cleveland Cavalier, inside and outside the lines. 
Jordan just never found the motivation to wield his power for causes social or political. He played it safe, down the commercial center. As he said when a black Democratic candidate, Harvey Gantt, tried to unseat Senator Jesse Helms in Jordan's native North Carolina: "Republicans buy shoes, too."
This was no crime, just his choice. But in that context, the recent outcries of injustice -- the hint, even, of racism from Jordan's minions after his firing in Washington -- were downright comical, and cruel, given the charitable and social record of the Wizards' owner, Abe Pollin.
For once in Jordan's professional life, he did not have the leverage. At 40, five years beyond his last playoff heroism, the bottom line is that he was cut because he shot air balls from the front office.
If I were adviser to the reigning pitchman, Tiger Woods, or James, the new Nike pinup, I would be coming to the realization that Jordan's commercial strategy, while extraordinarily lucrative, has come with likability term limits. By comparison, who would have thought more than a decade ago when he retired from the Lakers after contracting the virus that causes AIDS that there would now be more magic in Earvin Johnson's public persona than in Jordan's? 
Johnson found a corporate calling, in the luring of companies to inner-city communities, creating commerce and jobs. Even factoring for inflation, Johnson and even Jordan never made the kind of money James will earn as a teenager. Given that scale, Nader is right. Most of these athletes play in luxurious taxpayer-financed arenas and reap every public benefit. James may be too young to feel the pain of others but he is not too innocent to be told how lucky he is and how he might help.
"As far as our monitoring of workplaces goes, Nike is not very high on the human rights list," Marisol Enyart, the California organizer for the United Students Against Sweatshops, said yesterday.
Blessed with the opportunity to play in Cleveland, a short drive from the poverty in which he was raised in Akron, James can expect Nader and the student group to stay on his case. "We're going to keep trying," Nader said. "I know they'll say, 'He needs to focus on basketball,' that he doesn't need the controversy, but this is not really a controversy anymore. Even Phil Knight admits that," he said, referring to Nike's chief executive. "It's just the right thing to do."
Based on the Jordan model, growing a social conscience, the sooner the better, may also be the smart thing to do, long term.

HEADLINE: Show Me the Money 

BYLINE:  By Lawrence S. Ritter; Lawrence S. Ritter, author of "The Glory of Their Times: The Story of the Early Days of Baseball Told by the Men Who Played It," is the John M. Schiff professor of finance emeritus at New York University.

 ON opening day last year, the payrolls of the Yankees and the Boston Red Sox, totaling $234 million, approximated the combined payrolls of Tampa Bay ($34 million), Montreal ($39 million), Oakland ($40 million), Minnesota ($40 million), San Diego ($41 million) and Florida ($42 million). The Yankees and Red Sox won a total of 196 games in 2002 while losing only 127. Not surprisingly, the six less affluent franchises won fewer than half of theirs.
The genesis of the sport's problems can be traced in part to baseball's infamous "reserve clause," so named because it permanently reserved a player's services to the first team that signed him unless he was traded or released. Players were not permitted to change teams or even to negotiate with other clubs on their own initiative. In 1922, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., speaking for a unanimous Supreme Court, ruled that because baseball was a game, not a business engaged in interstate commerce, it was uniquely exempt from the provisions of the antitrust laws; therefore the reserve clause was legal. Since then, the court has had numerous opportunities to reverse that decision but has chosen to let it stand.
In 1968, the club owners agreed to recognize the recently organized Major League Baseball Players Association as the "sole and exclusive bargaining agent" for all major-league players. Someone should have whispered the words "slippery slope" to them. In 1975, on petition from the association, a labor arbitrator, Peter Seitz, ruled that the reserve clause was nullified if a player played an entire year without signing his contract.
Now in the catbird seat, the Players Association offered an olive branch to the vexed owners. Instead of demanding a strict interpretation of the Seitz ruling, the union agreed to a modified version wherein a player had to be in the major leagues six years before attaining free agency. After six years, players are able to sign with the highest bidder. In the 1980's and 90's, the balance of power in baseball shifted from the club owners to what has become one of the nation's most intransigent trade unions. As the American union movement struggled to keep its head above water, the Players Association won strike after strike. In 1998, Congress passed and President Bill Clinton signed the Curt Flood Act, which repealed that part of the antitrust exemption dealing with labor relations. The repeal was more formal than real, of course, because for all practical purposes the players had already taken care of that little matter all by themselves.
Although they approach the subject from completely different angles, baseball's competitive inequities are the focus of both Andrew Zimbalist's "May the Best Team Win" and Michael Lewis's "Moneyball." Zimbalist offers a medley of free-market remedies designed to enhance competitive equity. On the other hand, Lewis apparently had such a good time monitoring the stratagems of the maverick general manager of the Oakland Athletics, Billy Beane, that he had neither the inclination nor the time to bother with much else. Nevertheless, Lewis's insights regarding the nuances of the market for athletic talent go a long way toward explaining Beane's impressive accomplishments. 
Zimbalist, the Robert A. Woods professor of economics at Smith College, toys with such far-out concepts as the abolition of all antitrust restrictions on baseball. Taken literally, without antitrust restrictions, ball clubs would presumably be free to locate wherever they wished. "If monopoly sports leagues did not artificially regulate the number and location of franchises," he writes, "then markets would be filled according to demand. A media market with seven million households, such as New York, would host a third or a fourth team before a market with 830,000 households, such as Milwaukee, would host its first franchise."
Tantalizing as the ideal of a free-market solution might be, especially to an economist, Zimbalist realizes there is little chance of Congress legislating divestiture (breaking up the monopoly into more than one firm) to create a truly competitive industry. However, he has other arrows in his quiver, including a worldwide player draft with picks in reverse order of league standings, elimination of some of the tax shelters that owners now enjoy and tighter governmental oversight over team movement and labor relations. 
On Aug. 30, 2002, the club owners and the Players Association reached a truce that promises labor peace through 2006. The accord includes revenue sharing and a competitive balance (or luxury) tax on payrolls -- two provisions intended to reduce the gap between the more and less prosperous clubs by transferring funds from the well-heeled to the needy. In principle, Zimbalist approves of both measures as steps in the right direction, although he is concerned that no minimum payroll is stipulated in the revenue-sharing formula; instead of using the funds to augment their payrolls, revenue-receiving clubs might simply pocket the money, which would defeat the whole reason for revenue sharing. 
The luxury tax on payrolls is a shabby excuse for a salary cap. A cap prevents a team from spending over a certain amount on player salaries, while a luxury tax, more permissive, allows payrolls above a certain level but imposes a penalty on offenders. Players dislike both, but the astronomical height of present-day salaries makes it virtually impossible for them to escape culpability. Also, Zimbalist warns, both salary caps and luxury taxes can be partly or wholly avoided by creative accounting, no stranger to either management or labor. 
"Moneyball" is a joy ride at the elbow of Billy Beane, general manager of the Athletics. Can Beane run a ball club? In 2002, with the third smallest payroll in the majors ($40 million), Oakland finished first in the American League West with 103 wins, tied for victories with the mighty Yankees (payroll $126 million), despite losing Jason Giambi, a winner of the American League Most Valuable Player award, to free agency. The A's had also won more than 100 games the previous year, and more than 90 games the year before that.
Beane's strength is that he is skeptical of truisms that pass for wisdom in the establishment -- including players, coaches, managers, scouts and front-office personnel. To him, received baseball doctrine (managing "by the book") amounts to little more than a cobweb of prejudices crying out for objective empirical and statistical validation. 
To explain Beane's success, Lewis, the author of "Liar's Poker," hijacks the concept of efficient markets from the world of finance. An efficient financial market is one in which the prices of securities accurately incorporate all available information. In Lewis's (and Beane's) view, the market for ballplayers is inefficient, largely because evaluation of talent is often distorted by baseball bromides.
There are few baseball maxims that escape Beane's magnifying glass. Can left-handed batters really hit right-handed pitchers better than lefties? How useful are bases on balls in winning ball games? What about stolen bases? Is batting average as good a measure as on-base percentage in evaluating hitting ability? Are high school athletes or college players more likely to make the grade? How to value a hard-hitting outfielder who circles under fly balls guessing where they might come down? Beane has unorthodox opinions on all of these topics, and a sackful more to boot.
Lewis trails after his subject doggedly. See Beane attempt to bluff rival general managers as they haggle over trade bait. See Beane lock horns with Oakland's old-time scouts over which high school and college players the A's should pick in the draft. When a game is under way, see him prowl restlessly, a pinch of smokeless tobacco stuck in his upper lip. See him try to manage games by remote control (front office personnel are barred from the dugout). And when carefully devised plans go awry, watch Beane morph into an enfant terrible and attack the office furniture.
Whether Billy Beane is a prophet or a flash in the pan remains to be seen. In either case, by playing Boswell to Beane's Samuel Johnson, Lewis has given us one of the most enjoyable baseball books in years.

HEADLINE: COVER STORY; 
A Portrait Of a Man Who Knew War's Face

BYLINE:  By Ted Loos 

 BODY:
FORTY-NINE years ago today, Robert Capa stepped on a land mine in Vietnam while covering that country's war against France, becoming the first American war correspondent to die there.
 Capa was only 40, but he had already become one of the world's top war photojournalists. His coverage of the Spanish Civil War produced "The Falling Soldier," the image of a Spanish Loyalist militiaman collapsing into death, which, despite debatable claims that it was staged, still ranks among the indelible images of the 20th century. 
 During World War II, Capa risked his life many times, even parachuting into the Rhine Valley with G.I.'s, and got close to the action with his lightweight Leica camera. He was the only photographer to capture the first wave of the Allied landing at Omaha Beach. 
 "Capa largely invented the way photojournalists look at war today," said Anne Makepeace, who wrote, produced and directed "Robert Capa: In Love and War," an "American Masters" documentary that is to have its premiere on Wednesday night at 9:30 on WNET and other PBS stations.
 "Before him war photography was about generals and the glory of battle," Ms. Makepeace said. "Capa really showed the human costs of war."
 For all of Capa's significance as an artist -- his Life magazine work is legendary -- his personal life was just as compelling.
 Handsome and dashing, he loved to gamble and party, and he spoke a multilanguage hybrid that a friend, the writer Irwin Shaw, called Capanese, the product of a Hungarian upbringing and many travels. 
 In the 1940's he had a romance with Ingrid Bergman, whom he photographed on the set of Alfred Hitchcock's "Notorious," and itis thought that Hitchcock based his 1954 film "Rear Window" on their affair. 
 Naturally filmmakers have been interested in Capa's story, but the rights are controlled by his brother, Cornell, who is dedicated to preserving Capa's legacy.
 "Ever since my brother died, I wanted to make a documentary," said Mr. Capa, 85. "But I did not want a Hollywood-style movie." 
 Mr. Capa had a distinguished photojournalism career of his own at Life and became the founding director of the International Center of Photography in 1974.
 "Cornell went with us because he wanted his brother's work to be the centerpiece, and he didn't want the life to overshadow it," said Susan Lacy, the executive producer of "American Masters."
 Once the rights were secured, Ms. Lacy tapped Ms. Makepeace, a longtime friend and collaborator whose first "American Masters" film, about the photographer Edward Curtis, was shown in 2001.
 "At the beginning I only knew what the average person did -- his war photographs -- but not his life," Ms. Makepeace said. "You cannot find a more amazing story than that of Robert Capa."
 Born Endre Friedmann to a family of Jewish tailors in Budapest, Capa was politically active from an early age, and at 17 left Hungary, where he had protested against the fascist dictatorship.
 Despite a life of bearing witness to violence, Capa always hated it. He once said, "A war photographer's most fervent wish is for unemployment."
 Although Ms. Makepeace called Capa "the first embedded photographer" for his close-up view of five wars, it was not his only beat. He took memorable photographs of movie stars like Humphrey Bogart, captured Picasso frolicking on the beach with Francoise Gilot and documented life in the postwar Soviet Union.
 Probably the most fantastical element of Capa's story is his name and persona change, which occurred in the 1930's, when he and his girlfriend, Gerda Taro, were living in Paris. 
 Taro posed as the agent for a famous photographer named Robert Capa (a name some say was inspired by the film director Frank Capra). The invented Capa was an American photographer too busy to meet with editors. When not out taking the pictures himself, Capa (then Friedmann) pretended to be the darkroom assistant.
 The ruse worked, and the pictures were good enough to get plum assignments. By the time someone figured it out, Capa's reputation was already established. And in 1946, when he became an American citizen, he legally changed his name. 
 "Within 10 years he had become exactly the description he created: a famous American photographer, always away on assignment taking these incredible pictures," Ms. Makepeace said.
 To make her 90-minute documentary, Ms. Makepeace filmed in seven countries, and moved from her home in Santa Barbara, Calif., to New York City, where she lived for more than a year while poring over many of the 70,000 Capa negatives housed at the International Center of Photography.
 "The hard part was, I had to deliver the film in a year," Ms. Makepeace said. "There was a massive amount of material."
 In looking through the images, about 500 of which were used in the film, Ms. Makepeace said that empathy was the common denominator.
 "If you look at the pictures in my film that he took of Nazi soldiers surrendering, they are full of humanity," she said. "The Nazis killed some of his relatives. He would have had every reason to make them look like monsters, but you see their suffering."
 To illuminate Capa's sensibility, both on the job and off, Ms. Makepeace wrangled some big-name interviews. Steven Spielberg appears in the film to talk about how he used Capa's photographs of D-Day for the opening sequence of "Saving Private Ryan." The actress Isabella Rossellini discusses Capa's famous charm and his relationship with her mother, Ingrid Bergman.
 The documentary also includes an interview with the 94-year-old French photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson, who founded Magnum, the photographers' agency, in 1947 with Capa and three other photographers. 
 "It's a real achievement for a filmmaker to tell the story when so few of the principals are around," said Cornell Capa, who appears in the film in an older interview since Parkinson's disease has made it difficult for him to talk on camera.
 Ms. Makepeace said, "Part of the urgency of getting the film done was that we wanted Cornell to be able to see it while he was still alive." 
 Mr. Capa, who took his brother's new name when he came to America, said he was pleased with the film, adding that it brought home to him the unlikely trajectory of his brother's life: a pacifist war photographer who dreamed up an impossibly successful life and then lived it for only a short time.
 "It was all imaginary," Mr. Capa said. "Except that it happened to be true."

HEADLINE: Q. & A.; 
Cigarette Smoke From Co-op Below

 BODY:
 Q. I live in a small Manhattan co-op and have had a serious problem for years now with cigarette smoke coming through my floor from the apartment below. In addition to finding the odor distasteful, I am highly allergic and often get sinus headaches from the smoke. I know that co-ops have rules about noise infiltrating adjoining apartments. Are there any similar regulations for cigarette smoke? . . . Florence Bistecca, Manhattan.

A. Stuart M. Saft, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that most proprietary leases contain a provision that prohibits residents from allowing unreasonable noise and odors to escape from their apartment. Most leases also contain a provision giving residents the right to the "quiet enjoyment" of their apartments. And while either of those clauses could provide a basis for the letter writer to complain to the board, Mr. Saft said, it is unlikely that the amount of smoke entering her apartment would be considered unreasonable.
 "Unless the proprietary lease forbids smoking in apartments, the board cannot stop a lessee from smoking in his or her apartment," he said. "And it is virtually impossible to prevent the smoke from leaving one apartment and entering another."
Mr. Saft recently represented a co-op board, at 180 West End Avenue in Manhattan, that had considered requiring new buyers to agree not to smoke in their apartments. After many complaints, that effort was suspended, pending further review.

A Survivor's Right To Live in a Co-op

Q. My husband bought a co-op apartment in 1982 and lived alone in it as he was divorced at that time. In 1987, he refinanced and added his daughter and son as shareholders on the lease and stock certificate. In 1992, he and I married and have been living together in the apartment ever since, but we did not add my name as a shareholder. Now, he cannot add my name to the stock certificate because his daughter and son object to this solution. According to a letter I received from the co-op's lawyer, I will not be allowed to live in the apartment after my husband's death unless my name is added to the certificate. Can my husband assign me in his will the right to continue living in the apartment after his death? . . . Samira Wahba, Long Beach, N.Y.

A. Arthur I. Weinstein, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that most proprietary leases provide that occupancy of an apartment is limited to the shareholder "and" members of the shareholder's family. "Several court cases have held that the word 'and' means 'with,' " Mr. Weinstein said. "Therefore, under the terms of the proprietary lease, if the letter writer's husband passes away or permanently leaves the apartment, the letter writer would have no right to remain without the approval of the co-op."
Moreover, Mr. Weinstein said, even if the co-op was inclined to grant the letter writer permission to remain without the husband, she would still need the consent of the co-owners, the son and daughter. 
"When the husband transferred ownership of the shares of stock and the proprietary lease to himself and his children, he created ownership rights in the children," Mr. Weinstein said. "And he cannot now extinguish or change those legal rights on his own."
Mr. Weinstein said that if the husband bequeaths his interest in the apartment to the letter writer, that would give the letter writer only an economic interest in the apartment. "She would not automatically become a shareholder and proprietary lessee entitled to occupy the unit," Mr. Weinstein said. "And most co-ops would not consent to a transfer of an interest to a beneficiary of an estate over the objections of the other owners of the unit."

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE; 
Her Inventory Is on the Walls and on the Web

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH SPIERS; Elizabeth Spiers is the editor and sole writer of Gawker.com.

 BODY:
THE gallery owner Jen Bekman wants to make the process of putting art into the world as painless as possible, which may seem counterintuitive in an industry where melodrama, hyperbole and inflation both of egos and prices are everyday realities. Ms. Bekman certainly brings a fresh approach: before opening her own, she had never worked in a gallery. She didn't even have a fine-arts background. 
 What she does have is a photo log, a Web site that can be updated with photos and text frequently. And with that photo log, Ms. Bekman, 33 and a former dot-com executive, recruits new artists, solicits feedback on current work and exhibits exponentially more inventory than her closet-size gallery at 6 Spring Street in Manhattan can possibly hold. She's taking the traditional inaccessibility of the art world and tossing it out the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed window. (Her financial arrangements, however, are traditional: she takes art on consignment and splits the fees with the artists.) 
 Ms. Bekman uses her gallery's photo log -- www.fotolog.net/jenbekman -- to screen new pieces and display current inventory, allowing her to presell pieces before they're shown in the gallery. "The minute that I posted one of Luke Doherty's paintings, I started getting inquiries about buying his work," she said. The photo log also allows her to continue marketing artists who have previously exhibited. "Dana Miller and Mara Bodis-Wollner and Tema Stauffer, who were in the first show -- all their work from that show is still online, and there's still interest."
Ms. Bekman also said she found Tod Seelie through his photo log, www.fotolog .net/x_o. "He shoots film," she said, "but he had digitized so much of it, and he was working on his Web site and he wanted to put some images up."
Like Mr. Seelie, many of Ms. Bekman's recruits are not digital photographers. "I think there's definitely digital photography that fulfills the fine-art category," she said. "There are photographers on Fotolog.net who are just shooting digital and they're producing work that I think is on par with other fine-art photography. But I still see a lot of trepidation from people who come into the gallery."
Digital snobbery aside, Ms. Bekman's Internet scouting has produced results. She has found "maybe a quarter or a third" of her artists online, and casual traffic has yielded several buyer inquiries.
Ms. Bekman is aware of the inherent limitations of virtual exhibits, and she said most buyers know what anyone who has met an "intelligent, fit supermodel" through an online dating site or purchased an "authentic Chanel handbag" on E-bay can tell you: what you see on the Internet isn't necessarily what you get. "They understand that it's just a representation," she said. "They can't print out an image they see online and put it on their wall."
Finding emerging artists through photo logs may be a sexy use of the online medium, but Ms. Bekman said it's not the best. "I think that generally speaking, that's not its strength at all," she said. "What it's really about is creating a visual narrative for people's lives."

HEADLINE: FILM; 
From Nightmare To Home Movie To the Multiplex

BYLINE:  By JULIE SALAMON 

 BODY:
SILLY BILLY may be the best-known children's party clown in New York City. So naturally Andrew Jarecki wanted to include him in the lighthearted documentary he was making about clowns. But as he began to interview David Friedman, who performs as Silly Billy, Mr. Jarecki's first reaction was: what makes this clown so angry?
 Before long, Mr. Jarecki was on the trail of the altogether different story, tragic not comic, that would become "Capturing the Friedmans," which won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival in January and opens in New York on Friday and nationally in June. Simultaneously earnest and pulpy, raising as many questions as it answers, this riveting documentary re-examines the charges of child molestation that resulted in prison for David Friedman's father and youngest brother. 
 This may seem familiar, the routine stuff of television shows like "48 Hours" or HBO's "America Undercover" series. (Indeed, HBO has bought "Capturing the Friedmans" and plans to show it next year.) But the Friedman story is so juicy and is getting so much attention partly because it took place not in a trailer park but in Great Neck, N.Y., the affluent Long Island suburb usually associated with upwardly mobile stories of striving and achievement. The father, Arnold Friedman, was a Columbia University graduate, a longtime, prize-winning high school teacher. The brother, Jesse, was a high school student. Their accusers were boys who had taken after-school computer classes in the Friedmans' basement.
Call it "Dateline" filtered through David Lynch. Even the sprinkler systems maintaining Great Neck's pristine lawns become ominous in the camerawork of Aldolfo Doring. Yet Mr. Jarecki manages to convey sympathy for Arnold and Jesse Friedman, raising significant points that cast doubt on their guilty pleas without making claims for their innocence. At the same time, his film conveys the utter strangeness of this family, its fixation on documenting itself even at its worst -- especially at its worst.
The film is embroidered with vivid and sometimes alarming selections from the Friedmans' weirdly comprehensive home movies. There are the happy Friedmans at birthday parties and at the beach, images so familiar that they seem like stock footage from a collective memory bank. Then, after Arnold and Jesse are arrested, in 1987, come the screaming Friedmans, yelling at one another as the videotape rolls.
In one of those tapes, recorded a year after the arrests of his father and brother, David Friedman is seen sitting in a white T-shirt and boxers on his bed, clearly distraught, talking to the camera. "This is private, so if you're not me, you really shouldn't be watching this, because this is supposed to be a private situation between me and me," he says. "So turn it off, don't watch this."
Yet this private moment is now available to anyone for the price of a movie ticket. "Capturing the Friedmans" casts a spotlight on the most sensitive aspects of documentary filmmaking: what is the responsibility of filmmakers to their subjects, as they transform them from private to public figures? And what's the matter with us, that we can't take our eyes off the screen? Have we lost the ability to distinguish between public and private, or are we just living through a new variation on the old Hollywood dream, in which the fantasies and frailties that are made larger than life happen to be real? Or do we rationalize our prurience by saying that the Friedmans are fair game, having already lost their privacy to the criminal justice system and the reporters who cover it? These issues have become more critical as real-life stories have increasingly rivaled fictional ones in the public imagination.
What specifically changed the course of Mr. Jarecki's story was David Friedman's hostility toward his mother, Elaine. " 'My mother is an idiot,' that was a big theme with him," said Mr. Jarecki, discussing their early interviews. Mr. Friedman kept at it: " 'My mother is crazy, my mother is a lunatic.' " 
That angry outpouring convinced Mr. Jarecki that he needed to meet Elaine Friedman. At the time, he knew only that Silly Billy was an unusually cranky clown, and he wanted to know why. The mother was reticent during their first interview, which appears in the film. "I can't say too much about it," she says about the past, appearing flummoxed. "We were a family."
Mr. Jarecki told me that her use of the past tense broke his heart and sharpened his curiosity. "I didn't know why this family had ceased to be, but they clearly had," he said.
As the filmmaker continued his investigation, he found himself pulled in many directions. Elaine Friedman, who felt she had been unfairly reviled by her sons, became interested in revisiting the case, while a third son, Seth, who lives in California, wanted nothing to do with the project and does not appear in the film. Uncle Howard, Arnold Friedman's brother, a sentimental man in his 60's, agreed to participate simply to help shape a humane portrait of his brother and nephew. David Friedman would have been happy had the movie just gone away.
But it hadn't. Besides the family drama, the filmmaker was uncovering a police investigation that seemed to have been driven more by hysteria than by evidence. Students in the computer class that Arnold taught with Jesse's help had accused them of committing dozens and dozens of sexual acts and acts of physical brutality over a period of years. Parents had apparently noticed nothing untoward until a police investigation began. Yet even as Mr. Jarecki found evidence that the charges were dubious, he also learned about Arnold's pedophilia, which may or may not have been limited to trading sexual pictures of little boys, and about Jesse's assertion that his father had sexually molested him, which may or may not have been a ploy by Jesse's lawyer to obtain leniency.
Mr. Jarecki became overwhelmed. He wondered about his complicity in filming this ravaged family and the consequences of exposing its secrets. "I was tortured by that for awhile," he told me. But he also knew he had stumbled into a story that had lots of potential. He wanted to convince David Friedman -- and himself -- that pursuing the movie was a good thing to do.
So he visited Robert Coles, the child psychiatrist who is the James Agee Professor of Social Ethics at Harvard University as well as co-editor of DoubleTake magazine, published by the Center for Documentary Studies at Duke University. Dr. Coles remembers his initial reaction. "Hearing about some of this, I threw my hands up in the air and said, 'My Lord, What is going on?' " he told me in a telephone interview. "This is trouble enough, let alone trouble for a film. It's a fine line isn't it, between telling the truth and parading the truth?"
But as they talked further, Mr. Jarecki recalled, they found what he felt was a morally satisfying way to proceed with the movie he felt compelled to make. "One of the most interesting things about family secrets is that not everyone in the family wants them to be a secret," he said. "Usually I think it's better for the family for the secret to come out, or it becomes the element that destroys the family."
Filmmaker or shrink? The question becomes particularly pertinent for Mr. Jarecki, a director with only one previous credit, an 18-minute film called "Swimming," made in 1988. He is an unusual filmmaker from an unusual family. His father, Henry Jarecki, is an intimidating character who was for many years one of the world's leading gold traders. Henry is also a psychiatrist, yet his son never considered consulting him about his dilemma. ("He may be the only psychiatrist who doesn't believe in psychiatry," Andrew said coolly. "My father acted as though the talking treatment was touchy-feely and idiotic.") The family has its own private island in the British Virgin Islands. One of Andrew Jarecki's brothers, Eugene, made "The Trials of Henry Kissinger," a provocative 2002 documentary focusing on Christopher Hitchens's book of the same title, charging Mr. Kissinger with war crimes. A half-brother, Nicholas, wrote a show-business book called "Breaking In."
"I was drawn to a story about a father who behaves in ways that have an effect on his son, and he doesn't take responsibility," said Andrew Jarecki. His father had wanted him, the eldest son, to take over the family business. Instead, he chose an enterprise unrelated to either of his father's. In 1988, at 25, he became the co-founder of MovieFone. He and his partners sold the company 11 years later to America Online for stock valued at about $388 million.
So unlike most independent filmmakers, Mr. Jarecki didn't have to worry about the budget as he tried to unravel the Friedmans' convoluted tale. He could pay for lavish aerial shots of Great Neck, where they lived, and keep paying the editor he had hired for three months for almost three years. And he could meet reporters at the Regency Hotel on Park Avenue, not a regular hangout for neophyte documentary filmmakers.
From this varied and steamy psychological stew emerged a film that is impossible to watch without feeling squeamish and without wondering: why did the Friedman family record its own destruction? 
David Friedman, who bought the culpable video camera, said he wanted to record what was happening to the family after the charges were brought against his father and brother because things were moving too quickly to comprehend. He also needed a place to record his thoughts, like a diary. "It was like having a therapist, which I didn't have," he told me. "But it was never meant to be seen. None of the footage had been put into a VCR until Andrew told me he was making this movie."
So why did the Friedmans become convinced that airing family secrets was preferable to the alternative? Yes, there's the Jarecki argument, that the secrets become corrosive. Then there's the other school of thought, that the altered course dictated by revelation isn't necessarily better for everyone, and that some secrets can become the glue that holds families together.
But the Friedmans' secrets had already done their damage. This is why Jesse Friedman says he has no qualms about being in the film, although he was released from prison in late 2001 and is now, at 34, enrolled as an undergraduate at Hunter College, majoring in economics and political science.
"I didn't do anything wrong, and I always wanted to make that known," he said in a telephone interview, his voice still boyish. "I didn't have a problem with Andrew telling the story. My other family members don't feel the same way because they would rather not relive it. But for me, it never goes away. I'm on parole 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and that never changes. I have to register every 90 days as a level-three sexual predator for the rest of my life, unless something changes."
For David Friedman, now 42, appearing in the film is much more fraught. He has perhaps always been aware of the camera's powerful effect. His father recorded David's early magic tricks; he even appeared on "Candid Camera" as a child. He enjoyed the taste of celebrity (and gave his mother's phone number to Mr. Jarecki only after the filmmaker managed to supply him with a copy of that old "Candid Camera" show).
In 1994, by then established as Silly Billy, Mr. Friedman was the subject of a long, cheerful profile in The New Yorker (which he took to his interview with me), in which he told the writer, Susan Orlean: "I think that for a lot of people, having a clown at their kid's birthday party is really important. It's become part of the American dream, like owning a VCR."
Mr. Jarecki's clown film seemed like a good opportunity to Mr. Friedman, who had long been thinking about how to break into television. "An independent movie about me, Silly Billy, that could have been something special for my career," Mr. Friedman told me when we met.
He was devastated when Mr. Jarecki told him that the film had changed. "The movie went from being a film that would help my career to a film that could conceivably ruin my career," he wrote later in an e-mail message.
During our interview, his large dark eyes grew teary at points. He seemed fragile, quite different from the tense, abrasive man captured on film. "I hadn't told any of my friends in all these years about my brother and father because people hold children's entertainers to a standard different from any other career," he said. "When I socialize with my magic friends, even other magicians, and I curse, they all look at me and say, 'Wow, a children's magician cursed.' "
His friends may have been exaggerating the saintliness required for a children's clown. But, he added, "surely there would be a reaction of some of my clients to any suggestion that I come from a family where my father may have been a child molester."
Still, he said he felt he had no choice but to participate and to supply Mr. Jarecki with the family's home movies. His father had died in prison in 1995, but his brother was still in prison and continually being rejected for parole. "It was all about Jesse, about helping him," he said.
If only it were that simple.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 8, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on May 25 about the film "Capturing the Friedmans" misstated the title at DoubleTake magazine for Robert Coles, who advised the film's director, Andrew Jarecki, and misidentified the magazine's publisher. Mr. Coles is editor, not co-editor; the publisher is the DoubleTake Community Service Corporation, not the Center for Documentary Studies at Duke University. The magazine's affiliation with Duke ended in 1999.
Because of an editing error, the article also referred incorrectly to the title of a book by Christopher Hitchens that was the subject of "The Trials of Henry Kissinger," a film directed by Mr. Jarecki's brother Eugene. It was "The Trial of Henry Kissinger"; it was not the same as the title of the film.

HEADLINE: THEATER; 
The Sincerest Form Of Self-Flattery: An Allen Crib Sheet

BYLINE:  By ALEX ABRAMOVICH; Alex Abramovich writes frequently about culture and the arts for Slate and other magazines.

 BODY:
WRITER'S BLOCK" consists of two new Woody Allen one-acts ("Riverside Drive" and "Old Saybrook"), and its recent premiere at the Atlantic Theater in Chelsea marked the first time that Mr. Allen has directed his own original work for a live audience.
 How new, and how original? That's entirely open to interpretation: once upon a time, all you needed in order to enjoy his latest was a healthy sense of humor. These days, you need a crib sheet. 
 The plot of "Riverside Drive" is lifted boldly from Edward Albee's classic 1960 one-act, "The Zoo Story." (In his review of the play in The New York Times, Bruce Weber called it "Albee lite.") And what of it? With Broadway looking more and more like a homage to Hollywood, who could object to a great filmmaker's homage to the theater? Besides, Mr. Allen has a history of riffing on canonical works, from "War and Peace" ("Love and Death") to "Casablanca" ("Play It Again, Sam"). As long as those riffs were delightful, no one thought to complain -- Mr. Allen's jokes were original enough. 
But Mr. Allen stopped being delightful in 1992, when news of his own sexual indiscretions surfaced. He seemed to stop having new experiences, and began cannibalizing his own work with a vengeance: two of his films ("Sweet and Lowdown" and "Manhattan Murder Mystery") were dusted off after desk-drawer decades. He also began cannibalizing his own biography: "Bullets Over Broadway," "Mighty Aphrodite" and "Deconstructing Harry" (which one of his biographers dubbed the "Hooker-Fellatio Trilogy") were just three of his many self-lacerating rants about the many extra-societal privileges an artist's ego affords. 
Before the scandal, which revealed Mr. Allen's affair with Mia Farrow's adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn, Mr. Allen was fond of existential jokes about the expanding universe. Afterward, his universe shrank to the size of his Upper East Side home: he grew solipsistic. His jokes turned stale and formulaic. Our laughter gave way to smirks of knowing recognition (which Mr. Allen seems to have interpreted as encouragement). His anarchic impulse used to be irrepressible -- even the serious, Bergman-influenced "Crimes and Misdemeanors" took time out to triangulate Alan Alda, Mussolini and Mr. Ed. Compare that juxtaposition to the following, from "Riverside Drive": "I, on the other hand, am a true original. Like Stravinsky. Or ketchup." 
Well, that's as good as Mr. Allen gets nowadays, but it's the same shtick he was peddling in the mid-60's, when deflationary takes on highbrow shibboleths seemed somehow subversive. Mr. Allen won that war -- it's thanks to him, in part, that we're all adrift in a sea of cultural signifiers -- but he seems never to have heard the news. Or any other news. Today, Mr. Allen's cultural reference points (which used to be all over the map) seem confined to within a three-block radius of Zabar's. He might as well have written: "Like Mahler. Or matzo-ball soup." We might as well have stayed home and played Mad Libs.
Which, in fact, is what Mr. Allen seems to have done with "Writer's Block," filling in the blanks with phrases, lines and entire swaths of dialogue drawn from his own films. Here, the crib sheet comes in handy: "Riverside Drive" and "Crimes and Misdemeanors" both describe a wealthy man's sexual indiscretion with a slightly unhinged woman. Both women turn out to be blackmailers and threaten to reveal the affair to the men's wives: 
"I want to speak to Miriam!" ("Crimes and Misdemeanors") 
"I want to talk to Lola!" ("Riverside Drive") 
"Just because you've decided I'm through in your life doesn't mean I'm going to roll over and die!" ("Crimes and Misdemeanors") 
"One thing for certain is I'm not some patsy who's going to roll over and play dead!" ("Riverside Drive") 
"She can be gotten rid of!" ("Crimes and Misdemeanors") 
"You have to get rid of her!" ("Riverside Drive") 
"He finds that he is plagued by deep-rooted guilt. Little sparks of his religious background, which he had rejected, are suddenly stirred up. He hears his father's voice. He imagines that God is watching his every move." ("Crimes and Misdemeanors") 
"A weak individual; a domestic crisis; a sexual impasse. . . . Then, one night, he sees his family and is overcome by a flood of memories. Guilt pervades his every pore." ("Riverside Drive") 
The night's second one-act, "Old Saybrook," is another homage (telling you what it's a homage to would ruin the surprise). It's also another cannibalization of Mr. Allen's own films and, like so many of his latter-day movies, it relies on the audience's knowledge of his own biography to flesh out what are often two-dimensional characters. "Art is different from life," one of those characters argues here. "Art is the mirror of life," another replies. "Art is Woody Allen's life," seems to be Mr. Allen's own position. 
AND so, in "Old Saybrook," Bebe Neuwirth finds incontrovertible photographic proof of her husband's affair with her own sister and Richard Portnow confesses to "having an affair with my wife's mother" (not to worry, she turns out to be his stepmother, so morally we're in the clear). Whether or not you will find this funny depends on how much you enjoyed the news of Mr. Allen's own affair (which Ms. Farrow uncovered by finding a stash of sexy Polaroids in Mr. Allen's apartment). It also depends on whether you got the point of all those semi-confessional films a clef ("Celebrity," "Mighty Aphrodite" and not a few others), which seemed to allude to the affair. Some of us got the point immediately. But as Mr. Allen says himself in "Riverside Drive," "a dog doesn't see its own tail."
What a strange thing for a comedian to say! After all, comedy -- especially Mr. Allen's own neurotically self-aware brand -- is rooted in doing just that. Mr. Allen, who spent almost four decades of his life as the consummate New York comedian, has ended up as just another New York curiosity -- the kind who holds his wounds out for our inspection and amusement. But those wounds are nothing we haven't seen before, and there's nothing amusing about them. The longer we keep laughing, the longer they'll take to heal.

HEADLINE: CHOICE TABLES; 
Frogs' Legs to Conch Fritters in Miami

BYLINE:  By ERIC ASIMOV; ERIC ASIMOV writes the $25 and Under dining column for The Times.

 BODY:
WITH its beguiling reputation as a pastel playground, the little slice of sand, surf and Art Deco known as South Beach has come to dominate the public image of greater Miami.
 Yet Miami proper has its own significant strengths, not the least of which are serious, grown-up restaurants that present a stark contrast to the raucous combinations of party and theater that so often pass for restaurants in South Beach. These Miami restaurants, either in the heart of the city, in Coral Gables or Coconut Grove, or along the suburban edges, all have their own particular constituencies. 
 La Broche, a new sibling of a two-star Michelin establishment in Madrid, offers the latest in haute mad-scientist Spanish cuisine, at stratospheric prices. Diego's, in Coral Gables, offers traditional Spanish food to a largely Spanish-speaking clientele, at prices that are only a little bit lower, while Norman's in Coral Gables, where culinary pilgrims have busted their budgets for almost a decade, is still going strong. 
 In contrast to those sky-high prices, blue-collar restaurants like Captain's Tavern, in a plain shopping center, and Big Fish, right on the Miami River, offer simple food at reasonable cost.
 These were among the restaurants I visited with several Miami friends in mid-April.

La Broche
 In almost every way, La Broche is an astonishing place. The quiet, stark white dining room is beautiful in its simplicity, with comfortable chairs of butter-soft white leather and pedestals for the ubiquitous designer bags. Service is professional yet personable.
 The clear partition between the kitchen and dining room, the glass-walled wine room, even the big windows overlooking Biscayne Bay all connote nothing-to-hide. Yet the transformational food is full of secrets, jokes and surprises.
 The meal begins with a procession of snacks and tapas almost too numerous to recall: tiny anchovies embedded in bread crisps; cantaloupe gazpacho with trout eggs; a blue cheese cone filled with celery ice cream; madeleines studded with bits of sausage; even a sweet cocktail of chilled orange-lemon foam and brandy. Each intriguing combination is a sign of the excitement to come.
 The chef, Angel Palacios, favors odd, seemingly unrelated pairings, like a half-dozen tiny lollipops of fried frog leg, each with a gauzy little raviolo filled with herring eggs, a stirring contrast of flavors and textures. Or a fabulous earthy square of poached foie gras, served with delicate marinated eels and apple. Some dishes can be educational as well as delicious, like one billed as chickpea ravioli with mushrooms and duck sweetbreads in a light duck broth. "Of course, they're duck gizzards," our waiter told us. "Ducks don't have sweetbreads."
 The fascinating journey continues with main courses. Smoky little rounds of wood pigeon go beautifully with cubes of quince, alongside a crisp potato enveloped in warm poultry foam. Beef loin, cut in squares like an arrangement of sashimi, is paired with a bread crisp layered with tomato-and-water gelatin and cured, pressed tuna. For simpler desires, an assortment of fish and shellfish is grilled perfectly and served without fuss. Unlike the food, the eclectic wine list includes many conventional choices at not unreasonable prices, like a bottle of 2001 Albarino from Santiago Ruiz for $42. 
 Our meal hit a roadblock with desserts, which lack the dramatic contrasts of the other courses. One, called El Dracula, is a bloodless cola gelatin topped with strawberry foam and vanilla ice cream. Much better are the wonderful Willie Wonka-like petits fours, including cotton candy with a surprise dose of Pop Rocks in the middle that made us laugh.
 All told, a meal at La Broche is an exhilarating adventure. Not every experiment clicks, but taking part is a pleasure.

Diego's
 It's hard to imagine a greater contrast between the self-conscious artistry of La Broche and the old-school pleasures of Diego's. The dining room recalls countless movie sets, with stucco walls, timbered ceiling, phony grape arbors (but real flowers on the tables). The waiters, too, are from central casting, dignified in ties and jackets, expertly filleting fish or saucing the meat tableside as they flirt with the ladies.
 The dining room is almost entirely Spanish speaking, and the businessmen at one table are a sign of Miami's central role in the Gulf and Caribbean economy. Surprisingly, the food, served in enormous portions, is classic Spanish rather than Cuban or South American.
 Gazpacho has the force of a verdant garden, fresh and delicious; a tortilla, the Spanish omelet of potatoes and onions, is perfectly savory. Shrimp in garlic and parsley, enough to feed a soccer team, is exactly as it should be, though boquerones, fresh marinated anchovies, are firm and unyielding.
 You could make an entire meal of appetizers, but Diego's prides itself on certain main courses, like cochinillo, a huge wedge of suckling pig roasted in a wood oven, full of flavor and contrasting textures, from the tender meat glistening on the bone to the crisp, impossibly rich skin. I'm not much of a fan of veal chops, but I may never have had one as good as the one at Diego's, served with big langoustines, their heads still on, gripping the top of the meat. The restaurant's other specialty, sea bass encased in sea salt and baked, emerged from its salty crust dry and overcooked, although it gained from its sauce of aioli and capers. 
 Desserts, too, cover the classics. Torrijas is the Spanish version of the ideal French toast, soaked in milk and wine and dredged in sugar and cinnamon syrup. Rice pudding, also imbued with cinnamon, is a delight. 
 The largely Spanish wine list is full of collectors' items, like a magnum of Vega Sicilia Unico '73 for $1,505. But Diego's does well by the ordinary wine drinker, too, with estimable reds like a smooth and concentrated Ribera del Duero from Condado de Haza for $50.

Norman's
 With four cookbooks, a new restaurant set to open in Orlando in August, another in Los Angeles and yet another in a new Coral Gables mall, and a multitude of other entrepreneurial plans, it would be understandable if Norman Van Aken's attention had wandered from his flagship restaurant.
 Remarkably, Norman's remains at the top of its game. While Mr. Van Aken's signature melange of global influences and local products inspired other chefs in South Florida, too many ended up in the hackneyed realm of New World Cuisine, and Floribbean cooking. But Mr. Van Aken's approach remains as fresh as ever, creating unlikely combinations that are both soulful and stimulating.
 The bilevel 145-seat dining room, with big wood-burning ovens and an open kitchen, has a 1980's feel. Service is courteous and professional. 
 At La Broche, many combinations feel surreal. Here, they are just right. Shrimp as big as chicken drumsticks, crisp on the outside, are stuffed with mashed yucca, yet taste intensely shrimpy. A mojo sauce of sour orange and garlic adds fruit, while a tartar sauce spiked with habanero chili adds heat. It's a pleasure. Soft Vietnamese spring rolls come with a square of lush tuna tataki and a refreshing pawpaw slaw. 
 A main course like bright and garlicky roasted pork Havana, with an equally bright salsa of tiny black beans and a stack of grits, is a knowing take on lechon asado, the ubiquitous roasted pork dish of Cuban Miami. I was a little hesitant about a dish called tuna pad Thai, having experienced enough variations on this Thai noodle dish to know it's usually a synonym for deadly dull. But this version, with plenty of rare tuna with shimmering stir-fried shrimp, peanuts and egg noodles, proved a delicious combination of soft and crisp, crunchy and sumptuous.
 I hesitated again before a dessert description of a "warm chocolate melting cake," but Mr. Van Aken even manages to breathe new life into that hoary cliche, transforming it into a sundae by surrounding it with toasted-nut clusters, rich vanilla ice cream and hot fudge sauce. You can get tired just reading the lengthy description of banana mousse coated in milk chocolate, with toasted cashews and macadamia nut brittle ice cream, but the clarity and intensity of the flavors will wake you right up again.
 The wine list is exceptional, with a strong, intelligent selection of both Old and New World choices. You can find good, less expensive choices like a '97 Savennieres from Domaine des Baumard, with a touch of honey in each sip.A single misstep shows up at the bottom of the dessert menu. Mr. Van Aken offers his own line of "spice creams," a trademarked term that essentially means ice creams with savory spins, like chocolate ancho or vanilla escabeche. The combinations don't work for me.

Captain's Tavern
 Sometimes another plate of macadamia-encrusted snapper in fruit salsa is more than anyone should have to bear. Occasionally you just want a plain piece of fish. Captain's Tavern, hidden away in an unlovely shopping center deep in strip-mall territory, is the antidote.
 With its nautical decor of rough-hewn wood, rigging and mounted fish, Captain's Tavern looks like the template for any number of 1960's-era fish houses. At lunch red tablecloths under glass are set with paper napkins and placemats.
 What Captain's Tavern has to offer is a wide selection of pristinely fresh fish simply prepared at moderate prices. At lunch time it's packed with local people, many of whom choose the day's specials. Conch fritters, a South Florida standard, are among the best I've had, crisp outside and creamy within, just right with some ground pepper and a squeeze of lime. A whole pompano, served broiled, is moist, sweet and delicious. It comes with a steakhouse baked potato, in aluminum foil, and a nice little salad. 
 For dessert, rum cake would make any Cuban grandmother proud, simply soft yellow cake topped with nuts and saturated in rum. The wine list is surprisingly varied, with many good inexpensive choices.

Big Fish
 Like Captain's Tavern, Big Fish is a local institution well off the tourist track. It's perched on the shore of the Miami River, that other body of water, where the sights and sounds are of tugboats, container ships and drawbridges rather than the ocean's body surfers and sun worshipers. 
 While it offers a small covered area, the dining room is largely outdoors. At lunch, lawyers, real estate people and others do business in wicker chairs, sometimes lighting up cigars as they finished a bottle from the modest wine list. My business one afternoon was simply a fried yellowtail, a perfect piece of fish that was light and crisp on the outside, with enough moist, flavorful meat to keep me digging through the bones. 
 At the end of the meal, I wanted no dessert or coffee. I only wanted to remember the sound of the wind flapping the awning, and of course the taste of the yellowtail. It seemed as if I were a million miles from the smell of sunblock in South Beach.

Bill of fare
Prices are averages for dinner for two and include a modest bottle of wine or a couple of drinks, but not tax and tip.
 All these restaurants accept major credit cards. All allow smoking at the bar only except for Big Fish, where smoking is allowed in its open-air dining area. 
 La Broche, 1155 Brickell Bay Drive (11th Street), Miami; (305) 415-0070. Lunch and dinner are served Tuesday through Saturday. Closed Sunday and Monday. About $190.
 Diego's, 65 Alhambra Plaza (between Ponce de Leon Boulevard and South Douglas Road), Coral Gables; (305) 448-2498. Lunch and dinner daily. About $150. 
 Norman's, 21 Almeria Avenue (Douglas Road), Coral Gables; (305) 446-6767. Dinner Monday through Saturday. Closed Sunday. About $175. 
 Captain's Tavern, 9621 South Dixie Highway (98th Street), Pinecrest; (305) 666-5979. Lunch and dinner served Monday through Saturday. Dinner only on Sunday. About $100.
 Big Fish, 55 Southwest Miami Avenue Road, (off Brickell Avenue and Southwest Fifth Street), Miami; (305) 373-1770. Lunch and dinner daily. About $95.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT; 
French and Germans Woo American Tourists

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE

DATELINE: Paris 

 BODY:
JEAN-PHILIPPE PEROL tells his French compatriots to be more pleasant to Americans.
 Mr. Perol, the director general of Maison de la France, a travel trade organization, recently hauled 300 hotel directors and others into a vast hall under the Louvre to preach the benefits of, well, simply being nice. 
 "Attention, I told them," said Mr. Perol, lifting a hortatory finger as he recalled the session, "this year you have to be particularly nice to Americans." 
 In Berlin, several hundred miles east, Natascha Kompatzki is similarly sensitive.
 "I don't know of a single incident againstAmericans, not a single one," said Ms. Kompatzki, the spokeswoman for Berlin Tourism Marketing, the agency that promotes the German capital. "We think people make a clear distinction between Berlin as a tourist destination," she said, "and the policies of the German government."
 The war in Iraq is now for the most part over, yet gnawing concern persists among the French and Germans, whose governments opposed the war, that American animosity may contribute to curtailing the number of Americans who travel here.
 In France, Americans are the largest contingent of foreign visitors, totaling more than 4.5 million in 2001, the latest year for which figures are available. That was more than 7 percent of the total of foreign visitors. In Germany, with four million in 2002, or almost 11 percent of the total, Americans are the second-largest contingent, after the neighboring Dutch. What's more, Americans spend more -- in France, an average 328 euros a trip, or $372 (at 0.88 euros to the dollar) in 2001, as opposed to $150 for British tourists and $88 for Germans. Only the Japanese, at $740, spend more.
 Despite recent history, in both countries some in the tourism business still express optimism. In Berlin, Sabine Held, spokeswoman for the Adlon, the recently restored grand hotel near the Brandenburg Gate, said through an associate that the percentage of American guests has been constant, at 15 to 20 percent. Russian and Chinese tourists have recently taken up some slack. 
 At the George V, the luxury hotel off the Champs-Elysees in Paris, the share of Russians among the guests has risen so far this year to 7 percent, up from 1 percent a year ago, Didier Le Calvez, the director, said recently. Yet in the whole Ile-de-France region, an area around Paris that is slightly smaller than Connecticut, luxury hotels report a drop in occupancy of up to 20 percent in the first three months of this year. At the George V, the percentage of American guests for the same period dropped to 20 percent, from an average 45 percent.
 In Berlin, the number of American visitors had climbed back up in the first two months of this year, after plummeting in the aftermath of Sept. 11, only to drop again with the war in Iraq. 
 Such numbers account for the charm offensive vis-a-vis the United States by French and German travel industry officials. Of course, no one is really sure how much Americans are resisting travel to France. Mr. Perol argued that most Americans who choose to go to France as a destination are not likely to be susceptible to a boycott appeal. "They are largely of a high cultural level, they live in big cities, they tend to come from the East and West Coasts," he said. 
 French surveys suggest reasons for the American absence other than the wish to punish the French. "First, there is the economic situation, then there is the fear of being treated badly by the French," Mr. Perol said. Travel experts in Germany agree, citing fear of violence and terrorist attacks as factors along with the weak dollar.
 "People are generally staying closer to home," said Jurgen Scharrer, the editor of Touristik Report, a trade journal. Germany will launch a tourism offensive in the United States later this year that will concentrate on highbrow and closely defined groups presumably less likely to heed a boycott appeal.
 Berlin, for instance, has joined Hamburg, Munich and Cologne to promote tourism among American gays; for music lovers, 2004 has been designated the year of German music. Special tours are proposed for Jews and German-Americans in search of their roots.
 France, Mr. Perol said, has started a campaign called Bonjour to instill in travel employees the need to make Americans feel welcome. An ad campaign on American television will feature Americans who came and were warmly received. A special travel card, Club France, has been revived to offer Americans special prices and discounts at stores and museums.
 The stress on Paris hotels is evident at the Concorde La Fayette, out past the Arc de Triomphe along the Avenue de la Grande Armee, which is owned by the Societe du Louvre, which also owns the Crillon in Paris and the Martinez in Cannes. While the fighting in Iraq went on, about 20 percent fewer Americans stayed at the Concorde than usual, said Eliane Picard-Monier, the director of communications. But only very few absentees cited anti-French sentiment for staying away. "I think we got one card," she said. At the moment, the Concorde is experiencing an upswing in American bookings. 
 Over on the Left Bank in the Sixth Arrondissement, the Victoria Palace Hotel is offering the night of the Fourth of July free to Americans who come for the weekend. 
 Michael E. Erwin, the director of sales, was traveling in California with the owner, Philippe Schmitt, when the war started. "Some people said they would boycott France, others said they were afraid because the French would be unwelcoming," said Mr. Erwin, who is American.
 "How can I try and explain that the French make a big distinction between politics and day-to-day affairs? You're talking two centuries of friendship here." He would do anything, he said, to get his fellow Americans back to France: "I wish I could offer a barbecue as well."

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN; 
Montreal

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS; CLIFFORD KRAUSS is the chief of the Canada bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
While Montreal is a beguiling place in any season, there is no better time to visit this bilingual city than summer. Rue St.-Denis becomes a joyous scene of dueling cafes, as diners temper the humidity with chilled vichyssoise and Chablis. Day lilies, lilacs and peonies brighten the Botanical Garden. The big bands are back to serenade visitors on the balcony of the Chalet du Mont-Royal. And one cultural festival after another makes Montreal night life sizzle with live music, dancing and avant-garde cinema.
 It is easy to think of Montreal, the second largest French-speaking city in the world, as European, although it is an easy drive from much of New York State or New England. The Old City in particular, with its narrow cobblestone streets, quaint galleries and 18th-century wooden houses, invites comparisons with France. 
 Montreal has been spared the affliction of SARS suffered by Toronto, 200 miles away, and has no reported cases. 
 The mood of the city is upbeat; the economy is strong and the rancorous debate over sovereignty has subsided. New luxury hotels are opening, old ones are refurbishing, and the fashionable shops on the Rue Ste.-Catherine are flourishing.

Events
 Le Grand Prix du Canada, June 13 to 15, www.grandprix.ca, (514) 350-0000, gets summer off to an exciting start with world-class Formula One racing. The Gilles-Villeneuve Circuit is on a lovely island on the St. Lawrence River, but the zooming of cars can be heard throughout the city, packed every year with over 300,000 racing fans. Tickets and packages, $53 for general admission to $292 for the gold grandstand, at 1.42 Canadian dollars to the United States dollar.
 Le Mondial SAQ, formerly known as the Montreal International Fireworks Competition, will be held June 21 to July 30, www.lemondialsaq .com, (514) 397-2000. Eight countries and Hong Kong compete on Saturdays and Wednesdays at 10 p.m., rain or shine. The display is magnificent along the St. Lawrence River, best viewed from balconies around the Old City.
 The Montreal International Jazz Festival, June 26 to July 6, www .montrealjazzfest.com, (514) 871-1881, is Montreal's answer to Mardi Gras and the highlight of the summer. Downtown becomes one big party, with food booths, street performers and craft sellers clogging traffic but creating a festive air. For nearly two weeks the Place des Arts becomes the scene of daily and nightly free concerts. The Ray Charles Big Band, Bobby McFerrin, Norah Jones, the Wayne Shorter Quartet and the Dave Holland Big Band are some of the headliners. Ticket prices range from $10.50 to $60. 
 Just for Laughs, July 10 to 20, www.hahaha.com, (514) 845-3155, is a showcase for comedic talent from around the world. There are free outdoor shows and street theater, plus indoor shows with tickets from $10.50 to $32. This year's stars will include Brad Garrett ("Everybody Loves Raymond"), Eric Bogosian, Kathy Griffin ("Suddenly Susan"), Tina Fey ("Saturday Night Live") and Emo Philips.
Rossini's "Italiana in Algeri," will be performed by L'Opera de Montreal at the Salle Wilfrid-Pelletier-Place des Arts, 260 Boulevard de Maisonneuve West, (514) 985-2258, www.operademontreal.com, on May 31, June 5, 7, 11 and 14. Tickets: $39.50 to $110.50.
 On July 2, the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, www.osm.ca, will perform Mozart's Overture to "La Clemenza di Tito" and Clarinet Concerto and Brahms's Symphony No. 3 at Notre-Dame Basilica, 110 Notre-Dame Street West, (514) 842-2925. Tickets: $16 to $37.

Sightseeing
 Summertime is walking time in Montreal. The pace of life, slower than in other big Canadian cities, invites ambling down Boulevard St. Laurent and Rue St.-Denis to take in the cafes, music shops, boutiques and restaurants. There are fine examples of Beaux-Arts and French Renaissance-style buildings around the Latin Quarter, particularly around Carre St.-Louis, a lovely little park with a modern sculpture garden.
The recreational heart of the city is Mount Royal Park, a leafy expanse designed by Frederick Law Olmsted that is an easy walk from downtown and has the best views in town. Before visiting the park, the best place to find picnic fare -- excellent and reasonably priced Quebecois cheese, cider and crusty bread -- is the Atwater Market, 138 Atwater, which is also a great place to take in the French core of daily life.
 The Montreal Botanical Garden, 4101 Sherbrooke East, (514) 872-1400, www2.ville.montreal.qc.ca/jardin/jardin.htm, is open all year, but its 30 thematic gardens are particularly glorious in summer. The Japanese Pavilion has an exhibition until Sept. 1 exploring the history of green tea. In the Chinese Garden, from July 16 to 20 and 23 to 27, on Wednesday through Sunday afternoons, there will be exhibitions of Chinese, Indian, Japanese, Iranian and Turkish song and dance. Open daily 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., to 6 from June 21 to Sept. 1. 
 The highlight of any walking tour is Old Montreal, which still has cobblestone streets and gas lamps, mansard roofs, fragments of stone walls from the French colonial era and grand bank buildings festooned with copper gargoyles and stone dragons. An alternative to walking is the horse-drawn cart, which costs $60 for an hour's ride. The drivers are bilingual, often funny and knowledgeable about local folklore. They can be found on the Place d'Armes, in front of the Notre-Dame Basilica.
 The Basilica, at 110 Notre-Dame Street West, (514) 842-2925, www .basilicanddm.org, is Montreal's most distinguished building, a fine example of Gothic Revival with soaring vaulting, gilded and carved wooden sculptures and fine stained-glass windows produced in Limoges, France. Admission is $2; a two-hour tour and lecture, by reservation, $7; open daily 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 The other highlight of the Old City is the Montreal Museum of Archaeology and History at Pointe-a-Calliere, 350 Place Royale, (514) 872-9150, www.musee-pointe-a-calliere.gc.ca, which is built around archaeological remains of colonial Montreal. An underground multimedia exposition of six centuries of history, it will present a special exhibit from June 17 to Nov. 2 in collaboration with the Israel Museum: "Archaeology and the Bible From King David to the Dead Sea Scrolls," including three important scrolls discovered on the shores of the Dead Sea. Admission $7. Closed Mondays until June 23.
 The Bonsecours Market, 350 St.-Paul Street East, (514) 872-7730, www.marchebonsecours.qc.ca, an imposing 19th-century market with a splendid silver dome, is home to fashionable boutiques and restaurants.

Where to Stay
 A growing number of boutique hotels have opened in Old Montreal in recent years. An excellent new addition is Hotel Nelligan, 106, rue St.-Paul Ouest, (514) 788-2040, fax (514) 788-2041, www.hotelnelligan.com. Its 35 rooms and 28 suites -- the latter with fireplaces and double Jacuzzi baths -- are furnished in a minimalist manner, but the brick walls give them a warm feeling. The Atrium bar is tasteful and inviting. Doubles begin at $158, including Continental breakfast.
 Auberge Bonaparte, 447, rue St.-Francois-Xavier, (514) 844-1448, fax (514) 844-0272, www.bonaparte.com, is a sweet inn with 31 rooms, two with terraces, and lovely views of the courtyard of the Notre-Dame Basilica. Classical music, Louis Philippe-style furniture and marble bathrooms lend a European feel. The French restaurant downstairs is also excellent. Doubles start at $109, with full breakfast.
 Downtown and convenient for shopping, the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth hotel, 900 Rene Levesque Boulevard West, (514) 861-3511, fax (514) 954-2256, www.fairmont.com, has been newly renovated. Its 1,039 rooms have lovely views of the Mary Queen of the World Basilica and a promenade leading to downtown. The bellhops are happy to show guests Suite 1742, where John Lennon and Yoko Ono stayed and composed "Give Peace a Chance." Doubles start at $161. 
 Budget: Auberge Les Passants du Sans Soucy, 171, rue St.-Paul Ouest, (514) 842-2634, fax 514-842-2912 www.lesanssoucy.com, is a former fur warehouse dating back to 1723, with one wall from a 1689 seminary. It has only nine rooms, rustic but elegant, with fireplaces and wooden ceiling beams, so reservations must be made at least one month in advance. The lobby doubles as an art gallery. Doubles begin at $88, including a generous buffet breakfast.
 Luxury: Hotel Le St.-James, 355, rue St.-Jacques, (514) 841-3111, fax (514) 841-1232, www.hotellestjames .com, is probably the most luxurious in Montreal. It has marble floors, crystal chandeliers, Persian rugs and 61 rooms and suites individually decorated with antiques from Asia and Europe. The spa has a stone wall from Montreal's original fortifications. Rooms range from $229 to $3,520 a night.

Where to Eat
 One of many great deals is Cafe Cherrier, 3635, rue St.-Denis, (514) 843-4308, an unpretentious bistro just north of the Latin Quarter with outdoor seating. Dinner and lunch are served every day, and an a la carte brunch is served on Saturdays and Sundays. Favorites include Toulouse sausages for $9.50 and steak tartare for $9.85. Dinner for two with wine costs around $40.
 One of the hottest restaurants in town is Toque! 3842, rue St.-Denis, (514) 499-2084, fax (514) 499-0292, www.restaurant-toque.com, where reservations must be made at least three weeks in advance. The decor is handsomely simple, but the details go into service. The chef, Normand Laprise, offers a "mystery menu" of six dishes that costs $55, $80 with three glasses of wine. An a la carte dinner with wine for two costs $127. Try the cauliflower soup with foie gras shavings ($11) and the roasted Maine scallops with Israeli couscous ($24). Open for dinner Tuesday through Saturday.
 Ferreira Cafe Trattoria, 1446, rue Peel, (514) 848-0988, fax 514- 848-9375, www.ferreiracafe.com, in the heart of downtown, is a Portuguese place that is one of Montreal's liveliest and most sophisticated restaurants. The tile fresco above the bar, collage of broken plates on the walls and large bouquets of fresh-cut flowers make for a pleasing atmosphere. A dinner that starts with cold gazpacho with chunks of lobster ($10) might go on to include roasted veal filet with a Madeira sauce ($25). Dinner for two with a modest wine from the extensive Portuguese list costs around $120. Closed Sundays; open for lunch and dinner Monday through Friday, dinner on Saturday.
 Schwartz's, 3895 boulevard St. Laurent, (514) 842-4813, is a Jewish deli that has been a fixture since its founding in 1930. Its smoked meat is Canada's answer to New York pastrami. A very hearty lunch or dinner with soft drink costs $5.60 and up a person. Open daily for lunch and dinner. 
 Chez l'Epicier, 11 St.-Paul East, (514) 878-2232, combines a restaurant with gourmet shop in the heart of Old Montreal.

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 5-25-03: CRASH COURSE; 
New Washington Consensus

BYLINE:  By Dirk Olin; Dirk Olin is national editor at The American Lawyer.

 BODY:
Earlier this year, the Bush administration requested $1.3 billion, or a first installment, for the "Millennium Challenge Account," the president's plan to increase foreign aid to unprecedented levels. When combined with his pledges of greater international financing for the fight against AIDS and more loans for developing countries, total foreign aid would spike fully 75 percent, well above Clinton administration levels. But certain academics who have long advocated improving the effectiveness of American largess abroad say that wealthy nations must refine the rules of giving. Specifically, they call for reforming the "Washington Consensus," which tethers development money to "conditionalities" that include market deregulation, privatization of state-owned enterprises and trade liberalization by recipient nations. Otherwise, critics say, aid will be marginally effective, at best. 
 A chief complaint, for example, is that the rich are inconsistent on the issue of trade liberalization. European countries have skewed policies to favor banana imports from former colonies; the United States slaps discriminatory tariffs on steel. A recent study of "developmental friendliness" by the Center for Global Development, published in this month's Foreign Policy magazine, indicates that the relative contributions of the United States and Japan -- which donate the most in absolute dollars -- rank last among big givers when you factor in dynamics like how large the donors' economies are and whether their trade or environmental policies end up counteracting the charity. Hence the reformers' support for "reciprocal obligation" and "development coherence." Unsurprisingly, the criticism has a political analog: President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil and others in South America have gained traction by inveighing against the Washington Consensus. 

Thesis-Antithesis
The origin of foreign aid as we know it came in the waning days of World War II, when American and European economists met in Bretton Woods, N.H., and conceived the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. After the war, these institutions helped to augment the Marshall Plan's emergency stabilization efforts in Europe. Soon, the I.M.F. and the World Bank were directing loans toward poor governments in Asia, Africa and Latin America, typically for specific short-term projects. During the cold war, aid often became politically charged, and by the 1980's the bank and the fund, basically run by the United States State and Treasury Departments, were heavily managing the markets of borrowing countries.
In 1989, John Williamson, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, coined the term Washington Consensus to describe a shift in American foreign aid policy that had occurred. Though this formulation mutated over the years, elements of it proved highly popular throughout the 1990's. In a paper prepared for a 1999 conference of the I.M.F., Moises Naim, a former Venezuelan trade minister and now editor of Foreign Policy, contended that the approach filled an "ideological vacuum" at the end of the cold war -- just as interventionist state regimes and entrenched protectionist practices were coming into widespread disrepute: many developing countries had "no other choice but to fall into the welcoming but stern arms of the Washington Consensus."
Prof. Jagdish Bhagwati, a development expert at Columbia University, concedes that some unregulated capital flows contributed to crises in certain developing countries and regions. But, he says: "As for the criticism that we foolishly imposed a single-size-fits-all approach, that's nonsense. The critics have to decide whether they want the countries to move toward freer trade or toward increased protection. They cannot shirk that choice."

A New Consensus
This is all more family feud than cat fight. There's not much talk about socialist five-year plans and state commodity pricing. There is shared commitment to market instruments and local accountability. Dani Rodrik, a professor of economics at Harvard University, says, "The problem with the consensus is not that it placed the onus on developing countries themselves -- it's that it so often gave them the wrong recipe to follow." But Rodrik is careful to distinguish his argument from the mere advocacy of "gradualism," whose proponents are embroiled in a theoretical tiff with advocates of economic "shock therapy." Rodrik argues for less ideology and more agnosticism. "Gradualism presumes that policy makers have a pretty good idea of the institutional changes they want to make but that for political reasons they have to go step by step," he says. "My argument is that there is typically a large amount of uncertainty about what institutional changes are even desired."
Jeffrey Sachs, director of Columbia's Earth Institute, says you often can't even start to talk about institutions and trade routes and currency policy until you've looked at a society's pre-existing environment: "A lot of the problem with the poorest countries has to do with geography, rather than which new market dial you're going to turn. Africa needs much more help with malaria and AIDS than macroeconomic management. You have to start focusing on real investments that need to be made to alleviate real problems that are barriers to progress, whereas economists -- and I was trained as one -- go on fiddling with the rules without dealing with crippling health problems, the lack of paved roads, miserable soil content, drought or the inaccessible locations of many societies. That's why the same policies can have extremely different effects in different places."
Of course, it wouldn't be wise to allow a revival of ham-handed state controls and onerous reregulation. Even da Silva, in Brazil, has pursued strict monetary and fiscal policies, as well as a variety of market-oriented experiments. The most pressing monetary needs moving forward would seem to be "second generation" reform of currency policies to make them more supple and capital controls that improve "crisis proofing." Outside the ambit of market-speak, inducements to the development of institutions -- think schools, roads, courts and hospitals -- also make sense. Oh, and a little less hypocrisy on the trade front wouldn't hurt. 

Outline of an Idea
From "Did the Washington Consensus Fail?" (delivered at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Nov. 6, 2002), by John Williamson

"Let me remind you of the 10 reforms that I originally presented as a summary of what most people in Washington believed Latin America (not all countries) ought to be undertaking as of 1989 (not at all times): 1) Fiscal discipline. This was in the context of a region where almost all the countries had run large deficits that led to balance-of-payments crises and high inflation. . . . 2) Reordering public expenditure priorities. This suggested switching expenditure in a pro-poor way, from things like indiscriminate subsidies to basic health and education. 3) Tax reform. Constructing a tax system that would combine a broad tax base with moderate marginal tax rates. 4) Liberalizing interest rates. . . . 5) A competitive exchange rate. . . . 6) Trade liberalization. I stated that there was a difference of view about how fast trade should be liberalized. 7) Liberalization of inward foreign direct investment. I specifically did not include comprehensive capital account liberalization. . . . 8) Privatization. This was the one area in which what originated as a neoliberal idea had won broad acceptance. We have since been made very conscious that it matters a lot how privatization is done: it can be a highly corrupt process that transfers assets to a privileged elite for a fraction of their true value, but the evidence is that it brings benefits when done properly. 9) Deregulation. This focused specifically on easing barriers to entry and exit, not on abolishing regulations designed for safety or environmental reasons. 10) Property rights. This was primarily about providing the informal sector with the ability to gain property rights at acceptable cost."

A Home in Manhattan Near Theater and Opera

BYLINE:  By TRISH HALL 

 BODY:
FOR seven years, on and off, Harold and Kappie Hochman looked for a small place in New York where they could stay when they went to the city for plays and opera from their home in Bucks County, Pa., about 10 minutes from Lafayette College in Easton, where he was a professor of economics. 
 They didn't like the hassle of coming in, going out to dinner, going to the theater and then driving the hour and a half home. They figured that if they had a place here, they could bring the dog and come in on the spur of the moment. 
 But everything they saw cost more than they wanted to spend, and as they looked, prices kept rising. "We worked our way through a couple of real estate brokers and then we said, 'We can't afford this,' " Mrs. Hochman said. 
They missed the virtues of New York, which they knew well. Before they moved to Pennsylvania, where they lived for 10 years, Mr. Hochman had taught at CUNY's Baruch College campus and they had lived in Scarsdale, where they raised their two daughters, now in their 30's. 
When Mr. Hochman began to think of retiring, they saw it as their chance to return to New York, at least for part of the year. They started looking again for something bigger, perhaps a classic six with two bedrooms, so they wouldn't feel completely squashed after leaving a 4,000-square-foot house. 
But still the prices were higher than they could imagine spending. The two-bedroom they thought they could get for $600,000 to $800,000 didn't exist. Not the one they wanted, anyway. "I was so bothered by opening windows and seeing solid brick walls," Mrs. Hochman said. 
There were suggestions that they wait until prices come down. "People would say, 'Wait two or three years,' " Mr. Hochman said. "But at our age, you don't wait two or three years. The future is now."
During their search, they happened to meet Mickey Cohen of the Charles H. Greenthal brokerage, whose low-key manner they liked. 
"He gave us some good advice," Mr. Hochman said. "He said, 'Sell your house first and put all the stuff into storage.' " That turned out to be wise, because their home in Durham Township, a California-modern house, took seven months to sell. 
"We've owned six houses, and it was the only one on which we did not make a profit," Mr. Hochman said. Their house in Scarsdale, where they had lived for 17 years before going to Pennsylvania, had taken only three weeks to sell and had netted a large profit. 
Mr. Cohen showed them a number of apartments to buy, including one on 90th Street near Amsterdam Avenue in a six-story prewar building that had recently been expanded to 11 stories. 
The apartment, part of the new construction, was 1,100 square feet with one bedroom, two bathrooms, a separate dining room and a large terrace. But it was $900,000, more than they wanted to spend. 
Because interest rates were so low, they said, Mr. Cohen tried to persuade them to make the leap. "He'd say, 'Another $100,000 is only $5,000 a year,' " Mrs. Hochman said. But they just weren't ready. 
THEY kept looking, but everything they saw compared unfavorably with the 90th Street apartment. Most important, nothing else had its light. The apartment had the feel of a prewar building, with moldings and beautiful floors with inlaid borders, but it had the large windows of a newer building, and light coming from three sides. 
Fortunately for them, a contract on the apartment fell through, and when it did, the building's owner was willing to drop the price. They bought the apartment, a condo, in February for $827,000. 
"We wanted a condo because we want to be able to rent it," Mr. Hochman said. "In a co-op, I have the feeling everyone is trying to tell everyone else how to live. I don't have the patience to handle it."
Even though they spent more than they wanted to, they didn't get a perfect apartment. The bedroom is triangulated to bring in more light but it also has a window by their bed looking out to a terrace that belongs to a neighbor. They had the owner of the building replace the glass so that they can see out but no one sees in. 
They have used the apartment a few times since buying it, but it isn't their primary residence. After selling their home in Pennsylvania, they decided that they would spend more than half the year at their vacation house in Sunapee, N.H., which they have owned for years. 
They are happy with the mix of city and country. "There you do physical outdoor things," said Mr. Hochman, who, now that he has retired, will consult and write. "I like working in the woods." She said they sail and canoe, and "in the winter we run a fireplace all the time."
In the city, they enjoy being just 15 minutes from Lincoln Center. They have subscriptions to both the Metropolitan and New York City Operas. 
They like their new neighborhood for both its convenience and its diversity, both racial and economic. Scarsdale, he said, was "chock full of people with incomes of $1 million a year." Their new neighborhood is more comfortable for them. "It seems to be what some of us would like America to be," Mr. Hochman said.

Court Ruling Broadens Co-op Power

BYLINE:  By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
A RECENT ruling by New York's highest court has proved to be a pleasant surprise for co-op boards and the lawyers who represent them.
 The ruling emphatically ratified a co-op's power to control its own affairs. It did so by affirming a lower court decision that allowed a Manhattan co-op to evict a tenant shareholder for objectionable conduct without first taking the matter to court. 
 The earlier ruling was binding only on courts in Manhattan and the Bronx, and it was, some lawyers said, such a raw extension of a co-op's power that many predicted it would be overturned. But the recent ruling now has statewide application, and it bolsters co-op housing corporations' control over tenant-shareholders. 
"Without a doubt, the landscape of co-op law in New York has dramatically changed," said Ed Fajardo, a Manhattan real estate litigator. "In short, a co-op board's decision to terminate a proprietary lease is protected by the business judgment rule. And the business judgment rule is almost impossible to get around unless fraud or self dealing can be proven." 
On May 13, the New York State Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed an earlier ruling by the Appellate Division, First Department, that allowed a 38-unit Manhattan co-op to evict a tenant-shareholder without going through the standard landlord-tenant eviction process. 
According to the decision written by Judge Albert M. Rosenblatt, the co-op at 40 West 67th Street terminated the tenancy of David Pullman, a tenant-shareholder, in accordance with a provision in the proprietary lease that authorized such action if a tenant engaged in "objectionable" conduct.
Judge Rosenblatt wrote that soon after moving into the building in 1998, Mr. Pullman, "in the view of the cooperative," engaged in a course of behavior that "began as demanding, grew increasingly disruptive and ultimately became intolerable." In addition to making numerous requests to change the services in the building, Mr. Pullman asked that lobby mailboxes be replaced and that 24-hour door attendants be hired. Moreover, Judge Rosenblatt wrote, Mr. Pullman complained about his upstairs neighbors and "in a stream of vituperative letters to the cooperative -- 16 letters in the month of October 1999 alone -- he accused the couple of playing their television set and stereo at high volumes late into the night, and alleged that they were running a loud and illegal bookbinding business in their apartment." 
In addition, Judge Rosenblatt pointed out, Mr. Pullman made alterations to his apartment in violation of house rules, would not respond to board requests to correct these conditions, would not allow an inspection of the apartment and, finally, filed a series of lawsuits against the couple upstairs, the president of the co-op and the co-op's management. 
In June 2000, in accordance with the co-op's proprietary lease, the shareholders held a special meeting to determine whether Mr. Pullman's tenancy should be terminated because of "objectionable" behavior. Although Mr. Pullman had been given notice and an opportunity to appear, he did not attend the meeting. The shareholders voted 2,048 shares to 0 in favor of directing the board to terminate Mr. Pullman's tenancy; 542 shares, including Mr. Pullman's, were not voted.
A State Supreme Court judge ruled it was the court's job to determine whether or not objectionable conduct had occurred, but the appellate division reversed that ruling and said the co-op's decision was protected by the business judgment rule and was not subject to review by the courts. It was this ruling that was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.
When the appellate court decision was rendered, many co-op lawyers believed that the decision -- while welcome -- applied the business judgment rule so broadly that it was likely to be overturned.
"My fear was that the Court of Appeals would decide that the business judgment rule doesn't go this far," said Stuart M. Saft, a Manhattan lawyer who is chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums. Mr. Saft pointed out that under the terms of the co-op's proprietary lease, a two-thirds vote of the shareholders was necessary to terminate Mr. Pullman's tenancy because of objectionable conduct. There was some question, he said, as to whether the business judgment rule -- which protects corporate boards from judicial second-guessing -- would apply to shareholder actions as well. 
In fact, however, the shareholder vote seems to have played a significant role in the court's reasoning, and some lawyers wonder whether a board acting without a shareholder vote would be given as much discretion.
Arthur I. Weinstein, another Manhattan lawyer and vice president of the council, said that while the court seems to acknowledge that co-ops should be treated differently than rental buildings when dealing with tenancy matters -- the court pointed out that co-op shareholders agree to be bound by the co-op's rules -- it is not absolutely clear whether the court's ruling would be the same if Mr. Pullman's tenancy had been terminated by the board rather than the shareholders. 
"In most proprietary leases, termination of a tenancy for objectionable conduct can be made by vote of two-thirds of the board of directors," Mr. Weinstein said. "And since this case included a vote of the shareholders, it is not absolutely certain that the court would rule the same way if it was only a vote of the board of directors."
John T. Van Der Tuin, a Manhattan lawyer who represented 40 West 67th Street, does not see any uncertainty. He said that since the court specifically based its opinion on the business judgment rule, it was clearly indicating the same result would have occurred if the proprietary lease had provided for action directly by the board.
"The fact that there was a unanimous shareholder vote is significant," Mr. Van Der Tuin said. "But the decision does not require a shareholder vote, it only requires compliance with the terms of the proprietary lease."
In fact, he said, the Court of Appeals articulated the conditions under which a co-op board's action to terminate a tenancy would not be protected by the business judgment rule and would be subject to judicial review. 
If the board was acting in bad faith, or outside the scope of its authority and in a way that did not legitimately further the purposes of the co-op, the board's actions would be subject to judicial scrutiny. 
Mr. Van Der Tuin added that he believes that the ruling is clearly beneficial to those who live in co-ops. "You're going to have fewer problems with out-of-control neighbors," he said. "And rather than have long and drawn-out battles in landlord-tenant court, it will be up to the co-op to decide whether someone is engaged in objectionable behavior."
Jeffrey Turkel, a Manhattan landlord-tenant lawyer who represented Mr. Pullman, had a different reaction.
"This is a potentially dangerous decision," Mr. Turkel said. "I think the court viewed co-ops as being these objective, benevolent entities. But that's not strictly true. Co-ops are made up of people, and people have faults and axes to grind."
Indeed, Mr. Turkel said, instead of making co-op living more secure, the ruling could have the opposite effect.
"What the case says is that when there is a battle between the entrenched shareholders and a newcomer, the entrenched shareholders win," he said. 
Mr. Weinstein, the co-op lawyer, disagreed.
"I think the court did an excellent job balancing the interests of co-op boards and individual shareholders," he said. "The court recognized the difference between the economically adversarial battle between landlords and tenants and the voluntary relationship between a co-op shareholder and the cooperative."
Mr. Weinstein pointed out that the court explicitly recognized "that the broad powers of cooperative governance carry the potential for abuse."
The decision, he said, "shifts the burden from the co-op having to prove objectionable conduct on the part of the shareholder, to the shareholder having to prove that the board's action was, in the words of the court, the product of 'unlawful conduct, discrimination, vendetta, arbitrary decision-making or favoritism.' "

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Mamaroneck; 
Waterside Village With Range of Choices

BYLINE:  By CHERYL PLATZMAN WEINSTOCK 

 BODY:
FOR years a boat in the snug harbor of the Westchester County village of Mamaroneck sported a sail adorned with the face of the comic book character Archie. "Archie is the typical boy that lives in every town in America, and Mamaroneck is your typical small town," said Michael I. Silberkleit, the boat's owner and chairman and co-publisher of Archie Comic Publications, which is headquartered here.
 A racially and economically diverse village, Mamaroneck has a busy commercial district, a handy train station and an attractive waterfront. It seems to have retained the kinds of small businesses that disappeared from many other older downtowns when malls and big box stores sprang up. 
 Jack Brewer's great-great-grandfather opened R. G. Brewer Hardware in 1878. Customers still wander its old pine floors, grab items from peg shelves and choose nails and screws from bins. "We exist because we provide old-fashioned service for our customers, and we know everyone by name," he said. 
Giovanni Vozza, 66, and his wife, Rosa, raised four children in Mamaroneck after arriving in 1966 from a village near Rome. "I started working in the garden business and after one year was able to open my own business here as a landscaper," Mr. Vozza said. "Now, whenever I go back to Italy, I miss Mamaroneck. There is no other place like it in the world. It's a friendly village where it is easy to get to know everyone."
Home buyers today find the proximity of the village to New York City, its harbor, its hometown feeling, its diversity, wealth of recreational opportunities and housing stock so desirable that they are willing to wait a long time to find the right house.
In July, Susan and Brendan Murray moved from an apartment in Larchmont to the village, which lies within the towns of Mamaroneck and Rye. "We looked for two years until we found a small 1,200-square-foot, two-bedroom home for under $400,000 in excellent condition with property to expand on when we could afford to," Mrs. Murray said.
This market segment is little served in some other parts of the county, said Maureen McKiernan, an associate broker at Julia B. Fee in Larchmont. "Although the median price of a home in Westchester is now $570,000, the entry price into our area is around $400,000 for a home."
Kathleen Spadaro, owner of Spadaro Ltd. in Mamaroneck, said, "The inventory of homes in the village changes from ranches and small colonials built in the early 1900's that need work to newer homes on the average of 2,500-square feet or more."
Some three- and four-bedroom homes with up to 2,000 square feet on 50-by-100-foot lots go for $500,000. Homes that are even larger or in better condition or on somewhat bigger lots range up to $700,000. There are Cape Cods, colonials and Tudors with prices up to $1 million, and unique homes on special sites that have sold for many millions.
Among the distinctive neighborhoods is Harbor Lawn-Shore Acres on the eastern side of the harbor, bordering the city of Rye. It is an enclave of about 200 homes that is "sought after because it is one of the few neighborhoods along the Westchester shore that offers easy access to beaches, pools and boating," Ms. McKiernan said.
The estate of Robert Ripley of Ripley's Believe It or Not fame is there, as are two of the village's 16 beach clubs. Homes on the market range from $655,000 to $1,649,000 and children attend Rye Neck schools.
A NOTHER special neighborhood is Orienta Point," she said. In 1919, D. W. Griffith set up a film studio there. It was sold in 1925 but the area, once known as "Hollywood in the East," is still distinctive, said Ms. McKiernan, because homes are near the water and the styles vary widely, ranging from small ranches, which start in the $600,000's, to Mediterraneans on the water with a pool and tennis court, which list for more than $9 million.
Harbor Heights has historic homes dating back to the 1800's. Many of them line Melbourne Avenue and range from $500,000 to $600,000, Ms. McKiernan said.
Besides 2,768 single-family homes, the village has nine condominium developments with a total of 575 units, said Leonard M. Verrastro, acting village manager. Ms. Spadaro said the largest is the 114-unit Regatta, where a two-bedroom unit begins at about $325,000. Condominiums can range upward to $1 million for a two-bedroom at Orienta Apartments, which has a pool and private mooring.
There are 11 co-ops in the village with a total of 640 units, said Mr. Verrastro. Two-bedroom units range from $129,900 at Mamaroneck Gardens to $287,000 at Orienta Gardens, Ms. Spadaro said.
There are approximately 20 large rental apartment buildings and 70 other multifamily dwellings of four families or more. Ms. Spadaro said, "A two-bedroom apartment in the village can range from $1,350 to $2,200 depending on its location and amenities."
There is also a 75-unit federally subsidized housing facility in the village, Mamaroneck Towers, for people 62 and older.
The village's array of housing choices is just one allure. Susan and Graham Copley moved to Orienta Point last August from Larchmont. "My husband wanted an easy commute to the city, and we wanted a very diverse, fluid community representing all incomes, races and religions for our three children," Mrs. Copley said.
Almost 20 percent of the 4,648 students of the Mamaroneck School District are members of minority groups. The district encompasses the entire village of Larchmont and most of the village and town of Mamaroneck. There are four elementary schools, one middle school and one high school.
Sherry King, the superintendent, said: "Our district is a community of neighborhoods that really support each other, and parent involvement is one of our strongest assets."
For more than 30 years the district has held prekindergarten classes for children who are economically disadvantaged or have special needs. "But there is a long history of commitment on our part not only to these children, but to the whole child, particularly in the arts," Dr.King said.
In fifth grade, students participate in a collaborative program with the Whitney Museum of Art. At all grade levels, the district participates in the Lincoln Center Institute for the Arts in Education, which brings visiting artists into the schools. In the middle school, children can take robotics as an elective and participate in a media arts program. At Mamaroneck High School, students are offered a science research program, four years of performing arts courses for credit, 15 advanced placement courses and electives that include forensics and architectural drawing.
On the SAT reasoning tests, last year's 302 graduating seniors averaged 572 on the verbal test and 584 in math, far above the statewide averages of 494 and 506, respectively. Eighty-percent went on to four-year colleges and 12 percent to two-year colleges.
About 1,225 children who live in the village attend school in the Rye Neck School District, which also serves some parts of the neighboring town of Rye.
"We offer just as many opportunities as a larger school district, and more," said Peter J. Mustich, superintendent of the 1,414-student Rye Neck district. "We have a personalized education program that beginning in kindergarten identifies a student's strengths and talents and offers them opportunities to excel in these. This is not a gifted program. We are all gifted in some way and we try to use each child's gifts and talents to enrich their school experience.
Students begin foreign languages in the second grade and, though the high school has only 355 students, it offers 14 advanced placement courses and a science research program. The district began an environmental studies program this year in all the grades with a $13,000 grant from Toshiba.
Last year's 76 seniors at Rye Neck High School averaged 553 in the SAT verbal tests and 567 in math; 91 percent went to four-year colleges and 8 percent went on to two-year colleges.
The village's private schools include the Westchester Day School, a Jewish school, offering nursery through eighth grade; tuition averages $14,000. On the same campus is Westchester Hebrew High School, with tuition averaging $15,700. The French American School of New York operates nursery through 10th grade. Its tuition is $14,000.
Mamaroneck Avenue is the heartbeat of the village with its bustling shops, multitude of ethnic restaurants and the Mamaroneck Playhouse. Philip Trifiletti, the village mayor, said the street has recently been revitalized "to give it a whole new, wide open look." Over $150,000 is available in community development block grants to help store owners restore or touch up facades, he said.
The avenue reaches a dead end at the 44-acre Harbor Island Park, the largest village park. It has a marina, boat launching area, docks and tennis courts and a 700-foot salt-water beach, which has been closed for three years because of high bacteria counts. Last September, a new floating filter was installed in the harbor to replace one that was destroyed in 1999 from a gas and oil spill from one of the local boat yards.
"But it is only a Band-Aid and does not resolve or address our high bacteria counts," said Mayor Trifiletti. The village is under a state order to address all known sources of the harbor's pollution within five years. Mr. Trifiletti said, "We are working with an environmental firm to help us secure grants and begin a proactive sewer maintenance and repair program."
BEFORE the arrival of Europeans, the village was home to Siwanoy Indians, who are believed to have gathered their food from the harbor, said Gloria Poccia Pritts, the village historian. In fact, Mamaroneck is an Indian word, with many meanings, including "a place where we gather," she said. The Indians sold the area to John Richbell, an Englishman, in September 1661. 
After the railroad came through in 1848, many wealthy businessmen were drawn to the area and built summer estates there. On Nov. 16, 1895, the village was incorporated and by the early 1900's, the village began to boom, said Ms. Pritts. New industries, artisans and Italian and German immigrants were attracted to the area to work on the estates or in factories in the village. Ms. Pritts said businesses made a range of products, from chicken bouillon to gutta-percha, a rubberlike material, to coats.
Today, the major industry in the village is boat building. Derecktor Shipyard built the Stars & Stripes, which brought home the America's Cup in 1987.

To ease the family's plight, Mr. Santangelo gave Mr. Seely a 12 1/2-by-100-foot slice of his own lot to build a home for his wife and two children. A clever craftsman, Mr. Seely scoured the village for discarded materials to build his new home in 1932, said Gloria Poccia Pritts, the village historian. He used marble pieces as the cellar foundation, bannisters and railroad ties as supports and even lumber from a chicken coop. Since he could not build out, Mr. Seely built up three stories, adorning the thin home with several gables. Though it is not the skinniest house in the world, at 10 feet wide it is a village and Westchester County landmark, drawing many visitors, said Ms. Pritts. Ida Santangelo, Panfilo's daughter, said, "I'm proud of my father for donating the land to Mr. Seely out of friendship." About 20 years ago, after the death of Mr. Seely and his wife, Ms. Santangelo bought the home. "I didn't want it to be destroyed or ruined, and I wanted to keep it with the family home," she said, adding that a caretaker now lives in the two-bedroom house.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Connecticut; 
A Divided Campus Is to Expand at Both Its Sites

BYLINE:  By ELEANOR CHARLES 

DATELINE: DANBURY 

 BODY:
AS it celebrates its centennial this year, Western Connecticut State University is embarking on a $179.6 million program of expansion here.
 Mounds of upturned earth will soon give way to the foundation for a 122,000-square-foot, $48 million science building, the first of five major construction projects to be built over the next three years on the university's two campuses. The science building, to be completed in the fall of next year, will be part of the urban 34-acre Midtown campus, along with a $9 million, 600-car garage. 
 On the 361-acre Westside campus off Mill Plain Road, a 2,500-seat athletic stadium is under construction at a cost of $5.2 million. A $30-million residence hall, which will accommodate about 350 students, and a garage with spaces for 422 vehicles are to be finished by the fall of 2004, and a 49,000-square-foot student center, with a projected cost of $15.4 million, is scheduled for completion in early 2005. Later this year or early in 2004, work is expected to begin on a fine arts and performing arts center of 150,000 square feet, whose tentative cost of $64 million is still under discussion. 
The two campuses, about two miles apart, were considered ripe for consolidation in the early 70's, when the state developed an elaborate plan for the Westside campus, envisioning 12 clustered buildings around a central green and a building with dining and social facilities for students, faculty and staff. All Midtown personnel and activities were to be moved to the Westside campus.
But when the recession of the 70's took hold, the $43 million cost of constructing new buildings became prohibitive and the prospect of having more than a dozen Midtown campus buildings left vacant was perceived as a crushing blow to the city as it struggled to develop new strategies for its failed industrial economy. The plan was scrapped. 
Students who now live on Westside may have classes there. But many classes are also held at Midtown, and shuttle buses transport students between the sites.
Today, Mayor Mark Bouton said, "Danbury has shed its image of a mill town closely tied to the hatting industry. We've diversified our economic base; we have a vibrant arts community and an incredibly diversified population. Forty-five languages are spoken in our public schools."
Elected in 2001, Mayor Bouton, a first-term Republican in a Democratic city, is a graduate of WestConn who became a Danbury High School teacher for 14 years and later a member of the State Legislature for two years. "WestConn has been an integral part of the city," he said. "Its expansion only adds to the community, and we have formed a town-gown committee to enhance the relationship between the university and the residents." Ninety percent of WestConn students are from Connecticut, and most live on campus.
The State University system of which WestConn is a part is depending on a state-bonded nest egg of $400 million for constructing academic buildings on its four campuses, to be dispensed over five years ending in 2008, said Dr. William Cibes, chancellor of the system. Funds borrowed through the Connecticut Health and Education Facilities Authority, known as Chefa, for building residence halls, student centers and other nonacademic buildings are repaid by various student fees, including room rents and meals.
Part of the $400 million is shared by WestConn's sister universities. Eastern Connecticut State University in Willimantic will have a new science building next year, Southern Connecticut State University in New Haven is getting a $55 million addition and renovation of its library and Central State University in New Britain will have a new academic building this fall, Dr. Cibes said, despite the slow economy. "We have been adversely impacted in terms of operating funds provided by the state," he said, "but not capital funds. The governor remains very committed."
WestConn's president, James R. Roach, has a more cautious view, however. "If there's a change in governorship, there could be changes in bonding," he said.
Often confused with the University of Connecticut, familiarly called UConn, the state universities grew out of the normal schools, founded in New Britain in 1849, said Dr. Cibes. "UConn is the state's public research institution, while we are a comprehensive teacher training system," he said. "All four state universities are autonomous -- no mother-child relationship, no main campus," he said, noting that, collectively, "we are bigger than UConn with 26,000 students, 6,050 of them at WestConn." 
UConn, founded in 1881 with its main campus in Storrs and branches in Groton, Stamford, Torrington, Waterbury and West Hartford, has a total of 25,000 students and charges tuition of $7,100, compared with the State University tuition of $5,100. 
WestConn's division into two campuses within one city is unique in the state. The original Midtown campus bordered by White Street, Fifth Avenue, Osborne Street and Seventh Avenue comprises 15 traditional brick buildings, including the original 1903 Old Main academic building, now administrative offices. In the 60's so many buildings were erected on the campus that further development was no longer feasible.
So, from 1969 to 1998 the state acquired contiguous parcels of rural land from private owners, developing an Arcadian campus in the foothills of the Berkshires with glorious 360-degree views. "You can stand almost anywhere and see Pennsylvania," is the standard quip. If the property were not now tax exempt, the annual tax bill for land alone would be about $570,000, and its estimated market value is more than $34 million, according to the Danbury assessor's office. The approach road to the campus, University Boulevard, flows along a one-mile driveway whose center island has been planted with cherry trees that at this time of year are a mass of bright pink blossoms. 
DEVELOPMENT of the Westside campus began in 1979 when Gov. Ella T. Grasso released $5.2 million to build the only classroom building to date. Two residential halls, in which suites for five students offer kitchens, common areas and balconies with marvelous views, have been built and occupied, along with an observatory-planetarium building. The Ancell School of Business, an 89,615-square-foot building, was erected by the state in 1982; its $600,000 endowment was provided by Nathan Ancell, founder of the Ethan Allen furniture stores. 
WestConn's campuses feature traditional brick Federal or contemporary architecture with one notable exception: the O'Neill Athletic Center, named for a former governor, William A. O'Neill. A box-shaped, baby-blue-and-white horizontally striped structure on the Westside campus, it houses a gymnasium for students and is a site for programs by sports and entertainment figures. Its large indoor pool is open to the public. Soon, an $8 million expansion will provide more space for physical education, offices and enlargement of the pool.
All athletics are to be consolidated at the Westside campus, said Thomas P. Carlone, director of planning and engineering. "The new stadium will handle all field sports: football, track, lacrosse, soccer and field hockey," he said. Softball and baseball fields are already on the campus.
A popular attraction at the Westside campus is the open-air concert park completed in 1982 and named for a Danbury favorite son, the composer Charles Ives. The park is owned by WestConn and leased to a nonprofit organization that produces performances of classical, jazz and popular music each summer in the large gazebo. Nearby, a pond's fountain sends up a vertical spume; low stone walls and benches delineate seating areas; and a large lawn becomes a picnic ground for concertgoers. Art exhibits and poetry readings are held by university departments on the Midtown campus and at the Silo in New Milford; theatrical performances are presented in the Midtown campus's White Hall and Berkshire Theater.
The Fine and Performing Arts Center to be built behind the concert park will hold art galleries; studios for sculpture, graphics, painting and photography; rehearsal halls; music and art classrooms; offices; conference rooms; and a state-of-the art theater.
Dr. Roach said the growth in the last eight years of programs in music and the visual and performing arts have led WestConn to be informally designated as the "school for the arts of the State University system."
Eugene Buccini, vice president for academic affairs, noted: "This side of the state has no major cultural facility. The Fine and Performing Arts Center will provide a teaching and cultural center for the region." WestConn, UConn, Yale and the University of Hartford, Dr. Buccini said, are the only universities in Connecticut that offer Master of Fine Arts degrees.
In describing the two state systems, Valerie Lewis, commissioner of higher education for Connecticut, said: "UConn is focused on research, Ph.D. programs and graduate studies for the state's industries. It is selective in choosing its student body.
"The State University System is charged with being affordable and accessible, focused on teaching and achieving a high level of bachelor degrees among first generation college students. One is not better than the other -- just different."

HEADLINE: New Look for Bronx Civic Crossroads 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
IT takes imagination and audacity to look at the East 161st Street corridor, as Borough President Adolfo Carrion Jr. does, and envision it as "Downtown Bronx," a civic, commercial, recreational and cultural crossroads.
 But it requires less imagination today than it did a few years ago, because physical evidence of the area's redevelopment is beginning to accumulate. (Audacity is still needed. The very idea of "Downtown Bronx" is not universally embraced.) 
 Stretching from Yankee Stadium to Third Avenue, the 161st Street corridor is at once tended and neglected, a jumble of activity and abandonment, high-density and low-rise construction, landmarks and eyesores. In a word -- Mr. Carrion's word, in fact -- its identity is fuzzy. 
That is changing. The most striking harbinger of transformation is the 10-story steel superstructure of the $324.7 million, two-block-long Bronx Supreme/Criminal Court complex, rising between Sherman and Morris Avenues. In its openness, the framework hints at what will be a remarkably transparent glass facade, by Rafael Vinoly Architects and DMJM. Samples of the glass wall have been tested successfully for bomb blast resistance at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.
At 163rd Street and Sherman Avenue, the $60 million Bronx School for Law, Government and Justice is nearing completion, to designs by the Hillier Group.
At 165th Street and the Grand Concourse, Arquitectonica has designed a faceted $8.2 million addition to the Bronx Museum of the Arts. The city's Design and Construction Department expects to begin the project this summer.
The artists Vito Acconci and Helene Brandt have contributed to the recent renovation of the 161st Street-Yankee Stadium station on the B, D and 4 lines.
Between Joyce Kilmer Park and the Bronx County Building is a parking lot that is grandly styled Lou Gehrig Plaza. It is to be turned into a true plaza under a relandscaping by Thomas Balsley Associates as part of a larger street reconstruction project by the Transportation Department. The agency, which has just renovated the Macombs Dam Bridge, also plans to build the city's first major cable-stayed bridge, reconnecting 153rd Street across the broad Mott Haven rail yard.
With silvered cables splayed like spidery fingers from two slender masts, the four-lane, 500-foot-long, $40 million bridge would do more than carry vehicles, bicyclists and pedestrians. "A project like this is a great symbol of the revitalization of the city and of the Bronx," said Iris Weinshall, the city transportation commissioner. Construction is to begin in 2006.
Looking further ahead, local officials imagine redeveloping the 32-acre Bronx Terminal Market along the waterfront. "This has tremendous potential as a destination retail center," said Paula L. Caplan, deputy director of planning and development in the borough president's office.
Mr. Carrion estimated that more than $630 million was committed to the area or had recently been spent there. "What this collection of projects begins to do is define a downtown for the Bronx," he said. It also reflects planning efforts going back more than a decade to a concept called Bronx Center, developed by community leaders, city agencies and civic organizations when Fernando Ferrer was borough president.
"What is happening here is very exciting," said Purnima Kapur, director of the City Planning Department's Bronx office. "It fits into the overall concept of creating a vibrant South Bronx, Downtown Bronx, whatever you want to call it." (Some object to "Downtown" on the grounds that there is no reason to change names now that the South Bronx is rebounding. Others say the new name is more hopeful than accurate.)
No matter what the area is called, though, its future is tied to Yankee Stadium.

Yankee Stadium
Building in a Park To Stay in the Bronx
No one can say for sure what the Yankees will do. But their preference is a 50,000-seat covered stadium in Macombs Dam Park, designed by HOK Sport Venue Event.
"A new Yankee Stadium will in many ways be an anchor tenant in the Bronx," said Randy Levine, president of the Yankees. "We're staying in the Bronx for five years in good faith while going through the planning process." The team has extended its lease until 2006, but Mr. Levine said that was the limit of its commitment to the House That Ruth Built in 1923 and that New York City rebuilt in 1976. "The present Yankee Stadium is not going to make it for very much longer," Mr. Levine said. "The cost of renovating the stadium is more expensive than building a new one."
Among many hurdles faced by a new stadium is that it would eliminate city parkland, a step that would have to be approved by the State Legislature.
Under an agreement reached in the final hours of the Giuliani administration -- and now sidelined by the budget crisis -- the city would have issued $800 million in bonds through a local development corporation to finance the project. The Yankees would have assumed slightly more than half of the $46 million annual debt service, paid 4 percent of the gate revenue to the corporation and picked up the operating costs.
About a new Bronx stadium, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is noncommittal. He said in 2001 that "we should have great cultural and athletic facilities, and the issue is really can we afford them." His position is unchanged, a spokeswoman said last week.
Mr. Carrion, too, is careful neither to dismiss nor endorse the politically controversial idea. "We ought not get tied down by the question of an old stadium or a new stadium," he said, "but look at the larger picture. It may make sense to look at a new stadium along with all the other opportunities that Yankee development offers us."
By that, he means a sports-oriented district centered on the stadium, with a new Metro-North station, a new ferry landing, a hotel and convention center, a high school for sports-industry careers and a Yankee hall of fame. Mr. Levine said these projects are "not at the core of what we're doing, but we would explore them."

Works of Art
An Old Fountain Near a New Station
A small but symbolic turning point on 161st Street was the restoration four years ago of the Heinrich Heine Fountain, also known as Die Lorelei, in Joyce Kilmer Park. The monumental statue by Ernst Herter had been dreadfully vandalized, not just by graffiti, which reached up to the figure of the Lorelei siren, but by outright destruction. Mermaids at either side of the base had lost their heads and arms. Their tails and fins were broken or chipped. And the fountain had long since stopped working.
Under the Municipal Art Society's Adopt-a-Monument program, the fountain was restored, largely through a grant from the Anna-Maria and Stephen Kellen Foundation. It was rededicated in 1999, the centenary of its original installation; heads, arms, tails, running water and all. "What is most gratifying," said Phyllis Samitz Cohen of the society, "is to see how warmly the people in the park respond to it daily."
At the foot of the park is Lou Gehrig Plaza, where about 40 vehicles park. Mr. Balsley has redesigned the median with seating, planters and gingko trees; an amiable extension of the rather forbidding public space around the Bronx County Building on 161st Street. "We fought very hard to get the parking eliminated," he said. The new plaza is part of the Transportation Department's planned $35 million reconstruction of the Grand Concourse and 161st Street underpass, to begin next year, that has been financed in part with federal money obtained by Rep. Jose E. Serrano.
Two blocks away is a remarkable work of contemporary art: the recently renovated 161st Street-Yankee Stadium el and subway interchange, with "Sliding Walls for the 161st Street Subway Station" by Acconci Studio and "Room of Tranquillity" by Ms. Brandt. The architect was John di Domenico of di Domenico & Partners.
In the subway station, the white and orange tile walls seem to have slipped from their moorings to reveal black, craggy expanses of bedrock. Along the platform, walls are peeled away to form seats. Another platform wall appears to have broken through the floor to the mezzanine above at crazy angles, its "161st Street" mosaic plaque sheared into three parts.
"The entire piece is about getting you to think about the place you are in from an architectural point of view," said Sandra Bloodworth, director of the Arts for Transit program at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The artwork accounted for about $100,000 of the $14.7 million renovation, which was completed two years ago.

Innovative Designs
A Cable-Stayed Span, An Origami Facade
"The issue is not pretty buildings," Mr. Ferrer said of the Bronx Center plan in 1990. "The point is to create a new economic engine." But pretty buildings -- or in any event some striking architecture -- will characterize the area's future.
Most arresting on the skyline would be the 190-foot masts of the 153rd Street bridge, which Ms. Weinshall called the first major cable-stayed span in New York City. (The only one like it is Rockefeller University's pedestrian bridge across East 63rd Street.)
Cable-stayed bridges are especially light and airy because of their simplicity, with slender towers carrying the structural load.
The 153rd Street bridge has been designed by Transportation Department engineers, including Lawrence King, Kamal Kishore and Ali Mallick, working with CTE Engineers and Daniel Frankfurt. Ms. Weinshall said the design was prompted in part by a desire to have as simple a structure as possible over the Metro-North tracks.
An earlier bridge over the Mott Haven yards was closed to traffic in 1988 because of deterioration and demolished in 1992. The new bridge should be completed in 2008.
Though the new bridge would reopen what is now a quiet cul-de-sac next to Cardinal Hayes Memorial High School, the principal, Msgr. John Graham, said it "would certainly be a help to traffic, safety and security."
The addition to the Bronx Museum of the Arts by Arquitectonica, architects of the new Westin New York at Times Square, has just won an award for design excellence from the city Art Commission.
The facade of glass and aluminum panels -- enclosing new galleries, offices, public program space and a cafeteria -- will "angle and twist like an architectural origami, demystifying the wall on the street and making it permeable," wrote Bernardo Fort-Brescia and Laurinda Spear, co-founding principals of Arquitectonica.
Money is available for the project in the capital budget, said Matthew Monahan, the assistant commissioner for public affairs at the design and construction agency.

Civic Center
Homes Are Built For Courts and School
The biggest project is the court complex being built by the state Dormitory Authority to designs by Mr. Vinoly, the architect of Jazz at Lincoln Center in the AOL Time Warner Center on Columbus Circle, and DMJM, architects of the American Airlines terminal at Kennedy International Airport.
The structure is a companion to the fortresslike 26-year-old Criminal Court but will be far different aesthetically, with a 500-foot-long glass curtain wall that is meant to make the building less forbidding and to reinforce the transformation of 161st Street into a vibrant corridor. "At a certain point," Mr. Vinoly said, "a grand gesture has to occur." The rear facade is enlivened by cantilevered stairwells.
The 750,000-square-foot complex includes 47 courtrooms, 110 holding cells, grand jury rooms, judges' chambers, offices for the district attorney and city agencies, a virtually freestanding circular jury assembly hall in which some 600 prospective jurors can gather and a 200-space garage. It is to be substantially completed in 2005 and fully operating in 2006, said John V. Andrus, chief project manager for the Dormitory Authority. A second phase would bring the complex up to about 1 million square feet.
Obvious even now is that there are no perimeter columns; they are instead recessed 20 feet from the facade, which would help minimize structural damage in the event of a blast. The curtain wall is designed to be flexible enough to absorb and dissipate the energy from an explosion.
Richard A. Kahan, president of the Urban Assembly, which founded the Bronx School for Law, Government and Justice, thinks the courthouse has done damage of its own by effectively turning its back on the new red-brick school building on 163rd Street. The six-story structure, being built by the School Construction Authority, is to be completed in September.
The specialized public high school prepares students for law-related careers. It opened in 1997 and is housed at the Health Opportunities High School, 350 Gerard Avenue. The program will be extended to the sixth grade in the new school, Mr. Kahan said, which accommodates 733 students. The building's scale and masonry facade serve as "a bridge to the community," said Barry Shapiro, an associate at Hillier.
Among the special features of the school will be a crime lab, forensic lab and mock courtroom with a judge's bench, witness stand, jury box and attorney's tables. As for the lack of a direct connection between the school and courthouse, which were supposed to be more closely related, Mr. Kahan said, "We'll walk around the block."

A Surprise Spin On the Debt Treadmill

 BODY:
I WAS about to treat the marketing pitch -- to borrow money at a low interest rate -- like all my other junk mail by throwing it into the recycling bin. But something stopped me. Instead, I put the envelope on my desk, thinking, "Hey, you never know."
 Frankly, I needed to be more honest with myself. I did know. I had a severe cash-flow problem: I had tallied all my bills and realized that my dwindling checking account wasn't going to cover them. Checks were going to bounce. I was in denial, hoping that some surprise money would arrive from, say, a tax refund or a rich uncle. 
 The mailing, from American Express, included checks tied to my credit card. For a limited time, I would be charged just 3.9 percent on the money, compared with the usual rate for cash advances of 19 percent. So I used one to pay my Visa bill -- and thus joined the millions of Americans who have credit card debt.
TheFederal Reserve Board, in its survey on consumer finances in 2001, the latest numbers available, found that 85 percent of families headed by people 45 to 54 years old were in debt of some kind. For those headed by people 35 to 44, the figure was 89 percent. Slightly more than half in both age groups -- mostly made up of baby boomers -- had balances on credit cards.
Many of my friends say they carry credit card balances. So do some of my co-workers, something I learned by rudely asking around the office. Geri Eisenman Pell, a senior financial adviser at American Express in Harrison, N.Y., said she was seeing people carrying debt because they were unemployed or had received lower-than-usual bonuses. But for many people, she said, debt just "creeps up on them." 
Rene D. Renfroe, 48, of Detroit, who works at a food bank, said she and her husband, Azely, 54, ran into a problem after he lost his job last year. They accumulated about $20,000 in debt, $5,000 of it on their credit cards, including cash advances to pay for living expenses.
"It was crazy," she said. "We would borrow to pay off another creditor or to pay the rent. We were going in circles."
Sounds familiar. For a while, I was juggling several credit cards, making purchases on the card whose billing cycle had just closed -- to buy myself another month. Toni Busuttil, 41, who works for an aircraft manufacturer in New Jersey, was juggling four cards and running balances, but figured that she would catch up as her and her husband's salaries grew. Their divorce ruined that plan.
"If we had been working together as a team, the monthly payments would have been manageable," said Ms. Busuttil, who had about $40,000 in debt. "But we weren't a team anymore."
Both women eventually sought help from GreenPath Debt Solutions, a nonprofit credit counseling organization based in Farmington Hills, Mich. The group took away their credit cards, put them on budgets and worked out repayment schedules with the card companies. Ms. Busuttil has caught up with her bills, and Ms. Renfroe is a few years away.
Chris Dlugozima, a credit counselor at GreenPath in Manhattan, says that whether the economy is good or bad, many people of all income levels have problems managing their expenses. "A lot of people are overextending themselves," he said. "They can pay their bills on time, but they are robbing one to pay the other, taking cash advances."
Ms. Pell, of American Express, said too many people used their tax refunds to pay off credit cards -- I was planning to -- instead of adjusting their withholding to put more money into their paychecks. She suggested using home equity loans to pay off high-rate debt, but only if borrowers can handle those payments and not put their homes at risk.
Mr. Dlugozima said people just needed to understand where their money was going. Once they see how they are spending, even on little things, they will have an easier time cutting back. "One thing I always see is what people spend on work lunches. That's $10 a day, about $200 a month. When I point that out, they say, 'Really?'
"Take no expense for granted," he said. "There is no expense out there that is fixed. Everybody thinks some things are a necessity, but any expense can be cut. The key is to be in touch with your priorities and not spend in areas that are not that important to you, like work lunches."
I CAN trace my problem to the purchase of a vacation home, a financial move I made last year instead of investing in the scary stock market. It was a good move, a lot more fun than stocks, but stocks don't need a plumber or carpeting on the second floor. The upkeep is a drain.
Oh, and that 3.9 percent loan I took out with American Express? It turns out that when I make a card payment, that money will be used first to pay down the low-interest loan, not the other purchases I have put on the card, which carry a 12.74 percent rate. And if I don't pay everything off when I get my next bill, I will lose the one-month grace period on new purchases, meaning I will pay 12.74 percent interest from the minute I make them.
Boy, I can sure spot a bargain when I see one.

HEADLINE: LIFE'S WORK; 
In Tough Times, Graduates Slink Back Home

BYLINE:  By LISA BELKIN; This column about the intersection of jobs and personal lives appears every other week. E-mail: Belkin@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
MY college graduation took me by surprise. Though it had been four years in the making, I was unpacked and unready to move out when the moment arrived. So my parents parked their station wagon near my dorm room and I hurled armloads of clothes through the second-story window into their waiting arms. We then drove it all back to their house -- back to the green-and-lavender room, filled with stuffed animals, I had lived in as a child.
 I stayed there for months while I figured out where to go next. And during those months it became painfully clear that my life couldn't be crammed back into that room any better than it could be crammed into the back of the station wagon. 
 All this could have been a metaphor for the fact that the trip from college to the working world can get unexpectedly messy. The most recent graduates are finding it particularly so, and more of them are moving straight from their dorms to their old bedrooms.
"Moving back home was the one thing I said I would never do," Meghan Butler, a December graduate of Southwest Texas State University, in San Marcos, told me in an e-mail conversation. "However, I graduated into one of the most undesirable job markets in recent history and found moving home to be the most cost-efficient option."
"The hardest thing about living at home again," she said, "was telling people where I lived." There's a certain stigma to moving in with your parents, she says, and she routinely found herself making excuses. "My answers varied from the truth to the absurd: just graduated, saving money for a down payment on a house, better than a cardboard box, can't cut the cord, etc."
"The only other downfall, was the nasty dent it made on my love life," she said. "I had many first dates, and only first dates, because, apparently, no man wants to date a 23-year-old woman living at home."
Paula Reichle-Smith didn't have that particular problem. When she returned to live in her parents' house two years ago she brought along her husband, Kirk. They moved back to Cincinnati so that he could finish school and she could find a job that made use of her public relations degree. Instead, she worked for a rental car company -- a job she hated and quit after two tearful months. She worked at Bath and Body Works, but the fact that she could not support herself and her husband made her feel that "I wasn't doing what I'd been trained to do, what I'd paid so much tuition for."
Though grateful to her parents for the physical and emotional shelter, the couple quickly began to chafe at being demoted from adult to child. "We felt like kids again when my parents kept asking questions like, 'Where are you going? When will you be home?' " Mrs. Reichle-Smith said.
"Every time I came home with a shopping bag I would get drilled," she recalled. " 'How much was that?' 'Are you saving money for that house?' It got to the point where we would sneak packages into the house if we bought something."
A year after moving to Cincinnati, Mrs. Reichle-Smith got a job that allowed for some savings. Six months later -- 18 months after they'd moved in -- she and her husband moved out.
Ms. Butler also found a job and moved out -- just two weeks ago. She's still adjusting to the fact that she now has to "budget and penny pinch" but says "she's pleased to have my own life back."
Some will go to any lengths not to have to move back home in the first place. As graduation from Clarkson University inched closer this year, and the specter of his old bedroom grew larger, John D. Byrne became increasingly creative in his search for a job. Rather than take a long-planned vacation he went to interviews through spring break, without success, and then hit on the idea of a finder's fee -- or, in his case, a finder's cruise.
"Here's how it works," he writes on his Web site, jobsforjohn.com. "You send me information on a job in upstate New York that isn't posted in a major job bank. If the job looks good, I'll apply. If I get a good offer and take the job -- YOU WIN A FREE CRUISE, or $500 -- as a thank you gift."
It's not as though he's being picky. According to his Web site, he has a B.A. in government as well as an M.B.A., and he will eagerly work in a long list of fields (including everything from advertising and finance to politics and entertainment) as long as the position is in upstate New York. So far, the ploy has generated a few promising leads, he says, but no actual job offers.
Graduation came and went two weeks ago so, technically, he is now unemployed. He has enough savings, he thinks, to keep his own apartment for at least a few more months.

HEADLINE: BOOK VALUE; 
Wall Street's Shadier Side, From Two Directions

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN 

 BODY:
THE stream of business books aimed at explaining the financial excesses of recent years continues unabated. And the books come in a variety of flavors.
 One that is arousing debate is "Born to Steal: When the Mafia Hit Wall Street" (Warner Books, $24.95) by Gary Weiss, a senior writer at Business Week. The book, which argues that organized crime may have played an important role in the spectacular run-up of financial markets in the late 1990's, reflects deep knowledge about how Wall Street works. Yet it is written in an almost novelistic style that will allow even financial know-nothings to understand what happened -- and may still be happening in one form or another. 
 Another is "Infectious Greed: How Deceit and Risk Corrupted the Financial Markets" (Times Books/Henry Holt, $27.50). Written by Frank Partnoy, who formerly sold derivatives on Wall Street and is now a professor at the University of San Diego School of Law, it argues that the complex financial instruments called derivatives are at the heart of all that has gone wrong -- and may still go wrong -- in financial markets. 
He traces the abuse of derivatives in every financial scandal and market meltdown since Michael R. Milken tried to dominate the market for junk bonds. Derivatives, of course, also were at the heart of the spectacular collapse of Enron. Over all, he estimates that the market for derivatives exceeds $100 trillion.
The more entertaining, and disturbing, tale is that of the mob.
It starts in the early 1990's, when the six Mafia families active in the New York area and Philadelphia began to establish toeholds on Wall Street by taking advantage of a demographic and socioeconomic transition in the kinds of people who were being hired.
Mr. Weiss writes that M.B.A.'s and Ivy League credentials were no longer necessary tickets to success on Wall Street. So unscrupulous brokerage firms, or "chop houses," could thrive by exploiting younger people from New York City's outer boroughs, even if "the Manhattan snobs" -- some of whom would later be accused of wrongdoing themselves -- sneered at the newcomers as "white 'ethnics.' "
Mr. Weiss writes that mob-affiliated financial fraudsters "discovered" Louis Pasciuto at the age of 20, when he was pumping gasoline in his native Staten Island. They recruited him to push stocks to unsuspecting buyers, Mr. Weiss adds, because he lacked any moral compunction about stealing -- hence the title of the book.
Mr. Pasciuto, who would eventually be accused of trying to cash bad checks and of committing securities fraud, began cooperating with the F.B.I. and federal prosecutors in 1999, helping them make dozens of arrests of Mafia-affiliated brokers and the extortionists who preyed on them.
While he has pleaded guilty to three counts of securities fraud and conspiracy, Mr. Pasciuto is free on bail while working with the F.B.I.
After he became a cooperating witness, Mr. Pasciuto approached Mr. Weiss to tell his story because Mr. Weiss had written a Business Week cover article about the mob on the Street in late 1996.
Author and subject first met around Christmas 1999, and Mr. Weiss interviewed Mr. Pasciuto, his wife, his parents and his in-laws over a period of almost three years. He also took advantage of court records and interviews with authorities to verify their stories.
Mr. Pasciuto used many techniques as he worked for a series of chop houses, according to the book. The one that is unfamiliar to many investors was called rips. Hanover Sterling, Mr. Pasciuto's first employer, had a way of buying a stock at $5 and then selling it to customers for $8, a 60 percent markup -- or rip. Mr. Weiss writes that it avoided detection by regulators by timing the trades in a way that the ill-gotten gains were not considered commissions, but rather a trading profit.
"Rips performed several functions," Mr. Weiss writes. "They were motivators, without which brokers would not have been willing to push stocks that had all the appeal of wet tree bark. They kept the conscience quiet. They kept stirrings of the phony emotion called 'guilt' from wafting out of the toilet bowls of their souls."
The mob was involved in "protecting" young brokers, according to the book; Mr. Pasciuto had to give a percentage of his income to his Mafia baby sitter. The "Guys," as Mr. Weiss calls them, also helped protect top management of the chop houses and helped adjudicate disputes -- all for a piece of the action. In effect, they controlled at least some chop houses.
MR. WEISS argues that there is a connection between the mob's penetration of the Street in the early 1990's and the sorts of abuses that permeated the market in the late 1990's. The author contends that the chop-house abuses of the early 90's helped set the stage for much broader manipulations during the bubble era.
"Brokerage and stock exchange executives, men of patrician backgrounds, who held chop house brokers in contempt, turned a blind eye to the insane overhyping of stocks by analysts, and the web of conflicts of interest that would become a full-blown scandal in 2002," he writes.
Mr. Pasciuto became involved in his first Internet stock in 1997. His employer was Ralph Daniel Torrelli, whose company, TYM, was pushing the stock of a company called Internet Holdings with the stock symbol HTTP. Mr. Weiss obtained one of the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which acknowledged that Internet Holdings had no operations and did not maintain any offices. Mr. Pasciuto was able to sell $1 million of the worthless stock to one of his "whales," or rich, dumb investors.
Federal prosecutors eventually indicted Mr. Pasciuto. That, combined with increasingly violent extortion threats from his mob protectors, led him to cooperate with authorities. That helped set the stage for Mary Jo White, the United States attorney in New York, to crack down on the mob's influence on Wall Street in 2000. 
Many people believed that "the mob was dead," Mr. Weiss writes. Multiple prosecutions, "such as Mary Jo White's June 2000 indictment-fest, were credited with destroying the very core of organized crime, forever, everywhere," he adds. But Mr. Weiss says he doesn't believe that the mob has been eliminated, and he argues that its corrosive influence was visible after the arrests. 
The story line of "Infectious Greed" is not nearly as compelling, but the book tackles a hugely complex subject that any investor should understand more about. Mr. Partnoy, who once sold derivatives, seeks to portray them as at the heart of greed on Wall Street. Clearly, they have played a major role in a $200 million settlement that Bankers Trust reached with Procter & Gamble, in how Long-Term Capital Management nearly self-destructed and in how many rascals have rigged a market.
What Mr. Partnoy does not explain adequately is that many kinds of derivatives, like currency hedges, are essential lubrication for how the international economy functions. It's not until his epilogue that we understand the author's reform ideas. They include some positive proposals, like one to improve the regulatory system's ability to oversee derivatives, but also some questionable suggestions, including encouraging more investors to short, or bet against, stocks. The reader is left with the knowledge that derivatives are big and important, but uncertain as to whether Mr. Partnoy's solutions are solid.
So, no matter your taste, there is an account of financial skulduggery awaiting you. Millions of investors are asking whether the markets have been cleansed of impropriety or are merely awaiting the fools who rush in. These two books suggest that America's financial markets are still deeply flawed.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
On Taxes,What's The Fairest Of Them All?

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
LAST week, the House and Senate agreed to $320 billion in tax cuts. Not surprisingly, the plan deals with some economic inefficiencies, albeit in a clumsy way, and will provide the biggest benefits to the wealthy. Sadly, a politically unmentionable alternative might have done better.
 The Congressional plan will, among other things, reduce taxes on capital gains and dividends for the next several years, a step that will take most tax considerations out of a company's decision to sell stocks or bonds. Indeed, there's no reason that taxes, rather than the finances of a company and its investors, should play a role. 
 At the moment, dividends on shares face higher taxes than interest on bonds and loans. Say a company wants an investor in its stock or bonds to receive a cash payment of $1 after all taxes. In a typical situation, the investor might be paying the top income tax rate of 38.6 percent, and the company might be paying tax on its profits at a rate of 35 percent.
To pay $1 in after-tax interest on a bond, the company would have to allot only $1.54 in earnings, which would not be taxed at the corporate level. To pay a dividend worth $1 after taxes, it would have to allot $2.51 in pretax earnings, which would be taxed twice. Assuming that investors expect similar returns from both types of assets, it is cheaper to raise money by issuing debt than by selling stock -- a distortion that may lead to higher interest rates or inefficiently low investment in the corporate sector.
Reducing the tax on dividends to 15 percent will lower the amount of pretax profits needed to pay a dividend worth $1 after all taxes to $1.81 from $2.51. Three-quarters of the difference between the costs of paying dividends and interest will disappear.
Equalizing the rates on capital gains and dividends may help diminish another distortion, too. For most investors, the tax rate on capital gains is lower than the rate for dividends. Partly as a result, companies often try to funnel money to shareholders by repurchasing shares -- something that might not otherwise be in their interest -- rather than paying dividends.
When repurchases begin to appear routine, though, the government views them as dividends and begins to tax them as such. Equalizing the capital gains and dividend tax rates may give companies less incentive to walk the tightrope between keeping shareholders happy and incurring the wrath of the Internal Revenue Service.
The problematic part of the tax change, from an economic point of view, is its temporary nature. The lower rates will expire in 2009, giving shareholders a five-year window for extracting as much cut-rate cash as possible from their companies.
To those who say that cash sitting inside a company is likely to be wasted on perks and bad investments, a run on dividends may sound like a good idea. But bleeding the cash out of a company could hamper profitable investments, said Alan J. Auerbach, the director of the Burch Center for Tax Policy and Public Finance at the University of California at Berkeley. Moreover, he said, companies may be reluctant to pay more dividends because of the precedent it would set. 
"They'd be motivated to put an asterisk next to them and say, 'These are our special dividends being paid out as a result of this special opportunity, and don't expect them to be paid out in the future.' "
And as Democrats in Congress have said countless times, most benefits of tax cuts for dividends and capital gains will go to the wealthiest Americans.
LOOKING back, a different policy might have done better on grounds of efficiency and fairness. As several economists pointed out early in the tax debate, the most economically sensible way to end the double taxation of profits would have been to eliminate the corporate tax -- not the individual tax -- on the money used to pay dividends. That way, the treatment of interest and the treatment of dividends would have been exactly parallel.
The White House shied away from this idea, though, and Congress followed its lead. Hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of tax cuts for businesses did not have the same ring as hundreds of billions worth of tax cuts for individuals, even if the economic effects would have been similar.
Taking away just the corporate tax, however, might have yielded benefits to many more Americans, in addition to being more economically efficient. Cutting personal taxes on dividends helps only those people who have their own portfolios, noted Robert J. Shiller, a professor of economics at Yale. Taking away the corporate tax would also help the tens of millions of people who own stock in 401(k) plans.
"It seems like it might be more progressive, even though it sounds evil," Professor Shiller said.
In Washington, it seems, the sound is what matters.

Appealing to Older Travelers' Wanderlust, and Wallets

BYLINE:  By HARRIET EDLESON 

 BODY:
IN the last three years, Donald A. Mankin, 60, once accustomed to backpacking in the Sierra Nevada on his vacations, has more often taken expensive trips to far-flung destinations.
 Like many people over 55, he prefers educational trips, like his eight-night, $14,000 sojourn to Antarctica in December, through Adventure Network International, owned by Grand Expeditions. "I travel every opportunity I can," said Mr. Mankin, a psychology professor at Alliant International University in Los Angeles. 
 Almost 60 million Americans, or about 28 percent of the adult population, are at least 55 years old, according to the Census Bureau. The Travel Industry Association of America, a trade group in Washington, estimates that this group accounts for $130 billion in travel spending and takes one-third of all trips, which the association defines as journeys of 50 miles or more, or at least one night away.
"There is vast potential," said Suzanne Cook, the association's senior vice president for research and technology. "Baby boomers have grown up to value and expect travel. They have that mentality -- wanting to retain their youth and vitality -- and that includes travel."
Travel spending declined 6 percent in 2001 and grew only about 2 percent in 2002. This year, the travel industry has been hurt by worries about SARS and conflict in Iraq, in addition to continuing concern about terrorism and the weak economy.
To rekindle growth, cruise lines, airlines and hotels are eager to woo older travelers. "Everybody is going after this market," said Hal Norvell, manager for cruise and vacation products at AARP Services, a subsidiary of AARP. "It's wide open."
Older working couples account for 80 percent of luxury travel, according to a report by the travel association.
"The name of the game for them is not $59 hotel rooms but $15,000 cruises," said Richard M. Copland, the president of the American Society of Travel Agents and owner of Hillside Travel in the Bronx.
All kinds of travel companies -- whether mass-market ones like Walt Disney or specialty businesses catering to various travel interests -- are developing programs and strategiesto tempt the older market.
The Far and Wide Travel Corporation, the parent of 21 travel companies, began trips called Passages, or "journeys of discovery," in February. The trips use small ships, riverboats and private trains to reach remote destinations like Sado Island, in the Sea of Japan, and St.-Pierre, a tiny French island off Newfoundland.
One Passages itinerary -- 13 days to Turkey and Greece aboard the Sea Cloud, the former private yacht of Marjorie Merriweather Post -- costs $7,500 to more than $13,000, depending on the accommodations.
"Today, 50- to 59-year-olds are more active, more health conscious, more activity driven, more independent, and want experiences that change them," said Scott Boone, the chief marketing officer of Far and Wide.
To focus on this market, some companies have changed their advertising, while others have offered higher commissions to travel agents, who sell more than 90 percent of all cruises.
Ten years ago, Carnival Cruise Lines made some changes with "an eye toward the graying of America," said its president and chief executive, Robert H. Dickinson. It added more and better wines, for example, and upgraded its cuisine.
More recently, it raised the target income of its prospective 50-plus passengers to $70,000 from $50,000 and started advertising in Wine Spectator magazine. "We wanted to reach out to a more sophisticated vacationer, and they tend to trend older," Mr. Dickinson said. "We had to change our messengers as well to make sure we were reaching baby boomers."
In 2003, close to a million of Carnival's three million passengers will be 50 or older.
Sandals Resorts International, which operates Sandals Resorts for couples only and Beaches Resorts -- some for families and some for adults only -- has begun featuring "more mature" models in its brochures and advertisements, said John D. Lynch, the executive vice president for worldwide sales. The goal is to appeal to travelers who are 50 and older; they make up 30 percent of its customers, twice the level of a decade ago.
Far and Wide, which has records on 11 million actual and prospective customers, pays to use e-mail lists to reach potential customers based on certain characteristics, including their travel histories. "Age is part of the driver," said Kenneth P. Lane, vice president for direct marketing. The average age of its customers is 55, he said.
The company also uses the Claritas Corporation's Prizm profile analysis, which assigns every American neighborhood to one of 62 clusters. If a customer has traveled to the Great Barrier Reef in Australia with Far and Wide, the company will make pitches to other people in the neighborhood, or in similar neighborhoods in other cities. "It's kind of a birds-of-a-feather approach," Mr. Lane said.
Some companies market directly to an older audience, while others are "gently pitching" to it, said Ken Dychtwald, president of Age Wave, a consulting company in San Francisco that helps businesses market to people 50 and over. They don't want to "taint their brand" by alienating other age groups, he said.
ResortQuest International, a company that manages vacation property, markets to the 50-plus group for the months just before and after the peak summer season -- periods when the weather is still good, crowds are thinner and prices are lower. In the last two years, the company, based in Memphis, has shifted 20 percent of its $15 million marketing budget to reach this market, said James S. Olin, ResortQuest's president and chief executive.
That has paid off to some degree. The company's gross lodging revenue in northwest Florida, for example, increased 4 percent for the three months ending last November from the period a year earlier.
Club Med North America, a division of Club Mediterranee, based in Paris, said it might join the trend by marketing one of its 11 North American clubs to people over 50, but it has no specific plans. Up to 26 percent of people staying at some Club Med villages are 55 and older, said Valerie Bihet, a spokeswoman.

HEADLINE: ON THE JOB; 
Am I Busy? Let Me Count the Hats

BYLINE:  By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
People used to say they were busy, busy, busy. Now they say they're multitasking. In the Olympics, the decathlon is a sport. In the office, trying to do 10 things at once is a trial.
Multitasking is the only task Jenny McKinney of San Francisco knows. 
 On Sept. 3, she and her husband, Bruce, working with a staff of six people spread across seven states and working out of their homes, established a database Web site of bibliographies, historical and current book auction records, and prominent book dealer catalogs. 
 Mr. McKinney's concept was to help dealers of rare books become more efficient by giving them quick access to titles and prices -- and to help book collectors by making them aware of titles on the market and price history. Libraries that have rare-book collections would also benefit. "My husband's motivation to start this business was that this was an extremely smart and logical concept," Mrs. McKinney writes. "Everyone ought to embrace it.
"After the launch, not only did dealers not like it; libraries were indifferent to it, and collectors are nowhere in sight." Within a month, three staff members quit.
Mrs. McKinney writes: "I am on the job with the following multitasks: in charge of bookkeeping, payroll, coding articles published monthly on our Web site, updating database, maintaining an e-mailing list, designing promotional material and making date entries when I have free time.
"Additionally, our Web site is going through many phases of software additions and modifications."
Mrs. McKinney is responsible for ensuring that results are logical, functional and otherwise user-friendly.
During her free time, she manages an investment portfolio for her sister and herself and is the mother of a 16-year-old daughter and a 17-year-old son.
"My office is in the corner of our kitchen," she says. "Who do you think is doing the cooking, laundry, grocery shopping, etc.?
"Can I tell anyone that I am only one person? So far no one has lent me his or her ears. I hope you do." 
"Every day I find myself doing something like checking e-mail while talking on my office phone while unjamming the fax machines while trying to pick up the ringing cellphone," Susan Hay Cramer writes from Missoula, Mont., where she is a consultant on management and governance for local and national nonprofit organizations. "For me, the biggest challenge in terms of job performance is balancing the time I spend marketing myself and my services with the time I spend doing the actual work for which organizations hire me."
She says: "My biggest reality check was realizing that about 50 percent of my time is unbillable. No one pays me to buy office supplies or execute a dynamite marketing presentation or update my Web site (or unjam the fax machine)."
But she adds, "I may be someone who thrives on multitasking."
So how does she handle it all? "I write down (others would use a Palm Pilot, I'm sure) absolutely everywhere I have to be, everything I have to do and everyone I need to call, because I've learned the hard way that if I don't write it down, it doesn't get done.
"I carry a calendar both on my laptop (my constant companion) and a hard-copy version in my purse. And I've learned (also the hard way) to compose all e-mail to clients and prospects offline and then send it, to avoid erroneous (or embarrassing) transmissions."
Ms. Cramer says: "I'd write more, but I have a conference call with a client, during which time I will also be sorting laundry and packing for a trip out of town."
Henry Dubroff had a dream. In 1999 he was a business journalist, working as the editor of The Denver Business Journal. His dream was to own a newspaper company. So he quit his job and moved to Santa Barbara, Calif., with a start-up kit: a leased Saab, a checkbook and a business plan.
Today he is the chairman, chief executive, principal owner, president, publisher and editor of Pacific Coast Business Times, which he describes as "a thriving business journal that serves Santa Barbara, Ventura and San Luis Obispo Counties."
One of his first lessons, he writes, "was that our company's success depended very heavily on my ability to multitask."
"I have negotiated leases in the morning and edited real estate stories in the afternoon," Mr. Dubroff says. "I have sold ads over breakfast and written columns in the dead of night. I have delivered newspapers and met the payroll. And when the ad crunch hit in 2001, we had to let 6 of our 16 people go in order to keep the company afloat. That was hard. 
"Things are better now, and my multitasking has evolved. These days, my most important job is to keep our team of 10 people happy and motivated. Job No. 2 is to operate the company more or less within our budget -- but I have learned to make it fun.
"Recently, I took the company credit card to one of Santa Barbara's many thrift stores and for less than $25, I brought back 28 CorningWare plates and a mixed collection of stainless steel dinnerware that more or less serves 12. The result was a triple win. 
First, we will never again use paper plates at our semiregular company 'festivals.' Second, the new dishwasher that the landlord installed in the kitchen (see lease negotiations above) is being put to good use. Third, the long-term quality of life around the office has been kicked up a couple of notches. 
"For thousands of small-business owners like me, multitasking isn't just about doing e-mail and voice mail at the same time. That's the easy stuff. The hard stuff is doing whatever needs to be done to make the business go." 
Years ago, when Robin A. Kroft was looking for her first job after college in Toronto, a friend's mother looked her squarely in the eye and said: "Whatever you do, never admit you know how to type. As a woman, you will always have more earning power." 
That encounter, says Dr. Kroft, who now lives in Baltimore and whose expertise is in philanthropic studies, occurred before "keyboarding" at a computer made acceptable the notion that brains and typing could go hand in hand.
Dr. Kroft writes: "Recently, after the economy claimed a major donor, it became necessary to downsize the research foundation where I am a vice president. Faced with the challenge of running a grant program without secretarial support, I was pushed to call upon my closely held typing skills."
She said she had managed to teach herself how to create a special type of computerized letter that only the most revered support staff members had mastered.
"I wanted to celebrate by taking myself out to lunch on Secretary's Day," she said, "except I didn't have time."

HEADLINE: Personal Business; 
Adjusting the Rules of Thumb on Refinancing

BYLINE:  By GREG RETSINAS 

 BODY:
DEBBIE BURNS didn't hesitate when she decided last week to refinance the mortgage on her one-story brick home in Cushing, Okla. She had already refinanced once, five years ago, but because of a continued decline in interest rates, doing it again seemed smart.
 But who would get her business? As the branch manager of a small, family-owned bank in Cushing, Ms. Burns, 53, said she was aware of the very attractive rates and terms offered by the larger banks in Oklahoma and in Internet offers and mail solicitations. 
 As good as they looked, she went back to the lender that had handled her loans in the past. Yes, she knew the firm and, yes, the service and good relationship were nice, but she was also determined to save money. 
"Their reputation is based on word of mouth, so they have to be competitive; I know I'll get the best deal out there," said Ms. Burns, who is refinancing a 30-year mortgage, which now carries a 7 percent rate. She said she was reviewing several options and, as of Thursday, had not decided on loan terms or rates.
Her lender, Mortgage Source of Stillwater, Okla., which offered a better deal than even the bank she works for, prides itself on repeat business. A'kos Kovach, the president and owner, says he often puts together "no cost" refinancings, in which he absorbs the closing costs except for a loan origination fee, just to keep the business.
"Most people don't like to talk about three things: sex, religion and their money," he said. "When they start talking about their finances, that's a very personal arena. The reason they do come back to me is they do have confidence their information is kept confidential."
The relationship between Mr. Kovach and Ms. Burns is just a snapshot from what has been the longest and strongest refinancing boom in more than four decades.
Going back to your lender, though, can mean different things. While small-town lenders like Mr. Kovach boast of working with repeat customers to bring their costs and rates down, larger companies say true savings are achieved only through them, because their high volume drives down prices. 
Some mortgage experts say the best approach may sound simplistic -- going back to your original lender and urging it to make a deal for your business. That can mean trying to persuade the lender to drop the interest rate of your original loan rather than writing a new one. But that approach can be impossible if your original lender sold your loan to a third party.
And the refinancing marketplace has changed as much as every other financial arena. LendingTree.com, a Web site that matches consumers with lenders, says that about 20 percent of its loan requests are repeat business. Given that the loans handled through the site are farmed out to different lenders, the chances of being paired up repeatedly with the same one are extremely remote.
Consolidation in the mortgage industry means that large companies are controlling more of the marketplace. Last year, for instance, five corporations handled more than 40 percent of all mortgage applications, although that may not be clear to the consumer because those corporations do business through hundreds of smaller firms.
Returning to your previous lender may provide a high comfort level, but the savings may not add up to much. The appraisal will often be waived, for example, saving a few hundred dollars, and the application fee, sometimes called the loan processing fee, may be bargained downward. Both may be accomplished with a new lender as well, though you may have to negotiate harder.
"My experience has found that sometimes you're able to get preferential deals, but sometimes you don't," said Kevin Iverson, president of Reed Mortgage in Denver. "I'm not so sure if you go back to your current lender that you're going to get a better deal, but at least it might be an easier process."
In any event, refinancings keep rolling along. Last year, there were 8.5 million refinancing applications, a record, for about $1.4 trillion in loans. The Mortgage Bankers Association of America estimates that there will be far more this year -- about 11.5 million refinancing applications representing nearly $2 trillion in loan value.
According to Freddie Mac, formerly the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 5.34 percent last week, versus 6.81 percent a year ago. The average for a 15-year mortgage was 4.73 percent, down from 6.28 percent, and a one-year adjustable note was 3.61 percent, down from 4.85 percent.
The new lows have caused various forecasters to revise their industry projections. The mortgage bankers group predicts that refinancings will start to slow down this fall. Last week, three of every four mortgage applications were for refinancings; two weeks ago, it was two of every three.
"Things won't significantly slow until the fourth quarter," said Phil Colling, an economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association.
The National Association of Realtors expects the rate for 30-year loans to rise to 6.3 percent by the end of the year and then up to 6.6 percent next year.
A year ago, more people were refinancing mortgages mainly to gain more cash, by extending terms or loan amounts, thus increasing their personal debt. Now homeowners who are refinancing are generally doing so to take advantage of lower rates or to shift to 15-year or even 10-year loans, which can result in substantial interest savings, even though monthly payments are higher. 
The increase in 10-year mortgages, said Leonard Zumpano, executive director of the Real Estate Research and Education Center at the University of Alabama, reflects both lender creativity in persuading borrowers to keep refinancing and the thirst of consumers for better deals.
"The fact there has been such massive refinancings has forced lenders to look to new types of products that have a different appeal to borrowers," said Mr. Zumpano, who has refinanced twice in the last three years and now has a 30-year mortgage at 5.625 percent. "The lenders are thinking so many people have refinanced, that there's not much market left for them," he said.
The Banknorth Group, which provides loans in five New England states and upstate New York, sells about two-thirds of its loans to other companies. For those it keeps, bank officials say, it will often make an interest rate adjustment to an existing loan or waive certain fees to keep a customer's business.
This year, refinancings are about 70 percent of Banknorth's business, slightly below the industry level. David Stimpson, an executive vice president who runs the bank's mortgage division, said one obstacle to more refinancings is the time involved, given the backlog at appraisal companies, title firms and elsewhere in the loan process. The average Banknorth refinancing loan is approved within a week but then takes nearly two months to close, typical for the industry.
Richard Green, a Freddie Mac economist, said the growth of the market for 10- and 15-year loans showed the power of tumbling rates. The average age of a loan being refinanced is now just under two years, according to the latest Freddie Mac survey.
"Six months ago, we figured we'd burned through the refinancers," Mr. Green said. "But rates have fallen so much lower, we're seeing people again refinancing who just did three or four months ago. Each cycle, people get smarter. It's a lot harder to not know what's going on. If you have a Hotmail account, you're getting refinance e-mails."
Economists say refinancers should think of a mortgage as a service, not as a commodity. While the price of a commodity, like a sack of potatoes, is set by fairly straightforward market conditions, the interest rate on a refinanced mortgage is just part of the overall cost of that new loan. The total cost includes many fees, which can reach up to 2 percent of the value of the loan. Only some of those are negotiable, so customers often consider other factors, like service, convenience or speed, in choosing the lender.
THE old rule of thumb was to refinance only if the interest rate had dropped at least two percentage points from the original rate. But that guideline did not always take into account length of residency, existing household financial needs or other factors.
"That's bogus," Mr. Zumpano said of the rule. Some homeowners can benefit with even smaller rate cuts, although it depends on their circumstances, he said.
Yet a two-point drop may not be worthwhile. "Some borrowers really don't know the true costs of these refinancings -- not just the fees, but the cost of borrowing," he said.
He cited a long list of fees that may be added to a transaction, some more apparent than others. They include fees for legal and notary services, for getting a credit report and even for locking in an interest rate. Many borrowers may assume that another title search is unnecessary, but most lenders are still likely to ask for one.
In Oklahoma, Ms. Burns said she was hopeful that her lender had clearly laid out both the costs and the benefits of another refinancing.
"It's really important to me that I trust who I'm dealing with," she said.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
The Rules on Bosses' Pay Seem Written With Pencil

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
OF all the big lies out there, the one that corporate executives' pay is linked to the performance of their companies takes the prize. No matter how much of the shareholders' wealth goes down the drain, the hired hands in the executive suite keep pocketing preposterous pay and insisting that it is based on results. 
 They have a reason for keeping the myth alive. If an executive's pay exceeds $1 million, companies receive a tax deduction only if the pay is performance-based. 
 So how do executives take home big packages even if their stock lags and they don't achieve the performance goals necessary for their pay to be considered results-oriented by the I.R.S.? Stroll through recent proxy statements and count the ways. 
One is to lower the bar on the performance hurdles that executives must clear to get bonuses or stock grants. Among the pioneers was AT&T Wireless, which stated in its proxy that factors "including slower-than-anticipated subscriber and revenue growth for the wireless industry, a challenging economy, the earlier-than-expected completion of a significant acquisition, other changes in the industry, and certain strategic decisions during the first half of 2002 resulted in the original targets no longer providing meaningful incentives." So the company's compensation committee reset the performance measures. Nice.
The State Street Corporation, a manager of financial assets, announced on May 6 that it was lowering the 18 percent rate at which return on equity had to grow before bonuses could be earned. Now it is 13 to 15 percent. 
Then there are the companies like the Bio-Technology General Corporation, in East Brunswick, N.J., which blather on about how compensation is based on performance but quietly note that executives can get bonuses when targets are not met if the compensation committee concludes that it's "in the best interests of the company."
Dave & Buster's Inc., a restaurant operator, said that while its compensation committee recognized that the company had not met its target for financial performance, its executives received incentive compensation awards based on "leadership skills, planning initiatives and employee development." Although the chief executive's bonus fell 40 percent last year, his salary and bonus together gave him a 7.5 percent raise.
"For top levels of senior management in companies such as this, at least 90 percent of any bonus should be based on hard financial targets," said Paul Hodgson, a senior research associate at the Corporate Library, a research group. "And if they are set at the beginning of the year and those targets are not reached, there is absolutely no excuse for the company to adjust targets downward in order to ensure compensation for executives."
Representatives of companies who returned calls said their actions were not only fair, but also needed to keep talented executives. At least the change at AT&T Wireless applied to half of its employees, not just top management. 
The softness in performance targets may explain why executives at so many laggards received pay raises last year. Equilar Inc., a compensation analysis firm in San Mateo, Calif., compared pay at the nation's 450 largest companies with returns in their stocks. Dividing the universe into quartiles, the firm found that while the median market value of companies in the third quartile fell 20.1 percent, their bosses made 4.9 percent more. More amazing, executives at the worst performers received the biggest option grants -- a median $4.52 million worth. 
Shareholders typically can vote on executive compensation only every five years. That makes it even more crucial to be vigilant about stopping the transfer of wealth from owners to executives that corporate compensation has come to represent.

HEADLINE: City Unions' Leadership 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"When Labor Bosses Were Boss" (news article, May 18) suggests that the leaders of New York City's large public-worker unions have failed to offer leadership in the current financial crisis. 
 Public-sector unions played the crucial role in mobilizing support for the Legislature's passage of a historic revenue package. 
 I also disagree with the comparison drawn between the city's current labor leadership and union leaders who faced the 1970's fiscal crisis.
We revere the accomplishments of our predecessors. Yet concessions made in the 70's have had permanent and negative consequences. One example is New York City's four-tiered pension system, in which city employees working side by side in identical jobs draw different benefits.
You seem to argue that the only way labor leaders can be statesmanlike is to agree to draconian cuts or otherwise compromise our members' interests. We chose a different route this time, asking first for increased revenue from those New Yorkers most able to pay.
This solution is in the best tradition of our movement.

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/2003 Kia Sorento; 
Why Kia Is No Longer a Punchline

BYLINE:  By NORMAN MAYERSOHN

 BODY:
IT used to be easy to ignore Kia, or laugh it off as the bottom-feeder of the auto market -- South Korea's answer to Yugo. When Kia began establishing American dealers in the mid-1990's, it mainly attracted buyers -- usually young, on a tight budget, or both -- in need of few-frills starter cars. For about the price of a used late-model vehicle, these shallow-pocket customers could drive away with a factory warranty and that new-car smell.
 That's all changing. Sure, Kia still claims the lowest-priced sedan sold in America, the $9,995 Rio, but with the introduction in 2001 of the midsize Optima, followed a year later by the Sedona minivan, Kia is gamely bootstrapping itself out of the basement -- even a full-size family sedan, the Amanti, is on the way. But Kia's best shot at breaking into the big leagues may be the 2003 Sorento, a midsize sport utility that extends Kia's reputation for creating vehicles that deliver a lot of equipment for relatively little money. 
 The Sorento is not just a collection of bells and whistles stuffed into the S.U.V. equivalent of an ill-fitting bargain-basement suit. Kia's new sport utility is an attractive package, contemporary in almost every way, with styling that appears to have borrowed a few licks from the Lexus RX or Mercedes-Benz M-Class, particularly around the angled roof pillar behind the back doors. And while the Sorento is well equipped -- all versions are powered by a modern 3.5-liter V-6 and are fitted with four-wheel disc brakes -- it lacks any single attribute that elevates it to must-have status.
That is, until you get to the window sticker: the rear-drive Sorento LX starts at $19,995, including the destination charge; the EX is $24,595 with part-time four-wheel drive and can be equipped with antilock brakes ($520) and a luxury package that includes leather upholstery and an automatic slip-sensing four-wheel-drive system, as well as a handful of other extra-cost items.
By Kia's estimates, the Sorento's price is $5,000 to $7,000 below comparably equipped S.U.V.'s of similar size -- a group that includes the Jeep Grand Cherokee, Nissan Pathfinder and Toyota Highlander. Sorento's 107 cubic feet of passenger room outdistances those three similar-size, five-passenger competitors, though the Kia falls short in cargo capacity, partly because the raked rear hatch intrudes on the rear compartment.
Put another way, Kia has delivered a midsize S.U.V. for the price of a compact cute-ute like the Honda CR-V, Ford Escape or Jeep Liberty.
A bit of background: Kia entered the American market under its own name in 1994 -- in the late 1980's it had built the forgettable Festiva for Ford -- and it joined the S.U.V. fray a year later with its small and rather crude Sportage. As the 90's closed, Kia found itself swept up in Korea's economic crisis, eventually becoming part of the large Hyundai Automotive Group through a stock acquisition. The American franchise has grown from a modest 12,163 sales in 1994 to 237,345 in 2002, and this year it is outselling long-established brands like Mazda and Mercury.
Students of the modern S.U.V. might logically presume that the Sorento is some toughened-up derivative of the Sedona minivan, in the way that the Acura MDX and Honda Pilot were conceived from the Honda Odyssey's gene pool. Not so. The Sorento's architecture is purely truck gear, and its body is bolted to a ladder-type frame with nine cross braces that was developed primarily for the American market.
Like many truck-based S.U.V.'s, four-wheel-drive models have a part-time transfer case, manually actuated with a dashboard knob, unless the buyer opts for the automatic torque-on-demand system. A rigid rear axle, like the Grand Cherokee's, promises off-road ruggedness.
The Sorento shares no chassis structure with the Hyundai Santa Fe, though it does borrow Hyundai's 192-horsepower 24-valve V-6 engine, which Kia has adapted to fit lengthwise in the engine compartment.
In my driveway, face to face with the Sorento EX for the first time, I was impressed by the roster of features and the quality of materials for a sticker price of $24,495. The design cannot be called a breakthrough, but the fit and finish of the panels were at least to class standards, the paint was excellent and the full roster of safety considerations included side-curtain air bags.
Thoughtful touches abound: the hood is held open by gas struts rather than a flimsy prop rod; the spare tire, tucked under the rear, is full-size and mounted on a matching alloy wheel. A clean layout and tasteful execution of the interior colors and textures assure that an owner won't develop an inferiority funk unless the neighbor rolls up in something that costs twice as much.
Still, there's room for improvement, even at this price. Losing the imitation wood on the dashboard, making antilock brakes standard and raising the wimpy 3,500-pound towing capacity would be a start. The fuel economy (an estimated 15 m.p.g. in town) could be a lot better.
While it's true that favorable labor costs and efficient factories explain part of Kia's price advantage, they don't cover all of it. Some of the difference results from the simplified option choices. Limiting the selection streamlines manufacturing, and without technology-intensive amenities like navigation and electronic antiskid systems, development costs can be constrained.
But the Sorento's occupants can feel it, too, in the lower level of refinement. The engine is willing, but doesn't break into a jubilant harmony when prodded; the suspension does a competent job of soaking up bumps, though without the polished, precise feel of more developed competitors. You get what you pay for and then some, but for the most part, the rule about free lunches still holds.
There's no question that the Sorento furthers Kia's position as a value leader. The list of standard equipment -- including air-conditioning, power windows and door locks, cruise control and an eight-speaker audio system with compact disc player -- clinches that. Buyers with doubts about Kia's durability will be comforted by a 5-year, or 60,000-mile, bumper-to-bumper warranty (including roadside assistance and some loaner car provisions) and the 10-year, or 100,000-mile, powertrain coverage that has already drawn many shoppers to showrooms.
The Sorento is too new to offer long-term reliability data. And while Kia remains the bottom-ranked automaker in the Initial Quality Survey by J. D. Power & Associates, it has shown steady gains. Brian Walters, director of product research at J. D. Power, said Kia's defects had dropped 36 percent over four years. "Kia's quality improvements are far outpacing the industry," he said, "and they are closing the gap" with mainstream competitors.
By most standards of judgment short of actually owning the Sorento for a while, Kia's S.U.V. seems to offer a tempting value proposition. It does not look cheap or drive cheaply -- quite the contrary -- and equals almost every attraction offered by its competitors, including a $1,000 rebate and interest-free financing.
For a lot less money, it delivers the comforts required of a midsize S.U.V., but without the leading edge in electronic controls and driver aids: antiskid technology, navigation systems, rear-seat video screens.
So while the Sorento may be a half-step behind the pack in techno-gadgetry -- the EX's altimeter and barometer notwithstanding -- drivers primarily concerned with high-value transportation may find that's no drawback at all.

HEADLINE: Investing; 
For Many College Savings Plans, aYear of Lost Savings

BYLINE:  By JOHN KIMELMAN 

 BODY:
MOST investors in state-sponsored college savings plans have found that the performance of their portfolios bears much resemblance to the returns of the overall stock and bond markets.
 Portfolios tied to the stock market have generally fallen sharply in the last year, while those with substantial bond holdings have generally performed well. 
 Named for a section of the tax code, the 529 savings plans allow Americans to save for their children's college education without incurring federal taxes, and some states provide other tax benefits. Investors have poured money into the plans, which had $29 billion in assets as of March 31, with about 3.5 million children listed as beneficiaries, said Joseph F. Hurley, founder and chief executive of Savingforcollege.com, a Web site that provides information on the plans. 
The 529 plans were established in 1996 and gained popularity in January 2002 after a change in federal law making withdrawals exempt from income taxes. 
In the 12 months through March, the most recent returns available, investors lost money in every portfolio focused on the stock market, according to data from Morningstar Inc. The average 529 stock portfolio lost 25.8 percent in that period, underperforming the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index by one percentage point. (Many 529 plans may be faring better in the second quarter this year, given the 10 percent gain in the S.& P. 500 since March 31.)
Age-based portfolios, the most popular choice for investors across the country, also lost money in the 12 months through March. These portfolios contain a blend of stocks and bonds. They are heavily weighted in stocks when a beneficiary is a young child, then gradually accumulate bonds as she approaches college age. The average portfolio appropriate for a 5-year-old, for example, lost 17.8 percent in the 12 months. 
By contrast, fixed-income portfolios had a gain of 8.24 percent, on average, in the period, and were up 2.18 percent in the first quarter this year, Morningstar said. 
In addition, nearly half the states offer guaranteed fixed-income portfolios that use insurance policies to safeguard principal. These portfolios generally promise a return of 3 or 4 percent a year -- a modest amount that still compares favorably with most investments in the stock market over the last three years. (Some states offer prepaid tuition plans that are exempt from federal taxes under Section 529 of the tax code.)
The returns of the various college savings portfolios roughly parallel those of similar investments in mutual funds, Mr. Hurley said. "These return results are in line with the results that an investor would get outside of a college savings planif you followed the same allocation formula," he said. 
While investors are free to choose among many plans approved by the 50 states and the District of Columbia, many states provide tax breaks for investors who choose their home state's plan. New York, for example, allows state residents to deduct up to $5,000 annually from their taxable income for investments in the New York State plan, which is run by TIAA-CREF; the deduction jumps to $10,000 for a married couple. 
But tax benefits may be of little use to investors with money-losing portfolios. Among the worst performers have been specialized technology and growth portfolios run by companies like Alliance Capital, which manages Rhode Island's plan, and Pacific Life, which manages one of Montana's. These investments lost more than 40 percent over the 12 months through March and were down slightly in the first quarter, Morningstar said.
There were wide variations in the returns of age-based plans. For example, a number of aggressively managed age-based portfolios intended for a 5-year-olds lost 23 percent or more in the 12 months through March. An aggressive, age-based plan run for South Carolina by Banc of America Advisors lost 25 percent, Morningstar said. 
More conservative age-based plans, with a smaller weighting of stocks, have had smaller losses. A conservative portfolio intended for a 5-year-old and managed by Van Kampen Investments for Alabama's state plan lost 0.5 percent in the 12 months.
Federal rules allow Americans to switch investment options in a 529 plan once a year. Financial advisers and marketers of the plans say investors should be careful when they choose their portfolios.
"We let them know in the literature that there are no guarantees with this kind of investing," said Dale A. Hatch, deputy executive director of the Utah Educational Savings Plan, which has attracted many out-of-state investors because it uses low-cost index funds from the Vanguard Group. 
Investors in bond portfolios have had little to complain about. The best-performing fixed-income funds returned 14 percent in the year through March, and the worst performers lost only a few percentage points. 
Still, Neil G. Carousso, a financial planner in Whitestone, Queens, said fixed-income portfolios should be used only by investors who are trying to preserve capital, either because they are risk averse or because they are saving for someone who will be entering college soon. "Remember that bonds over the long term won't keep up with the general stock market," he said. "And with almost four years of down markets, I would lean toward advising investors to have a more aggressive asset allocation."
MOST financial advisers are generally reluctant to steer investors toward narrowly focused college saving portfolios like those focused on technology stocks, unless they are part of a well-considered asset allocation strategy. 
Richard A. Davies, an executive at Alliance Capital who oversees the nationwide marketing campaign for Rhode Island's 529 plan, for example, said investors shouldn't bet too heavily on his firm's tech fund or on its other specialized portfolios.
"We offer these individual funds, but it's our recommendation that people invest in age-based portfolios" or in broad-based stock portfolios, he said. 
TIAA-CREF, the asset management firm that oversees college savings programs in 13 states, including New York, California and Connecticut, has avoided offering portfolios that emphasize specific sectors of the stock or bond markets. "We want to spread the risk of owning stocks and bonds," said Timothy E. Lane, TIAA-CREF's vice president for tuition financing. 
Advocates of 529 plans say the programs continue to make investment sense, despite the disappointing results for many investors. "When you factor in the potential tax savings," Mr. Hurley of Savingforcollege .com said, "they are doing well enough in enough cases to show that the whole idea is a good one."

 CORRECTION:
A table last Sunday with an article about the performance of the college savings plans known as 529's referred incompletely to the return data calculated by Morningstar Inc. When mutual funds underlying the plans' portfolios were older than the portfolios themselves, Morningstar based the longer-term returns on the portfolios' current allocation of mutual funds. The portfolio returns assumed reinvestment of dividends and capital gains and included portfolio expenses, but excluded sales charges, enrollment fees and taxes.

HEADLINE: Defending the Right Not to Have a Nice Day 

BYLINE:  By WARREN ST. JOHN 

 BODY:
ON a rainy morning last week at his office at the West 57th Street headquarters of CBS News, Andy Rooney, the nation's curmudgeon in chief, took a few minutes to talk about the virtues of complaining. He sat in his familiar spot behind the walnut desk he made himself, and in front of a bookshelf full of titles that seemed to say something about their owner: there was lots of H. L. Mencken, a copy of Bertrand Russell's "Sceptical Essays" and a book called "The Worst of Everything."
 "The only way to correct what's wrong is to talk about it," Mr. Rooney said. "A restaurant needs complaints or it's never going to fix what's not going right." 
 He leaned forward in his chair, scrunched his bushy eyebrows together and adopted that quizzically philosophical tone he uses in his Sunday night broadcasts. 
"I don't know why we're so evasive," he said. "People are not honest about what they say. Part of it passes for good manners, and part of it is wanting to be liked by not being negative about things. Negative does not have a good reputation as compared with affirmative."
Indeed, these are tough times for America's cranks, complainers and curmudgeons. Maybe because there's so much that is genuinely wrong -- with threats of terrorism and a rotten economy -- Americans just aren't in the mood for pessimism. And anyway, in a culture dominated by the relentlessly cheery ethos of the self-help movement, grumps and contrarians are frequently dismissed as mildly delusional, or worse, viewed as malignancies that must be isolated and cut out.
If there were any doubt that cranks are under siege, consider that on Wednesday a group calling itself Smile Mania is putting on a national event called the Great American Grump Out, which aims to do for cantankerousness what the Great American Smoke-Out did for tobacco addiction. Janice Hathy, a 55-year-old stress management consultant from Venice, Fla., has been promoting the Grump Out with a series of happiness exercises; she recently headed a "drive-by smiling" in which she and some local students stood at an intersection and flashed cardboard smiley-faces at passing motorists. On the big day, she said, she and a "grump patrol" will don clown-noses, blow bubbles and hand out bananas. ("When you look at them sideways, they look like smiles," she explained.) They plan to establish "no grumping zones" in her hometown and to urge their fellow citizens toward positivity and optimism. 
Ms. Hathy likens negativity to a plague. "It makes us sick and keeps us sick," she said.
Barbara S. Held, a psychology professor at Bowdoin College and the author of "Stop Smiling, Start Kvetching," a book about the virtues of curmudgeonliness, said the Grump Out is part of what she calls "the tyranny of the positive attitude in America."
"It's telling people there's one way to be -- smile, be positive," she said. "First you feel bad, then you're told you're defective for not being cheerful about it." Ms. Held added that the pervasive feeling that iconoclastic ideas are unhealthy may be depriving younger Americans of what she called "the right nutrients to grow a curmudgeonly attitude."
Indeed, America might be facing a curmudgeon shortage. The country's best-known cranks are aging -- Mr. Rooney is 84, Gore Vidal is 77, Art Buchwald is 77, Jimmy Breslin is 73 and even Fran Lebowitz, 52, is getting up there -- or else they're imported, like Christopher Hitchens, Andrew Sullivan and Simon Cowell, the grouchy judge on American Idol. It's enough to make one feel pessimistic about pessimism.
So how many curmudgeons are there? It's hard to get a tally, in part because few curmudgeons will cop to their curmudgeonliness. Mr. Rooney, for example, said he never cared for the term and doesn't know why it's applied to him. Ms. Lebowitz said she preferred the term "realist." Bill Maher, the former host of "Politically Incorrect" on ABC, who lost his job after he angered network executives with comments about Sept. 11, said he wasn't one, and that he wasn't a contrarian either.
"When people hear contrarian they think that you're trying to be contrary," he said. "No, we are just of the opinion that the rest of you are crazy. I really do think religion is bad and drugs are good," he added, "and I really am for mad cow disease."
Mr. Maher said he has long felt like an outsider. "When Ronald Reagan used to say 'It's morning in America,' I always thought to myself, 'But I'm not a morning person,' " he said.
Jon Winokur, the author of "The Portable Curmudgeon" and a self-described connoisseur of curmudgeons, said the term suggested "a crust of misanthropy," and added that most curmudgeons are characterized by an ability to "combine malice with wit." George Carlin, Dennis Miller, Mr. Vidal and Mr. Breslin make his list of favorite cranks. Mr. Winokur said he knew of only one genuinely young American curmudgeon, 31-year-old Geoff Shackelford, a golf writer who makes a living writing cantankerous reviews of golf courses. Mr. Shackelford said he's been on a curmudgeon's apprenticeship of sorts, reading lots of Mencken. But he said it's not easy being a young grouch. 
"Look at comedy now; that says it all," he said. "Much of it has gravitated towards slapstick, like Jackass, instead of a Mel Brooks, Carl Reiner 'Let's have fun with stereotypes.' "
"It's the death of being able to make a joke about something," he said. 
So what does it matter if there are fewer cranks? Julie K. Norem, a professor of psychology at Wellesley College and the author of "The Positive Power of Negative Thinking," said curmudgeons actually serve an important cultural role. "They help us as a society to avoid complacency," she said. "Most people would rather avoid the negative."
Ms. Norem said most curmudgeons are what she calls "defensive pessimists," people who think about what could go wrong, rather than what could go right. She called the trait "the opposite of denial," and said it could have a positive effect. By thinking of negative outcomes, defensive pessimists prepare themselves practically and psychologically for unpleasant outcomes. 
Alan Zweig, an admitted crank and a filmmaker currently at work on a documentary called "I, Curmudgeon," takes a predictably dimmer view. Mr. Zweig said that in his experience the only people who benefit from encountering curmudgeons are other curmudgeons. He gave an example. Suppose you're in a bar, he said, and Celine Dion is blaring on the juke box. "You look around and everybody is saying, 'This is so great -- I want to play this at my wedding,' " he said. "Then somebody comes along and says, 'Hey, turn this garbage off.' That's a great moment," he said. "You needed that."
"If you're the least bit negative or suspicious you can go crazy if you don't hear the odd person saying something you think too," he said. 
But being the lone voice of reason, he said, can have a social cost. Mr. Zweig was at a party a few years ago when a Nike commercial featuring the late writer and heroin appreciator William S. Burroughs appeared on the television. Offended by the idea of an addict selling sneakers to kids, he launched into a curmudgeonly rant. "Everybody looked at me like, 'Ooo, that guy, he gets all worked up over a sneaker commercial. That's kind of sad, that guy with his lonely opinion,' " he said.
"There is a level of self-destructiveness to it," he said. "Curmudgeons don't pick their battles, they fight every battle."
The isolation of curmudgeons in America may be rooted in our country's heritage. Ms. Held, the Bowdoin psychologist, pointed out that Alexis de Tocqueville wrote in 1840 that America was built on the profoundly uncurmudgeonly idea of "the indefinite perfectibility of man."
"By virtue of being conceived in a democratic country we are by nature optimistic," she said.
Even so, Ms. Norem said that according to her research, between 25 and 30 percent of Americans are defensive pessimists, and therefore have the foundations of a curmudgeonly attitude. (In France, she said, the number is closer to 50 percent.) 
In laboratory studies, she said, she has found that defensive pessimists can do better at everything from puzzles to throwing darts if they are allowed to engage in anxious worrying beforehand. Show the pessimists a nice relaxing nature video before the tasks, and they do worse. The lesson, Ms. Norem said, is not that everyone should be negative, but rather, that pessimists and curmudgeons should get in touch with their inner negativity and embrace it.
On Grump Out day, Fran Lebowitz said, she plans to do just that. "In order to be cheery, you have to be unconscious," she said. "And anything that has the word 'out' in it, I don't like -- except 'Get out.' "

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH/Steven C. Leuthold; 
Leuthold Core Investment Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
STEVEN C. LEUTHOLD, lead manager of the $160 million Leuthold Core Investment fund, is extremely bullish about the stock market.
 Since the fall, the price-to-earnings ratio of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has pointed to a big market rebound, he said. "In October, stock prices reached their median valuation levels from 1957 through 2003," he said from his office in Minneapolis. "Our work shows that half of all bear markets have stopped at that point." 
 The fund now has a 70 percent stake in stocks, as high as it typically goes, and nearly double the allocation 12 months ago. 
"Corporate bonds and Treasuries seem terrifically overvalued now," he said. "We can't find anything to buy that looks attractive except high-yield bonds." These bonds account for 15 percent of the fund's assets, the most permitted. The remainder of the assets are in cash, 10 percent, and real estate investment trusts, 5 percent.
The fund returned 3 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, placing among the top 13 percent of all domestic hybrid funds, which own a mix of stocks and bonds. That category lost 2.3 percent and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 11.4 percent, both annualized, during that time, according to Morningstar Inc. The fund gained 1.3 percent in the last 12 months, compared with declines of 4.4 percent for its group and 12.6 percent for the index.
Mr. Leuthold, 65, is chairman and chief executive of Leuthold Weeden Capital Management, the fund's investment adviser. James E. Floyd, 56, is a managing director of the adviser and co-manager of the fund. Andrew J. Engel, 43, the fund's other co-manager, is vice president of the adviser.
Mr. Leuthold and Mr. Engel allocate the fund's assets by using a proprietary computer model that is run weekly and has more than 170 variables. "We've got all the bases covered," Mr. Engel said. "We try to quantify and take the emotions out of our investment decisions."
To measure fundamental value, the model uses variables like ratios of price to earnings and price to cash flow. To gauge investor sentiment, it checks consumer confidence indexes, for example, and cash flows into mutual funds.
The model also looks at insider-trading patterns, the volume of new issues, and other measures of investor supply and demand. Among its technical measures are stock price movements and trading volume. Finally, the model considers economic indicators by reviewing interest rates and inflation, among other things.
Each variable receives a weighting based on reliability, Mr. Leuthold said, and the results are compiled into a single ratio. When that ratio is more than 1.05, he said, the managers are very bullish on the stock market. When it falls to less than 0.95, he said, the managers become cautious.
The ratio is now at about 1.3, explaining their exuberance about equities.
"We think that there is more potential and probably not much more risk in stocks than in U.S. Treasuries right now," Mr. Leuthold said. 
Bond analysis, he said, is not his firm's strength, so he invests the fund's 15 percent stake in junk bonds in three no-load junk-bond funds: T. Rowe Price High Yield, Strong High Yield Bond and Northeast Investors.
IN February, the fund began buying shares of Nextel Communications, the wireless communications company. The managers paid $12.50, on average, for the entire position; the stock is now at $14.88. "Nextel is part of our telecom survivors thesis," Mr. Floyd said. "We believe the severe three-year telecom shake-out has taken down the good companies along with the poor ones."
As the economy improves, he added, the managers expect that telecommunications products and services will rebound and that stronger names, like Nextel, will gain market share from weaker companies. He projects that its earnings-per-share growth will average about 15 percent annually over the next three to five years.
The managers also own shares of Biosite, a company in San Diego that develops tests to improve doctors' ability to diagnose disease. Mr. Floyd said Biosite was in position to benefit from moves to lower health care costs; he expects the company's earnings to grow 30 percent a year, on average, over the next three to five years. The fund bought shares in February, paying $35.50, on average; the stock is now at $44.76.
Another holding is Foundry Networks, a company in San Jose, Calif., that designs, makes and sells computer networking products. "As profits continue to improve, we expect business to increase its capital spending," Mr. Floyd said. "One beneficiary of this trend will be technology stocks, and networking stocks in particular." He projects a long-term earnings growth rate for the company averaging 15 to 20 percent a year.
The fund began buying shares in August, paying $7.80, on average. The stock now trades at $13.93

Where Greed Is Good, A Mob Opportunity

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN 

 BODY:
GARY WEISS, the author of "Born to Steal: When the Mafia Hit Wall Street," argues that mob-related brokerage firms, including one that employed the subject of his book, a small-time crook from Staten Island named Louis Pasciuto, have been able to steal millions of dollars in securities frauds. 
 The ease with which they recently have done so suggests there is a basic problem in how Wall Street is regulated. Following are excerpts from an interview.
 WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN

Q. Did the mob's involvement in unscrupulous brokerage firms, or chop houses, and similar kinds of fraud help set the stage for the abuses that occurred during the Internet bubble?

A. I think they did. What you had was a certain mind-set on Wall Street. Greed is the only thing that matters. The making of money by any means necessary is life itself. It's this credo that the chop houses had and that became the credo of Wall Street.
After he started cooperating with authorities, Louis was reading about these dot-com criminals and these analysts who were lying to people. He had always wanted to be in the legitimate Wall Street. But he realized he had been in the real Wall Street all along. The chop house Wall Street and the real Wall Street were the same phenomenon.

Q. Was financial fraud a major moneymaker for the mob, or just a sideline?

A. You can never be 100 percent certain. They don't publish financial statements. But as best as organized-crime experts can ascertain, Wall Street and brokerage firms by the late 90's were a major moneymaker. They used to have the numbers racket in Harlem. They used to have the Fulton Fish Market. They used to have garbage. They went seamlessly into Wall Street.

Q. Many were arrested. Is the mob still there?

A. Yes. They'll never be gone. You're talking about a subculture of people in certain neighborhoods of New York City and throughout the country.
Organized crime is a subculture, a lifestyle. It endures because the lifestyle is enviable. People like to get books written about them. They like to become famous. They like for TV series to get done about them. They're pursuing the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. You could put the bosses in jail forever, and it's not going to affect what's going on on the street.

Q. Exactly what game are they playing now?

A. Frankly, I don't have up-to-the-minute sources. I was able to find out what the mob was doing on the Street after the fact because people were willing to talk about it. Anybody who tells you they know what the mob is doing today is lying. You just don't know. They're involved in unions, they're involved in gambling, and they're involved in loan sharking. But have they found something new and innovative? Is there some guy sitting at a social club saying, "I've got an angle?" There's no way to know.

Q. What role did the leaders of the NASD play in allowing these abuses to occur?

A. They had a tendency to look the other way. They did not do a good job of combating the Mafia. They didn't do a good job of combating stock fraud. I think they simply were not interested in going after the chop houses. A little bit like the French army in 1940, they were prepared to fight the First World War, not the Second. The NASD was ready to fight the scamsters of 1983 or 1985.

Q. How much of the stock market bust can we blame on the mob?

A. That's an impossible task. Nobody really knows. But I'd say we're talking about billions, well into billions. If you compared the amount of money lost by stock fraud and defined it broadly to include analysts lying to their customers, stuff going on in big firms and improper accounting, if you look at that as one entity, we're talking billions and billions. How much of that would be mob-related?
It would be a small percentage. You have to look at the mob stuff as an example of the character of Wall Street run amok. I don't think that anyone would say stock fraud is Mafia-dominated.
The gangsters were able to latch on to this great American phenomenon of stock fraud. What is there about Wall Street that, without blinking an eye, the Mafia can come in. Doesn't that tell you something? It tells you something about the morality of Wall Street and the regulation of Wall Street.

HEADLINE: No Power, No Rebirth In IraqiBusiness 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq 

 BODY:
LAST Tuesday, like most days since the war, there were no customers in Rahim Dhiyakh's butcher shop. The heavy sides of beef and lamb hanging from wall hooks shone dark and glassy, spoiling in the heat.
 Before the war and Iraq's troubled peace, Mr. Dhiyakh's shop would stay open until midnight, but now, with most of his business gone, it closes at around 4 p.m. The shop gets only a couple of hours of electricity a day, far too little to keep the freezer running. His customers, mostly women, are too frightened to venture out during the evening on Baghdad's dark and often lawless streets. 
 "Electricity is the main problem," Mr. Dhiyakh said, as one of his employees washed a large tree stump used as a butcher block. "Electricity means safety, work. It's the chain of life." 
In the most palpable of ways, the American promise of a new Iraq is floundering on the inability of the American occupiers to provide basic services, particularly electricity, in Baghdad, a city with five million residents, about the size of metropolitan Houston, and the country's economic heart. On the priority list of places where power must be restored here in the capital, business and industry are last, after hospitals, water and sewage treatment plants and residential areas. The logic to the list is that homes account for 80 percent of electricity demand in the city, while business and industry consume 4 to 8 percent, said Dr. Karim W. Hassan, the interim head of the national electricity commission. 
But businesspeople here warn that the the slow pace of power restoration to industry and commerce could devastate what's left of an economy already weakened by 12 years of sanctions.
"The impact of this is a ripple effect," said Maazen Baaghet, co-owner of al-Shumuz, which makes plastic shopping bags in a factory in the capital's industrial Jamila district. "If I can't operate 24 hours a day, then my workers can't get the salaries they used to, and that affects the buying power of the household. That spreads through the state and the country. And if this keeps up, it will lead to the economic deterioration of the country."
From Mr. Dhiyakh's butcher shop to Mr. Baaghet's factory to large chemical plants to the refineries that make the gasoline and cooking gas now in shortage here, businesses, even those with their own power generators, have sharply scaled back production. Without electricity, people do not go to work or have work to go to. And without street lights, the city faces an even higher crime rate, residents say. Amid such privations, one of the few things that thrives now in Baghdad, at least, is a deepening distrust and anger toward the United States. 
"We were hoping that the Americans would rescue us," said Ameen al-Haj, 57, co-owner of the Is'Haki Dairy Farm Company, one of Baghdad's oldest and largest dairy plants. "I still have that hope, but now I'm not so certain. In the last one and a half months, things have just gotten worse."
BUSINESSPEOPLE here are especially frustrated because most of Iraq's power plants were unscathed by the war and much of the country actually has more power than it did before the fighting. But Baghdad is the choke point. Shooting and bombing badly damaged the high-voltage power lines that move electricity into and around the city. Iraqi engineers, with the help of the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the Bechtel Group, the primary American contractor for rebuilding here, are working frantically to repair hundreds of severed high-voltage lines.
The American administration here says that the power shortage is easing and that people in Baghdad get about eight hours of electricity a day. Dr. Hassan estimated significant improvement by the end of June. But the distribution of electricity is very uneven in the city, and Iraqi engineers in charge of repairing the grid say that most of Baghdad gets far less -- and at erratic times. The power sometimes vanishes for days.
"Sometimes people get three hours, four, five," said Shaker Karim, chief engineer of the middle region network of the electricity commission, who oversees 40 crews that repair power lines around the city. "If you get six, you are very, very, very lucky."
Baghdad will need less electricity this summer than it did last year because industry will not be running at full strength, said Peter Gibson, the senior American adviser to Iraq's electricity commission and a civilian employee of the Corps of Engineers. But that trend is already clear to Bagdad's businesses.
Outside Mr. Haj's dairy plant, on a street in central Baghdad, the air still smells sweetly milky. But because the plant receives just two hours of electricity a day, it is running nowhere near full strength. Just after the fall of Baghdad, he said, the plant got about four hours. As a result, the plant's production has dwindled to 20 metric tons of products daily, compared with 100 metric tons before the war. Customers are buying less now, he said, because they do not have the electricity to refrigerate the products. Once able to turn a healthy profit, Is'Haki now barely breaks even, Mr. Haj said.
Is'Haki's production has been aided by its two generators. But they sometimes malfunction, forcing the plant to throw out entire batches of food. The generators cannot run round the clock, and neither does the plant anymore. At 2 p.m. on a recent day, workers in rubber boots and white coats were hosing down the floors of the plant and moving some products into a cooler to close the plant for the day. All the employees at that hour were men, the women having been sent home earlier because of long travel times and fear of the crime that could come with nightfall. Mr. Haj is trying not to cut any jobs.
"I have a staff of 250 here," he said. "If I close my factory now, what would they live on?"
The Iraqi electricity grid was frail even before this latest war, said Mohammed al-Atif, chief engineer for Baghdad's electrical distribution system, which includes the lower-voltage power lines that deliver power into homes. He said the grid's condition reflected the accumulated damage and neglect from the Iran-Iraq War, the Persian Gulf war of 1991 and then the sanctions imposed by the United Nations, which were rescinded only last week. 
At full production, Iraqi power plants can generate around 5,500 megawatts, said Haitham al-Yassein, head of the Iraqi transmission network's technical office. (One megawatt is enough for about 1,000 homes.) But the country needs about 6,800 megawatts at peak times, Mr. Yassein said. 
To make up for the difference, electricity had been rationed around the country, with Baghdad, as the seat of power, receiving a disproportionately large share and the rest of the country losing out. For example, the northern city of Mosul got only four hours of electricity a day in previous summers, but Baghdad routinely received nearly 20 hours a day by importing it from regions deemed less important. 
Several times a week, Iraqi electricity industry officials meet with Americans in one of Saddam Hussein's palaces to discuss repair progress. On Thursday, the Iraqis and Americans worried aloud about how regions that were once compelled to export power to Baghdad are now so flush with a sense of freedom that they are rebelling. 
"It's a good sign of democracy," Dr. Hassan said to the other men around the table, "but these other power stations are making trouble at the wrong time."
Whenever a new issue seems to be resolved in the repair of the grid, another flares. The meeting often begins with the chairman, Maj. Gen. Steven Hawkins of the Army Corps of Engineers, receiving a quick report about how many cars belonging to Iraqi engineers were stolen in the preceding few days. At another meeting recently, the Iraqis told him that two cars had been stolen, including one containing a hydraulic compressor needed to refasten severed power lines.
The repair effort may be getting a boost now that power-grid specialists from Bechtel have arrived in the city. The company received a contract worth up to $680 million from the United States Agency for International Development to repair nearly all of Iraq's infrastructure, except for the oil and telecommunications industries. 
For now, Bechtel is taking a decidedly low-profile approach to working in Iraq, portraying its function as more of a handmaiden's than a leader's. "We understand the impatience" among the Iraqis to have their electricity restored, said Thomas Wheelock, the international development agency's infrastructure team leader, who is working with Bechtel here. "We want to enable the Iraqi management. We feel like we're in a supporting role to the Iraqis."
Bechtel has about 120 people in Kuwait who are gradually arriving in Iraq to work on all the infrastructure projects; at least 15 are already in the country working on electricity, said Michael Robinson, Bechtel's power sector manager for the Iraqi reconstruction. The Bechtel electricity specialists are now visiting Iraqi power plants to assess what is most needed to improve electricity output in the short run before sitting down to detailed discussions with the Iraqis about longer-term work, Mr. Robinson said.
BECHTEL'S quick appointment to rebuild Iraq has been a contentious issue in the United States, where critics say it won the contract in bidding that was limited to a few American companies because of political connections. Still, the company's presence here appears to be addressing the pent-up needs of Iraqi power engineers, who have been handing Bechtel representatives a wish list of the many parts and types of equipment they have needed for years. The company is already providing chemicals to power plants and equipment to repair the high-voltage lines. 
But Iraqi engineers and technicians are doing almost all the back-breaking work of splicing power lines and digging down to cables in 110-degree heat. On a recent morning, Mr. Karim, the chief engineer, visited a crew repairing downed power lines that have run through the dusty yards of High Voltage Street, a procession of high towers through the Ghazalia district of western Baghdad. "The work," Mr. Karim said, standing in a garbage heap on the side of the road where his employees were working, "is primitive, very primitive."
With hard hats their only protection, the half-dozen men used a truck with a winch to drag together two pieces of a fat aluminum cable severed during the war. Schoolchildren pestered them like flies, asking them to turn on the electricity again. The workers cut the frayed ends off the cables and clamped them together, leaving the section of cable looking as segmented as a finger and not terribly reliable.
So far, it is the best the Iraqis can do until they get more equipment from the Americans, Mr. Karim and other engineers said. Warehouses filled with spare parts and equipment were looted. Mr. Karim's own storage room is shuttered and bricked in, a hole in a broken window to the room serving as a portal onto the hills of ash left after it was burned.
Looting has continued, though maybe in a more organized form. Mr. Atif of the distribution system said thieves with cranes cut overhead lines at night to pilfer the copper and the insulation material, which they sell as scrap to neighboring countries. 
Mr. Baaghet's plastic-bag factory is in an industrial zone surrounded by smelters that he and his partner know melt the stolen copper. One day, he said, a truck rattled past the neighborhood carrying electric cable insulation material that clearly had been used.
The factory, al-Shumuz, is getting the same two to three hours of electricity it received immediately after the war and is working at less than 40 percent of capacity. Of the dozens of factories in Baghdad that made such simple shopping bags before the war, only three to five are working now, Mr. Baaghet said, and none at full strength.
"We can't go on much longer like this," he said. "Perhaps another four months, and then we'll have to shut down."
One of his suppliers, Makki al-Jenabi, sat watching his 4-year-old son, Mohammed Makki, buzz around Mr. Baaghet's desk. Reckoning that there would be some instability after the war, Mr. Jenabi, 38, had socked away about 20 tons of raw material for plastic bags to sell to his clients. But he is running out and unable to produce more because, unlike Mr. Baaghet, he has no generator.
"I figured that after a month, everything would be all right," Mr. Jenabi said. "But out of six employees, I only have two now. When I let the other four ago, I had to apologize for how things are."

HEADLINE: Motor City 

BYLINE:  By FIELD MALONEY; Field Maloney is on the editorial staff of The New Yorker.

 BODY:
AMONG the attractions of Hunts Point, that patch of the South Bronx that juts out into the East River like a clenched asphalt fist, are a juvenile prison; ominously shuttered drinking establishments with names like Al's Mr. Wedge; informal, and illegal, late-night drag races on the weekends; and the world's largest wholesale fruit and vegetable market. Since the 1940's, the Point, as natives call it, has also been a grease monkey mecca, with almost 200 junkyards, garages and used auto parts shops packed into a couple of square miles. 
 Dead cars from all over the city and country, thousands and thousands of them, enter the automotive afterlife here. Pilgrims in search of the city's cheapest used crankshafts and U-joints and carburetors follow right behind. What doesn't get dismantled to reappear as someone's bumper or radiator or door, gets crushed, shredded, baled and loaded onto a container ship full of scrap metal headed to Asia, where it is melted down into low-grade steel. 
 People who work in junkyards tend toward blithe pessimism. And for the last decade or so, everyone on the Hunts Point auto strip has had extra reason to be dour. Local proprietors say that historically, the fortunes of the city's junkyards, like those of the bond market, have dwindled in boom times and flourished in busts. In the last decade, business was generally slow. A booming city didn't have much need for bargain parts. But with the economy faltering,the scavengers are returning to Hunts Point.
 They come from all over the Bronx, from the other boroughs, from Long Island and New Jersey. Rarely do these hunters and gatherers come alone. Foraging for car parts tends to be a social activity -- for the technical counsel, for support in heavy negotiations, for the pleasure of a sunny day's drive up to the Bronx with company. They come in pairs: fathers and sons, neighborhood buddies, young couples; or in threesomes. Sometimes even a "Cheaper by the Dozen"-type family entourage pulls up, chasing down, say, a carburetor for a 1989 Dodge minivan. Customers confer among themselves in the many dialects of the language Car: from Hindi to Korean, from Haitian French to Turkish.
 Customers like Derrick Johnson and his cousin Mike, who live on the same block of the Grand Concourse in the Bronx and were looking for a driver's-side door to Derrick's '94 Toyota. He pointed to his old door -- it looked as if it had come in second in a demolition derby -- and shook his head sadly.
 "Got took out by a plow on the first snowstorm," he said. "Didn't slow the plow down much."
 For Paul Song, from Fort Lee, N.J., going to Hunts Point was a kind of homecoming. Mr. Song, a spiky-haired skateboarder in an Army surplus parka, wore like a badge the streetwise manner and hip-hop inflection that he'd absorbed as a kid growing up in the Bronx. He had driven out from Fort Lee with his father, a courtly silver-haired man, who rode shotgun. The elder Mr. Song sat in the car while his son haggled over the price of a grill for their Mazda. Every now and then his son leaned in the window to brief him, formally, in Korean, on the course of the negotiations. The elder Mr. Song made a few strategic nods, but said nothing. 
 Then there was the Bronx-Italian mother and daughter team in search of a bumper, and the young Latino couple who, while waiting for a driver's-side headlight to be mounted, strolled through the junkyards. They held hands as they stepped around discarded tires and oil-slick potholes.
 HUNTS POINT isn't the city's only hub of car culture. Like mushrooms around a stump, blocks devoted to automotive commerce spring up on the margins in all five boroughs: under highway overpasses, in failing warehouse districts; places where land comes cheap, and residents, if there are any, don't have enough clout to make a fuss about the piles of rusting steel littering the landscape, the dust and the noise. 
 Places like the section of Corona, Queens, behind Shea Stadium (which, in aerial photos, has the dazzling, eerie look of a virus seen under a color microscope: a giant, garish mass of scrap metal slowly colonizing the entire borough). Or where Jerome Avenue runs over the Cross Bronx Expressway, and under the elevated No. 4 tracks. (Thirty auto glass shops are squeezed together on a single block there: employees carry signs on the streets to lure passing drivers. This particular strip has its unique conveniences -- at one spot, you can get an "oven baked factory paint job" for your car, and then pick out a live chicken next door, to be slaughtered and dressed while you're waiting).
 All these areas have their merits, car-wise: Jerome Avenue is known for repairs, the strip behind Shea for its sheer size and variety. But Hunts Point has a reputation as the place to find a part, any part under the sun, for as cheap as it gets, as long as you are willing to pick through enough junkyards.
 These yards are mostly old-fashioned mom-and-pop affairs. The Point has not been infiltrated yet by the new breed of postmodern junkyards that belong to corporate chains, and look like showrooms, with sparkling white floors and computerized inventories, where security cameras and motion detectors take the place of the mangy Doberman chained out front. 
 Most of the yards and used-parts shops are cash and carry only. Though the auto crimes unit of the state's Department of Motor Vehicles makes frequent surprise visits up and down the strip, and conspiracy theories about the city's trying to shut down the junkyards are floated with gusto here, Dina Improtad, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Consumer Affairs, says very few complaints have been reported in Hunts Point over the past few years. (Still, she urges consumers to patronize only used auto-parts shops that can show a secondhand-auto dealer's license and salvage yards that can show a green-and-white dismantler's license.)
 UP and down Hunts Point Avenue, on a recent Saturday, people were draped over windshields, huddled under hoods, snaked under car bodies, perched on tires. Headlights and mirrors hung in dense braids from shop fences and walls. At Abad Auto Glass, salsa played over a set of speakers jury-rigged atop a stack of rims. The owner's mother-in-law had wheeled a hot dog cart out to the street, and was doing a brisk business. A weight bench had been set out in the yard of the auto glass shop next door, and a bare-chested man hoisted a barbell, attended by two men and a bored pit bull. Springtime in the Point.
 A few blocks down, on East Bay Avenue, a woman lounged in a white plastic chair in front of a walled, concrete compound that was open to the sky. Inside, there were a couple of storage trailers, three wrecked cars, scattered piles of radiators, other assorted car parts and a Puerto Rican flag. There wasn't an inch of ground that wasn't covered. A handful of grizzled-looking men with soot-caked hands and faces were gathered around the woman like courtiers. On a sign behind her, in big yellow-and-blue letters, were the words "Radiator Woman."
 "That's my line, radiators," she said. She waved her hands in the air. "Radiators, radiators." Her hands were coated with grime, but her fingernails were shiny pink. "At radiators I am the best," she went on. "I see a car, I say, what radiator, what year, what is the problem?"
 Radiator Woman, who is in her late 40's and whose Christian name is Iluminada Castro -- she also goes by Tita -- is a licensed welder, and the only female used auto parts proprietor on her street, most likely the only one in Hunts Point and, quite possibly, in all five boroughs. She is surely the only female radiator specialist. 
 In every way she lives out the dualism suggested by the name of her business: radiator woman. The feminine merged mysteriously with the automotive. She paints her lips cherry red, and shiny gold hoops, big as engine gaskets, dangle from her ears. She is compact, like an economy sedan. 
 If she were a car, she'd be stick shift, not an automatic, to accommodate the dizzying pace at which she changes gears, going in a moment from a furious shower of Spanish invective, punctuated by fist-shaking and enthusiastic spitting on the dirt, to bright cackling, to ruminative melancholy as she sits in her plastic chair reflecting on life and contemplating the view: 1 2 3 Auto Wreckers across the street, where Manny is always screaming something at Manny Jr., who is always up on the roof searching through skyward stacks of parts, and can never hear him. 
 "You want a '94 Ford Explorer grill?" Manny Jr. will say. "No, you moron, I said an '89 Mercury bumper," Manny Sr. will shout back. 
 Whenever Manny Jr. comes down from the roof, he wheels around on a forklift very fast, several car bodies stacked on the tines like a pile of dirty dishes. The other day, it was sunny, and in a mood of mellow reminiscence, Radiator Woman told her story.
 Radiator Woman was born in Puerto Rico, and came to the Bronx with her family as a child. She married here, but soon after her husband left her and their young son. She went to work in a textile factory, but began to fix cars on the side. She was 28. 
 "I buy an old car, I practice fixing in the street," she said. "I take a radiator out, put it back in. I break it, I fix it, I put it back in. I go to the junkyards, and if the radiator no good they give it to me for five dollars and I practice. Nobody taught me." 
 Pulling out a Newport, she went over to a propane tank almost as big as she was. She picked up a torch attached to the tank and flicked. There was a whooshing hiss of flame, and she lighted her cigarette. Then she dropped the torch, and went on: 
 "The first car I fixed was a '78 Mustang. The engine was too big for the radiator and blew up. So I buy a three-line radiator, put it in car, problem fixed, my brother sell it. Ford LTD was the second car I fix. It wasn't easy working in the street. When I made a few dollar, I buy a van. I put on the side of the van, 'Radiator Woman.' People were surprised to see a woman fixing radiators. They tell me: 'I want to bring my wife up to see you."'
 A young man with a mop of slicked-back hair, and sunglasses with small rectangular green lenses, entered the yard. "Do you have an engine fan for a Mitsubishi Diamante?" he asked in Spanish.
 Radiator Woman marched into the back of her shop, realized he wasn't following, turned and yelled at him in Spanish. He jumped, and hustled after her. She began peeling apart a pile of parts, tossing them aside as she dug down, a flurry of hubcaps and bumpers, fan belts and old coffee cups. Then she shouted and triumphantly lifted up a Mitsubishi fan. 
 "I'll give you 20?" the young man said.
 Radiator Woman frowned. "Thirty."
 The man shook his head. "Twenty." He held out a bill. "It's all I have."
 Radiator Woman shook the fan at him, raising her voice. "You need this. I don't need it, papi. I tell you the truth."
 Finally, the man yanked a five from his wallet. "Twenty-five," he said.
 Radiator Woman considered, and then silently, petulantly, stuck out an open hand. 
 Farther up the block, an older black man leaned against the hood of his car, basking. He was lanky, had a rough-cropped, salt-and-pepper beard, and wore green work clothes. His name was Larry Creeo, and he demolishes boilers here for a living; his father had demolished cars here before him. Both had left high school to work on the Point. 
 "Back in the 70's, prostitutes were all up and down the streets here -- all day," Mr. Creeo said. "People burned and cut abandoned cars out on the street. Set them on fire to cut the gas tanks off. It was a madhouse. The city cleaned the place up. There's always been junkyards here ever since I can remember. And before the junkyards it was all goat farms." 
 He got quiet, stared off into the distance, apparently caught up in a vision of all those billy goats milling around where Luxury Auto Salvage and Millennium Auto and Truck Salvage now stood. "All goat farms," he said, shaking his head. 
 A COUPLE of blocks over, on Bryant Avenue, Mike Jones was out on the street in front of his house, changing the gas line of a black '85 Cadillac Fleetwood. The Cadillac belonged to Mr. Jones, and he had laminated "Nothing but Love," in large pink block letters, on the top of his windshield. 
 Mr. Jones, who said he operates forklifts for the Hunts Point Market, owns six Cadillacs -- Coupe de Villes and Eldorados and Fleetwoods -- from the 70's and 80's, which he has painted in shiny canary yellows and powder blues. He refers to these Cadillacs in the feminine pronoun, and treats them with a husband's mixture of tenderness and henpecked resignation. He drives them all, taking turns, so that none of the cars get jealous. There is no question of who wears the pants in Mr. Jones's relationships with his Caddies. 
 "I go all over," he said. "Wherever she wants to go. Wherever she take me. I let her lead the way. I got to." 
 Mr. Jones said his Cadillacs play a big role in his romantic life. He has as many girlfriends as he has cars, and he makes sure to always take the same girl out in the same car.
 He moved with his mother and younger brother from Soundview, in the Bronx, to Hunts Point a year ago. For Mr. Jones -- a man who likes to say, "No better car than an old car" -- the Point is agreeable. Allied Used Auto Parts and Salvage sits around the corner, and he goes to see Nick, his man there, at least twice a week. 
 Mr. Jones enjoys renown in the neighborhood -- "Everyone, they see all these old cars and this young guy," he says -- especially because of his sky-blue '79 Coupe de Ville, which he calls the Monster. He replaced its muffler with four chrome pipes, which make a sound similar to the launching of a space shuttle. ("Lets the car breathe better," Mr. Jones says. "Don't want her to be choking.") He plans to put hydraulics in next. ("Then you can do the bunny hop! Make the car bounce up and down, side to side.") 
 Mr. Jones took a break from the Fleetwood's gas line, leaned against the car's hood and gazed up and down the street approvingly, all his Cadillacs gleaming in the sun. 
 "It's all right, Hunts Point," he said. "More space to park cars."

HEADLINE: Doctors Seek to Cut Malpractice Awards 

BYLINE:  By DAVID WINZELBERG 

 BODY:
HUNDREDS of lab-coated doctors rallied on Long Island on Tuesday to protest high liability insurance rates and call for a cap on pain-and-suffering awards in malpractice cases.
 Physicians and medical staff carried signs and listened to speeches from colleagues in specialties like radiology, obstetrics and neurosurgery who talked about risk, rising costs and diminishing rewards to a smattering of applause. The demonstrations, held simultaneously at Eisenhower Park in East Meadow and Hecksher Park in Huntington, were part of a statewide protest organized by the Medical Society of the State of New York. 
 "Doctors in New York State are paying the highest medical liability rates in the nation," said Thomas Donoghue, director of communications for the medical society, headquartered in Lake Success. Mr. Donoghue said the liability insurance issue "goes far beyond doctors" to effect people in all walks of life. "All this is ultimately passed on to the consumer," he said. 
As payments from health management organizations for certain procedures have gone down, insurance rates and the risk to the caregiver have increased, doctors complained, making it difficult for some high-risk specialists to stay profitable. Eventually, several doctors said, Long Island patients will go looking for an obstetrician or a neurosurgeon and not find one.
Already, people seeking mammograms on the Island have a four- to six-month wait, because many radiologists refuse to do the screening for fear of being sued if something is missed. "Mammography is reimbursed at a lower rate than the cost of providing it," said Dr. Steven Palter, 36, an obstetrician-gynecologist in Syosset. Dr. Palter, an infertility specialist, moved his practice to Long Island 18 months ago from Yale University Hospital. "My malpractice insurance here is three times what it was in Connecticut. People told me that I was crazy to practice medicine here. Everyone is leaving New York."
Many doctors said their homes are in the names of their wives or other family members because when their insurance coverage limit is reached, their personal property becomes fair game in malpractice suits. Dr. John Cafaro, 45, an obstetrician-gynecologist who practices in Garden City, said some doctors are paying $130,000 for only $1 million worth of protection. "But we are getting sued for $85 and $90 million at a time," he said. "You do the math. Every time I walk into an operating room I put my family's life savings on the line."
Besides doctors in high-risk specialties, hospitals are also affected by rising insurance costs. Joseph Quagliata, president of South Nassau Community Hospital in Oceanside, said the malpractice crisis is making it tougher on hospitals to stay in the black. "It is compromising the ability of the provider community to continue to deliver proper care," he said.
One of the biggest reasons for high insurance rates is the risk of a huge lawsuit and subsequent award if something goes wrong. Many of the doctors said they blame lawyers and the current tort system for generating unreasonably large settlements and judgments. 
"We find it unfair all the droves and droves of TV commercials for lawyers looking to sue us," said Dr. James Ferguson, 47, who practices family medicine in East Islip and attended the Huntington rally. "They are giving out $30 million awards. My whole neighborhood in a lifetime won't earn $30 million. How can they give these numbers?"
Some states, like California, have adopted caps on awards for non-economic damages. Last month, the House of Representatives approved a bill that would set a limit of $250,000 for those awards, although states could set that number higher. Here in New York, however, attempts to get an awards cap have failed.
"It passed in the Senate, but Sheldon Silver, the speaker of the Assembly, controls the agenda," said Dr. Vincent Geraci, 57, an internist who practices in Garden City and is president of the Nassau County Medical Society. Dr. Geraci said Mr. Silver was a member of Weitz and Luxenberg, a law firm which specializes in medical malpractice and asbestos cases. Last month, Mr. Silver denied that this association was a conflict of interest.
John Bracken, 65, a partner in Bracken, Margolin and Gouvis in Islandia, said doctors have been making the same complaint since the early 1980's, but a cap on awards would be "inherently unfair." Mr. Bracken, who co-chairs the New York State Bar Association task force on the tort system, said: "If a patient loses a leg because of malpractice he would get $250,000. And if the patient lost two legs, it's the same value?"
Although doctors complain about their insurance burden, Mr. Bracken said they won't give you what percentage of their incomes it amounts to. "I don't see any doctors filing for bankruptcy because they can't make a living," he said. "They may be making less, but then lawyers are making less too."
Putting a cap on awards would also discourage lawyers from taking malpractice cases, said Mr. Bracken, because the time and effort involved wouldn't be worth it. Doctors are saying the same thing about practicing high-risk medicine.
Dr. Robert Weiss, an obstetrician-gynecologist who practices in Bethpage, said patients will soon go wanting. "One day you will come to my office and there will be a sign on the door that says 'Go see them,"' Dr. Weiss said. "Then you will see a sign on their door that says 'Go see them.' Maybe then you'll get a trial lawyer to deliver the baby."

HEADLINE: . . . And Fortitude for the Job Hunt 

BYLINE:  By BETH KRESSEL; Beth Kressel, an English major pursuing a career in journalism, lives in Highland Park.

 BODY:
AT Rutgers University commencement on Thursday, I gave the valedictory address for Rutgers College on behalf of myself and 16 other valedictorians -- a record number, all with perfect 4.0 grade averages. I spoke before some 2,500 fellow graduates and our friends and families. The next day, I joined the ranks of the unemployed. 
 Many would consider this a tremendous letdown, especially given the current economy and the national unemployment rate of 6 percent. The news media, in countless articles about graduates entering the job market, express more sympathy to us than a seven-day stream of shiva callers. Thank you for the pity. But, like Mark Twain, we say the reports of our demise are greatly exaggerated. And here's why: 
 My classmates and I are the masters of technology and networking, two qualities that are crucial to seeking and finding a job. Thomas Friedman, the New York Times columnist, writes in his book "The Lexus and the Olive Tree" that, thanks to globalization, everyone -- from the street peddler in Thailand to the lobbyist in Washington -- is a "super-empowered individual" who can reach around the globe "farther, faster, deeper and cheaper than ever before."
 We college grads have multiple e-mail addresses, instant messenger buddy-lists and cellphones. You might call us the top tier of the super-empowered.
 Whoever said that college life was fun and games? The word "student" doesn't cover the half of it. We are also interns, community service workers and part-time employees. Much of what we do is "volunteer," and when we do get a salary, it's often in pennies. All of us know the meaning of tight budget, and we are surprisingly resourceful.
 Faxing, photocopying, filing, and mailing. No job is too small or too tedious for us. And no one knows how to reduce, enlarge, collate or staple better. We are well educated but will also perform tasks that others sneer at. This makes us marketable.
 We are used to multitasking (see above). After graduation, we will focus solely on finding a job. And our efforts will not be diverted by 2.5 children, our 401(k) plan or house mortgage payments.
 We relish the role of underdog. Youth sports have taught us well. I am a slender 5-foot-10. As a high school basketball player, I played the position of center, banged against taller, wider bodies and still grabbed my share of the rebounds. Entering the job market at its lowest point doesn't faze me. If it doesn't kill me, it will make me stronger.
 I recognize that finding employment -- or even a position in graduate school, the Peace Corps or Teach for America -- is tougher than ever. But I also see the tremendous potential of the Class of 2003. Let's all say amen to that, even as we grant a moment of silence for our joblessness.

Prices That Are All Over the Map

BYLINE:  By VIVIAN MARINO 

 BODY:
Travelers heading to domestic destinations this summer can find some good deals, especially in the nation's heartland, according to a survey of vacation costs by the leisure travel organization AAA.
 Its annual survey, released this month, found that lodging and dining costs have risen 2 percent over all during the last year. 
A family of four can expect to pay, on average, $244 a day for food and lodging this summer. Lodging rates are expected to average $132 a night, up $5 from last year, while meals are expected to cost an average of $112, unchanged. 
 The most expensive and least expensive destinations were the same as in 2002. Atop the list was Hawaii, where food and lodging cost a family of four $533 a day on average. The least expensive was North Dakota, at $175. VIVIAN MARINO

For the Web, the Party Really Is Over

BYLINE:  By Karen Alexander 

 BODY:
As if vanishing paper fortunes, unemployment, bankruptcy and mocking books and magazine articles were not enough, dot-com pioneers are coming in for an extra measure of humility these days.
 The Webby Awards -- which its sponsors promoted as the Oscars of the Internet just two years ago, when the ceremony drew more than 3,000 people to the War Memorial Opera House in San Francisco -- will be scaled back to a virtual event this year. 
 The need for the opera house vanished along with most of the dot-coms that once crowded into the city's trendy South of Market neighborhood. Now, even plans for a modest party for 300 people -- in a tent not far from the opera house on June 5 -- have been scrapped. Not enough people expressed an interest in attending, not even many of the 150 nominees.
Instead, the awards, given by the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences, will be announced on the Internet, at www.webbyawards.com.
One nominee, Kenn R. Louis, creative director of www.spongi.com, which features short films, said he had planned to fly to San Francisco for the event. "I would like to have gone," said Mr. Louis, who is proud that his site is the first Webby nominee from Cleveland. Instead, he will throw a Webby party at a bar, in Cleveland. Karen Alexander

For the Euro, the Worst Time for the Best of Times

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
IT is a measure of the hard feelings on both sides of the Atlantic that when John W. Snow, the United States treasury secretary, signaled last weekend that the Bush administration would tolerate a weaker dollar, people here muttered darkly that the White House had finally found a way to stick it to France and Germany for having opposed the war in Iraq.
 A falling dollar translates directly into a rising euro, which makes German-built cars and French wine more expensive in the United States. Just as a weak dollar could help revive the American economy, a surging euro could hobble the exports Europe needs for growth. 
 Few Europeans genuinely believe that American policy is motivated by revenge rather than self-interest. But the conspiracy theories lay bare a deeper frustration: Europe, already bruised by Washington's unbridled use of military power, now feels elbowed by its economic muscle-flexing as well. 
The euro was supposed to right the economic imbalance. By uniting 300 million Europeans under a common currency, with a single monetary policy and tightly coordinated fiscal policies, the architects of the new Europe believed they could create a counterweight to American economic might -- a stable, thriving bloc stretching from Dublin to Athens.
It has taken just three years of wobbly economic growth, and a shift in American dollar policy, to call that into question. "This is an unprecedented experiment," said Niall C. Ferguson, an expert on economic history and a senior research fellow at Oxford. "I don't think it can be proclaimed a success yet, and indeed I would argue it has been a slow failure."
To a currency trader or an American tourist visiting Europe this summer, such a verdict might seem bizarre. The euro, after all, is trading at the highest levels since it was introduced in 1999. It has recouped all the value it lost against the dollar in the last four years, and then some. The euro is becoming a preferred asset for international investors, who are unnerved by the yawning deficits in the United States.
The trouble is, "euro power" is coming at exactly the wrong moment in Europe's economic fortunes. Germany, Italy and the Netherlands are on the brink of recession; it would be their second in two years. A hard blow to exports could be enough to tip these countries into the trough.
In this regard, Europe and the United States are in similar straits. The difference is that Washington is tackling its problems with ruthless pragmatism, typified by its decision to soft-pedal the strong-dollar mantra that was first articulated in the mid-1990's.
Europe's central bank, by contrast, is wedded to core principles that go back considerably further than the Clinton administration. Derived from Germany's Bundesbank, they reflect its obsession with inflation, rooted in the hyperinflation of the Weimar Republic.
The quickest way to slow the rise of the euro would be to lower interest rates, something the Federal Reserve has done time and again in the United States. The European Central Bank, however, has held the line, saying the need to curb inflation still outweighs the benefits of lubricating the economy.
"American policy makers are not dogmatic," said David Mackie, the chief European economist at J. P. Morgan Chase. "They buy into ideas for a season, and they discard them when it is time to move on. European policy makers are far more stuck on dogma, through thick and thin."
To be fair, the European central bankers are expected to lower rates in June at their next meeting. The question is whether the remedy will be too little, too late for European industry. Volkswagen and DaimlerChrysler have already reported eroding profits; while both have other problems, and operate huge assembly plants in the United States, they say the euro is partly to blame.
THE debate over interest rates is just part of a broader debate over whether the European monetary union is too rule-bound. The union's fiscal restraints are set out in its Stability and Growth Pact, which requires its 12 members to keep budget deficits to less than 3 percent of total output.
Germany, France, Italy and Portugal have all breached that ceiling. Given the restorative effects of government spending on a sickly economy, many economists say they were right to do it. For Germany, however, thumbing its nose does not come naturally. Chancellor Gerhard Schroder has pledged to push the deficit, now 3.8 percent of gross domestic product, back under the cap with tax increases and spending cuts.
Once again, the timing could not be worse. With zero growth, anemic consumer demand and historically low business confidence, the German economy, Europe's largest, needs a bracing tonic, not a dose of castor oil.
The White House, meanwhile, is pushing the federal budget deficit well above Europe's 3 percent mark, with a $350 billion program of tax cuts and state aid that the administration insists will revive the economy.
Not all of Europe's problems are rooted in the dogmatism of Brussels. Broader economic reforms in Germany and France have been hurt by a familiar mix of political backsliding, vested interests and the enduring appeal of social responsibility as a European ideal.
In France, public workers nearly shut down the country two weeks ago to protest efforts to rein in the pension system. In Germany, Chancellor Schroder is watering down his plans to relax entrenched labor laws in response to a rebellion by the unions and other leftist elements within his own Social Democratic Party.
Summarizing the state of affairs, the German weekly newsmagazine Der Spiegel said on its cover last week, "The Hour of Truth in a Land of Lies."
As Europe faces this hour of truth, some here believe the United States should be a model. Norbert Walter, Deutsche Bank's chief economist, said Europeans could start by drawing the right lesson from Mr. Snow's recent remarks. "The U.S. has always had the philosophy, 'the dollar is our currency, and your problem,' " he said. "We have to come to grips with that."

 CORRECTION:
An article on May 25 about the disadvantages for Europe that accompany a stronger euro referred incorrectly to the location of Volkswagen's non-German assembly plants. The company says it has not operated an assembly plant in the United States since 1988. 

GRAPHIC: Photo: HOW MUCH ARE YOU WILLING TO PAY? -- Stores in America trying to sell Louis Vuitton luggage from France, European wines, or Miele vacuum cleaners from Germany report prices going up as the euro strengthens against the dollar.

HEADLINE: The World: Long Haul; 
A Sickly Economy, With No Cure in Sight

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
FOR much of the last month, the people responsible for the health of the sputtering economy have been performing a series of emergency procedures.
 With the economy showing new signs of weakness, the House and Senate overcame sharp differences last week to pass a $320 billion tax cut intended in part to increase stock prices and give households additional money to spend. Alan Greenspan has been assuring investors that the Federal Reserve will act aggressively to prevent deflation, an unlikely but dangerous possibility. 
 And Treasury Secretary John W. Snow, by speaking without concern about the dollar's recent decline, has helped push it down further versus the euro, aiding American manufacturers by effectively cutting the price of their products relative to those of foreign rivals. 
Few policy makers or economists question the need for action, even if some are unhappy with the particulars. After roughly three years of falling stocks and rising unemployment, another downturn could create a whole new class of problems. The already big pool of the long-term unemployed could swell. Inflation -- now near its lowest level in decades -- might turn into deflation, a sustained decline in prices that can set off a vicious cycle of wage cuts and unmanageable debt. 
But even if tax cuts and carefully chosen words represent a sensible form of insurance, they seem unlikely to accomplish what everybody agrees is the ultimate goal: the creation of a truly healthy economy, one in which stocks, wages and company payrolls are rising, without an enormous financial bubble as a main cause. 
On balance, in fact, the steps being taken to pull the economy back from the precipice may delay the arrival of one able to stand on its own. "What we're doing now is trying to create a cyclical pop with a massive policy response," said James W. Paulsen, one of the few forecasters to predict the 2001 downturn and the chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. "That may well succeed -- I think it will. But very little of it will solve the problems that got us into this situation."
Instead, those problems -- consumers who remain financially stretched, a corporate sector that has not yet won back the trust of many investors and a government living well beyond its means -- will weigh on the underlying strengths of the American economy. 
Those strengths are not small, as continuing increases in productivity and the even slower growth of Europe and Japan have made clear. 
"We have in place probably the best economic infrastructure" in the world, said Douglas J. Holtz-Eakin, the director of the Congressional Budget Office. "We actually get rid of nonperforming assets."
None of that is new, however, and the economy's problems have existed long enough to raise the questions of whether slow growth is the new reality, and whether good times like the boom of the late 1990's can exist without the help of a bubble.
In Washington, the problems start with a budget deficit that is expanding more quickly than it was even a week ago. Then there are ticking fiscal time bombs like the retirement of baby boomers (which will lower the government's income tax revenues, while threatening to bankrupt Social Security) and the alternative minimum tax, a once-obscure provision that is raising the taxes of a new set of households each year. 
In future years, the upshot of these trends is likely to be a politically painful choice between higher taxes and lower government benefits.
Last week's stimulus bill added to the list of tough decisions to be made another day. To hold down the cost of the plan, Congress created tax cuts and tax credits -- for married couples, parents and stockholders -- that expire after a few years, leaving tomorrow's lawmakers to increase the deficit further or to anger voters by allowing the benefits to lapse.
Economists overwhelmingly agree on the wisdom of running deficits during downturns, particularly one that has raised fears of deflation. "The deflation scenario is so dangerous," said J. Bradford DeLong, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, "we want to take every step we can to avoid it."
What makes the slump of the last three years unusual is that spending by consumers stayed strong, which means they will be less likely to supplant the government as the main engine of growth once taxes increase or federal spending falls in future years. 
Consumers have typically emerged from past recessions with a pent-up desire for houses, cars and other big-ticket items they avoided buying during tough times. This time, an aggressive series of interest rate reductions by the Fed has helped make many of those items affordable even as wage gains have all but stopped, after inflation is taken into account.
In trumpeting the Fed's vigilance against deflation in recent weeks, Mr. Greenspan has ensured continued low interest rates. Bond traders now believe that short-term rates, which the Fed controls, will remain low for months, and they have reacted by lowering long-term rates. Thus, last week, mortgage rates plunged to record lows, making it more likely that the refinancing boom will continue. 
"This is obviously not going to go on forever," said Jan Hatzius, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs. The recent growth of consumer spending, he added, "is sustainable as long as households are able to take more and more equity from their homes."
THE one recent attempt at resuscitation that economists say is likely to bring future benefits is the dollar's decline, which has accelerated since Mr. Snow suggested he was not bothered by it. By contrast, the Clinton administration occasionally bought dollars in the currency market to bolster their value, hold down the price of imports and keep inflation low when the economy was growing rapidly.
Now, however, a little inflation does not look so bad. 
Even before the dollar's recent fall, the corporate sector was the only big part of the economy that has used the slowdown to bring its debts better into line with its assets. While the market's fall brought down the net worth of consumers by 10 percent from the start of 2000 to the end of last year, the net worth of nonfinancial companies rose almost 5 percent, according to the Fed.
Pointing to benefits from the dollar's fall, many economists say they expect corporate executives will soon end their cost-cutting ways of the last three years and decide that they can profitably use new factories and new technology.
That is a reason to think the economy will improve before the year ends, as almost every forecaster is predicting. By itself, however, it might not be enough to restore the economy to full health.

 Tally Last Week in Connecticut, New Jersey and New York.

Senate

1. Defense: Vote to kill an amendment to a $400 billion Defense Department spending bill that would have preserved a 10-year-old prohibition on moving toward producing nuclear weapons of less than five kilotons. Many modern nuclear weapons have a blast force of several hundred kilotons. Approved 51 to 43, May 20.
2. Defense: Vote on an amendment to a $400 billion Defense Department spending bill that would require the Bush administration to obtain Congressional approval before beginning development of a low-yield nuclear weapon. Approved 59 to 38, May 21.

3. Defense: Vote on an amendment to a $400 billion Defense Department spending bill that would limit the military's exemption from environmental laws that impede military training and readiness. Approved 51 to 48, May 21.
4. Taxes: Vote on a compromise $350 billion package of tax cuts and state assistance. Approved 51 to 50, with Vice President Dick Cheney casting a vote to break a 50-50 tie, May 23.

House

1. Forests: Vote to hasten the burning of underbrush and the thinning of trees on federal land as an effort to reduce catastrophic forest fires. Approved 256 to 170, May 20.
2. Defense: Vote on an amendment to a $400 billion Defense Department spending bill that would give the Pentagon broad discretion to waive laws meant to protect rare animal and plant species if the restrictions are judged to interfere with military training and readiness. Approved 252 to 175, May 21.
3. Defense: Vote on a $400.5 billion Defense Department spending bill for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The bill authorizes more than $70 billion to upgrade and buy weapons, increase military pay an average of 4.1 percent, raise hardship bonuses, improve access to military health care and provide millions of dollars for new housing for troops and their families. Approved 361 to 68, May 22. (The Senate approved a similar bill on May 22 by a vote of 98 to 1 with all senators in New York, Connecticut and New Jersey voting for the bill. Differences in the bills will now have to be reconciled in a conference committee.)
4. Jobless: Vote to extend jobless benefits by 13 weeks for workers who exhaust their state benefits this year. Without the extension, those benefits would have begun expiring after May 31. Approved 409 to 19, May 22. (The Senate approved the bill by a voice vote on May 23.)
5. Taxes: Vote on a compromise $350 billion package of tax cuts and state assistance intended to energize the economy. Approved 231 to 200, May 23.

HEADLINE: Tide of Humanity Alters Long Island Sound 

BYLINE:  By KIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: GROTON, Conn. 

 BODY:
Forty years ago in the summer of 1963, a writer for The New Yorker named Morton M. Hunt spent two weeks circumnavigating Long Island Sound in a little sailboat. 
 When he sat down to write, he mourned. A way of life was disappearing. The old culture of the Sound -- a still wild mix of scruffy boatyards, Gold Coast snobs and fishermen, all set against the vast mirror of nature -- would surely be homogenized and pushed to the brink by the pell-mell rush of suburbanization and the mass market, Mr. Hunt wrote. 
 But then there was a plot twist that he could not have foreseen. In the years that followed Mr. Hunt's trip, people gradually began to realize that the Sound -- by the power of history and population and the environmental damage inflicted upon it -- had in a very real way become a human creation. The impact of civilization was complete, the idea of a return to wild nature only a fantasy. 
The ancient estuary, extending 110 miles northeast from New York City to Rhode Island through the densest population corridor in the nation -- loved and loathed as a breadbasket, playground and dump -- would have to be managed for its own sake, and for the region's. 
And that realization produced another voyage -- of discovery and confounding mystery, triumph and setback -- as people came to understand the complexity of what they had undertaken to do.
In economics, politics, culture and science, people took action, and nature responded. A tiny sea plant called eelgrass, and a group of families here in Groton who unintentionally triggered its resurgence, play a part in that story.
"We're learning for the first time where the Sound's heartbeat is, where the pulse is," said Robert B. Whitlatch, a professor of marine sciences at the University of Connecticut. 
The management of nature, loosely called environmental stewardship, is being applied in many places around the world. In the North Sea, marine managers have compiled an exhaustive database about the aquatic food chain -- a kind of who eats whom of the fish world.
In the United States, managers are remaking the bottom of Tampa Bay with the sea grasses of its past.
But on the Sound there is much more going on than mere ecology. How people connect with the Sound, for instance, or how they don't -- and thus how much political clout the Sound's advocates can wield in Albany or Hartford or Washington -- is part of the new management equation as well, as politicians and environmentalists try to increase access to the water with new parks and beaches.
Unlike the Adirondacks or the Hudson River, the Sound never stole the region's heart. It was always too close to New York City, too taken for granted, too practical in its uses -- as a fishery, a transportation artery or a trash can. There was no wolf baying at the moon to shiver the spine, no sense of a lost wilderness to touch the soul.
What the Sound had, first and foremost, was people -- a bustling, grasping, dreaming, teeming population. It was America's first urban sea, a kitchen sink for the industrial revolution, and an ecological witness to the rise of the suburbs after World War II. Now, in the age of management, scientists and politicians say, the huge force and clout of that population -- one in 10 Americans within an hour's drive -- has once again made the Sound a kind of vanguard and sentinel. Where the nation's other great tidal estuaries might go, as demographic patterns and economies change around Chesapeake Bay or Puget Sound or San Francisco Bay, the Sound has already arrived.
"It's the first 21st-century estuary," said Glenn R. Lopez, a professor of marine sciences at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, on Long Island. "Its issues are all about human habitation."
Profound philosophical questions have emerged from this. If the Sound cannot be restored to what it was in the pre-European past -- and no one thinks that is remotely possible -- then what should it be? What is the optimum natural state in a system that has been overwhelmingly and permanently transformed by human presence? Should the Sound be managed for the sake of nature and biological diversity, or for the human pocketbook, to maximize the species people want to extract and attract the most tourists?
But perhaps the biggest question is whether people are smart enough to chart the course at all. Nature, for every push that people impose, has pushed right back.
Local and state governments have committed billions of dollars, for example, to reduce nitrogen from sewage treatment plants. But even as that process goes forward, evidence has mounted that climate change and warmer water temperatures may be altering the ecosystem as fast as humans can fix it.
Efforts to restore lobster populations have been undercut, some scientists believe, by programs to bring back other species like striped bass, which have soared in number in recent years under wildlife management. Stripers adore finger-sized larval lobsters and eat them with great gulps whenever they can.
Or consider the air itself. Wind moves differently over the built-up expanses of New York City and its suburbs than it did in centuries past, climate researchers say, and different winds make for different rates of mixing in the Sound's water column. Different mixing rates, in turn, can compound the problem of low oxygen that kills the animals that local governments are working to save through nitrogen reduction.
And on and on it goes. The ecosystem has been put in motion and no one knows where it will stop.
At a recent daylong conference on the Sound, Arthur Glowka voiced those anxieties. Mr. Glowka, a fisherman and retired pilot who had the lean and windblown look of a life lived on the water, thundered that the Sound's new managers were messing with things beyond the human ability to control, and that the piper would have to be paid.
"We're playing God," Mr. Glowka said. "And when you start to play God, you don't know what's going to happen."
When he finished, the director of the Environmental Protection Agency's Long Island Sound office, Mark A. Tedesco, rose to respond.
"I would submit that we've been playing God on the Sound for the last 300 years," Mr. Tedesco said. "Now we're just trying to do it responsibly."

The Human Hand
Politics and Lawyers Help the Grass Grow
A willowy, jade-green sea plant called eelgrass grows on the bottom of Mumford Cove, and for marine biologists and fishermen -- not to mention baby scallops, which hide from predators amid its waving fronds -- this qualifies as very big news. Eelgrass is disappearing all over the East Coast and across most of the rest of Long Island Sound, but here in an obscure little inlet on Groton's east end, it has been growing for the last decade in resplendent and thickening abundance.
The tale of Mumford's eelgrass is only partly about nature, however. And that is why it says so much about the new rhythms of the Sound. It is also about the mysteries of the human heart, and small-town politics and shrewd lawyers.
A Mumford Cove Christmas party figures prominently into the story. And so does Herman E. Sheets, a widower and retired engineer who met and fell in love with a New York civil prosecutor, then named Paulann M. Caplovitz, and brought her to live with him on the cove in 1983.
But perhaps the most important thing to know is that nothing to do with eelgrass was ever remotely intended by anybody. People, acting on their own messy and complicated agendas, changed the cove's waters, and nature, literally out of the deep blue sea, responded.
"Mumford Cove is a poster child," said R. Scott Warren, a professor of botany at Connecticut College in New London. "The hypothesis says that where you take action, nature can recover, and on Mumford Cove, you can actually test that."
What makes the cove such an ideal laboratory for the human-wild connection, Professor Warren and other experts say, is that the trajectory of its decline and rebirth was so stark and so well documented.
Mr. Sheets, who is now 94, remembers diving off the dock with his children almost every summer night in the 1950's and 1960's after coming home from work at the Electric Boat submarine yard a few miles away, where he designed boats for the Navy.
But then, beginning in the mid-1970's, it all changed. The volume of wastewater from the local sewage treatment plant, which then drained into the cove from an upland creek, began increasing as more and more people moved to the shore.
Giant mats of sea lettuce -- a thick and glutinous plant that thrives in nitrogen-rich waters -- began to take over. By 1980, the cove had stopped even hiring lifeguards because no one was swimming. And what was worse, residents were told again and again that nothing could be done. Lawyers said it would be impossible to prove in court that the sewage or the slimy lettuce were causing "irreparable harm," which was the legal standard they said would be needed to force the town to move the pipe somewhere else.
That is when the former Ms. Caplovitz, now Mrs. Sheets, strode into the picture. She had been an assistant attorney general in New York (where she had met her future husband when he testified as an expert witness in one of her cases) and she felt certain that there was another way to fight. So at her first Mumford Cove Christmas party, in 1983, she said she had an idea.
"We'd given up until Paulann came," said Robert Boggs, who has lived on the cove since the 1960's and was at the party that night. "She was the catalyst."
With the backing of Mumford residents, Mrs. Sheets arranged for a new law firm to look at the cove, and the lawyers there found exactly what she hoped they would. Years earlier, Groton had been instructed by the state to move the sewer pipe across town to drain into the Thames River, but the town never got around to it.
For purposes of a lawsuit, the cove's pollution was secondary. All the residents needed to do was prove that the town had violated a state order.
The resulting fight split Groton down the middle, sparking anger and passions that in some corners of town have still yet to cool, and it all revolved around a couple of nagging questions:
If the cove's residents didn't want the sewer outflow, why should anybody else?
Were Mumford residents better than the people who lived near the Thames, where the alternative pipe would drain?
"There wasn't really a scientific or environmental argument," said Mark R. Oefinger, the Groton town manager, who butted heads with Mrs. Sheets many times during those years.
Mr. Oefinger added, "It was all about, 'If this stuff is bad for you, why is it good for us?' "
But the Mumford argument, however narrow and technical it seemed to some, prevailed. In 1986, a Federal District Court judge ordered the town to comply with the old state order.
The cove's days as a dump were over.
And a great experiment had begun.

Webs and Consequences
Warning: Beware Of the Mute Swans
So the eelgrass bloomed, and the naturalists swooned. But people were not alone in noticing the change. 
Min Huang, the waterfowl coordinator for the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, took a helicopter flight over southeastern Connecticut this spring and saw three pairs of mute swans nesting in Mumford Cove -- the first time any had been observed there in the state's annual bird surveys.
The arrival of swans, Mr. Huang and other experts say, suggests that another cycle of human-influenced nature may be under way here. Mute swans, a non-native species that escaped from a private preserve on Long Island around World War I, are notoriously destructive and voracious feeders who love, perhaps more than anything else -- you guessed it -- eelgrass.
An adult mute swan weighing 30 pounds can eat 8 pounds of grass a day, and destroy 12 more pounds in rooting around for the choice morsels it wants. And to make the twisted cycle of nature complete, swans -- who can live 20 years or more and tend to stay permanently in their nesting areas once they've moved in -- are also officially protected by the full power of state law. The Connecticut General Assembly granted the birds protected status in the 1950's. 
Like a nursery rhyme turned on its head, the logical links tumble like dominoes: It's a crime to harm the mute swans that eat the eelgrass that shelter the scallops that the Sound's managers would love to restore if they could. A formal study of the bird's impact on sea grass, focused in part on Mumford Cove, will begin later this year.
"We do know that our decline of eelgrass has to do with water quality in many areas, but are mute swans inhibiting the recovery as well? That's what we'll be looking at," Mr. Huang said. "One hypothesis is that the places we have eelgrass are the places the birds haven't discovered yet."
And so the ripple of implications from the Mumford Cove sewer pipe fight continues to expand. Are mute swans, searching for the foods they like, a natural phenomenon, or a perverse consequence? 
What, in the end, is natural at all in a place like the Sound? That's a question that James N. Kremer wrestles with all the time.
Dr. Kremer, a professor of marine sciences at the University of Connecticut, has been studying Mumford Cove for nearly a decade, since he moved into the neighborhood just a few blocks from the beach in the mid-1990's. And on a recent foggy morning, he was doing what has by now become a monthly ritual -- testing the water, checking the growth of the eelgrass, and trying, most of all, to put the pieces of the puzzle together.
Leaning over the rail of his school's research boat about 50 yards offshore, he pushed a metal pole with a cage down into the cove's mud. Up came a green clutch of eelgrass -- short, perhaps a bit stunted from the cold winter -- but alive and well.
Dr. Kremer's goal goes far beyond merely understanding the botany. He is trying to construct what might be called a social-biological history of the cove -- a kind of management manual that mayors and wetlands commissioners all over the Sound, and perhaps the world, might be able to use in managing their local waters. The model will be stocked with all the variables about water quality and clarity -- a key factor for eelgrass photosynthesis -- along with as much of the human story that he can gather about what people did to alter that chemistry.
"We want to make it useful to town planners and managers who deal with these issues every day, so they can see where they are on the spectrum and be able to say, well, if I do something different in the future, how will it look?" he said.
This is increasingly how science works on the Sound, especially now as grant money has become tighter. In writing proposals, practical applications have become a hook, Dr. Kremer and others say. And so in a kind of feedback loop of its own, research reinforces the management systems that in turn pay for the science that justifies more management.

Relationships Revealed
A Feeling of Being In Your Backyard
Peter J. Bartinik Sr., a lawyer in Groton, remembers being dispatched as a boy to Mumford Cove by his grandmother in the 1950's to collect clams and blue crabs for dinner. He would jump in the family's boat -- not much more than a rowboat, he said, with a little outboard motor -- and gather crabs by the bucketful, jacklighting them with a flashlight beam that would stun the crustaceans in their tracks, ready for the plucking.
No one lived on the cove then. There was no beach (that was created much later by a real estate developer, using sand dredged from the cove's bottom). People would just camp out in places like Mumford, pull up in their boats, throw out a tent and spend the night, or the summer.
"We'll never get back to that feeling that the Sound is your backyard," said Mr. Bartinik, 60, who lives on the cove. "But in a way, that's good -- thinking of it as your backyard means you can do with it as you please."
That old casual relationship with nature, fading even in Mr. Bartinik's youth, is over now. Rules, regulations, protections and licenses -- for human and environmental protection -- are part of the new net. But in other ways, places like Mumford signal the beginning of a new relationship -- a new voyage to a place that is both deeply familiar, and yet also strangely undiscovered.
Some people fear that management will make the Sound into a kind of park -- pleasant and safe to be in, but no more than an extension of the built environment. Other people say the very opposite has been revealed by the management efforts so far -- how truly wild, or at least unpredictable, the Sound still is. Opportunistic species -- whether eelgrass or swans or stripers -- aggressively expand to fill the niches that arise. In such a place and time, hope and loss are intertwined.
"Long Island Sound shrugs," said James O'Donnell, a professor of marine sciences at the University of Connecticut. "These systems are more robust than anybody imagined."
And yet for all the vast machinery and energy of management that has been unleashed, perhaps the ultimate lesson of Mumford Cove is that a handful of people, thinking in new ways about the old backyard, made a difference.
Mrs. Sheets, 62, who still practices law part time -- mostly environmental cases -- said it was really a simple thing that happened. "I had two young children," she said. "I had to do something. Herman's children had swum and boated in the cove, but now it was unswimmable. I couldn't live on the shore of such a beautiful place that was so degraded."
Mr. Sheets nodded. A simple thing indeed, he said, in an interview in his living room with its a sweeping view of the cove. When he brought his new wife home here, a little more than a decade after the death of his first wife, Norma, healing began.
"After I married Paulann, everything changed," he said. "Mumford Cove started to live again."

Human Nature
Over many years of settlement, Long Island Sound has been a breadbasket and a dumping ground, a private playground for the wealthy and a symbol of environmental despair.
But when people reached for a new definition -- a repaired, restored, managed Sound -- nature did not respond according to the rulebook.
For every push to achieve a certain end, the whorls of the ecosystem have pushed right back, often in unexpected ways.
This is the first of a summer-long series of articles on the evolving nature of Long Island Sound. The second article will look at the fading world of the boatyards. Many are sinking fast as the old ways of the Sound ebb, while others hang on -- the last of the old salt survivors.
Additional materials, including a preview of the remainder of the series, can be found on the Web at nytimes.com/lisound.

(Angel Franco/The New York Times)(pg. 1) Chart/Map: "Wide Water, Shared Water"On the map, Long Island Sound's place in the grand scheme of things looks pretty clear. It is one of the geographic cornerstones of the Eastern Seaboard, a 100-mile-long pivot point of marine ecology carved into the heart of the New York islands by the last ice age. But at the water's edge, the Sound is many different things: playground, workplace, inspiration, dumping ground. Some of its facets are detailed below.

Oldest LighthouseEaton's Neck Light, first lighted in 1799. The Press of PopulationMany of the Sound's ecological problems derive from the vast number of people that populate the area.The region around the Sound is among the most densely populated in the nation. Water Quality ProblemsNitrogen -- from waste treatment plants, storm runoff and the atmosphere -- causes algae to bloom, then die and sink to the bottom. Their decay draws oxygen out of the bottom water. The resulting hypoxia can have devastating consequences for fish and shellfish. The Legacy of GeologyConnecticut is full of ridges, remnants of a collision between Africa and North America 500 million years ago that formed the Appalachians.Long Island, on the opposite shore, is flatter and far younger, created by runoff from the glaciers that advanced as far south as the Sound's northern shore. These geographical differences have influenced everything from the power of local governments to the need for harbor dredging. Busiest MarinaBrewer's Pilots Point Marina in Westbrook has the most boat slips. Most Exclusive PlaceGardiners Island is the nation's largest privately owned island, held by the same family since 1639. Eelgrass Returns to Mumford CoveAfter a wastewater treatment plant's discharges into Mumford Cove were stopped in 1987, eelgrass returned to the cove. Eelgrass (at right) is an indicator of cleared-up water and provides shelter and food for fish and shellfish.

HEADLINE: For Food Pantries, Cupboard Isn't Bare But It's Coming Close 

BYLINE:  By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: RICHMOND, Va. 

 BODY:
Hunger starts in many ways for the clients of the Lamb's Basket food pantry. Deborah Williams, 47, a home health care aide, runs out of her government food stamps in two weeks. William Hines, 40, arrives on a bicycle with a duffle bag for food on his back. A landscaper, he said, "I get jobs here and there, but my luck hasn't been that good."
 Jennifer Spurgeon, 30, has two sons, ages 11 and 12. A year ago, Ms. Spurgeon's husband left. She collects $45 a month in food stamps, $500 a month in child support and had been clearing $800 a month working in the kitchen of a Friendly's restaurant until her hours were cut to 12 a week from 30. 
 Food pantries, soup kitchens and shelters have rarely seen such demand. "I am not aware of any food bank in the country that's saying they are seeing fewer people," said Douglas O'Brien, vice president for public policy and research at America's Second Harvest in Chicago, which coordinates food distribution to 212 food bank warehouses where 80 percent of the nation's pantries pick up most of their food. Second Harvest says it is seeing three times more clients than it saw in the days before Sept. 11, 2001, when the surge began. 
In the face of the demand, some pantries are rationing food by putting less in the bags they distribute, asking clients to wait longer for bags or setting limits on the number of clients they serve. 
"The food is going out faster than it's coming in," said Rachel Bristol, executive director of the Oregon Food Bank, which distributes food to agencies, mostly pantries, throughout the state. "Some of our agencies have cut back from serving families six times a year to two." The 75-church Urban Ministries pantry of Raleigh, N.C., serves an average of 30 families a day. But 30 more a day need food, David Reese, the agency's resource director, said. "We turn folks away every day," Mr. Reese said. 
Meals served by the Salvation Army climbed from 51 million three years ago to 57 million in 2001 to 61 million last year, "and my sense is the need is still increasing," said Col. Tom Jones, a spokesman. While demand varies from city to city, the United States Conference of Mayors reported in December that in a survey of 25 cities, the number of requests for free food last year exceeded the 2001 average by 19 percent.
To help meet the demand through a program that provides about 25 percent of the food that Second Harvest manages, the United States Department of Agriculture says it spent $380 million in the 2002 fiscal year, about $200 million more than in the 2000 fiscal year. But the other sources of food are not keeping pace with the demand. 
One reason is the slow economy. Donations to pantries of private money from foundations, businesses and individuals have stalled. "People still give to us," Virginia White, president of the Kansas Foodbank Warehouse in Wichita, said. "People who used to give $100 are giving $10, $20." 
But there are other reasons beyond shifts in the economy. The 1996 overhaul of the welfare system and the law's tighter eligibility standards for food stamps are one. In moving more than half of the 12 million recipients off the rolls and into jobs, advocates of the poor say many former recipients still fail to earn enough to cover basic needs. 
Another is changes in the food industry. Supermarkets and food processing companies are using technology to control their inventories better. Many are also using better handling technology to cut down on the dented cans and scratched cartons that they give pantries. More stores and companies also sell excess and damaged supplies to a growing secondary market of discount stores rather than give them away.
The Central Virginia Foodbank in Richmond, a Second Harvest affiliate, supplies Lamb's Basket and 594 other pantries, shelters and soup kitchens in 31 Virginia counties from a 60,000-square-foot former tobacco warehouse. "We have never had more need for food," Fay Lohr, the executive director, said.
This year, Ms. Lohr said, 14 foundations have committed to a total of $48,000 in contributions to the food bank. Last year, 33 foundations gave $138,000. Two years ago, the food bank distributed 7.1 million pounds of food. With intense, door-to-door food drives to meet the rising demand, it distributed 11.4 million pounds last year.
"We're getting more U.S.D.A. product than we've ever gotten," she said. And yet, she said, "for the first time, we're having to ration food from the U.S.D.A." 
A growing industry of scavengers and volunteers feeds the supply line. Churches, which sponsor 70 percent of the Richmond food bank's pantries, ask parishioners to bring food to Sunday services. On some weeks, the Boy Scouts, the letter carriers' union or a bank organizes a food drive.
Pantry staffs are almost entirely volunteers, mostly retirees. About 100 volunteers take turns at Lamb's Basket ferrying in food from stores and the food bank, interviewing clients and packing bags and boxes. The pantries are cheerful, trusting, fast-moving places with little of the delay and paper-shuffling scrutiny of the welfare office.
Recently, two women lingered on concrete steps outside the Ephesus Seventh-Day Adventist Church on Richmond's South Side, waiting for the pantry in the cellar to open. They come once a month, they say.
"I come because I'm disabled," Phyllis Williams, 51, said. "My husband, he's disabled. He had a heart attack in January." The Williamses have two daughters and two grandchildren at home. Ms. Williams said their income was about $1,100 a month, mostly from food stamps and disability checks.
Sheila Russell, 46, a disabled and divorced mother of a 15-year-old boy, said: "It's better than Social Services because they don't degrade you. They don't make you feel like they're giving you something of theirs."
Both have worked, they said, but major companies in Richmond have been contracting and consolidating. "Let's be real," Ms. Russell said. "Look at all the money to fight that war. That's money that could have gone in people's kitchens."
Norma Foster, a volunteer, has managed the Ephesus pantry for five years. "When I started we were seeing 25 or 30 households a month," Ms. Foster said. "Now we're seeing 100 households with 200, 250 people a month. We can't take everybody." 
To receive food supplied by the Agriculture Department, a single person's income may not exceed $1,108 a month, a two-person family's, $1,493, a three-person family's, $1,878. People already eligible for disability payments, food stamps or Medicaid because of low incomes automatically qualify.
Food from the Agriculture Department, provided free to the pantry, is stored in one room. A year ago its shelves were full. Now, they are one-third full, with cans of beans and pears, boxes of powdered milk, and bags of shelled walnuts and trail mix.
"Spaghetti, juices, prunes, plums, mashed potatoes, noodles, they just don't have it now," Ms. Foster said.
At Lamb's Basket, bigger and better stocked, a can of black olives and a jar of clam juice linger on a shelf. But outdated Mother's Day cakes are moving fast. So are pasta, tuna, frozen chicken, Thomas's bagels and English muffins, and canned meals like ravioli in tomato sauce and franks and beans that a child home from school can open and heat.
"A family of five gets about five bags a month," said Betty Shumaker, the manager. In March, the last month for which she has compiled figures, the pantry served 330 households, including 447 children. In February, 229 households were served, and last June, 150.
"Jesus said, 'Feed my sheep,' " Ms. Shumaker said. "That's why we're Lamb's Basket. We'll give it out until it's gone."

HEADLINE: As Indonesia Battles Rebels, Its Civilians Bear the Burden 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, May 24 

 BODY:
The Indonesian military said today that food and fuel were running short in the northern province of Aceh, where the government began a major military offensive against separatist rebels this week. 
 The United Nations Children's Fund, or Unicef, warned of an impending crisis for the civilian population with the collapse of already weak health services, and reported arson to more than 200 schools in the last five days. 
 The increasing difficulties for civilians came after the Indonesian government pledged that the offensive, which is intended to suppress the rebels within six months, would be different from those in the past. 
This time, the government said, the military action would strive to spare civilians the brutalities of past campaigns, especially those conducted in the last decade of the rule of President Suharto, who was ousted in 1998. 
The current leader, President Megawati Sukarnoputri, said last weekend, "I hope this action will be understood and supported by all the Indonesian people, including those groups working for democracy and human rights." 
Despite the government's pledge, the chief of the armed forces, Gen. Endriatono Sutarto, told his forces last weekend to fight the rebels "until your last drop of blood." 
"You are trained to kill, so wipe them out," he said.
The new effort, headed by an army known for its poor human rights record, is referred to by the Indonesian military as a "hunt and crush" operation. 
The Indonesian Army has battled the Free Aceh Movement for nearly 30 years. In the 1990's, the army fought a secret war in the province that included torture and summary executions of Acehnese civilians. The military's brutality added to the grievances in the province, which is rich in natural resources.
Exxon Mobil operates a major plantthat exports liquid natural gas from Aceh to Japan and South Korea. The plant, near the city of Lhoksomawe, has been a target of the rebels and is now heavily guarded by the Indonesian military. The rebels complain that Aceh has never received a fair share of revenues from the central government in Jakarta. 
The current military action began last Monday after peace talks brokered by the United States, Japan and the World Bank fell apart in Tokyo. Washington has said it supports the Indonesian government's insistence on the country's territorial integrity. But the State Department said it believed that both the rebels and the government could have done more to bridge their differences in Tokyo. 
The government has an estimated 40,000 soldiers and paramilitary police officers whose goal is to push the rebel fighters out of the province's population centers and deep into the jungle. The rebels include about 5,000 armed fighters who have managed to replenish their weapons in the last several months, Western diplomats said. 
In trying to differentiate the new offensive from those in the past, Mrs. Megawati's government has talked of a "humanitarian war" that blends tough action against the rebels with protection of civilians. To that end, the government has said it has plans to provide aid to up to 100,000 people who might be displaced by the fighting. 
But human rights workers assert that money set aside for assistance is likely to be stolen before it reaches those who need it. Moreover, they say, plans by the Indonesian military for a so-called strategic hamlet program in Aceh will harm civilians more than help them.
The army has told Western diplomats that if they do not make early headway against the rebels they will forcibly move villagers into secure compounds. That would be done in an effort to starve guerrilla fighters into submission, according to the plan. 
The rebels and the government gave conflicting accounts of the number of civilians killed in the first week of the new conflict. But there seemed little doubt that a group of perhaps as many as 12 civilians were killed on Wednesday morning in a village near the rebel stronghold of Bireun. According to accounts in the Indonesian press, among those killed was a 12-year-old boy who was accused by the military of being a spy for the rebels. 
A spokesman for the Indonesian military in Aceh, Lt. Col. Firdaus Komarno, said the army was looking into those reports. 
"If our investigation shows soldiers are indeed responsible," he said, "then we will hand down punishments we promised at the beginning of the operation." 
The spokesman was referring to an order by General Endriatono to his commanders: If their troops committed human rights abuses, the general said, the commanders should "just shoot them in the head."

HEADLINE: WOMEN'S BASKETBALL; 
For Its Seventh Season, the W.N.B.A. Undergoes a Significant Makeover

BYLINE:  By LENA WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
When the Women's National Basketball Association opened its seventh season last Thursday, it did so as a league transformed by time, circumstance, and business and economic reality.
 The makeover was substantive as well as cosmetic. While the W.N.B.A. made major changes, including its contract with the players, business model, attitude toward outside investors and schedule, it also redesigned the players' uniforms and the game ball. 
 The players, although not completely happy with their new contract, now have free agency, higher salaries and an opportunity to expand their market value. The league now has a salary cap, and with it, a new television deal with five networks and labor peace for five years. The fans have two more games a team for their money and, maybe, one of the most competitive seasons ever, thanks to a dispersal draft. 
"The changes in the model will better position the league to grow and, more importantly, will allow us to consider non-N.B.A. markets as home for W.N.B.A. teams," the league's president, Val Ackerman, said. "The collective bargaining agreement gives us long-term stability, and the league and the players can both benefit from movement afforded by free agency."
But the more things have changed in the W.N.B.A., the more things have remained the same:
*The two-time defending champions, the Los Angeles Sparks, remain the team to beat. 
*The road to the Eastern Conference title will again most likely go through New York, where the Liberty keeps winning with defense despite having one of the smallest frontcourts in the league. 
*The All-Star Game is back in New York.
*Teresa Edwards, 38, the five-time Olympian and one of the most revered players, makes her W.N.B.A. debut with the Minnesota Lynx, and Cynthia Cooper, a two-time league and four-time playoff most valuable player, is back playing for the Houston Comets after two seasons coaching the Phoenix Mercury.
But the new wrinkles are significant. The league opened two days earlier to accommodate the expanded schedule. Each team will play 34 games, and the regular season will be two weeks longer, extending to Aug. 25.
The postseason, which traditionally ended on Labor Day weekend, concludes on Sept. 14.
For the past six years, the league had the financial weight of the National Basketball Association behind it. But last November, the N.B.A. Board of Governors voted to change the W.N.B.A. business model from a single-entity structure to individual team ownership. The Portland Fire, the Miami Sol and the Orlando Magic folded. The Utah Starzz relocated to San Antonio.
But out of the ashes, the league got its first outside investor in a non-N.B.A. city when the Magic was acquired by the Mohegan tribe that owns and operates the Mohegan Sun Casino in Uncasville, Conn. The Connecticut Sun will play in the casino's 10,000-seat arena. And the dispersal draft for players from the Fire and the Sol has undoubtedly strengthened some franchises.
"This year promises to be tremendously competitive," Ackerman said. "I think the fact that we had a dispersal draft was another important mechanism for teams to get themselves more competitive. Players like Ruth Riley, Sheri Sam, Betty Lennox and others are going to make immediate contributions to their respective rosters."
Riley, the Sol center, landed in Detroit. Sam, her former teammate, will be playing in Minnesota. Lennox, the guard who was the W.N.B.A. rookie of the year in 2000, moves to Cleveland. Forward Elena Baranova, also from Miami, brings her 6-foot-5 outside presence to New York. 
The league has four new coaches: Mike Thibault in Connecticut; Suzie McConnell Serio in Minnesota; Candi Harvey in San Antonio; and John Shumate in Phoenix. Anne Donovan, who twice led the Charlotte Sting to the playoffs, is the new coach of the Seattle Storm.
The W.N.B.A. is gambling that all the changes will pay off. But questions remain.
Will the salary cap hurt teams like the Sparks, Liberty, Comets and Washington Mystics with the money to spend on franchise players? Will free agency spark a movement of players around the league and bidding wars for star players? How will fans react to a W.N.B.A. team playing its home games in a casino? Will more teams fold under the pressure of taking on operating costs once borne by the N.B.A.?
The answers to those questions may ultimately shape the future of the W.N.B.A.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: POLITICS; 
Returning to Iraq, Few Kurds Want to Be Part of It

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE 

DATELINE: KIRKUK, Iraq, May 24 

 BODY:
Khasro Goran, a Kurd who is the new deputy governor of the northern city of Mosul, thumbed through a book of maps in his office there recently, tracing with his finger what he calls the true border of Kurdistan.
 The old border used to cramp Kurds in the northeast of Iraq. But since the war, Kurds have begun streaming back to the valleys and villages farther south from which they were driven in a series of ethnic cleansing campaigns that began in the 1960's. 
 Now Kurdish territory includes a plump new swath of land. In one southern province alone, Erbil, about 400 villages have been reclaimed, according to Nechirvan Barzani, the regional governor. For Mr. Goran, as for most Kurds, it is sweet victory. 
"Now we are back in Mosul," he said, pointing to the dot on the map. "We control Senjar and Mosul Provinces. We want to add the other parts of Kurdistan. We have the same economy, language and future. For the rest of Iraq, it's up to them, but for our part, we will govern ourselves."
After decades of deportations, mass killings and other miseries, Kurds are starting to feel for the first time in recent history that it is safe to return their homes. Even in Halabja, a town devastated by chemical attacks in 1988, residents are beginning to come back.
Kurdish political leaders have governed their own independent enclave in northern Iraq under American protection since 1991. In public, they say they want to be part of Iraq, but most ordinary Kurds do not want that. As American authorities propose remaking Iraqi institutions, Kurds say those very institutions -- the army in particular -- brought them only misery in the past.
"More than 80 percent of the people are for independence," said Farhad Pirbal, a professor of Kurdish history and literature at Erbil University. "It's etiquette, like a game. The politicians say what the Americans want to hear."
But, he continued, the Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani "in his heart" aspires to be president of "the country of Kurdistan."
Kurds are emerging as the most influential force in the political soup of Baghdad today. They are the only group with their own army, and Kurdish fighters -- unlike Shiite Muslim and other Iraqi militias -- would be allowed to keeptheir assault rifles and heavy weapons under an American draft proposal.
They are organized and politically conscious. They have a functioning economy in their independent zone, while the rest of Iraq has foundered. The two main Kurdish leaders, Mr. Barzani and Jalal Talabani, speak fluent English and have had dealings with the United States for decades.
"They're definitely the kingmakers, and the question is whether they might also be the kings," said Peter W. Galbraith, a professor of national security studies at the National War College in Washington.
Kurdish politicians talk of pragmatism. After all, the Kurds do not have their own state, but are spread out in four countries: Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey. The Kurdish enclave in Iraq is landlocked and could not survive without doing business with its neighbors and with Baghdad, no matter how good its relations with the United States.
"No Kurd can dissuade himself of the right to self-determination, but history and geography have been cruel to my people, and we know the possibility of a Kurdish state in Iraq is a very distant one," said Barham Salih, governor of the eastern Kurdish enclave. "The tangible thing for us is to work for a federal democracy and be a full-fledged Iraqi citizen."
But Kurds have already made substantial gains since the war. In Kirkuk, a northern city that was the center of Saddam Hussein's "Arabization" campaign to replace Kurdish residents with Arabs and give Baghdad more control over the region's oil fields, the local police force is now overwhelmingly Kurdish.
Kurds won another victory today when American forces here detained five members of an Arab delegation on its way to a city council election. The delegates were suspected of having been members of Mr. Hussein's Baath Party. The American commander in Kirkuk, Maj. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, met with Mr. Barzani on Friday at his Kurdish base.
Kurdish political parties said today that they were confident they would win the governorship of the Kirkuk region in elections on Tuesday .
The northern city of Sulaimaniya sent more than 100 doctors to Kirkuk. Kurdish militia guard the gates of the Northern Oil Company, the state-owned oil company there. In addition, Kurdish groups appear to be quietly nursing relations with foreign neighbors independent of Baghdad. A Turkish consulate will open in Sulaimaniya this month, and the local government there is pushing ahead on several oil contracts with foreign companies -- more to stake out territory than to reap profits.
The strong new Kurdish presence has chafed on the Arab community in the region, particularly in Kirkuk. Arabs there say Kurdish police officers ignore their problems. They also say Kurds, encouraged by newly energized political parties, are moving into houses that do not belong to them.
American authorities are still unsure how to handle the problem. The new American civilian administrator of Iraq, L. Paul Bremer III, cut short a visit to northern cities last week. An American official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the Kurdish issue was the main reason for the cancellation.
"The Kurds are the wild card in the Iraqi equation," said Professor Galbraith. "If they were given a choice, almost unanimously they would prefer not to be in Iraq. Over the long term, that's a big problem."
The problem is essentially one of trust. The main political parties, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the Kurdistan Democratic Party, have similar aims, but fought bitterly for territory and influence throughout much of the 1990's. The leaders ofthe parties, Mr. Talabani and Mr. Barzani, seem to have struck a truce since the end of the American-led war. But trusting Baghdad, even if it is run by Americans, is proving difficult.
Mr. Barzani and Mr. Talabani lodged a formal protest with Mr. Bremer last week, saying the new United Nations resolution to lift sanctions and redistribute funds held from oil sales was unfair to Kurds. In addition, many Kurds think the Americans have been too soft and too slow in untangling the Arabization issue, which the Kurds see as the most important issue now.
"Our previous experience is making us anxious," said Nechirvan Barzani, the regional governor and a nephew of Massoud Barzani. "We feel that we're being kept in the dark about what's happening. People are anxious and unhappy with the way the United States is conducting the process."
Since breaking free from Mr. Hussein in 1991, northern Iraq has been a relative oasis of prosperity. Satellite dishes beam dozens of television channels from every roof. Goods fill shops. All large towns have Internet cafes.
The political parties have grown wealthy, in part on renegade trade across leaky borders with Syria, Iran and Turkey, and have ruled with a strong hand. They held elections only once over the past decade, and are dominated by powerful families, personalities and unilateral decision-making. Critics say the biggest challenge for American forces will be untangling that web.
"The society is like a little mosaic of many patronage networks," said David McDowall, author of "A Modern History of the Kurds." "Kurdish political parties today are not that different from the tribes of the 18th century. You don't get democracy as an end product. You get patrons delivering chunks of delivered votes."
Most Kurds say they are aching to re-enter the larger world after decades of isolation. Because of their uncertain status over the past decade, ordinary Kurds did not have passports. They pin their hopes on the United States to modernize Iraq.
"I have never ridden on a plane or a train," said Rooshad Muhammad, 23, a medical student in Sulaimaniya. "We just want to live like normal people."

PUSHING THE ENVELOPE

BYLINE:  By Felicity Barringer

 BODY:
Back in the good old days, last month, a few basic texts supplied all the international laws invoked when one state occupies another. Now, in addition to the Fourth Geneva Convention and the Hague Regulation of 1907, there is United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483 of 2003. 
 Adopted by the Council without dissent Thursday, the measure takes international law on occupation to a place it has never been in modern history. It gives the United States and Britain sweeping authority to reconstitute Iraq's political system and control its economy. A senior United Nations official called the leap in international law "breathtaking." 
 There is little quarrel, however, with the Security Council's right to legislate as it did, ending nearly 13 years of sanctions against Iraq and giving a new United Nations special representative, Sergio Vieira de Mello, the current high commissioner for human rights, an independent but limited role in the country's physical and political reconstruction. The United Nations' lawyer, Hans Corell, had told Council members that they were free to adopt any measure they chose. But, he added, they should remember they were setting a precedent.

HEADLINE: New Rochelle Library Too Vital to Shut Down 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Many arguments can be made in support of the New Rochelle Public Library in the specter of its closing due to a lack of funding. 
 These include statistics indicating the heavy usage of the New Rochelle library (second highest among Westchester libraries); the critical role the library plays in nurturing literacy through its early childhood programs; the resources the library offers older children with homework help, computer access, materials for research projects, a source for developing a life-long love of reading and learning, and the safe haven in which the library offers these services for at-risk, disadvantaged youth; the cultural and social vitality that the library sustains through its programs in music, films and art exhibits; resume help and other job-hunting assistance for the unemployed or underemployed (particularly vital in this time of economic and employment insecurity); free English classes for new Americans seeking a better future for themselves and their children. 
 I and others are working hard to ensure that New Rochelle residents give a resounding yes for the library at the polls on June 3. But even should the vote be successful, the idea that the existence of our public library should be in jeopardy and requiring ongoing effort to keep open is simply unacceptable. 
 At a time when cities and towns throughout New York State are facing financial difficulties and are required to raise taxes to maintain city services (including their libraries), only the city of New Rochelle is hamstrung by a tax cap. This is a consequence of the short-sightedness of New Rochelle's representatives in the State Assembly, Ron Tocci and Amy Paulin. The tax cap currently prevents the city of New Rochelle from raising the funds necessary to keep the library open. But property values in New Rochelle will plummet if the library closes. In short, the tax cap is too costly.
 Even New Rochelle homeowners who do not frequent the public library and are unmoved by arguments made to keep the library open surely care about the value of their homes and property diminishing.

HEADLINE: Denver Election Is a Model of Civility 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: DENVER, May 23 

 BODY:
With Wellington E. Webb stepping down next month after three terms as mayor, city residents will elect a new leader for the first time in 12 years, and if the campaign has not made a lot of waves here or elsewhere, there is a good reason.
 As the leading finishers among seven candidates in an election on May 6, Democrats John Hickenlooper and Don Mares are headed for a June 3 runoff, and so far, they could not have been nicer to each other. 
 Theirs has been a race remarkable in modern American politics, one nearly devoid of rancor, mudslinging and negative advertising. Until now, at least, their debates and campaign literature have focused on issues. And sharing a podium, as they did here on Thursday at a forum sponsored by the Rotary Club, they actually seem to like each other. 
The amity has surprised some political strategists here, given that Mr. Mares, 46, a former state legislator who has served as city auditor for the past seven years, is a heavy underdog, and underdogs usually get nowhere by being nice.
"I'm very surprised," said Lori Weigel, a partner in Public Opinion Strategies, a polling firm, referring to Mr. Mares's sanguine approach.
In the general election, Mr. Mares won 22 percent of the vote compared with 43 percent for Mr. Hickenlooper, 51, a geologist turned restaurateur. 
City law requires a runoff between the top two finishers when no candidate reaches 50 percent.
Polls in the past two weeks showed Mr. Mares trailing badly.
"The race could tighten up, but it's pretty clear by our polling that he can't win by building himself up," Ms. Weigel said. "He has to tear Hickenlooper down. So far he hasn't, but there's still time."
While the candidates have vowed to run clean, upbeat campaigns, it was clear shortly after the general election that Mr. Mares was advised to go on the attack.
One of his seniorcampaign aides, Tim Knaus, a former chairman of the Colorado Democratic party, quit after a difference of opinion over strategy that included attack advertisements against Mr. Hickenlooper. The advertisements did not run.
In an interview, Mr. Mares said he had resisted advice from "people pressuring me" to run a more aggressive campaign over the final weeks. He was guided by a feeling, he said, that "society has been alienated" by nasty campaigns and that he should focus on problems and solutions.
"I'll point out what I think are differences, the contrast in our ideas," Mr. Mares said. "But that's all. I want us to stay aboveboard, and talk about the issues."
For all the civility, the campaign has come during Denver's worst financial crisis since Mr. Webb, a Democrat who has not endorsed either candidate, was first elected.
Like other cities that rode the high-tech wave into the mid-1990's, Denver is on a downward path by any economic measure. Over the past 18 months, the city has lost more than 17,000 jobs. Downtown office towers are begging for tenants. By next year, the city's budget deficit could reach $50 million.
Mr. Hickenlooper and Mr. Mares have made closing the deficit a cornerstone of their campaigns. Mr. Hickenlooper said he wanted to cut the city payroll by 4 percent and lower personnel costs. Mr. Mares said he would rather eliminate wasteful spending than jobs.
They agree on many issues, including job creation as critical to Denver's economic rebound, but they disagree on others. Mr. Hickenlooper said he would be open to a school voucher plan to improve educational choices; Mr. Mares opposes vouchers as a drain on the public school system. Mr. Mares said he would not rule out raising taxes; Mr. Hickenlooper said new taxes would discourage business development. Mr. Mares favors a smoking ban in restaurants, which Mr. Hickenlooper argues is antibusiness.
Mr. Hickenlooper's appeal to voters has come largely from his feisty campaign style and a strategy to sell himself as a fresh-faced political newcomer, a candidate with new ideas for lingering problems. He has pointed to his background as an out-of-work scientist who built a chain of restaurants and worked for nonprofit groups to convey his grit, management skills and community spirit.
"A lot of people are tired of politics as usual," he said on Thursday, branding himself as an outsider compared with Mr. Manes, who worked in government for years. "But I'm not the typical little guy who makes it big. In the process of building a business, I've been involved with the community and I've never shied away from speaking up when politicians didn't do so."
Mr. Mares pointed to his own frequent differences with Mr. Webb as evidence of his independence and right to say he is a political outsider.
Even so, Mr. Mares said he still needed to overcome Mr. Hickenlooper's broad appeal to close the gap, and time is running out. Mr. Hickenlooper said he feared the polls that showed him with a wide lead might scare people off. 
"My biggest enemy now is apathy," Mr. Hickenlooper said. "People are excited about the campaign, but they're not excited about politicians. My job now is to keep them turned on."

HEADLINE: PORTFOLIOS, ETC.; 
When Risks Eclipse Rewards in Corporate Bonds

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
EUGENE FLOOD JR., the chief executive of Smith Breeden Associates, has a warning for investors who have been enjoying the good returns in the corporate bond market.
 Investors, Mr. Flood said, are no longer being paid enough for the risk of carrying investment-grade corporate bonds in their portfolios. The big rally in this sector has narrowed the interest rate spread, or differential, between corporate bonds and Treasuries and has pulled the yields of corporates so low that they don't justify the risk of a downturn in the market. 
 "The reason we have changed our position is not that things are good or bad," he said. "It is because the compensation for bearing risk right now has fallen dramatically."
Mr. Flood said Smith Breeden, which manages $26 billion for institutional investors, including Unisys and the Asian Development Bank, began rejiggering its corporate bond portfolio last year and has accelerated the move in the last two months.
Smith Breeden, based in Chapel Hill, N.C., has pulled out about $7 billion from some volatile investment-grade sectors and moved the money into more conservative areas, like the agency bonds of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, commercial mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities. The firm has also changed its hedges against interest rate moves to make its portfolio less vulnerable to a sudden reversal in the corporate bond market.
Among corporate bonds that Smith Breeden has sold recently are those of Ford, AT&T and Verizon Communications. Last October, a Ford bond held by Smith Breeden had a yield of 9.75 percent. That is now down to 7 percent, which Mr. Flood said was not high enough to justify the risk that the economy would slow and the bond would sell off. He also reduced his holdings of residential mortgage-backed securities. They are less attractive because low interest rates have increased the probability of prepayments as homeowners refinance their mortgages. Commercial mortgage-backed securities have much less prepayment risk, so they are less volatile.
Mr. Flood's view that the risk-reward ratio is out of balance offers little solace to investors who, seeking safety, have put up with paltry yields of money market funds. He says that this is not a great time to take on more risk by going for attractive yields. "There are not a lot of things that are exciting on a risk-reward basis," Mr. Flood said.
Still, he said most investors should not keep much in money market funds now, because their yields are less than 1 percent and may keep falling. Some $2.15 trillion is invested in money market mutual funds, only slightly below the $2.27 trillion a year ago, according to AMG Data Services.
Mr. Flood outlined four alternatives.
The least-risky possibility is a short-duration bond fund, which mimics the performance of short-term securities and has a heavy emphasis on residential mortgage-backed securities. He said such funds could have a return of 2 percent this year, based on the yields and the profits from trading the mortgage-backed securities.
Foreign bonds, especially those from Europe, are another opportunity. Yields on European bonds are now higher than those of their American counterparts, and Mr. Flood said he expected that the European Central Bank would have to cut its benchmark interest rate soon. That would bolster European bond prices. In addition, the dollar could fall more, adding to the returns on foreign bonds when they are translated back into dollars. But this is also the riskiest alternative, because a sudden turn in the dollar could change gains into losses in a hurry.
Another option is the Treasury's inflation-protected securities, known as TIPS. But Mr. Flood warned that since mid-April TIPS have returned 8 percent and similar returns are unlikely in the near future. Falling inflation is also not good for TIPS.
The fourth possibility, high-yield or junk bonds, still provides enough return for the risk, he said, especially when compared with the alternative of putting money into the stock market, which is already up 6 percent this year.

HEADLINE: The Radical Bean Counter 

BYLINE:  By James Bennet; James Bennet is the Jerusalem bureau chief of The New York Times.

 BODY:
This is a story about fighting Palestinian chaos and corruption, about seeking to throw off Israeli occupation and build a democratic state of Palestine. It is about these things, because it is about one man's lonely pursuit of direct deposit.
 The man is Salam Fayyad, the Palestinian minister of finance, the kind of Palestinian you rarely hear about, an economist trained in Texas who has never fired a gun, sent men into battle or served time in prison or exile. He met recently in Gaza City with half a dozen men who had done these things -- who do some of them still -- the chiefs of Yasir Arafat's Gaza security services, the most hardened of Palestinian warriors. It was Fayyad's intention to intimidate them. 
 As the chiefs arrived at the Saraya, the military headquarters in Gaza, some of them wore fatigues and were trailed by men carrying guns. Fayyad, as usual, arrived alone, carrying his black satchel and wearing his nice blue jacket, red-and-blue tie and spectacles. 
Fayyad did not tell these men everything he thought: that he was horrified by the system, if it could be called that, for paying the 53,000 security officers from the dozen independent security agencies in the West Bank and Gaza; that he thought it was morally wrong to dole out $20 million in cash monthly, in plastic bank bags, to the security chiefs, to be handed out to their men, one by one; that he worried that some of the money, "paying" for ghost employees, might be lining the wrong people's pockets, perhaps even financing the kind of violence the security agencies were supposed to stop.
He did not make a point obvious to everyone in the room: that the power of the purse is power, period, and that his reform would help shift control of the officers from these chiefs, and from Yasir Arafat, to the first Palestinian prime minister, Mahmoud Abbas. In theory, Fayyad now reports to Abbas; in practice, he checks in with both him and Arafat, the president of the Palestinian Authority, who appointed him last June; in reality, he is choosing his battles for himself.
Fayyad presented his idea as a common-sense change that anyone who favored efficiency and clean government -- as security officers naturally did -- would support. He had already divided the chiefs by previously persuading two of them. Now he, the economist, not any of the military men, began pounding the table. Unless the chiefs switched to direct deposit of paychecks, he said, he could not guarantee that their salaries would be paid. Foreign donors would cut them off. Did they want to be forced by outsiders to change, or to act with a sense of pride?
Later, with the matter undecided, I rode with Fayyad from Gaza back to Ramallah, in the West Bank, where the Palestinian Authority is headquartered. He wondered whether he would have to use the weapon he held in reserve, a bean counter's laser-guided bomb: publicly naming the recalcitrant chiefs and declaring loud enough for the 124,000 Palestinian civil servants to hear that, if every agency switched to direct deposit, he would cancel the so-called intifada tax of 7 to 12 percent levied on paychecks by the Palestinian Authority during the uprising. He said he hoped that would turn the civil servants against the security leaders.
"There are battles that have to be fought, and have to be won decisively," he told me, as the car climbed toward Jerusalem. "And I may not win this battle. And then it will be over for me."
This is a terrible time to be the average Palestinian, and so it is a golden time to become an exceptional one. The Palestinians are at a historic moment in search of historic leaders -- the Jeffersons, Hamiltons and Washingtons who can wrest a viable, competent state from Israelis (even on the left) who are distrustful and angry; from a Bush administration that is chilly and distracted; and from Islamists who seem bent on endless conflict. 
Arafat remains pre-eminent. There is no Palestinian power vacuum. But there is a new softness at the core, because of the pressure on Arafat from not only the United States but also Europe. Inside Arafat's dominant Fatah faction, younger leaders are starting to attack him and his generation for mismanagement and cronyism. For them, the issue is not merely having a state, but what kind of state is worth having. Fatah members who grew up under the Israeli occupation are rebelling against the wrinkled exiles who came back from decades overseas to build a state and, in the view of these younger people, blew it.
"They can go to hell," said Khaled Elyazji, Arafat's former protocol chief, who is now running a center in Gaza for political change. We were talking about Fatah's Central Committee, composed of the faction's most venerable leaders. "These are the people who led us in the last four years from disaster to disaster."
Abbas, the prime minister, founded Fatah together with Arafat and returned like him from exile. He may surprise everyone, but most Palestinian politicians and diplomats in Jerusalem expect him to be a transitional figure between the era of Arafat and a new Palestinian leadership. (He likes to delegate authority, and to nap in the afternoon.) 
Fayyad, an ally of the prime minister and one who would clearly like to have his job someday, presents a different case study in the use of power. He dismissed the security detail that the Palestinian Authority offered him, in the belief he should never show fear. He travels by car service and taxi, walks alone across checkpoints and fields his own calls nonstop on a cellphone. The father of three children in a Jerusalem private school, he left a much more lucrative job to become finance minister at about $1,200 a month, and Israeli and American officials who study the Palestinian Authority say he is an honest man. He has been praised by Colin Powell, Ariel Sharon and Yasir Arafat; despite that, he has flourished politically. His suits, hair and skin are all rather gray, like the dense cloud of cigarette smoke in which he moves. At 51, he is fidgety, ambitious, profoundly sure of himself. He is a small, assuming man.
"If you have the authority, use it," Fayyad likes to say. "If you don't have it, create it."
The challenge to such new leaders is to fight two revolutions at once: against the Israeli occupation and against the aristocracy of revolution that has shaped the Palestinian national dream for 35 years. Arafat got his people very far -- within sight of their state -- but he has not delivered them. Many Palestinians believe that Arafat encouraged this uprising partly to save himself, to deflect anger over, to put it simply, bad government.
Ismail Abu Shanab, a senior political leader of Hamas, made an astonishing criticism of Palestinian self-rule to me recently in his home in Gaza City: "When the Israelis were here, we lived our lives better than now, in every way. Believe me.
"Look how the streets of Gaza are not clean," he complained.
This is a basic political point that Hamas understands as well as any Chicago alderman, but that the Palestinian Authority has not quite grasped. Hamas has gained strength not only through violence, but also through its schools, health clinics and reputation for incorruptibility. Arafat's failure is also a failure of the Israelis and the Americans, and it holds lessons for the United States as it tries to rebuild Iraq.
Successive Israeli and American administrations sought security above all else from Arafat, and did not pay much mind to how he went about building a proto-state, the governing Palestinian Authority called for under Oslo. Details like sacks of money dropped in the hands of security chiefs did not seem like such a problem, provided the security chiefs did what Israel wanted.
Reviving Palestinian security is central to the new peace plan, known as the road map, and the long-postponed drama with Hamas may lie ahead. But it turns out that dullness also counts: detailed budgets, due process, responsive bureaucracies -- the institutions and practices that may not capture headlines but that do improve people's lives and sustain peaceful states.
Now reform of the Palestinian Authority has gained prominence in the drive for Middle East peace. That is in part a triumph for Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who for more than a year shifted the conversation away from Israeli military tactics and settlements. It is also, potentially, a problem for Palestinian reformers. To a degree, their two revolutions could conflict, because the struggle for good governance could be seen by Palestinians as a struggle on behalf of Sharon and President George W. Bush.
Fayyad rejects that link. He is not optimistic about the new peace process. But he argues that improving governance would benefit Palestinians day to day, and also foster "character rebuilding" -- restoring a sense of what they can accomplish on their own.
The occupation, he told me, "in no way should give us a license to resign. Or worse, a license for bad governance. To the contrary."
But there is a flip side to that message. As we rode into Gaza one day this spring, Israeli forces were withdrawing from a raid that left five Palestinians dead. We passed an Israeli tank, an armored personnel carrier and a giant D-9 armored bulldozer, with its man-size steel spike canted in the air behind it. Then we parted a crowd of Palestinian children, some with bookbags, who were milling in the stone-strewn, rutted road.
Paycheck reform was suddenly beside the point, and Fayyad seemed momentarily deflated. He said he had no sense of possibility that Sharon, despite his talk of painful concessions, would ever agree to more than a "Mickey Mouse state" west of the Jordan River.
"This reform business -- it's a matter of obligation, as far as I'm concerned," he said. "But poor governance is hardly an excuse for colonialism."
As we left later that day, a warning came over the car radio that Israeli helicopter gunships were above Gaza City. From the checkpoint, Fayyad heard the explosions as the Israelis fired missiles to kill a leader of Islamic jihad.
"Sometimes it seems we're meant to fail," he said, more to himself than to me.
Fayyad is an outsider to what has become the Palestinian political establishment. He grew up in the West Bank town of Tulkarm, son and grandson of members of the Parliament of Jordan, which then held the West Bank. The family moved to Jordan proper in 1968, after Israel seized and occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the Six-Day War. Fayyad was starting 10th grade. He would not return to live in what he hoped would become Palestine for 27 years.
In accordance with his grandfather's wishes, Fayyad was sent off to college at the American University of Beirut. The university, like Palestinian colleges in the West Bank, was intensely partisan, fractured more along Marxist and "reactionary" lines than along the Islamist-secular fault that has developed since. Arafat was in Beirut then, and Fatah was in its revolutionary prime. 
Somehow Fayyad never got around to joining Fatah or any other faction. He did not like the way his friends seemed compelled to buy the party line when they joined. When he entered school politics and ran for his dormitory's council, he drew on several factions, named his list of candidates after the dorm, Penrose, and won. 
Those were the glory days of Arab economic power -- the days of OPEC and oil embargoes -- and Fayyad dropped his pursuit of chemistry for business and economics. After working in Jordan, he went to Austin, Tex., where eventually he earned a Ph.D. in economics at the University of Texas. After a brief stint at the Federal Reserve in St. Louis, and then nine years with the International Monetary Fund in Washington, he felt a tug from the Middle East. 
With the Oslo accords in 1993 came an in-gathering from the Palestinian diaspora, as intellectuals and businessmen rushed back from the United States, Europe, gulf states and elsewhere to join in building their national home. Fayyad said he felt antsy and even a little guilty reading The Washington Post and drinking coffee in his backyard in suburban Virginia. He arrived in Jerusalem at the end of 1995.
For the next six years he served as the International Monetary Fund representative to the Palestinian Authority, and he watched as the Palestinian state that was supposed to come into existence in 1999 receded toward the horizon in a haze of bad faith, corruption and violence. As Oslo collapsed, many Palestinian returnees grew disillusioned and left the occupied territories. But Fayyad said he was never tempted to leave.
"It's an opportunity to do good things, to build institutions that could last," he told me recently, as he wolfed down a cheeseburger for lunch at his desk (it was 5 p.m.). "I don't see how one could pass that up."
As it had with other returnees, America left its mark on Fayyad. At meetings in Gaza, while his assistants sip coffee from traditional thimble-size porcelain cups, he sucks it down from a mug. He chain-smokes Winstons. He speaks torrential English, and though he is a Muslim, he might refer in conversation to the feeling that comes after two or three glasses of wine.
Fayyad was such an outsider that it was hard to take him seriously when Arafat, under international pressure to reform, tapped him as finance minister last June. Fayyad talked big about change, but he had no popular support and no history with Fatah or any other faction. Then, one day in September, he went to meet with Arafat in the Mukata, his official compound in Ramallah.
A more experienced Palestinian official might have realized it was a good day to come very late or not at all. It was last Sept. 19, and Palestinian suicide bombers had just killed seven people in back-to-back attacks. The Israeli Army arrived at the Mukata so fast that Fayyad lost his briefcase. It was crushed inside the car in which he had come, under an Israeli armored vehicle.
Israel offered to let Fayyad leave, as it did some others inside. He stayed, while the army demolished most of the compound and snipers took up posts outside, until American pressure forced Sharon to lift the siege after 11 days. Fayyad emerged with new credibility on the street.
During the siege, more than 400 men were sealed into one building. Fayyad shared a small room with Arafat, the interior minister, Hani al-Hassan, and Arafat's top aide, Nabil Aburdeineh. Each man took a corner and slept on a pad. The room had an air-conditioner, which had the double advantage of cooling things off and bringing some fresh air into the fetid atmosphere. But it turns out that Arafat gets cold when he sleeps. He pulls on a cap and burrows under blankets. Each evening, Fayyad and Aburdeineh would blast the air-conditioner, only to wake up sweating in the middle of the night because the Palestinian leader had stealthily retrieved the remote control and shut the air-conditioner off. After a couple of nights, the remote control disappeared, and after ransacking the room the other men concluded Arafat had taken to sleeping with it under his pillow.
Jeffrey Feltman, the acting chief of mission at the United States consulate in Jerusalem, drew an obvious moral from this story when Fayyad told it to him: Arafat would not surrender any control. Fayyad saw it differently -- that power had devolved, and Arafat could not trust even his closest aides anymore.
At the Ministry of Finance, Fayyad's approach has been to act on the assumption that Arafat meant what he said when he granted him the authority to do his job. One of his first moves was to centralize the Palestinian Authority's income. Each ministry or agency had been holding onto the fees it collected for things like transportation, stamps or health insurance -- a total of about $24 million a month. This meant that ministries that collected little money, like Education, had little to spend.
Fayyad's approach was characteristically heavy-handed. He wanted to signal that he meant business. Acting through the Palestinians' monetary authority, he ordered all banks in the West Bank and Gaza to block checks written on those funds by other ministries. And he told the banks to transfer the money to the treasury. Then he dispatched a two-line "for your information" note to his colleagues.
Fayyad stripped authority over the civilian payroll from the Palestinian civil service bureau and brought it to his own ministry; this meant that the bureau in charge of hiring no longer also distributed checks, and it enabled Fayyad to obstruct a patronage system that was annually adding 10,000 to 15,000 people -- many with less than sterling resumes -- to the payroll. He issued the first detailed, public Palestinian budget, of $1.28 billion, and he posted it on the Web (www.mof.gov.ps). He tracked down $600 million in Palestinian Authority assets in 79 commercial ventures, from Canadian biopharmaceuticals to Algerian cellphones, and hired Standard & Poor's to examine them for their value and ownership structure. He published the results as they came in, identifying the officials involved, centralizing the investments under a new supervising agency and laying plans to sell them off.
And he began simply ignoring many of the slips that arrived bearing Arafat's signature, the ones requesting a job for someone or help with bills or students' fees. Fayyad now had an all-purpose answer for requests he deemed unworthy: there was no allocation in the budget for them, so he was powerless to act. "It's incumbent on the treasurer to say no," he says.
These changes are only a start, as Fayyad acknowledges. He has yet to audit the payrolls for ghost employees or to break up the Palestinian monopolies on oil and other commodities, which feed corruption. Longer term, he wants to modernize the Palestinians' income-tax code. But for now he is doing triage, focusing on areas where the problem is not inefficiency but, as he puts it, right and wrong.
"This guy is my next target," he told me gleefully one day, hanging up after talking to a high-ranking official involved in a continuing scam.
At each major step, Fayyad has been careful to keep Arafat apprised, if sometimes a bit after the fact. Arafat, Fayyad said, has never complained to him. If so, a major reason is that, as Fayyad's reforms took hold, the Bush administration began pushing Israel to release hundreds of millions of dollars in funds it had sequestered from the Palestinian Authority. The money comes from import duties and other fees paid by Palestinians that, according to Oslo, Israel is supposed to pass along.
In the fall and winter last year, at a time coordination had all but died between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, Fayyad quietly held a series of meetings with Israeli officials that were brokered by American diplomats. The Israeli argument -- that the authority would just spend any new funds on terrorism -- was becoming less persuasive as Fayyad's financial controls kicked in. Eventually, the Israelis relented. In January alone, Israel handed the Palestinian Authority about $50 million. It was about to go bankrupt.
When I asked Khaled Elyazji, the director of the center seeking political reform, if any of the two dozen ministers had impressed him, he mentioned only Fayyad. "At the beginning they accused him of being a spy, and said that he was imposed by the Americans," he said. "But he established a transparent financial institution. And who gained from that? The people. Who lost? The corrupt."
Gen. Abd Al-Razek al-Majaydah, a dignified man with a silver mustache and a green beret, is chief of the Palestinian "national security" forces. On a recent Sunday night in his office inside the Saraya, in Gaza City, I raised what proved the unappealing subject of direct deposit. "This doesn't work in the army," he said shortly. "It doesn't make any sense for a soldier with a gun to go to the bank. Imagine if I came here one day and everyone was at the bank."
He warmed to his argument. "Do you know any Arab army -- Egypt, Sudan, Yemen, Syria -- that gets its money from the bank?"
I suggested that Palestine could be first.
"Why us?" he asked. ("There is nothing innocent about this -- nothing!" Fayyad exploded, when I recounted the conversation to him later. Then he began muttering caustically to himself, "No Arab army. . . . ")
Majaydah insisted he was doing nothing wrong -- though he said he might have added a few extra unemployed men to the payroll just to help out -- and he said that "Mr. Salam" was welcome to send accountants to watch him. 
A different armed force in Gaza, this one devoted to "preventive security," had already signed up for direct deposit, and the men I spoke with in Gaza's streets seemed pleased. They were men with rifles, to be sure, but they were also men on the job, making about $200 a month and trying to take care of their families in a very difficult place. Direct deposit meant that they received their money precisely on schedule and, for some, that they had bank accounts for the first time.
"You feel you're respected," one 23-year-old sergeant explained, as he stood guard outside the central headquarters. "It's civilized. And it will make it much easier for me to get a loan."
Fayyad's pursuit of this reform is a textbook illustration of his method. Two days before he began pushing the security chiefs to adopt his plan, he conducted a pre-emptive strike at the official who controlled the monthly disbursement to the services in the West Bank. Fayyad learned that, after one month's payroll went out, this official still had about half a million dollars in his account. Without any warning, Fayyad snatched it from the bank.
"It was intended to be seen as malicious," he told me with relish. "I knew what I was going to do only two days later, and I wanted to go on the offensive." His general belief appears to be that some of his colleagues will run from a fight, and the only way to achieve reform is to keep your opponents perpetually on defense. "Make them react to you," he says.
For the next month's payroll, Fayyad issued the man half a million dollars less.
Having lined up two allies among the security chiefs, Fayyad held the Gaza meeting with the bosses. What he wanted was lists of all their employees, with identification numbers and bank accounts. But they balked. And until the entire security force was signed up, the system could have little effect on fighting corruption and centralizing payment and, with it, control.
Fayyad insisted to me that Arafat has backed him up on direct deposit, but allies of the finance minister said he had to argue it out with him. Regardless, Arafat did not exactly put his shoulder to the wheel.
So Fayyad's next stop was the Palestinian Legislative Council, the Parliament. For years, this was a debating society, but lately it has shown signs of strength. It forced Arafat to form a new government last fall, and it created substantial powers for the prime minister over Arafat's objections. Fayyad -- who is not particularly deferential by nature -- has chosen to be carefully polite to this body and, unlike other ministers, to meet regularly with the committee that oversees him. It is the right thing to do, he says. More to the point, the Parliament could prove a useful tool.
A few days after seeing the security chiefs, he met with the legislative committee privately and named names, telling them which officers were obstructing the reform. Gaza was a small place, he told me at the time, and word would get around.
His allies in Fatah distributed a leaflet asking: "Why do some of the commanders of the security forces still refuse to transfer the salaries of their personnel to bank accounts? Our people should ask this question."
Still, the chiefs would not relent, and so Fayyad went public. One Saturday in April, he met with the Palestinian press and dropped what he hoped would be his devastating bomb: the pledge to rescind the "intifada tax" for all Palestinian Authority employees, once the security chiefs relented.
"My timing was off," Fayyad complained to me a few days later. He had timed his most aggressive move to coincide with the formation by Abbas, the prime minister, of his new cabinet. Fayyad said he thought that the creation of the new government would generate irresistible momentum for his reform.
But Abbas, rather than simply presenting his cabinet to the Parliament, tried to reach a private compromise with Arafat on the very day Fayyad met with the press. Abbas put together a list of ministers that slighted the technocrats sought by reformers and included several old Arafat allies. Spotting weakness, Arafat pounced. He refused to support the cabinet and challenged Abbas to take it to the Legislature. Because it was a compromised list to begin with, reformers had no enthusiasm for it, either. It had no chance.
One result was a 10-day feud that prompted the intervention of more than a dozen foreign governments and swamped any talk of direct deposit. Abbas limped into office facing demands from Israel and the United States that he act immediately to stop all Palestinian violence, but Arafat is still in effective control of much if not most of the authority. Several of the ministers are longtime allies of Arafat, and more than half the security chiefs, including Majaydah, still report to him.
And this is where, for now, the reform hovers, in the same state of unsatisfying equipoise as the Palestinian Authority itself, teetering between Abbas and Arafat.
Like his colleagues, Fayyad is continuing to informally drop in on Arafat for regular chats. But he is also building an alliance with Muhammad Dahlan, the new minister of security, who seems equally interested in cultivating Fayyad. One evening in mid-May, Dahlan's black, armored Chevrolet Suburban pulled up outside Fayyad's ministry for a quiet meeting between the two men. Dahlan is pushing the paycheck reform behind the scenes as he tries to take control from Majaydah and the other chiefs.
Spending time with Fayyad, I often found myself thinking about some Palestinian electrical workers I met a year ago, as Israeli forces were withdrawing from the West Bank city Jenin and its smashed refugee camp. As we talked in their office, above a fire station, we could hear occasional explosions from the camp. 
For the previous 10 days, during the most brutal fighting, these men had put on their orange vests, gotten in their pickup trucks and gone out into streets emptied by Israeli curfew to try to repair the city's electrical grid, which they said soldiers were deliberately damaging. Some of the trucks had been holed by bullets, and the workers had had to scramble beneath them for refuge. These men were functioning on their own, scrounging wiring where they could find it, contacting the World Bank and the Israeli Army directly, sleeping four hours a night. They were not gunmen or soldiers or security officers, just city workers trying to sustain power to people who were trapped in their homes and dependent on their refrigerators, lights, televisions and radios. The chief was an exhausted engineer named Imad Khader, who was born in Jenin and trained in Syria. He proudly pulled out a pink bar graph showing a steady return of power to the city, from a level of dead 0 on April 11 to 72.72 percent on April 17.
I asked him what could possibly have kept him and his men going. His English was not great, and his answer was simple -- and one that Salam Fayyad, and most Palestinians, would subscribe to, I have no doubt. "To save the people," the engineer said, "there must be someone to do the job."

 BODY:
The temptation, upon entering Charles Mitchell's dorm room at Bucknell University, is to assume that he's kidding. The doormat features a picture of Hillary Clinton and the injunction, "Wipe Liberally." A vast American flag festooned in red, white and blue Christmas lights adorns one wall, along with a faded Reagan-Bush '84 poster and a small photograph of the cowboy-hatted Gipper himself. The sole concession to any interest outside right-wing politics is a wall hanging of an African jungle scene. "My nod," says Mitchell, an intense 20-year-old history major, "to multiculturalism." 
 There's an element of youthful provocation at work in all this, of course -- an awareness, on Mitchell's part, that any liberal who dares to enter here will reel back in horror. ("It's fun to freak people out," as he puts it.) But it would be a mistake to assume that his decor reflects only a sophomoric search for self-definition. Having just completed his sophomore year, Mitchell is a dead-serious political ideologue, a right-wing activist so effective that he has been singled out by leaders of the national movement as one of its rising young stars. This past year's editor in chief of Bucknell's conservative newspaper, The Counterweight, and a founding member of the Bucknell University Conservatives Club, he has come to this small liberal-arts college tucked amid the cornfields in Lewisburg, Pa., not solely to educate himself (he holds down a 3.9 G.P.A.), but also to spread the conservative gospel, to wage war with what he considers an egregiously liberal faculty and administration and to win the hearts and minds of his politically undecided peers. Which is why it is both a joke and not a joke when he announces on his dorm-room answering machine: "I can't come to the phone at the moment because I'm out advancing the great conservative revolution." 
 He's not alone. At campuses across the country, undergraduates like Charles Mitchell have organized for an assault against the university establishment not seen since the 1980's, when Reagan's popularity triggered a youthquake of conservative campus activism. Today's surge reflects a renewed shift pronouncedly to the right on many defining issues, after several years during the Clinton presidency when students gravitated toward more liberal political labels. 
As with college conservative movements in the past, the recent wave has been fueled and often financed by an array of conservative interest groups, of which there are, today, almost too many to keep straight: Young Americans for Freedom; Young America's Foundation; the Leadership Institute; the Collegiate Network; the Intercollegiate Studies Institute. These groups spend money in various ways to push a right-wing agenda on campuses: some make direct cash "grants" to student groups to start and run conservative campus newspapers; others provide free training in "conservative leadership," often providing heavily subsidized travel to their "publishing programs"; others provide help with the hefty speaking fees for celebrity right-wing speakers. Through these coordinated activities, these groups have embarked in the last three years on a concerted campus recruitment drive to turn temperamentally conservative youngsters into organized right-wing activists. From Maine to California, students have taken up the offer -- even at such lefty bastions as Berkeley and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Students at Howard University, a black institution in Washington, have started a group that has been referred to as the "hip-hop Republicans." The Campus Leadership Program has by their own count helped set up 256 conservative campus groups in less than three years. The College Republican National Committee, a group that mobilizes students to campaign, has tripled its membership since 1999 to an all-time high of 1,148 chapters.
The impact has been felt far beyond the campus quadrangles and classrooms. Scott Stewart, chairman of the College Republican National Committee says that campus conservatives were instrumental to the success of the Republican Party in the last midterm elections. "Students provide the enthusiasm, the excitement and the work that needs to be done for free in political campaigns," he says, "knocking on doors, talking to voters, passing out literature, pounding in lawn signs." Then there is the role, historically, that college conservatives have played in shaping Republican Party ideology. A former campus conservative, William F. Buckley, wrote the movement's Ur-text, "God and Man at Yale." Published in 1951, the book attacked his alma mater for spreading "socialist" ideas and for its lack of religious instruction in the classroom. To help institutionalize his mission of leaching liberalism from campuses, Buckley helped create the Intercollegiate Studies Institute, the first education institute devoted to turning colleges to the right. I.S.I. was one of several groups behind the campus conservative movement of the 1980's, which gave rise to Dinesh D'Souza, Ann Coulter and Ralph Reed, all former college right-wingers who are today leaders in spreading and shaping the Republican Party message. But just how close a college conservative can get to the levers of power is suggested by the ascent of one hard-right, Nixon-loving ideologue who, in 1973, became chairman of the College Republicans and who today is credited as among the greatest influences on President George W. Bush: Karl Rove. 
"They have a theory of getting them while they're young," says David Brock, a former college conservative who graduated from Berkeley in the mid-1980's. After spending almost a decade as an activist in the conservative movement (during which he published the 1993 liberal-bashing book, "The Real Anita Hill"), Brock had a change of heart. In 2002, he published a book, "Blinded by the Right," about his former life as a conservative-movement insider. "People are searching for their identity in college," he says. "The right try to instigate polarization so that it looks like the right wing is the alternative to the left. This is what happened to me. I went to Berkeley because it had a liberal reputation. But I became disillusioned with some of my experiences with the left on the campus and I had a knee-jerk reaction -- or I was looking for an alternative -- and there was the right. There really wasn't anything in the middle." 
The mission of today's college conservatives is, in many respects, no different from what it was in Brock's day, and even Buckley's. But today's movement also differs markedly from ones that came before. Influenced as much by the mood and mores of MTV as it is by the musings of Allan Bloom, today's movement has shaped itself around a new demographic of young right-wingers, one that includes a heavy contingent of women and that draws some of its fiercest ideologues from the middle class. Having spread beyond traditionally conservative hotbeds like Dartmouth, it's a movement that operates in an atmosphere that did not even exist when Buckley and D'Souza were undergraduates: campuses governed by speech and behavior codes introduced more than a decade ago. A result is a new breed of college conservative, one poised to inherit the responsibility of shaping the Republican Party in the years to come. 
The Bucknell University Conservatives Club has its origins in the fall of 1999, when a freshman named Tom Elliott arrived on campus. His father is Bently Elliott, former director of speechwriting for Ronald Reagan. Growing up in Alexandria, Va., and attending Easter-egg hunts on the White House lawn, Tom Elliott absorbed by osmosis the central tenets of conservatism: smaller government, less taxes, more military spending, welfare reform, no abortion on demand. He'd never questioned his right-wing beliefs until he entered Bucknell, where, he says, he found his ideas coming under attack from his professors. 
"In my spare time, I started visiting conservative Web sites," he says, "so I could arm myself." In his sophomore year, he wrote right-wing columns in the student paper, The Bucknellian. Styling himself after his journalistic heroes, like Hunter S. Thompson, Elliott strove for an in-your-face attitude in his writing and came to enjoy his status as the campus's provocateur. But it was not until the summer after his sophomore year that he called on his contacts with conservative interest groups, like the Leadership Institute, to move on his idea of starting a conservatives club and his own right-wing campus newspaper. Elliott enlisted a fellow Bucknell sophomore, Michael Boland, a square-jawed evangelical Christian from Cooperstown, N.Y., the only other "out" conservative on campus at the time. 
It was, in many respects, an odd marriage. Elliott, a hard-partying frat boy from a privileged background, fits a common stereotype of the college conservative of the 1980's: affluent, confident, connected (his father is a Bucknell alumnus and trustee). When Elliott offers that he "doesn't take school too seriously, and my grades reflect it," you know he's telling you that he doesn't have to worry too much about a career and money (after graduating this month, he plans to "travel and maybe write a book in the future"). Mike Boland, by contrast, is like many of today's young right-wingers. Determinedly middle class (his dad is an X-ray technician, his mom a teacher's aide), Boland can afford Bucknell's $35,000 in tuition and fees only with the help of financial aid. Studious and abstemious, he works hard to keep up a 3.9 G.P.A. For Boland, the effort that has taken him from a modest background to the top ranks of an elite university bolsters his conservative beliefs on self-reliance. "If you don't earn it," he says, "you don't appreciate it." 
Boland agreed to join Elliott in starting Bucknell's conservatives club. The two don't agree on every issue (Elliott is against capital punishment; Boland supports it), and they often clash when it comes to how best to spread their message (Elliott likes to use satire and ridicule to raise hackles; Boland prefers close reasoning), but the two share a mind-set common to virtually every college conservative you meet. They describe themselves as defenders of "individuality" and "freedom" against a campus, and world, overrun by groupthink liberalism and pious political correctness. They also share a belief that despite the common perception of youth being synonymous with progressive, liberal ideals, the true spirit of their generation is solidly, if quietly, conservative. 
The polls bear this out. According to the U.C.L.A. Higher Education Research Institute, which has been tracking the attitudes of incoming freshmen at hundreds of colleges nationwide since 1966, student conservatism is increasing in many areas. Asked their opinion about casual sex, 51 percent of freshmen were for it in 1987; now 42 percent are. In 1989, 66 percent of freshmen believed abortion should be legal; today, only 54 percent do. In 1995, 66 percent of kids agreed that wealthy people should pay a larger share of taxes; now it's down to 50 percent. Even on the issue of firearms, where students have traditionally favored stiffer controls, there has been a weakening in support for gun laws. "We're at a record low on this item," says the U.C.L.A. Institute's associate director, Linda Sax, an associate professor of education at U.C.L.A. "We've seen a decline over the last four consecutive years." 
Yet according to Sax, this conservative trend on issues does not necessarily mean that students call themselves right-wingers, or even Republicans. "Students' opinions of particular issues are not always in line with their own self-placement on an ideological spectrum," she says. 
Still searching for their identities, many of these kids are not yet prepared to declare a particular political affiliation. This is where the conservative campus activists come in. Having recognized the importance of conservativism to their own lives, they have committed themselves to the task of bringing out the unacknowledged conservatism in other students. The mission of today's activistsinvolves less an act of persuading their peers to accept an ideology than in awakening them to the fact that they already embody it. 
Back in early September 2001, Boland and Elliott sent a campus e-mail message announcing the birth of the Bucknell University Conservatives Club. Among those who showed up for the first meeting was Charles Mitchell, a freshman and another middle-class kid attending Bucknell on financial aid. "You knew right away," Boland says, "that this guy was a warrior." Mitchell arrived in Lewisburg from a suburban enclave in Delaware County, Pa., and became intent on being a campus activist. He traces his passion for right-wing politics to his father, who runs a trolley repair shop for Septa, the public transit company in Philadelphia. A member of the N.R.A., Mitchell's father took his son shooting every Friday. "That was really the beginning for me," Mitchell says. "It seemed to me that the policy of less government in conjunction with gun control made sense. And everything else just kind of followed from that." 
That initial e-mail message brought out only five or six attendees. But soon after, an event took place that would give the club a campus profile it might otherwise have taken months to achieve: the attacks of Sept. 11. When a small coterie of students and professors organized vigils against the American bombing of Afghanistan, the conservatives club staged a counter-rally in support of the troops -- a kind of strategy encouraged by the Beltway-based interest groups that not only helped finance the students' activities but also helped shape them. "Pro-troops" and "pro-America" rallies were staged, simultaneously, at colleges across the country. The tactic brought results. "Kids started coming up to us," Mike Boland says, "and asking how they could join up." Today, the club has about 35 active members. And each issue of The Counterweight carries supportive letters from students who are not in the club.
A jump in club enrollment post-9/11 was not unique to Bucknell. According to Bryan Auchterlonie, the 24-year-old executive director of the Collegiate Network (a program administered by I.S.I.), the terrorist attacks helped to galvanize right-wing students across the nation. "Students are upset with what they see as anti-Americanism on campuses," Auchterlonie says. "Patriotism is big now." It's a patriotism that the national college movement has pushed to the fore as an issue that can win the sympathies of kids who are not overtly political. "We handed out red, white and blue ribbons on the anniversary of 9/11," Charles Mitchell says. "I didn't think anyone was going to take them. We ran out in half an hour." 
Besides the flag, the other potent symbol for today's young conservative movement is Ronald Reagan. Because they are too young to recall any of Reagan's live TV appearances (Mitchell, for instance, was born in 1982), today's college students tend to see the former president purely as his image makers tried to present him when he occupied the Oval Office: as a Norman Rockwellian, mist-shrouded icon of Better Times -- an idealized figure of myth. The Washington-based groups know this, and they play on it. When the Leadership Institute, a group formed by a right-wing activist, Morton Blackwell, recruits on campuses each fall, it prominently displays at its sign-up table a huge poster that includes a photograph of Reagan. 
Mitchell is one of those who has fallen under the spell of the former president. His dorm-room bookshelf holds no less than four Reagan biographies, from which he is given to quoting, as if from Scripture. "If you study what Reagan wrote and said and believed," Mitchell explains, "it didn't change from at least the 1960's on. People always attack that and say he was intellectually lazy. I don't think so. The guy believed in something. He came to the presidency with three big goals: defeating communism, lowering taxes and recovering the economy. And that's what he did." Mitchell's support for George W. Bush derives from what he sees as one of the current president's Reagan-like qualities: a certain down-to-earth honesty. "I don't agree with Bush's politics some of the time," Mitchell says, "but he's not phony at all. When he talks, he's just a straight-up honest guy, and I love that. As politicians go, you kind of trust him." 
But a movement based on patriotism and Reagan-worship alone could not have spread so rapidly nationwide. Here's where the left has unwittingly helped to energize the conservative movement. Visit any college campus today, and you're struck by the forces of what the conservatives call overweening political correctness that have seeped into every corner of life. Same-sex hand-holding days, "Vagina Monologues" performances, diversity training seminars, minority support groups, "no means no" dating rules, textbooks purified of gender, racial or class stereotypes -- for all their good intentions, these manifestations of enforced tolerance can create a stultifying air of conformity in college life. Hence the cries for "individual responsibility" and "freedom of speech" that are the leading slogans of today's campus conservative movement -- a deliberate echo of the left-wing Free Speech movements of the 1960's and a direct appeal to the natural impulse, on the part of young people, to rebel against the powers that be. 
"It's been true through recorded history that the younger generation instinctively rebels against the establishment, whatever the establishment might be, and that definitely is part of what encourages folks to join us," says Blackwell, a former head of the College Republicans who trained Karl Rove. "We know we're turning the tables," says Manny Espinoza, the public relations director of the Leadership Institute's Campus Leadership Program, "and we know it's frustrating the other side, because they know it's their stuff and now we're using it." Indeed, the Collegiate Network, which distributes some $200,000 a year in publishing money to 58 student newspapers, issues a handbook, "Start the Presses!" which explicitly counsels its conservative charges to "loosen up," to, in effect, get in touch with their inner Abbie Hoffman. "Don't strive to be thought of as 'serious' and 'respectable,"' the handbook counsels. "On campus, those words equate to 'irrelevant and ineffective."' 
The Bucknell Conservatives have taken this advice to heart. "Some club members do want to shock," Mike Boland says, "to incite outrage, to start fires -- because they think that doing so just demonstrates how ridiculous campus liberals can be." He cites The Counterweight's satiric twitting of the campus performances of "The Vagina Monologues." The paper has published an annual "Penis Monologues" rich in sophomoric humor ("My man-hammer has not clubbed a single baby seal. . . . "), and each year it sparks anger in the college's various women's support groups. "Did we print that piece knowing that the feminists would blow a gasket?" Boland says. "Yes. But we did it anyway, because it was fun to write and the response allowed us to show how intolerant and intellectually lazy some feminists had become." 
If the interest groups have worked hard to retrofit the college conservative movement as a right-wing version of the leftist Berkeley Free Speech Movement of the 1960's, they have worked equally hard to frame the conservative women's movement on campuses as a new brand of empowering feminism. A number of well-financed and highly organized conservative women's groups in Washington have been instrumental in leading the charge, among them the Clare Boothe Luce Policy Institute and the Independent Women's Forum. The latter has started a "Take Back the Campus" crusade, in which an array of well-known right-wing women are brought to colleges by the activist conservative clubs to explore such questions (as the Independent Women's Forum Web site puts it) as "whether women's-studies programs actually harm women with misleading feminist myths of women as victims." (The answer, according to the I.W.F., would be an emphatic yes.) Regular speakers on campus include Phyllis Schlafly, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Ann Coulter, Katherine Harris and Christina Hoff Sommers, author of "Who Stole Feminism?" and "The War Against Boys." These women preach that the preponderance of women's-studies classes and the proliferation on campuses of Take Back the Night marches, sex and dating rules and rape-awareness lectures -- all of which are aimed at making women feel empowered on campus -- in fact do precisely the opposite: they infantalize. 
One Bucknell conservatives club member, Allison Kasic, buys it. She's a 19-year-old who just finished her sophomore year, and she writes a regular column in The Counterweight and has her own rock-music show each Monday on the college radio station. Raised in Littleton, Colo., the daughter of an administrative judge, she is a confident, tough young woman who wears little makeup and favors jeans and T-shirts. As a management major concentrating in marketing, she sees the importance of selling a new brand of conservatism to female students. "There's the old stereotype of the WASP-y country-club wife or the Bible-study mom from the Midwest," Kasic says. "But that's not what conservative women are anymore." Kasic, instead, points to "stiletto conservatives" like Hoff Sommers and Coulter. "We have role models now," she says. "Hip, strong women who exude the message: 'I don't need hand-holding just because I'm a woman."' Kasic herself plans to be a working woman when she graduates ("I'm no soccer mom," she laughs; "I don't even like kids"), but she respects women who choose a different path -- to be homemakers, like her own mother. "Conservatives are inclusive in a way that liberals are not," she says, voicing a central theme of the Independent Women's Forum ethos. "We say that women can be executives or stay-at-home mothers." Kasic extends this notion to the abortion debate. Herself an anti-abortion Catholic, she says that the Republican Party today nevertheless supports candidates who espouse the right to abortion. "But the National Organization for Women has never supported a pro-life candidate," she says, as proof of the left's narrowness and the right's "diversity" (a term the conservative movement has deliberately co-opted from the left). 
It can be disorienting to hear conservatism advanced as the ideology that frees women, but such is the skill with which the right has reframed the issues for the campus crowd, and such is the degree to which the left has allowed its own message to drift into rigidity and irrelevance for many college-age women. Another Bucknell conservatives club member, Denise Chaykun, typifies how some young women are onlydriven further to the right by what they see as the pieties of the left. Chaykun, with her shoulder-length blond hair, faded jeans and rock T-shirt, could have stepped out of a 1970's campus sit-in. But she is one of the most combative and hard-core conservatives at Bucknell. "You come to college, and the message they give you is 'Your parents are racist, sexist, bigoted, homophobic, and we're going to take you and change that,"' she says. "A lot of the courses are mushy stuff about sex and gender and social relations. You can't take a class about a war. We don't have a military historian at Bucknell. Everything is so dumbed down because no one wants to offend anyone."
This past year's president of the Bucknell University Conservatives Club, Chaykun is also Charles Mitchell's girlfriend. The two met and began dating in high school. Chaykun says that she always had a conservative bent (both her parents are registered Republicans), but Mitchell had a big influence in her transformation from privately conservative high-school student to fierce college activist. For instance, until she met Mitchell, she viewed firearms as "evil." But in her senior year of high school, he gave her a copy of John Lott's "More Guns, Less Crime," which argues that allowing law-abiding citizens to carry concealed handguns is an effective deterrent to violent crime. Chaykun was convinced. Last Christmas, she was thrilled when Mitchell gave her a semiautomatic .22 rifle with telescopic sight. Chaykun keeps it in a black nylon bag decorated with Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Care Bears and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles patches. She takes her gun with her to an outdoor shooting range near the campus where Mitchell and other members of the club blast away with .357 Magnums and AK-47 rifles at paper targets printed with the faces of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. (Chaykun shoots at a regular bull's-eye.) "It's a lot of fun," she gushes. For Chaykun, the most difficult thing about being a female conservative on a university campus is the flak she catches from other women. "I get personal character attacks from the feminists on campus," she says. "I try to explain that I'm a feminist, too. But they don't listen. They say, 'Oh, her boyfriend told her to say that."'
In fact, much of what Chaykun -- and indeed most any campus conservative you meet -- says is something that someone told them to say. This is not to doubt their passion and belief, but it is to be realistic about the language and tactics they've developed to communicate those beliefs. Bryan Auchterlonie of the Collegiate Network makes no effort to conceal that his organization helps to shape messages and provide "talking points" for their conservative student activist members. He lists what he calls the "formal programming" -- which includes the C.N.'s annual conference, journalism courses, grants, fellowships and summer internships. "Then there's the sort of ad hoc, off-the-radar-screen type of stuff," he goes on. "It's basically general P.R. advice on how to spin their messages on campus." 
Despite this close relationship between the Beltway-based groups and the conservative campus activists, Charles Mitchell bridles at any suggestion that he and his fellow club members are puppets for larger interests -- not to say operatives in the vast right-wing conspiracy. "I really have no patience with that viewpoint," he says. "We could be doing The Counterweight with the Campus Leadership Program or without them, with the Collegiate Network or without them. They didn't put us up to this. They'll be the first totell you that if you don't have the drive to do it yourself, it's not going to happen. We can get as many checks from Arlington as you want, and there still won't be a paper. What matters is having a group of people who are willing to do it."
In early April, several members of the Bucknell conservatives club, having put to bed an issue of The Counterweight, sat around a burger-strewn table in a school cafeteria and talked about the future of conservatism in America. 
"I think the paleos are dying out," Mitchell says. He's referring to the conservative movement's Old Guard, whom the author David Frum recently labeled the "paleoconservatives." Mitchell and his friends can't abide them. 
"Yeah," Kasic agrees. "Paleos like Pat Buchanan -- and Bob Novak."
"Trent Lott isn't a paleo," Mitchell says. "He's just a moron. Strom Thurmond is probably a paleo."
"George Wallace," Chaykun says. 
"Yeah, and the Copperheads," Mitchell says, referring to the Northerners who supported the South during the Civil War. "People who think Lincoln started the era of big government. That's paleo. The paleos are the people who give us a bad rap. They carry all these tinges of anti-Semitism and racism -- and that's what people expect from us. People expect us to be like Pat Buchanan, like, 'We're diluting our great Western culture by letting immigrants in.' I don't think any of us buy that." 
Kasic says: "It's not like Pat Buchanan's wrong on everything, it's just the persona -- he's just a grumpy old guy who's always complaining about something. He's not accessible to young kids." 
Mitchell says: "He worked for Nixon, for God's sake. I'm not a Buchanan conservative. I'm a D'Souza conservative." 
While it's true that Mitchell and his fellow club members are far closer to 80's right-wingers like D'Souza and Coulter, there are also crucial differences. Many of those Reagan-era conservatives announced their politics on campus with their dress and grooming, the men sporting aggressively conservative Clark Kent haircuts, blue blazers, red ties, loafers; the women tended to wear skirts and heels -- openly adopting the uniform of the Youth for Reagan army. Today, most campus conservatives who hope to be effective won't dress like George Bush or Dick Cheney. The idea is to dress like a young person. When the Bucknell conservatives assemble for their weekly meetings, they look like a typical, if all-white, sampling of American undergraduates, which is to say, there are plenty of ragged T-shirts, backward baseball caps and frayed jeans in the room. Some club members even let their freak flag fly a little. Aaron Hanlon, who attends the school on a grant, recently cut his hair into ragged spikes and dyed it blond. With his skeletal runner's frame and hawklike nose, he could pass as the elegantly smack-addled lead guitarist in a neometal band instead of the hard-right conservative that he is. Corey Langer is a club member just out of his freshman year who dresses in full-goth regalia, complete with ankle-length black overcoat, vintage Ozzy T-shirt, pentagram necklace and an array of "finger armor" that he bought at a "psycho-hippie shop" near his hometown of Higganum, Conn. 
These days, the interest groups encourage a hipper look. Auchterlonie encourages campus conservatives to drop the stiff-as-a-board ultraconservative attire. "What conservatives really need help on is how to be cool on campus," Auchterlonie says. "We're easily pigeonholed as loafer-wearing jerks." On visits to colleges across the country, he tells kids, "You don't have to adopt, hook, line and sinker, the conservative outfits, conservative haircut, conservative philosophy, conservative everything." 
But the difference between the college conservatives of 20 years ago and today goes deeper than dress. Many members of the Bucknell conservatives club, for instance, endorse same-sex unions. Corey Langer recently wrote a Counterweight article supporting gay marriages. This is a far cry from D'Souza's day, when gay males were termed "sodomites" in The Dartmouth Review. In part, the Bucknellians' openness to gays and lesbians can be attributed to the strong streak of libertarianism that runs through the club -- a conviction that the government should stay out of any and all aspects of life, including the bedroom. But you can't hang out long with the Bucknell Conservatives and not form the opinion that their tolerance on issues like homosexuality goes beyond libertarianism. 
Like the rest of their generation, they've been trained, from preschool onward, in the tenets of cooperation, politeness and racial and gender sensitivity. As much as they would hate to admit it -- as hard as they try to fight it -- these quintessential values have suffused their consciousness and tempered their messages. You can see it in Charles Mitchell's editorship of The Counterweight. Back in the 1980's, the editors of campus conservative newspapers subscribed to the theory spelled out by D'Souza in his book "Letters to a Young Conservative." "At The Dartmouth Review," he wrote: "To confront liberalism fully we . . . had to subvert liberal culture, and this meant disrupting the etiquette of liberalism. In other words, we had to become social guerrillas. And this we set out to do with a vengeance." 
D'Souza and his colleagues reveled in the shock and outrage they awakened with open gay-baiting and racist and sexist jokes. Charles Mitchell eschews such vicious tactics. Humor is crucial, but he has no desire to be mistaken for a bigot. "There are a few conservatives," he admits, "who would say, 'That's good, people are calling you a racist, you must be getting your point across."' Mitchell rejects this. "The point is not to create outrage -- at least not for us," he says. "The point is to get your ideas out there and make a difference." For Mitchell, the goal is to persuade the politically undeclared students who make up the largest percentage of the college's undergraduate population -- a group he estimates at some 75 percent of all students -- that they are, in fact, already part of the movement. Though they don't necessarily think of themselves as Republican, the stance they take on individual issues -- taxes, abortion, affirmative action -- gives them a conservative identity. And being a conservative can be cool and, as Mitchell puts it, not "just something that wacko people in Alabama do."
Within the national college conservative movement as a whole, Mitchell and his fellow Bucknellians are recognized as among the savviest activists in the country. Last December, they were No. 1 on the Young America's Foundation's list of Top 10 Campus Follies, a citation bestowed on campus events that exemplify the most outlandish manifestation of political correctness. 
In January, a group of Bucknell club members were invited to Arlington, Va., to attend the Conservative Political Action Conference's annual jamboree, which this year brought out such right-wing luminaries as Dick Cheney, Tom DeLay and the ubiquitous Coulter. There, Charles Mitchell addressed the crowd in a panel of students speaking on "Real Stories of Real Liberal Bias on Real College Campuses."Marveling that he was sharing a microphone used just the day before by the vice president, Mitchell outlined to raucous applause from the crowd of perhaps a thousand the "campus outrage" that had put the Bucknell Club on the radar of the national movement. 
Last fall, Mitchell and the Counterweight staff published a "free speech" issue of their newspaper. Bearing a photo of the rapper Eminem on the cover, the paper contained two articles that tested the boundaries of what the administration calls "acceptable" speech. In keeping with the kinder, gentler conservative activism of today, the articles were innocuous enough. (They gingerly examined incidents in which white students were chastised by the university for "racially insensitive" acts: in one instance a pair of frat boys dressed up for Halloween in blackface as Serena and Venus Williams; in the other, a white student used the phrase "What's up, my Negro?" on the phone with a student he didn't know was black). The articles were carefully written and edited to avoid any hint of endorsement of the acts, but within the heightened atmosphere of identity politics that can govern campuses, the articles were declared racially divisive by offended students, faculty and administrators. Some campus liberals called for The Counterweight to lose its school financing. 
To the conservatives, the paradox was obvious: the administration's reaction to the Counterweight stories underlined the very point the editors were trying to make: namely, that the university, in its zeal to ameliorate any possible friction among students, is stifling the open, vigorous, nontimorous exchange of ideas. "To me, it's sheltering and patronizing," Charles Mitchell says. "I just believe with every fiber of my being that our speech code is wrong, and it has to go. It's completely against everything that this university ought to stand for." The imbroglio, however, also provided an unequaled opportunity for the club. The Collegiate Network handbook "Start the Presses!" states: "As a media outlet, you have the power to transform a minor event or fact into a major embarrassment. . . . If the school persecutes you, send out press releases, notify alumni and give the administration a public black eye." The Bucknell conservatives followed this playbook to the letter. They sent out a press release to the local newspaper, which put the story on the front page. The club members were booked on the Fox cable program "The O'Reilly Factor." (They were bumped because of the Washington sniper crisis.) Still, they received a lot of mileage from the controversy. As a direct result of the furor, The Counterweight immediately became a must-read publication on Bucknell's campus -- avidly pored over, argued about, debated and discussed by administrators, liberals, African-American students, professors and conservatives alike. Their print run of 2,500 copies is gone within days of hitting the pavements. In less than two years, the Bucknell University Conservatives Club established itself as one of the most visible and influential student groups on campus. 
Just how influential is clear when you talk to Bucknell faculty members. Geoff Schneider, an economics professor at Bucknell, says that the conservative group's constant charge in The Counterweight, that the university is infected by political correctness and that professors seek to indoctrinate students with a liberal agenda, has had an effect in the classroom. "As the conservatives have become more prominent, other students are more prone to believe that they are being indoctrinated," Schneider says. "So the openness of a number of students to new ideas and new ways of looking at things has actually moved in a disturbing direction. Students are much more willing to write off something as 'liberal talk' -- oh, I don't need to think about that, that's just ideology -- as opposed to thinking, in a complex way, about all of the different ideas and evaluating them." Kim Daubman, a social psychology professor, concurs. Recently she taught a class in which she talked about the theory that news coverage of warfare in Iraq could lead to a rise in homicides in the United States. "I could see the students rolling their eyes," she says. "I could just hear them thinking, 'Oh, there she goes again!"' 
While professors like Schneider and Daubman worry about the potential for conservative activists to stifle intellectual openness among students, they also grudgingly admit to admiring the right-wingers' passion. "A lot of faculty members talk about the lack of commitment that most students have to anything," Daubman says. "It seems that they're about getting a credential and being able to get a good job. That's why you hear faculty say about the conservatives club: 'At least they believe in something. At least they've got convictions."'

HEADLINE: It Was Out of the Frying Pan And Into a Bustling Kitchen 

BYLINE:  By MELINDA LIGOS 

 BODY:
TWO years ago, Max Kalehoff managed to pull off what some considered to be a remarkable feat: he survived wave after wave of job cuts as a marketing executive at a dwindling dot-com.
 Two months ago, he did something else that raised eyebrows among his peers: Mr. Kalehoff gave up his high-paying job and is now chopping vegetables as the lowest man on the totem pole at La Grenouille, a restaurant in Manhattan. 
 "Some of my friends think I'm crazy," said Mr. Kalehoff, who worked four years at Media Metrix, now comScore Networks, an Internet-ratings firm in New York, before heading for the kitchen. "I'm the only person they know who actually quit a dot-com job, instead of getting fired." 
As surprised as his friends and colleagues may be, Mr. Kalehoff's decision to drop out of corporate America isn't so unusual. Many young executives who began rising through the ranks during the dot-com boom and bust, which was followed by the accounting scandals and a generally sour economy, are now rethinking their careers, say experts on the workplace.
Some, like Mr. Kalehoff, who is 27, are opting for lower-key pursuits that often center on hobbies or passions.
A management exodus of a different sort occurred just a few years ago, said Dr. Paul Winum, a managing director for RHR International, a consulting firm in Wood Dale, Ill. At that time, those in flight were middle-age executives who had saved enough money to chase old dreams and still pay their bills, he said, while "in this economy, young people don't have much to lose by dropping out of the rat race."
As an example, Dr. Winum cited his niece's recent decision to leave her job as a lawyer at a big Atlanta company to set up an ice cream-and-sandwich shop. At 32, she does not have children, and if her business fails, she still has the paycheck of her husband, a lawyer, to fall back on.
It is not just the rough economy, though. The spate of corporate scandals over the last couple of years has also taken away some of the glamour of being a business leader, management specialists say.
"Executives in their 20's have seen a lot go down in their short careers," said Samantha Ettus, president of Ettus Media Management, a Manhattan talent agency for executives. "They used to be able to look around a boardroom and see exactly what they want for their future. They'd idolize the C.E.O., and covet that spot."
Now, she says, "C.E.O.'s have become villainized, bonuses at many companies are down, layoffs are still happening, and young executives are asking what the payoff is for putting in 100 hours of work per week."
Ms. Ettus says she recently counseled a young executive at a large Wall Street firm who was thinking of leaving to become a lecturer at a university. "He found himself asking, 'Why am I here?' " she said.
Mr. Kalehoff remembers asking himself such a question during his time at Media Metrix, which grew to 1,000 employees at the height of the Internet boom and then dwindled to about 200 by the end of 2001, shortly before it was bought by comScore. "Things went downhill pretty fast," he said. "It was unnerving to see about 80 percent of my friends and colleagues go out the door."
As the company shrank, Mr. Kalehoff's duties expanded. He was on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, interpreting data for reporters and writing media summaries as new reports came out.
A year ago, Mr. Kalehoff decided he needed a change. After much soul-searching and many late-night conversations with his wife, Laura, he took some courses at the French Culinary Institute in New York as the first step to a new career as a chef. "I said to myself, 'If I die at 30, what would I want to say I accomplished in my life?' " he said. "And cooking was one of them."
Mr. Kalehoff did not have cooking in his blood. Canned salmon with overcooked broccoli was a household staple as he was growing up, he said, "and my dad's idea of a good meal was Taco Bell."
His interest in cuisine began in his college years working summer jobs as a licensed captain for a charter-boat business, a position that often required him to prepare meals for customers. He liked it so much that even as he graduated from Syracuse University with a degree in communications in 1997, he dreamt of becoming a chef.
About nine months ago, with the blessing of his wife, a magazine editor in Manhattan, Mr. Kalehoff began taking cooking classes at the institute three nights a week, while keeping his day job. He recently received his diploma in culinary arts and began working to make contact with local chefs. After meeting earlier this year with Ian Scollay, La Grenouille's head chef, he was offered a position as an assistant in the restaurant's legumier section, where all of the herbs and greens are prepared for lunchtime service. He started work full time in March.
Mr. Kalehoff is the first to acknowledge that his new job has its own pressures. There's a steep learning curve, for one. He spent his first few weeks learning how to make a variety of complicated garnishes, including coriander twills and an elaborate fried vegetable presentation. "I'm just trying to soak up information as quickly as I can," he said. 
In addition, the chef sets extremely high standards for his staff. "Because of the restaurant's reputation, customers expect to be flabbergasted when they see the plates," Mr. Kalehoff said. "So every single thing has to be absolutely perfect."
And of course, there are the unpredictable events that can send the entire kitchen staff into a tailspin. For example, the restaurant's main refrigerator recently broke down, and Mr. Kalehoff and his co-workers had to dash around to find cold storage areas, while continuing to move plates out of the kitchen.
But Mr. Kalehoff said he would rather deal with these minor headaches than the stresses of his previous job. And his regular work schedule means that he has more control over his free time, something he didn't have at his dot-com company.
"In my new job, there's a clear definition in terms of my work versus personal time," he said. "Now, I can go to a museum and be confident that my cellphone is not going to go off. There's a lot more predictability in my life now, and that's amazingly refreshing."
Mrs. Kalehoff, too, says she likes the fact that her husband's free time "is really free time."
The only downside to his new position, she said, is the fact that he does not cook as many elaborate meals at home. "When cooking was his hobby, he made dinner a lot more," she lamented.
Ms. Ettus, the consultant, predicted that many of the young executives who dropped out of the corporate world would re-enter at some later date. "They'll come back when jobs are more fruitful and the money is better," she said. "In the meantime, now is an ideal time for them to recharge their batteries."
Mr. Kalehoff, however, has no plans to return to his old career. He plans to spend as much time as possible learning the ropes at La Grenouille and dreams of owning his own charter business, where he could serve as both a captain and a cook.
"I'm a very goal-oriented person, not some slacker who was looking to do less work," he said. "I just want to make sure I'm doing something that I really love."

Luxury Wobbleson the Legs of Dollars and Yen

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
ON Bond Street here, as on the Avenue Montaigne in Paris or Via Condotti in Rome, this is the time of year when the sleek, the chic, the well-heeled and their pretenders can be found looking at the up-market wares of Cartier, Gucci and other luxury brands.
 But some companies that make the leatherware, watches and other accouterments are now wondering how many more hits their $65 billion global industry is likely to take. 
 After Sept. 11, 2001, airline traffic and global prosperity -- both important elements in the business of buying Prada shoes or Louis Vuitton handbags -- began to shrivel. Then came the double-war whammies of Afghanistan and Iraq. Barely had those conflicts begun to ease when fear of SARS grounded many of those same Asian -- particularly Japanese -- shoppers who prize luxury brands so highly. 
The latest blow has been the strengthening of the euro, which is up 12.7 percent this year against the dollar and 10.9 percent against the Japanese yen. Because many of the baubles and high-fashion products in luxury stores are made, or at least marketed, in Europe, the euro's climb has meant a commensurate cost increase for shoppers armed with dollars or yen.
So is it time to pity the poor Prada-philes? Probably not.
"One doesn't want to make too much of it," said Simon Raggett, a luxury-goods analyst at thebrokerage firm of Williams de Broe in London. For one thing, the luxury goods industry is "such a high-gross-margin business," with markups of 60 or 70 percent, that it is well able to absorb some strain, Mr. Raggett said. And luxury goods makers like Gucci routinely hedge their exchange-rate positions to minimize losses when rates move against them.
Indeed, some people in the business have benefited handsomely from the shift in exchange rates. In September 2001, the French billionaire Francois Pinault, head of the Pinault-Printemps-Redoute conglomerate, won control of Gucci with a deal to buy much of the stake held by a rival tycoon, Bernard Arnault.
Part of the agreement was that Mr. Pinault's company, which earns much of its income in euros, would buy out the remaining minority shareholders at $101.50 a share. Since the deal was struck, the fall in the dollar's value has made it cheaper in euros for Pinault-Printemps-Redoute to buy the stock at a dollar-denominated price, partially offsetting the argument that the deal had overpriced Gucci's shares.
Pinault-Printemps-Redoute has thus saved "around one billion euros," or $1.14 billion, as it has increased its stake in Gucci to 63.2 percent from 52 percent, said Thomas Kamm, chief spokesman for the company. Pinault shares have fallen 2.9 percent this year, closing on Friday at 68.05 euros in Paris. "There's a silver lining in the cloud" of the dollar's fall, he said.
Not for everyone. In a string of annual results announced in April, many luxury-goods makers had grim news, largely related to the global economic slowdown.
Richemont, a company in Geneva that owns the Cartier watch and Montblanc pen brands, suffered greatly as the watch and jewelry end of the luxury market proved to be most vulnerable to a downturn. Its shares have dropped 22 percent this year, closing Friday at 20.10 Swiss francs.
In March, Richemont, which also owns the Dunhill and Piaget brands and is controlled by the Rupert family of South Africa, issued a warning that its operating profit for the 2003 fiscal year would fall 40 percent because of weak sales of jewelry and watches. This month, it said its longtime chief executive, Alain Perrin -- sometimes nicknamed Mr. Cartier for his role in promoting the brand -- would quit in October.
That is not the only upheaval. In recent months, Pinault-Printemps-Redoute, which apart from Gucci owns Yves Saint Laurent, has sold office supplies and electrical parts businesses along with the lumber company on which Mr. Pinault had founded his empire. The sales, totaling five billion euros, were made as the conglomerate shifted course to meet its commitments on the purchase of Gucci and to pay off debt.
The Gucci Group itself reported slightly lower sales last year and a 27 percent decline in net income, to 226.8 million euros, largely because of losses at Yves Saint Laurent. The results were better than the company had forecast because of higher-than-expected earnings at its Gucci leatherware division. The chief executive, Domenico De Sole, nonetheless expressed caution.
For all that, Gucci stock seems certain to remain a favorite among investors, its price guaranteed by Pinault-Printemps-Redoute's commitment to paying $101.50, whatever the market conditions. Gucci shares closed on Friday at 82.30 euros, about $96.32, down 5.9 percent this year.
Prada, by contrast, has been forced to sell a 45 percent stake in the British shoemaker Church's, which it had acquired only four years ago. It sold the stake to reduce debts it incurred as it sought to emulate LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton's multibrand empire, which ranges from handbags and Christian Dior perfume to Moet & Chandon Champagne and Hennessy Cognac.
Indeed, LVMH is one of the few makers of luxury goods to weather the current crisis in reasonable shape, at least as far as investors are concerned. Its shares are outperforming those of many of its rivals, rising 8.3 percent this year, to close on Friday at 42.40 euros.
That has largely been driven by fashion and leather goods, particularly Louis Vuitton luggage, pushing up sales slightly last year, to 12.7 billion euros, and strengthening operating profit by 29 percent, to 2 billion euros, the company said.
Will all that change because of the euro's strength?
On the surface, the main casualty of the luxury slowdown could be Europe itself, because "the whole price gets hyped up" as travelers find the cost of hotels, taxicabs and other arrangements adding to the increased cost of the goods themselves, said Mr. Raggett at Williams de Broe.
That explains why companies like LVMH, the world's biggest luxury goods maker, are opening more stores in Japan, Canada and the United States to lure top-end shoppers who have cut back on travel. Mr. Arnault, the LVMH chairman, told investors in Paris on May 15 that he expected "substantial growth" and increased market share this year as his competitors faced "a disrupted year with uneven performance."
Of course, there's a catch. The euro may cost more for visitors to Paris and Rome, but margins at luxury goods stores in Europe are generally less astronomical than margins in Japan and other parts of Asia. So even with relatively weak dollars or yen to convert into euros, shoppers are still likely to find a better deal in Paris than in Tokyo -- if only slightly better now that the currency balance has shifted to the shoppers' disadvantage.
Laurie Appers of Elkhart, Ind., who was traveling through Paris on her way to Rome, said, "For big brand names, like Gucci or Louis Vuitton, it's still cheaper to buy items here." Cheaper being relative, of course, in a world where a simple purse with a designer logo can cost $400.
For many shoppers on Rue du Faubourg St.-Honore in Paris, renowned for its designer stores, the difference is not enough.
"If I buy something here, it's maybe 60 euros less than in Japan," said a 25-year-old Japanese woman from Tokyo who identified herself only as Yuko, gesturing at a bag bearing the name Chanel. "I bought this Chanel bag for a friend and nothing for me. It's too expensive."

HEADLINE: The President's Mideast Vision 

 BODY:
This page has said, countless times, that strong American intervention offers the only chance for a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians. We have often said it with faint hope that it would ever happen. Early in his presidency, George Bush stepped back, on the theory, promoted by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel and Mr. Sharon's supporters in the United States, that little could be accomplished without changes in the Palestinian leadership and its attitude toward terror. There have now been such changes. Moreover, Mr. Bush is not the same president. He may go to the Middle East next month to become more directly involved. We urge him to do so.
 In the aftermath of Sept. 11, the Bush administration gradually adopted a grand scheme for refashioning the Middle East that began with the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. The end goal is a transformed region in which autocratic governments open the windows to more democracy while their moribund societies join the global economy. Prosperity, hope and political openness will reduce the attraction of the extreme version of Islam that spawned Al Qaeda. We and others wondered if the administration had thought the plan through before leaping into the Iraq invasion. But the president has bet his legacy on his ability to carry it out. 
 It is clear that there can be scant progress toward the president's goal without a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian question, which has broken the hearts of countless diplomats. Both the Israelis and the Palestinians are cursed with a powerful minority obsessed with disastrous goals. There are Palestinians who still dream of destroying Israel just as there are Israelis who imagine a reincorporated West Bank, with the Palestinian population living among them as nonvoting noncitizens.
Mr. Sharon is a popular leader who has shown limited vision and has to contend with members of his government more extreme than he. Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian prime minister, is weak, unpopular and hemmed in by Hamas terrorists who are intent on continuing to send suicide bombers into Israel. Western leaders can issue all the "road maps" to peace they want, but nobody is going anywhere in this situation unless the United States leads the way.
The Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip are a particular sticking point. They represent for the Israeli right the cherished hope of reclaiming land that belonged to the Jews in biblical times. But the settlements are unsupportable. They are daggers in the heart of a future Palestinian state. Many are tiny enclaves in or near Palestinian towns and land, guarded by Israeli troops who make the Palestinians feel like hated intruders in their own homes.
On the Palestinian side, the biggest problem, by far, is terrorism urged by some leaders and insufficiently condemned by others. Mr. Abbas says he wants to put an end to it but cannot make a serious move without a good-faith concession from Israel. The easiest way to begin the peace process would be for Mr. Abbas to move against Hamas as Israel dismantles the hundred-odd new settlement outposts that have been established in the West Bank since 2001 without government permission. Mr. Abbas says he needs Israeli concessions before he moves. Mr. Sharon says he needs a crackdown on terror before he moves. It is a maddening circle of suspicion and fear.
The United States, which provides massive financial aid to Israel, and which has the means to help restart the Palestinian economy as well, is the one force capable of breaking through this destructive cycle. Mr. Bush's dream of a transformed Middle East is not going anywhere as long as the Arab world is obsessed with the plight of the Palestinians. The Mr. Bush of two years ago was not ready, for reasons of both policy and politics, to make any strong moves. But now conditions have changed and he has a grand vision, larger and more risky than any dreamed by his predecessors. We hope he is willing to follow it through.

Stock Indexes Take a Pre-Holiday Dip

BYLINE:  By JEFF SOMMER 

 BODY:
After weeks of gains, the major stock market indexes all fell last week, but the losses were modest and trading was exceptionally light on Friday in anticipation of the three-day Memorial Day weekend.
 The market dropped on Monday and Tuesday, when Canadian authorities disclosed one case of mad cow disease. 
Food companies like McDonald's, Wendy's International and Tyson Foodsdropped sharply. 
 On Wednesday, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said that the strength of the economy remained unclear. Even so, the market began rising. It continued to register gains on Thursday and Friday, but they did not outweigh the earlier losses.
 For the week, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 11.08 points, or 1.2 percent, to close at 933.22. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 28.44 points, or 1.9 percent, to close at 1,510.09. Both indexes had previously risen for five consecutive weeks. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had climbed for three consecutive weeks, fell 77.59 points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 8,601.38.
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note ended the week at 3.33 percent, down from 3.41 percent a week earlier. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: Buoyed by Resurgence, G.O.P. Strives for an Era of Dominance 

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: ZEELAND, Mich. 

 BODY:
The Republican Party's dream of becoming the dominant party was on full display the other day at the Ottawa County Lincoln Day dinner here. Although George W. Bush lost Michigan in 2000 and the state elected a Democratic governor last November, the national and state party officials heaping roast beef and chicken onto their plates at the local fish and game club were buoyantly predicting they would take the state in 2004.
 The attorney general of Michigan, Mike Cox, elected in 2002 by 5,200 votes after carrying Ottawa County by 40,712, said President Bush could count on a "grass roots army of the people who got me in office." 
 Jack Oliver, deputy chairman of the Republican National Committee, said the county exemplified the Republican Party's renewed focus on "putting people back to work in politics, going door to door, friend to friend, neighbor to neighbor."
With the Congress thinly divided along partisan lines, another presidential election taking shape and the rules of campaign finance in legal limbo, the two national political parties are at crucial turning points. 
Republicans are the most encouraged. Party officials around the country, convinced that this may be their moment, are raising the prospect of an era of Republican dominance.
Republicans already hold the White House, expect to continue to control the House of Representatives and have a majority in the Senate. For the first time in 50 years, a majority of state legislators are Republicans. Almost as many Americans (30 percent) call themselves Republicans as call themselves Democrats (32 percent), the narrowest gap since pollsters began measuring party identification in the 1940's.
But Republicans are not stopping there. In Michigan, as well as in other large industrial states that Mr. Bush lost, the Republican Party, nationally and at the state level, is making big investments in building new grass roots operations that its leaders contend will pay huge dividends in the next election -- and put the party in an even more commanding position.
One of the architects of Republican growth, Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, summed up where his party stands. "We are at parity right now," he said, "with a slight edge and good prospects."
In contrast, the Democrats are still dispirited by the outcome of the disputed 2000 election, shut out of control of Congress and the White House and confronted by a popular Republican president fighting a war against terrorism. The party finds itself in a desperate effort to rebuild and to avoid permanent minority status.
Still, for all their confidence, wise Republicans remember false dawns of impending majority status after the elections of 1980 and, especially, 1994, when under Mr. Gingrich's leadership the party overreached by challenging President Clinton to shut down the government and got the blame for shutting it down.
Yet Prof. John J. Pitney, a Claremont College political scientist, said: "In the past couple of years, I think we've seen a shift from rough parity to a slight Republican advantage, which I think reflects a shift in public interest to national security, which Republicans own. If you think about bombs and rockets most of the time, you're probably going to vote Republican."
The public greatly prefers Republicans on issues from national security to taxes, though Democrats hold advantages on specific matters like health care and on the more general idea that they care about ordinary people. The Republicans' financial lead is huge and growing, with $441 million in federally regulated contributions to all national party organs in 2001-02, compared with $217 million for the Democrats. That is buttressed by 500,000 new contributors to the Republican National Committee last year and more than 100,000 so far this year.
With Karl Rove, the White House political aide, as their chief strategist, Republicans have serious plans to use their national committee not just to help Mr. Bush get re-elected but also to build their party for the long haul.
Last fall's successes in Congressional elections depended heavily not only on Mr. Bush's campaigning but also on a revived effort to get out the vote, something Republicans had forgotten in recent years while unions worked harder than ever to help Democrats in 2000. The 72-Hour Project, named for the last hours before polls closed but involving months of organizing, tapped heavily into people, like evangelical Christians, who have voted heavily Republican for president but usually skip off-year elections.
For 2004, the party will move into another realm that is usually the preserve of Democrats: voter registration. Matthew Dowd, the president's pollster, said computers would identify nonvoters in Republican neighborhoods. That and other registration efforts, including having party workers at naturalization ceremonies, could "expand the pool of voters" by as many as three million, Mr. Dowd said.
At the same time, Republicans are trying to make inroads into Democratic constituencies like Hispanics, African-Americans, union members and Jews, he said, so that "long before Democrats can go after swing voters, they have to solidify their base."
A rising Pennsylvania Republican, State Representative Kelly Lewis of East Stroudsburg, said he won minority votes in 2000 after coming to the aid of minority homeowners who were losing their homes after developers and builders enticed them into taking out fraudulent loans. "Instead of ignoring it because it is happening to 'them,' " Mr. Lewis said, "we just did it as an issue because it impacted people."
Marc Racicot, the Republican national chairman, spoke of outreach programs toward people "we think are Republicans who just don't know it yet." He acknowledged that with some groups, including blacks, "we have an uphill challenge sometimes, to prove tonontraditional Republicans that we are worthy of their trust."
Of course, parties always have plans.
The reason to take these intentions seriously is that since 1974, the Republican Party has stayed with such seemingly mundane efforts as direct-mail fund-raising, campaign training schools and recruiting candidates for state legislatures, treating them as farm teams to provide eventual major leaguers. It has encouraged and worked with policy institutes like the Heritage Foundation that translated ideological instincts into legislative proposals with defensible numbers attached to them. Ronald Reagan passed out the foundation's "Mandate for Leadership" at his first cabinet meeting, and the foundation helped fill the ranks of the current Bush administration.
None of those avenues to power have been ignored by the Democrats, but the Republicans have stayed with them and fortified them far more intently.
Another reason to take Republican aspirations seriously is that Republicans live by the adage of the satirist Finley Peter Dunne's Mr. Dooley, "Politics ain't beanbag." They have built their strength in the South by appealing to white resentment of civil rights policies, and sometimes by discouraging voting by blacks, as they did last year in Louisiana's Senate runoff, which the Democratic incumbent, Mary L. Landrieu, won anyway by a margin of four percentage points. When it comes to hard-hitting campaign advertisements, they have used everything from Willie Horton's image to the suggestion that Senator Max Cleland, who lost both legs and an arm in Vietnam, was unconcerned about national security.
Today's aspiring majority has its roots in the wreckage of Watergate, the 1974 election when Republicans lost 43 seats in the House, ending up with fewer than a third of the seats. They lost 6 governorships and held only 12, only 2 in any of the 10 largest states. They came out of the election with 2,385 state legislators, down 618 or 21 percent.
Robert M. Teeter, a Detroit pollster, was hired to measure the party's troubles in a national survey. His report to Eddie Mahe, the executive director of the Republican National Committee, was blunt: "We are no longer a minority party. We have achieved the status of a minor party."
That poll showed that 18 percent of Americans thought of themselves as Republicans, a low, while 42 percent were Democrats. At least as bad, Mr. Teeter said in the report's summary, "While the Democrats are seen as being somewhat too much for labor and blacks, they are also seen as being the most patriotic, having the greatest belief in hard work and the value of hard work, and by a very large margin the most open to new people, the most concerned for 'people like you' and having the strongest belief in the value of helping others." Sixty-one percent of those surveyed in the study said Republicans excessively favored rich people.
The party turned quickly to devices then considered shocking, like having President Gerald R. Ford sign a fund-raising letter for House candidates in 1975. It was not an immediate path to solvency; the party had to close its doors for a month in 1975. Despite Mr. Ford's defeat in 1976 by Jimmy Carter, the party continued rebuilding. Bill Brock, the national chairman from 1977 to 1981, pushed direct mail, not just to raise money but also because he thought it would provide a core of committed partisans. "It was not only good economics; it was good politics," Mr. Brock said recently.
Mr. Reagan's nomination in 1980 (after his near-miss in 1976) was the biggest step on the road back. His success convinced suspicious conservatives that the political deck was not stacked against them, and they enlisted in the Republican Party and ultimately took it over.
Nancy Sinnott Dwight, a Midwestern moderate who ran the Congressional campaign committee, said, "For us to prevail, the party was going to have to be hospitable to people far to our right."
Mr. Reagan reciprocated by turning to moderates. He chose George H. W. Bush, who had derided Mr. Reagan's tax-cutting plans as "voodoo economics," as his vice president, and Mr. Bush's campaign manager, James A. Baker, as White House chief of staff.
This accommodationist style has continued to work for Republicans, because for all the stories that get written about divisions over abortion and the environment, Republicans are more cohesive than Democrats and have a few core beliefs -- lower taxes, less bureaucracy, more military spending -- that unite them more than social issues divide them.
While Mr. Reagan's victory brought in a Republican Senate and a lot of House members, those gains did not last. It took Mr. Gingrich to make the Republican trend deeper than the presidency.
They laughed when Mr. Gingrich started talking about controlling the House. After all, it had been Democratic so long (since 1955) that it almost seemed to be part of the Constitution.
"They thought I was crazy," Mr. Gingrich said recently. But he was dedicated in working to create a unifying message and ruthless in his attacks on corruption -- real and exaggerated -- among Democrats, and Republicans won the House in a landslide in 1994.
Republicans have held that House majority through intense discipline, dedicated candidate recruitment and heavy spending, and much more forceful House leadership than Democrats ever managed. Their narrow majorities have held them together better than the Democrats' past big margins.
Barring economic calamity, the House seems securely Republican until at least the redistricting after the 2010 census. In the Senate, the Democrats have more tough seats to defend than the Republicans do. The presidency is perhaps the least secure Republican base, if only because personalities and the qualities of campaigns can turn those elections around. As Mr. Gingrich said, "The presidency is the least mathematical and the most prone to chance of all the major offices."
But Republicans have the advantage, and not just because of mechanics like direct mail or the 72-hour project or Ottawa County's 500 volunteers at the last election. For 20 years or more Republicans have been selling ideas that the public likes. As Mr. Teeter says, "You look where the country is: foreign policy and national security, economic and tax policy, and line them all up -- it is a center-right country."
Those values worked for Bob Beauprez, a representative from Denver's suburbs. Before he won by 121 votes last fall, he went out and asked for votes in communities that his party often ignored. Mr. Beauprez said he won votes from Hispanics and Asians "who came here looking for the American dream" the way his Belgian ancestors did. He said they liked the Republican message of "less government, personal responsibility, strong national defense and strong family values."
But none of it might have worked for the party were it not for the Watergate debacle of 1974 and four more years out of power after Mr. Carter won in 1976. As Wilma Goldstein, a veteran Republican operative whom Mr. Mahe brought into the national committee, said recently: "You almost have to roll over and be dead before you can revive. We had to do new things because we had one foot in the grave."
TOMORROW: The Democrats' identity crisis.

G.O.P. VOICES
Republicans Explain Why the Party Appeals

"I want to make sure the dollars that we are taxed are being spent properly. I like George Bush's stance on social spending and funding of some of the Democratic strongholds. I feel that he's putting pressure on the Congress to really come to task and be responsible in their social spending. Because of the budget deficit, I feel that the Republicans are the best party to be able to bring a balanced budget back to the United States."

TIM CHRYSLER
Computer consultant, Woodbury, Minn.

"Republicans believe in the sovereignty of our country. The Republican Party consistently stands with our capitalistic system. They believe in free enterprise; they believe that we have the best country in the world. They take a lot less shots at what really makes this country great. The Republicans are for smaller government."

JOHN NICHOLAS
Associate pastor, Gentryville, Ind.

"It seems like the Republicans are little bit more conservative, and I tend to run more along the conservative line: not spending money so freely, that type of thing. I tend to think that the Democrats tend to raise taxes more and spend money a little more freely than I would like them to. The Democrats just seem a little more freewheeling, like Clinton."

SHEILA SCHAEFFER
Computer aide, Fort Wayne, Ind.

"The Republican Party just agrees with the way I feel compared with the Democratic Party, which is right now almost a communist party. You have to go some way or the other. I happen to think the Republicans are much more conservative. The Republican Party is trying to make the country so that the people are relatively self-sufficient and not living on welfare, which is paid for by the government and the people who are actually earning money."

HEADLINE: Political Memo; 
In Bush Math, Economy Equals Votes

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: CRAWFORD, Tex., May 24 

 BODY:
It was a vital meeting for President Bush's effort to strengthen the economy -- and by extension his re-election prospects -- and it did not start well.
 Mr. Bush had called Republican Congressional leaders to the White House on Monday evening to talk about the tax bill that he was counting on to give the sluggish economy a boost. But as they sat on the Truman Balcony, Mr. Bush and some top aides watched in consternation as J. Dennis Hastert, the House speaker, lashed out at Senator Charles E. Grassley over the way the Senate had handled the bill, underscoring the bitter split in the party over how to complete the legislation and send it to the president for his signature. 
 Mr. Bush let Mr. Hastert and other House Republicans vent, people who were present said. Then the president stepped in and delivered a stern message: Compromise and get the tax bill done by the end of the week.
With the White House dictating the terms of the compromise, Congress did just that, passing a $350 billion package of tax cuts and aid to the states.
Mr. Bush's imposition of a deadline reflected concern at the White House that open-ended negotiations between the House and the Senate could drag on for weeks or months, or even break down.
Aides to Mr. Bush said their nightmare was a contentious showdown between House and Senate tax negotiators that would delay their ability to move on to another issue vital to the White House's re-election strategy -- adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare -- and keep the tax cuts from going into effect until next fall, when they would have that much less time to help the economy before the presidential campaign gets under way in earnest.
"This achievement is a victory for every family struggling to pay the bills, every entrepreneur hoping to expand the business and create new jobs and every American looking for work," Mr. Bush, who is spending the weekend at his ranch here, said today in his weekly radio address.
With just over 17 months before voters will determine whether he gets another term and the Democratic presidential field already attacking his economic management, Mr. Bush can now make a case that he has pursued every option available to stop the steady disappearance of jobs since he took office, give a boost to stock prices and invigorate business and consumer confidence.
"We have a period of time to see some of those things turn around," said Betsy DeVos, chairman of the Republican Party in Michigan. "If there's even the slightest improvement in the economy, it's going to be hard for any of the nine Democrats to find a crack in the wall."
Mr. Bush has pushed three major tax cuts through Congress even though polls consistently show the public not to consider them a top priority. He has promised to reappoint Alan Greenspan chairman of the Federal Reserve, effectively throwing his weight behind the central bank's strategy of pushing interest rates to near record low levels. And in the last few weeks his Treasury secretary has begun talking down the value of the dollar relative to other currencies, a step that should give manufacturers an opportunity to sell more goods abroad.
"One would have to say this has been the most activist administration in memory in attacking economic sluggishness," said Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the White House budget director, who is stepping down in two weeks. "That illustrates the difficulty of the problem, but also the president's determination to keep attacking it. Is it enough? We won't know for a while, will we?"
Democrats said Mr. Bush's policies have been wrong-headed because they have been directed overwhelmingly at helping the wealthy and will leave future generations to pay off a huge government debt.
Politically, Democrats said, Mr. Bush's aggressiveness on the tax cut makes the economy his responsibility in a way it has not been up until now. 
"He's gotten everything he's asked for since coming into office," said Representative Robert T. Matsui, Democrat of California. "The economy is now his responsibility. He can't blame it on Clinton and Gore. He can't blame it on the war. This will be the defining issue of the campaign."
Even some Bush allies acknowledge that the long list of negative statistics will make the economy a minefield. At the top of the list is jobs. Employers have shed more than 2 million jobs since January 2001, following eight years under President Bill Clinton in which the economy added 23 million jobs. The jobless rate has gone from 4.1 percent when Mr. Bush was inaugurated to 6 percent today.
While stumping for his tax cut this spring, Mr. Bush repeatedly pledged that it would create 1 million jobs by the end of 2004, based on a White House study of a version of the bill similar to the one that passed on Friday. Administration officials said they had not yet updated the study to account for changes in the bill.
Even if the tax cut creates 1 million jobs by Election Day 2004, that would leave Mr. Bush to run on a record of losing 1 million jobs. That would be a tough position for the president to be in even with the excuses he can legitimately offer, including a recession, a terrorist attack, two wars and a wide-reaching corporate finance scandal.
Similarly, administration officials had made a case that eliminating the tax on stock dividends would push stock prices up by 5 to 15 percent, based on Wall Street estimates. But the provision in the final bill would reduce the dividend tax to 15 percent for most taxpayers rather than eliminate it -- and even that cut would be temporary, forcing action by a future Congress to extend it. 
As a result, analysts are divided over whether the dividend provision will have much effect on stock prices.
White House officials and their advisers say there is no guarantee of a quick return to prosperity. But they said Mr. Bush's efforts on behalf of the economy would be almost as important in shaping the perceptions of voters as whether those efforts prove successful.
"There is clearly a school of thought at the White House that believes these policies are the right thing to do," said one prominent Republican who advises the administration on both politics and economic policy. 
"But politically, the constant refrain about the need for more jobs and that tax cuts will generate growth, that level of engagement will have a significant political payoff whether it has a significant economic payoff or not."

HEADLINE: GOVERNORS RESIST BUSH PLAN TO SLOW COSTS OF MEDICAID 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24 

 BODY:
After two months of intense secret negotiations, governors and Bush administration officials have been unable to agree on a plan to rein in the soaring cost of Medicaid, participants in the talks say.
 Governors of both parties are resisting a proposal offered by President Bush this year to set firm limits on federal Medicaid spending in each state over the next decade. 
 "I am extremely wary of that approach," said Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, a Democrat on the bipartisan team of 10 governors negotiating with the Bush administration.
Negotiators emphasized that it was not just Democrats resisting Mr. Bush's proposal to give each state a fixed allotment of federal money to cover all Medicaid costs in each of the next 10 years. 
Republican governors, including Jeb Bush of Florida and John G. Rowland of Connecticut, have also expressed reservations, the negotiators said. The negotiations have been conducted privately, but details of the talks were obtained in interviews and from documents exchanged by the negotiators.
The basic concern, set forth in documents from the National Governors Association, is that the president's proposal does not protect states against unforeseen costs that might result from changes in the economy, natural disasters, outbreaks of disease or the development of expensive drugs and other treatments.
Dr. Rhonda M. Medows, secretary of the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration, said Governor Bush was "right there with the other governors" on this issue.
"Governor Bush is not going to make a decision without knowing there's a safety net to address the possibility of a phenomenal or catastrophic event, like a new disease or a man-made or natural disaster," Dr. Medows said. "He's a responsible man. He doesn't want to take money up front and dump problems on his successor."
State officials recalled the experience of New York, which added more than 300,000 people to its Medicaid rolls in four months after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
Some of the 10 governors have come under pressure from advocates for the disabled, hospitals and other health care providers lobbying against any caps on federal Medicaid spending. 
The American Hospital Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics have sent letters opposing the president's plan.
Federal officials have been trying to explain the president's proposal to governors since late January.
But Thomas A. Scully, administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said he found "a surprising level of misunderstanding" when he met with the governors on May 14. The Bush administration had wanted an agreement by May 15.
The governors association tries to work by consensus and would adopt a new policy on Medicaid only if two-thirds of the governors endorsed it. Negotiations continue, governors said, because they see Medicaid costs as growing out of control and they desperately want more authority to manage the program.
The governors readily embraced Mr. Bush's proposal to give states power to alter Medicaid benefits, modify eligibility rules and charge higher co-payments.
But the governors said they had reached no consensus, among themselves or with the administration, on the financing of the program, which provides health insurance to 50 million low-income people.
The negotiations are immensely important. Medicaid, the nation's largest health insurance program, pays for one-third of all births, covers one-fourth of all children and finances care for two-thirds of nursing home residents. It is also the fastest-growing item in most state budgets, rising 13 percent last year, even though state revenues were virtually flat.
Medicaid is expected to cost $277 billion this year, of which $158 billion is the federal share and $119 billion comes from the states. The federal share of Medicaid spending varies with a state's per capita income, ranging from a high of 77 percent in Mississippi to a low of 50 percent in 12 states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. 
Having rejected elements of President Bush's proposal, the governors are trying to devise an alternative that would make federal costs more predictable while still allowing Medicaid to respond to economic fluctuations and other unforeseen events.
One option being considered by the governors is simply to recalculate the federal allotments every year or two. Each state taking this option would receive a lump sum of federal money, but the amount could be adjusted if, for example, Medicaid costs increased because of a recession, a bioterrorist attack or the discovery of new medicines to treat AIDS or Alzheimer's disease.
Another option would continue the current open-ended commitment of federal money to some of the most vulnerable Medicaid recipients, including poor children whom states are now required to cover. But under this proposal, the federal government would set a cap on its spending for other groups that now account for one-third of all Medicaid recipients.
This hybrid approach, combining Medicaid's current payment formula with a fixed allotment of federal money for some costs, "has gained quite a bit of support among governors" on the negotiating team, Dr. Medows said. 
Gov. Paul E. Patton of Kentucky, a Democrat who is chairman of the National Governors Association, has floated a version of the proposal, under which states would accept more financial risk in return for greater freedom to manage the program. 
Medicaid benefits are now generally all or nothing. Eligibility standards vary widely from state to state, but states have to cover children under the age of 6 whose families have incomes up to 133 percent of the poverty level. People who qualify for Medicaid usually have access to a package of benefits more extensive than those available in commercial health insurance.
Some governors would offer different Medicaid benefits to different population groups: less generous benefits to children of higher-income families, for example, or a handful of specific drugs for people with the virus that causes AIDS. 
Advocates for children and the disabled fear they could lose access to critical services as a result of such changes. 
Governors said their top priority was to get the federal government to pay the full cost of providing care to six million low-income elderly people who qualify for both Medicaid and Medicare.
Bush administration officials said this issue should be addressed separately, in discussions to revamp Medicare. That answer does not satisfy the governors, who see health care for the elderly as a federal obligation. Medicaid provides more extensive benefits than Medicare, a program financed entirely with federal money.
People who qualify for both programs account for 12 percent of Medicaid recipients, but more than 30 percent of state Medicaid spending, including $7 billion a year for prescription drugs and $24 billion a year for nursing homes and other long-term care. If Congress adds outpatient drug benefits to Medicare, the federal government would pick up those pharmaceutical costs. But, governors said, they would still be left with their share of the costs for long-term care. 
House Republicans said they would soon begin drafting legislation to overhaul Medicaid. Representatives Heather A. Wilson of New Mexico and Billy Tauzin of Louisiana, the chairman of the Energy and Committee Committee, will lead the effort. Ms. Wilson said Congress would consider the administration's proposal and the governors' ideas.
But Mr. Scully, the top federal Medicaid official, said: "It will be hard for Congress to pass any legislation unless it has strong bipartisan support from governors. They need to come to an agreement very soon, or they'll lose this opportunity."

HEADLINE: Hummers Here, Hummers There 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
In the wake of the recent terrorist bombings in Riyadh, Saudi officials seem to have -- pardon the expression -- gotten religion. They say they now understand that suicide terrorism in the name of Islam is as much a threat to them as it is to the open societies of the West. This time, they insist, they're going to crack down on their extremists. I hope so, but I fear we have a deeper problem with Saudi Arabia. I fear it is the Soviet Union. I fear it is unreformable.
 I fear that the ruling brothers of Saudi Arabia are like the Soviet Politburo. I fear the 6,000 Saudi princes are like the Communist Party Central Committee. I fear that Riyadh is Red Square. I fear the Al-Sauds used Islamism to unite 40 fractious tribes in Arabia the way Lenin used Communism to unite 100 fractious nationalities across Russia. And I fear that Osama bin Laden is just the evil version of Andrei Sakharov -- the dissident Soviet scientist who exposed the system from within. Sakharov was exiled to Gorky. Bin Laden was exiled to Kabul. And both systems meet their end where? In Afghanistan. 
 Even if this parallel is off, and the Saudi system could be reformed without collapsing, I fear that the Saudi ruling family has become too dysfunctional, divided and insecure to undertake this task. Surely one test is whether Saudi officials and spiritual leaders can condemn Islamic suicide terrorism, not just when it is against them, but when it is against people of other faiths -- no matter what the context. Saudi Arabia's neighbors -- Jordan, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman -- are experimenting with elections, a freer press, women's rights and free trade with America. Saudi Arabia, by contrast, has been drifting under an ailing king, trying to buy a different perception of itself with better advertising rather than with deeper reform.
Frankly, I have a soft spot for the de facto Saudi ruler, Crown Prince Abdullah, who is a man of decency and moderation.But he's too nice for his own good. He needs to break heads at home, force some sustained reforms on his religious establishment, revive his own peace initiative and begin to empower his women -- because women's empowerment is the best antidote to extremism.
The problem with Saudi Arabia is not that it has too little democracy. It's that it has too much. The ruling family is so insecure, it feels it has to consult every faction, tribe and senior cleric before making any decision. This makes Saudi Arabia a very strange autocracy: it's a country where one man makes no decisions.
If this continues, we must protect ourselves -- by telling the Saudis, and ourselves, the truth.
In private, Bush aides have been fuming: The U.S. gave the Saudis intelligence warnings before the recent attacks, but they took no steps to deter them. Publicly, though, the Bush team bites its tongue. We never talk straight to Saudi Arabia, because we are addicted to its oil. Addicts never tell the truth to their pushers.
If we were telling the Saudis the truth, we would tell them that their antimodern and antipluralist brand of Islam -- known as Wahhabism -- combined with their oil wealth has become a destabilizing force in the world. By financing mosques and schools that foster the least tolerant version of Islam, they are breeding the very extremists who are trying to burn down their house and ours.
But we also need to tell ourselves the truth. We constantly complain about the blank checks the Saudis write to buy off their extremists. But who writes the blank checks to the Saudis? We do -- with our gluttonous energy habits, renewed addiction to big cars, and our president who has made "conservation" a dirty word.
In the wake of the Iraq war, the E.P.A. announced that the average fuel economy of America's cars and trucks fell to its lowest level in 22 years, with the 2002 model year. That is a travesty. No wonder foreigners think we sent our U.S. Army Humvees to control Iraq, just so we could drive more G.M. Hummers over here. When our president insists that we can have it all -- big cars, big oil, lower taxes, with no sacrifices or conservation -- why shouldn't the world believe that all we are about is protecting our right to binge?
And so the circle is complete: President Bush won't tell Americans the truth, so we won't tell Saudis the truth, so they won't tell their extremists the truth, so they can go on pumping intolerance and we can go on guzzling gas. Someday, our kids will condemn us for all of this.

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL; 
Spot a Falling Star Becomes a Playoff Theme

BYLINE:  By MIKE WISE 

DATELINE: DALLAS, May 24 

 BODY:
Before Dirk Nowitzki returned from the hospital and limped into the locker room, his Dallas Mavericks teammates wore the look of former contenders. "It's our turn now," Nick Van Exel said, resigned to the worst.
 Down the hall from the Mavericks' locker room, Malik Rose knocked on his oak-paneled cubicle at the American Airlines Center. 
 "I just hope our big guns stay healthy," Rose, the Spurs forward, said. "The way things are going in the playoffs this year, you can't take for granted anyone being around for the long haul." 
Nowitzki went down in Game 3 of the Western Conference finals, grabbing his left knee under the basket with more than eight minutes left. He was helped off the court with 7 minutes 45 seconds left in the quarter. Dallas, though not technically done, trailing the Spurs by two games to one, became an instant long shot to win the series and advance to its first N.B.A. finals.
And Nowitzki became the latest marquee pro basketball player to experience a debilitating injury or a defeat this May -- an ongoing exodus of stars threatening to rob the playoffs of drama, ratings and the interest of the casual fan. 
Nowitzki's injury is a sprain, but with his status doubtful for at least the next two games, an agonizing postseason cycle continues for the N.B.A.
No Nowitzki. No Chris Webber, who had a season-ending knee injury against Dallas that hindered Sacramento's chances. No Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, the N.B.A.'s golden children most responsible for ratings increases in the post-Michael Jordan era. O'Neal and Bryant now sit at home on their couches after the Spurs knocked the Lakers out in six games of the Western Conference semifinals.
On it goes. In the Eastern Conference, Allen Iverson, Paul Pierce and Tracy McGrady have been home for a while, sent packing by either Detroit or the Nets.
The rootin', tootin' all-Texas showdown between the Spurs and the Mavericks was supposed to galvanize interest in the West, but no Dirk, most observers acknowledge, equals no drama. All that's left is Tim Duncan, the most valuable player, clinically taking apart a team that cannot guard him.
"I've got kind of mixed emotions about that," said Donn Nelson, the Mavericks assistant coach, about the missing stars. "Those are the guys we like to coach and the fans like to come to see. But it also provides a unique opportunity for some guys to come off the bench and provide a different kind of a story.
"You have to weather some of those situations, but no question, some of the luster comes off when the stars aren't out there."
After Duncan, three point guards with star quality remain: Jason Kidd for the Nets, Tony Parker in San Antonio and Steve Nash in Dallas. It is not so much a star quorum as a herky-jerky Nike commercial, replete with gimmicky synthesizer music.
Tracing the immediate decline in playoff drama this postseason starts in Sacramento. While players like McGrady, Rasheed Wallace and Kevin Garnett were not favored to get their teams out of the first round, Webber and the Kings were looking as polished and potent as they did last season against the Lakers in a wildly entertaining Western Conference finals -- a series that had basketball fans on edge until the final seconds of overtime of Game 7.
In the last round against Dallas, when Webber tore cartilage in his left knee in Game 2, the question of who wins and who goes home became easier to answer. 
Any informal survey among N.B.A. cognoscenti reveals a longing for a rematch of the Lakers-Kings series.
But by deduction and based on perception, the Spurs and the Lakers were the two best teams left in the playoffs. Since whoever has won the West since Jordan retired for the second time in 1998 has won the title, the thinking was that Duncan's dominating performance in beating the Lakers was essentially the equivalent of wresting the title from them.
When the Lakers and the Kings were out, the Spurs were suddenly in. And while a story line involving Duncan en route to his second championship in five seasons is worthy, his game -- relying on footwork, strength, accuracy and an economy of movement -- does not resonate with many people beyond basketball's fundamentals gatekeepers.
The Spurs and the Mavericks were great for Texas, but were they big box office outside of their state? One local fan jokingly suggested that a promoter should pay the Kings and the Lakers to return from vacation and play again anyway, so that more people would watch.
With all due respect to Duncan, big men don't sell sneakers and they rarely captivate the masses. There was a reason the Duke student section called him Spock during his years at Wake Forest. In a galaxy of supernovas, Duncan's mannerisms on the floor were about as dispassionate as they come.
So the Mavericks, with their multipronged offense, privately became the league's last marketing hope. With Nowitzki, Nash, Van Exel and Michael Finley declaring themselves ready to shoot the ball once they left their hotel rooms, they stunned the Spurs in Game 1 of the series.
If they could somehow shock the Spurs, the thinking went, the Mavericks could engage in a church-league transition series with the Nets. There would be points, dunks, crazy finishes and, maybe, a ratings bonanza in ABC's first year of its N.B.A. television contract.
Now? You need go back no further than 1999 for an anticlimactic end, when the Knicks and the Spurs combined for some of the lowest finals ratings in league history -- a five-game series won by the Spurs, with the Knicks' most prominent player, Patrick Ewing, out with an injury.
Or go back to 1989, when Magic Johnson and Byron Scott nursed sore hamstrings on the bench as the Lakers were swept by the Detroit Pistons in the finals.
Providing San Antonio and the Nets advance, the Nets could push the finals to six or seven games and make up for the loss of star power. Maybe the game's marquee players will watch from their couches with interest.
But to be in Dallas on Friday night, the N.B.A. season appeared to be moving toward an end without suspense or much theater.
Neither Dallas Coach Don Nelson nor Van Exel gave a concession speech after the loss of Nowitzki and a pivotal game. But they did sound like a coach and a player whose team was going to lose the series.
Always the realist, Van Exel once put his hand into the middle of a team huddle in Los Angeles as the rest of the Lakers, down by 3-0 to the Jazz in a playoff series, broke the huddle with an emphatic "Team!"
Van Exel? He yelled sarcastically, "Cancun!" The next day, the Lakers were indeed on vacation, headed to some exotic place far from a dramatic postseason, the same place most of the N.B.A. seems headed for today.

Re "Death on the Border" (editorial, May 19): 
 The United States can fill its labor needs without inviting in people from other countries or looking the other way when undocumented workers come in. 
 With millions of Americans currently poor and unemployed, it makes no sense to import more workers. But employers want cheap labor; that's why they clamor for illegal immigrants. 
Amnesty is not the answer to the illegal immigrant problem; enforcement is. The invasion, currently about 80,000 illegal immigrants a month, would end tomorrow if these illegal immigrants could no longer come here and get jobs, free health care, education and other rights of American citizens.

HEADLINE: Dollars, Deficits And a Loss of Trust 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "A Weakened Treasury" (editorial, May 21):
 It is not the devalued dollar or the escalating deficits that we should be concerned with. 
The real issue is the devalued esteem, respect and trust we are experiencing throughout the world. 
 Certainly the decline of the dollar and recent reports of a slowing world economy are cause for great concern, but it seems to me that the Bush administration is trying to navigate a maze and is being blocked at every turn.
They got it wrong in Iraq (despite winning the war), they are all wrong on the economy and are akin to death on the environment. The decline of the dollar is a sign of what may come if we allow the folly of tax cuts when what we really need is a huge influx of capital and a shrinking of our trade deficits.

Nonprofit groups are slowly learning the benefits -- to services and fund-raising -- of being wired.

BYLINE:  By Bob Tedeschi

 BODY:
THE nonprofit industry is big business, with more than $700 billion in annual revenues and $2 trillion in assets. But unlike other large sectors of the nation's economy, this one has been generally Internet-resistant. And that, some say, is keeping nonprofits from achieving levels of efficiency they greatly need in an era of philanthropic tightfistedness.
 The most recent critics of nonprofits include former Senator Bill Bradley, who, along with two of his colleagues at the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, suggested this month that the nation's nonprofits could save $100 billion a year if they reduced costs and improved the effectiveness of their services. Internet initiatives, Mr. Bradley and his colleagues said, could help reach that goal. 
 Efficiency is certainly a watchword in nonprofit circles of late. With charitable contributions leveling off after 20 years of growth, nonprofits are ever mindful of ways they can better balance costs and services. Legislation recently introduced in Congress would force foundations to give away more money to charities each year, but this potential windfall comes at a time when grantors are increasingly interested in seeing statistical results demonstrating a return on their investments. 
While some executives of nonprofit organizations have shown they understand how Internet technologies can create both improved efficiency and transparency, analysts said a vast majority of charitable groups were not yet wired in even the simplest ways.
The McKinsey team said, for instance, in an article published in the Harvard Business Review this month that Web-based fund-raising, among other things, could save significant sums of money. But of the 200,000 largest nonprofits in the United States, only about 5 percent use the Web to solicit donations. And other e-commerce applications widespread in the for-profit world, like client databases, e-mail marketing and Web site traffic analysis, are even less common in the nonprofit industry.
But such applications can be critically important, said David Saltzman, the executive director of the Robin Hood Foundation, which among other things provides grants and technology support to nonprofit organizations. "There are an awful lot of foundations, and people providing services, who think the magic occurs when a social worker is there with a suicidal, pregnant 13-year old," Mr. Saltzman said. "They think, 'What's the role of technology in that?' "
But if the social worker had access to a client database, Mr. Saltzman said, "and they understood that the program they work for is also serving the abusive father, they could be even more effective."
Not all nonprofits are technologically backward, of course. "There's a stratification between the biggest nonprofits, who can afford the really high-end services, and the small- to medium-sized nonprofits," said Michael Stein, an author of "The eNonprofit: A Guide to ASPs, Internet Services, and Online Software" (CompassPoint Nonprofit Services, 2002), and associate director of Groundspring.org, a nonprofit group providing fund-raising and e-mail services to small and medium-size nonprofits.
Mr. Stein said that national nonprofits like the National Wildlife Federation, the American Red Cross and others "are spending a lot of money on technology, on infrastructure development." But among smaller organizations, which make up more than 80 percent of the nonprofit universe, "they're probably half a light year behind the corporate world," he said. "They don't have the money, staff or know-how to do technology investments."
Even if an organization makes the investments, though, technologies often go unused, according to Sheri Saltzberg, a nonprofit consultant based in Brooklyn. "They don't have the skills, the administrative support, a data person or a research analyst," Ms. Salzburg said. "So it ends up being the responsibility of the executive director, who has all these other demands on her time."
Mr. Stein, too, has witnessed this. Of the 1,000 customers who pay for Groundspring's software, 300 do not use it. "That's totally an industry norm," he said.
Nonprofit executives and consultants said one factor that could help change that norm was the emergence of affordable technology assistance for second- and third-tier organizations. With the dot-com bust and the downturn in corporate technology spending, many information technology consultants can be hired on the cheap, executives said. At the same time, low-cost technology consulting concerns aimed at nonprofits are attracting more funding, and are now offering their services in more markets than ever.
Take NPower, a nonprofit consulting group based in Seattle, and supported largely by Microsoft. The group, which was formed in 1999 and added a satellite branch in New York in 2001, has since added branches in seven cities, with another three to come this year.
NPower sells annual memberships to nonprofits on a sliding scale, at a maximum of $500, and provides technology support services to members for about $60 an hour -- less than half the going rate in the for-profit realm. It also provides free online diagnostic tools designed to help nonprofits identify their technology needs.
Among NPower's clients is the Urban Justice Center, which provides legal assistance to homeless and mentally ill people, among others, in New York City. The Urban Justice Center has for the past two years been working with numerous nonprofit groups based in New York to log information about food assistance recipients into an online database. That database, which is managed by a coalition of government agencies and nonprofit funding groups, will help identify areas that are underserved by food assistance programs.
The Urban Justice Center will also use the database to identify common problems in food assistance distribution and, if applicable, mount legal challenges to protect the rights of food assistance recipients. Moreover, the Urban Justice Center will use the database as a model for building an internal database for its project to help the homeless. The thousands of homeless people served by the project each year are now tracked with paper files -- a practice likely to end this summer, when both the food assistance database and the homelessness database are expected to go into action.
While NPower, Groundspring and other organizations are helping their nonprofit colleagues get wired, some for-profit e-commerce companies, like GetActive Software in Berkeley, Calif., have also found economic opportunity in the nonprofit market. According to Bill Pease, GetActive's chief technology officer, revenues for the privately held company are growing by 50 percent each quarter, reaching the $5 million range last year.
GetActive provides online fund-raising, advocacy and e-mail services, among other things, for monthly fees that typically range from thousands to tens of thousands of dollars. Most of its clients, Mr. Pease said, are the larger nonprofit groups, including the Environmental Defense Fund, the American Red Cross, and the major public broadcasting organizations.
But some smaller organizations, like Earthjustice, an environmental group based in Oakland, Calif., are also GetActive clients. According to Adelaide Roberts, the director of public support at Earthjustice, the group pays GetActive about $40,000 annually to help create and distribute a monthly e-mail newsletter that keeps members abreast of important environmental issues, and helps them contact legislators.
"It's paying for itself, but our supporters are also becoming more involved in contacting representatives about bills, so it contributes to our program, too," Ms. Roberts said. And to an increasing extent, nonprofit executives say that quantifiable service improvements like these are the fastest way to a donor's wallet.
Late last year the Harlem Children's Zone, a nonprofit group serving families in some of New York's most impoverished areas, rolled out a system that uses bar-code scanners and ID cards to track children in its day-care programs as they move to different activities and to monitor their developmental progress using database and analytical software.
According to Geoffrey Canada, the chief executive of the Children's Zone, the system took about two years and roughly $300,000 in hardware and software, but it has already helped him make significant improvements in services. And when major donors call for progress reports, Mr. Canada said he could quickly generate data and e-mail the results.
"That's been part of our success -- our ability to get information back out the door very quickly," he said. "It's helped us get more funding."

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Microsoft Finds Some Doubters For the Motives Of Its Largesse

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, May 25 

 BODY:
Even when the Microsoft Corporation attempts to do good, its critics distrust its motives. 
 The company is significantly increasing its donation of software to the nation's nonprofit organizations, to a level that may approach $1 billion annually in the next three to four years, according to the organization that will distribute the software. Executives at nonprofit organizations are applauding the expected increase in donations, up from $207 million in estimated retail value last year. 
 But the increase has also drawn objections from developers of "open source" programs (programs for which the source code is freely distributed). Those critics say they believe Microsoft is using a giveaway strategy to undercut the so-called free software movement in the potentially promising nonprofit market. 
Microsoft's donations -- the total will be determined by demand from nonprofit organizations -- will be offered through CompuMentor, a nonprofit agency in San Francisco that provides technical consulting and distributes donated software for commercial software companies including Cisco, Adobe, Lotus and Symantec. Microsoft executives are skeptical about the size the of increase, but said they believed it would at least double. Currently, Microsoft represents more than 75 percent of the donations.
The increased donations come at a time when Microsoft has adopted a strategy, as reported by The International Herald Tribune, to discount its software in Europe for government and large private agencies to counter the growth of open-source programs, like the Linux operating system and OpenOffice, that might potentially threaten its dominance in the desktop computing marketplace.
Microsoft executives have said that they consider open-source software one of the company's most significant competitors. 
In the United States, some advocates of the open-source movement have viewed nonprofits with limited budgets as a logical first market for free software.
Several nonprofit executives said they believed Microsoft was moving to ensure that free software would not gain a foothold in organizations that normally could not afford large commercial software packages.
"As a monopoly, Microsoft's below-market-price distribution of software might very well be a form of illegal competition for a particular market," said Michael Gilbert, a consultant to nonprofits and director of the Gilbert Center in Seattle.
Economists and antitrust experts say the issue is murky. Discounting is legal unless it is predatory, but proving anticompetitive intent by Microsoft in its philanthropy is unlikely.
"I have never seen an antitrust challenge to what in essence is charitable giving," said Andrew I. Gavil, a professor at the Howard University School of Law.
Microsoft executives said market competition played no part in their decision to increase their donations. "Maybe this is a case of no good deed going unpunished," said Brad Smith, Microsoft's senior vice president and general counsel.
Similar questions of motive arose last year when Microsoft proposed settling several state antitrust lawsuits by donating software to educational institutions.
After Apple Computer objected, Florida and Montana deals were altered and Microsoft will instead supply vouchers permitting educators to buy software from any company they choose. Mr. Smith said Microsoft was trying to negotiate a similar settlement to a California suit.
Several independent open-source software developers said they believed the donations had a strategic as well as a philanthropic intent.
"Microsoft's culture is about unfair competition," said Mitchell Kapor, a Microsoft critic leading an open-source project to build a program called Chandler that will compete with Microsoft's Outlook when it is released next year.
However, Mr. Kapor said there were positive aspects to Microsoft's increase in donations. "Within limits, it is good for Microsoft to give away software to nonprofits that can't afford it," he said, adding that if the strategy rises to the level of unfair competition "it becomes a problem."
He noted that in the future competition between Microsoft and the open-source community would be less about price and more about factors like total cost of ownership and technical support.
"It's a pretty transparent strategy," said Michael Stein, associate director of Groundspring, a San Francisco-based organization that develops software for nonprofits to manage relationships with donors and clients. Despite his commitment to the open-source movement, Mr. Stein also said he felt that the Microsoft donations were good for nonprofits, which often face severe financial limits.
"From the perspective of our constituency, CompuMentor becomes a hero," he said. "Everyone needs Microsoft tools." 
His view was echoed by David Geilhufe, senior program officer at the Beaumont Foundation of America, a grant-making organization focused on giving computer hardware to disadvantaged communities. "Microsoft is the standard, and its software has more features than open-source software," Mr. Geilhufe said. He added, however, that freely available open-source software might prove to be a better long-term solution for the needs of nonprofit agencies.
A number of open-source developers have also questioned whether Microsoft can be trusted to make long-term commitments to nonprofits.
"Maybe this is paranoia or maybe its historic perspective," said Michelle Murrain, a programmer and a member of the steering committee of the Nonprofit Open Source Initiative, a group trying to build support for open-source software among nonprofits. "Microsoft could throw in all this software for the next two years and then just stop and people will be hooked."
CompuMentor executives said they were reaching out to open-source software developers and hoped that in the future they would be able to add free software to the options available for nonprofits.
"There are tools that will help nonprofits that can only be built in open source, and we want to help with that," said Phil Ferrante-Roseberry, CompuMentor's executive director.
Earlier this year, at a gathering for their financial supporters, which Microsoft co-sponsored, CompuMentor executives showed a chart that indicated the organization's total software and hardware distribution to nonprofits would surpass $1 billion by 2006.
Microsoft executives said they are not certain that the program would prove as popular as CompuMentor estimates. They said the volume of donations would grow significantly, but perhaps not more than double current levels.
Mr. Smith added that even if CompuMentor proves correct in its estimate, the impact on the software market and Microsoft's ability to hold on to that market would not be very significant. Currently, the estimated retail value of the software that the company is giving away is less than 1 percent of its total sales, he said.
Even if the volume becomes significantly larger, it probably would not be greater than 2 or 3 percent.
"In reality, the big question that I worry about is not whether we're doing too much, but whether we're doing too little," Mr. Smith said.

HEADLINE: Hunt for Etiquette Among Unwired 

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL

 BODY:
About 200 top telecommunications executives and analysts met last week in Dana Point, Calif., at the Vortex Conference, so named to reflect the supposed convergence of communications technologies. In the future, organizers may want to rename it the Anarchists Conference.
 While speakers and panelists made their presentations on stage during the two-day affair, outside Los Angeles, many of the audience members were, quite glaringly, doing their own thing. Armed with laptop computers equipped with wireless Internet connections, many executives had only one ear on the speakers but both hands on the keyboard, checking e-mail and stock prices, surfing the Internet and otherwise whiling away their time wirelessly. 
 The problem may be genetic, joked one participant, Charles R. Lax, who said it was simply reflexes that kept him continually monitoring e-mail on both his laptop computer and his personal digital assistant. "I have a multitasking Linux kernel in my head," said Mr. Lax, a general partner with GrandBanks Capital, a venture capital firm in Newton Center, Mass.
John Gallant, the editorial director for the trade publication NetworkWorld, which sponsors the Vortex Conference, said the era of wireless communications had abetted social behavior that can be at once productive and distracting. "It's one of the issues we're talking about here," Mr. Gallant said.
Then again, wireless communications was not the only reason Vortex presenters were receiving less attention than in years past. This year, the conference had only 200 registrants, compared with 225 last year and 300 during the Internet bubble.
Some executives who have attended in years past but not this time, like David Hannah, the chief executive of Tropos Networks, cited various reasons for skipping it -- including the need to stay home and focus on internal issues, and the fact the conference had fewer big-name speakers than in the past. Those problems are not peculiar to Vortex; conference attendance is down across the technology and telecommunications industries, Mr. Gallant and several other Vortex participants said.
For those who made presentations, the question was whether they were distracted or annoyed by the clicking of computer keyboards or the beeping of pagers, digital assistants and cellphones from the audience.
"It might be considered rude, but it's becoming more and more commonplace," said Jeffrey T. Binder, chief executive of Broadbus Technologies, a broadband cable company, who took part in a panel discussion.
But Mr. Binder said the audience's divided attention might represent the future. After all, he said, he and his peers were not only helping create next-generation technology, but influencing how it is used.
"This is where the etiquette is created," he said.

From PlayStation to Supercomputer for $50,000

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
As perhaps the clearest evidence yet of the computing power of sophisticated but inexpensive video-game consoles, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has assembled a supercomputer from an army of Sony PlayStation 2's.
 The resulting system, with components purchased at retail prices, cost a little more than $50,000. The center's researchers believe the system may be capable of a half trillion operations a second, well within the definition of supercomputer, although it may not rank among the world's 500 fastest supercomputers. 
 Perhaps the most striking aspect of the project, which uses the open source Linux operating system, is that the only hardware engineering involved was placing 70 of the individual game machines in a rack and plugging them together with a high-speed Hewlett-Packard network switch. The center's scientists bought 100 machines, but are holding 30 in reserve, possibly for high-resolution display application. 
"It took a lot of time because you have to cut all of these things out of the plastic packaging," said Craig Steffen, a senior research scientist at the center, who is one of four scientists working part time on the project.
The scientists are taking advantage of a standard component of the Sony video-game console that was originally intended to move and transform pixels rapidly on a television screen to produce lifelike graphics. The chip is not the PlayStation 2's MIPS microprocessor, but rather a graphics co-processor known as the Emotion Engine. That custom designed silicon chip is capable of producing up to 6.5 billion mathematical operations a second.
The impressive performance of the game machine, which has been on the market for a few years, underscores a radical shift that has taken place in the computing world since the end of the cold war in the late 1980's, according to the researchers.
While the most advanced computing technologies have historically been developed first for large corporate users and military contractors, increasingly the fastest computers are being developed for the consumer market and for products meant to be placed under Christmas trees. 
"If you look at the economics of game platforms and the power of computing on toys, this is a long-term market trend and computing trend," said Dan Reed, the supercomputing center's director. "The economics are just amazing. This is going to drive the next big wave in high-performance computing."
The scientists have their eyes on a variety of consumer hardware, he said. For example Nvidia, the maker of graphics cards for personal computers, is now selling a high-performance graphics card that is capable of executing 51 billion mathematical operations a second.
The pace of the consumer computing world is moving so quickly that the researchers are building the PlayStation 2-based supercomputer as an experiment to see how quickly they can take advantage of off-the-shelf low-cost technologies.
"I think we'd like to be able to transfer a lot of our experience to the next generation," he said.
Despite the computing promise of game consoles that sell for less than $200, the researchers acknowledged that the experiment was likely to be most useful for a group of relatively narrow scientific problems.
They added that while the system was already doing scientific calculations, they cannot be certain about its ultimate computing potential until they write more carefully tuned software routines that can move data in and out of the custom processor quickly. The limited memory of the Sony game console -- 32 megabytes of memory -- would also restrict the practical applications of the supercomputer, they said.
But they noted that the computer was already running useful calculations on quantum chromodynamics, or QCD, simulations. QCD is a theory concerning the so-called strong interactions that bind elementary particles like quarks and gluons together to form hadrons, the constituents of nuclear matter.
The ability to lower the cost of QCD simulation in itself would be significant, the researchers said, because such problems are the single largest consumer of computing resources on supercomputers at the Department of Energy and the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center. 
Still, several supercomputer experts said that the memory and computing bandwidth limitations of the PlayStation would prohibit broader applications of the machine.
Gordon Bell, a Microsoft computer scientist and a veteran of the supercomputer world, said the PlayStation supercomputer might find its best application as a computer for the large digital display walls that are used by the Defense Department.
Dr. Bell awards annual computing prizes that include a category for the best price/performance in high performance computing. "They should enter my contest," he said.
The supercomputing center scientists said they had chosen the PlayStation 2 because Sony sells a special Linux module that includes a high-speed network connection and a disk drive.
By contrast, it is almost impossible for researchers to install the Linux system on Microsoft's Xbox game console. 
Using a network of machines is not a new concept in the supercomputing world. Linux, which plays a major role in that world, has been used to assemble high-performance parallel computers built largely out of commodity hardware components. These machines are generally called Beowulf clusters.

HEADLINE: MEDIA; 
Easier Rules May Not Mean More Newspaper-TV Deals

BYLINE:  By JACQUES STEINBERG and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
For all the efforts by media companies to persuade the Federal Communications Commission to loosen its restrictions on media consolidation, few are expected to go on immediate spending sprees once the proposed rule changes are enacted, as anticipated, on June 2.
 The conventional wisdom has predicted a rash of deals after the commission implements the rules, which include lifting the ban on owning a newspaper and a television station in the same market, as well as relaxing the criteria allowing broadcasters to own two or more local stations. 
 Under this thinking, newspaper companies would snap up television stations, and companies with deep holdings in broadcast television stations would do likewise with newspapers. And broadcasters would move to buy more stations in their current markets.
But interviews in recent days with senior executives and investment bankers of the media companies indicate that the short-term impact on cross-ownership deals may be far less than some envision. 
While Media General and the Tribune Company said they intend to pursue such arrangements aggressively, other companies, including Gannett and the Belo Corporation, are expressing more caution. And the News Corporation, the Walt Disney Company and Viacom are not expected to buy newspapers in markets where they already own stations.
"I don't think there will be an avalanche of deals immediately," said Gary B. Pruitt, chairman and chief executive of the McClatchy Company, which owns 11 daily newspapers, including The Sacramento Bee and The Star Tribune in Minneapolis. "We're not sure empirically it's been proven there are substantial operating advantages or economies of scale."
Some of the speculation of merger mania could be driven by the wishful thinking of bankers and newspaper brokers.
"There is a belief on the part of some people in the financial community that there are tremendous efficiencies and revenue opportunities associated with any cross-ownership," said Robert W. Decherd, chairman and chief executive of Belo, a media company that owns several newspapers, including The Dallas Morning News, as well as WFAA, the ABC affiliate in Dallas. "That is just not correct."
Some media companies already own newspapers and television stations in the same market -- the Tribune Company owns The Los Angeles Times and KTLA in Los Angeles; Media General owns The Tampa Tribune and WFLA in Florida -- as a result of waivers previously granted by the commission. But conclusive proof that such so-called cross-ownership leads to better financial performance does not yet exist.
The chief financial advantage of such arrangements, at least in theory, is that they enable media companies to cut costs by sharing news-gathering expenses while offering advertisers cross-media deals. But as Belo and other pioneers have learned, some local advertisers -- like supermarkets and shopping centers -- may not be able to afford to turn a relatively modest print campaign into what could be an expensive television spot, nor do they always see the strategic value of doing so. And when they do, they often demand a sizable discount.
"Advertisers who tend to use newspapers seem to be pretty exclusive from the TV list of advertisers or the radio list of advertisers," said Jon Mandel, co-chief executive officer of MediaCom, the media services company of the Grey Global Group, which buys advertising on behalf of Warner Brothers films and Subway Restaurants. "All of these F.C.C. regulations that all these companies want don't necessarily do anything to increase the companies' revenues."
There is also the matter of economics. Some companies that only own newspapers, like McClatchy, are concerned that television stations are too expensive to buy. And some companies that predominantly own television stations, like Disney, believe the newspaper industry is in decline.
The companies that are operating, or contemplating operating, a newspaper and television station jointly "may indeed crack the code," said Mr. Pruitt of McClatchy. "Until then, we're not going to be leading the charge."
Which is not to say that there are not companies planning to make acquisitions and trades. While most, including Belo, say that they expect some targeted deals in specific markets, Media General of Richmond, Va., has bolder plans.
"Any of the places where we have a newspaper, we'd like to have a TV station," said J. Stewart Bryan III, the chairman and chief executive of Media General, which owns more than four dozen newspapers and television stations, including The Tampa Tribune and that city's WFLA. "Any of the places we have a TV station, we'd like to have a newspaper."
Media General says it would like to buy television stations in the Richmond and Winston-Salem, N.C., areas, where it owns The Richmond Times-Dispatch and The Winston-Salem Journal. The company, which has some of the longest experience with such partnerships -- in addition to its holdings in Tampa, it owns at least one television station and newspaper in each of five smaller markets -- believes there is money to be made as a result of cross-ownership.
In Tampa, for example, Mr. Bryan estimates that the average annual revenue at The Tribune and WFLA increased about 2 percent, or about $5 million, in recent years as a result of strategies like dual advertising programs and the cross-promotion of the journalistic offerings of one medium on the other.
The cooperation among Media General's Tampa holdings could be a model of news gathering in the future. The religion editor for The Tampa Tribune doubles as the religion editor for WFLA, for example, and the sports departments of both have been combined. Moreover, the paper's city editor, the station's assignment editor and a top Web site administrator all sit at a universal news desk, where information can be shared.
"We're trying to provide better local journalism which will produce greater numbers of readers, greater numbers of viewers and greater numbers of users of our Web site," Mr. Bryan said. "If we get greater users, we can raise our ad rates."
Mr. Mandel, the media buyer, said he believes that if there is a financial incentive for combining a newspaper and television station, it is on the journalism side.
"What it is going to do is enable them to cut their costs -- their newsroom costs," he said.
And yet, it is not clear that such arrangements, whatever the news-gathering advantage, lead to true savings. Many media outlets, for example, are governed by union contracts that preclude such job-sharing without additional payments. So far at the Tribune and WFAA, no one on the news side has been laid off as a result of these arrangements and, said Mr. Bryan, "the staff is at least as large as it was" before.
"We don't do any of this for saving," said Mr. Bryan. "We do it for increasing revenue."
But the relatively small increase in revenue that Media General ascribes to cross-ownership is not likely to be enough to draw broadcasters like Viacom and Disney into the newspaper business. (Disney actually sold four newspapers, including The Kansas City Star and The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, in 1997, after its acquisition of Capital Cities/ABC.) Instead, analysts and bankers predict, companies like Viacom and Disney, and others, would be more likely to buy additional stations in markets in which they already have holdings or to swap stations, primarily for tax purposes.
"The most practical outcome in the near term is station swapping," said Douglas M. Arthur, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.
Nonetheless, Mr. Arthur said, investors are skeptical that many stations will be bought. "The small TV stocks don't trade like they are on the market," Mr. Arthur said, explaining that the stocks of companies like Paxson Communications and the Sinclair Broadcast Group would be higher if they were deemed takeover targets.
Nor is a relaxing of the rules expected to further tempt Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, whose ownership of the New York Post and WNYW, the Fox affiliate in New York City, is considered an early template of cross ownership.
Last week, Mr. Murdoch told a Congressional hearing that he had no plans to acquire additional stations or newspapers. Mr. Murdoch made those comments in the context of trying to persuade lawmakers to allow his company to buy control of the nation's largest satellite company, DirecTV, and its parent, Hughes Electronics, from General Motors.

Here is a look at overlapping operations for some of the biggest newspaper groups and station owners in the nation's 60 largest markets.

HEADLINE: THE SARS EPIDEMIC: THE RESEARCHERS; 
Global Collaboration Bears Fruit As SARS Gives Up Some Secrets

BYLINE:  By DENISE GRADY and LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN

 BODY:
There are biohazard signs on the doors and airflow systems designed to keep viruses from wafting out of laboratories. In one laboratory, a researcher wears gloves, gown and mask. In another, the dress code is a full spacesuit with its own air supply. A visitor, allowed to peer in through glass panels, is warned, only half jokingly, never to shake hands with anyone here who is wearing latex gloves.
 This is Building 15, home of the special pathogens branch of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. 
 The most feared diseases, caused by deadly, highly contagious viruses, are studied in this building. Hemorrhagic fevers like Ebola and Lassa qualify; malaria and hepatitis do not. 
Early in the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, when it was still being called a mystery disease, it became apparent that the microbe causing it was acting like what the C.D.C. terms a special pathogen: flashing through hospitals, swiftly cutting down scores of health workers, killing an alarming number of victims. Whatever this germ was, it belonged in Building 15.
If infectious disease experts have a worst nightmare, it is that a new, very contagious disease with a high death rate reaches an international airline hub -- a place like Hong Kong, for instance -- and hops to other countries before anyone even notices it. That is precisely what SARS has done. 
The potential of SARS to seed itself rapidly around the world and touch off a chain reaction of deadly epidemics galvanized the World Health Organization to start an international collaboration to identify the cause of the disease and to try to develop ways to diagnose, contain, treat and prevent it.
The effort got results, and with extraordinary speed.
The investigation has ranged from universities and besieged hospitals to live-animal markets in southern China to high-tech genetics laboratories and the sprawling C.D.C. complex.
When SARS emerged, many laboratories and infectious disease experts, in the aftermath of the anthrax attacks of 2001, were already in a heightened state of alert and on the lookout for unusual diseases. 
SARS first came to the world's attention in mid-March, and only a week later, scientists isolated the virus that appeared to be causing it. A few weeks after that, two teams decoded the viral genome, providing information that could help to develop diagnostic tests, vaccines and antiviral drugs and to find out where the virus came from. Last week, scientists pinpointed a possible source of SARS -- civets, badgers and raccoon dogs being sold for meat in China's Guangdong Province -- and were able to compare the gene sequence of the animal virus with the one found in people.
But the campaign had to begin with a simple, essential question: what exactly was causing SARS?

A Surprising Find
Before the world learned about SARS, specimens from infected patients were hard to come by. Some international shippers balked at handling them. 
In a hospital in Vietnam, where autopsies are frowned upon, it took delicate negotiations for a pathologist to get permission to remove lung tissue from a patient who had died.
Finally, in the first half of March, specimens packed in dry ice began to arrive at the special pathogens branch from Hong Kong, Thailand and Vietnam -- vials of blood, sputum, lung and throat washings, bits of tissue.
Researchers hoped that the specimens, dropped into cell cultures and injected into baby mice, would grow enough virus or bacteria to let them identify the cause of the new disease.
On March 18, researchers noticed that something was happening in a flask of cells that had been seeded with a sample from the throat of a patient. The flask contained a culture of monkey kidney cells, known as Vero cells, which are fertile ground for certain viruses. Clear zones had begun to form, meaning that something was killing the Vero cells.
"That's a sign something is growing," said Dr. Thomas G. Ksiazek, chief of the special pathogens branch. "Then you need to find out, well, what is this?"
The next step was to process the contents of that flask so that they could be looked at with an electron microscope. On Friday morning, March 21, an electron microscopist named Cynthia Goldsmith examined a type of sample, called a thin section, of infected cells that were magnified about 14,000 times.
Almost immediately, telltale features stood out: black, beadlike dots of genetic material inside spherical viruses, the distinctive way the viruses lined up along the cell surface and the region where they clustered inside the cells, a structure called the endoplasmic reticulum.
"My first reaction was coronavirus," Ms. Goldsmith said.
It took her by surprise, she said. Although coronaviruses made animals very sick, in people they were known to cause only colds and gut trouble, not serious diseases like pneumonia. They had not even been mentioned as a possible culprit in SARS. And most did not even grow in Vero cells.
Ms. Goldsmith spent the next 20 or 30 minutes examining more cells, thinking about whether she might be mistaken and looking at images of other coronaviruses for comparison.
At 12:11 p.m., she sent her supervisor, Dr. Sherif R. Zaki, an e-mail message saying that she could not believe it herself but she was looking at a coronavirus.
Ms. Goldsmith and Dr. Zaki met with other C.D.C. scientists that afternoon. The microscope image, all agreed, was just the beginning.
"We have a coronavirus," Dr. Ksiazek said. "So what?"
Finding the virus in a sample did not prove that it caused the disease. Other tests were needed to verify that it was indeed a coronavirus, determine which coronavirus it was, see whether it turned up in other patients with SARS and whether it could cause the same disease if given to test animals. 
One way to get clues about the identity of an unknown virus is to expose it to antibodies, proteins made by animals to fight off specific viral infections. If the unknown virus matches a particular antibody, they will stick together, and dyes will detect them. 
When pathologists at the disease centers learned that Ms. Goldsmith had found a coronavirus, they tested SARS virus samples against 35 to 40 different coronavirus antibodies. 
Antibodies from pigs and people gave positive tests. But by far the strongest reaction was to a coronavirus antibody from cats. 
"That doesn't mean SARS comes from a cat," said Dr. Wun-Ju Shieh, a member of the pathology team. 
Indeed, last week, researchers in Hong Kong said they had found a virus nearly identical to the SARS virus in other animals, civets, badgers and raccoon dogs in the market stalls of China's Guangdong Province.

Confirming a Theory
At the University of California at San Francisco, Dr. Joseph DeRisi, an assistant professor of biochemistry and biophysics, could not wait to get his hands on virus samples from the disease centers.
"We literally begged the C.D.C.," Dr. DeRisi said. "We were salivating."
On Saturday, March 22, he got his samples, the day after Ms. Goldsmith had made the preliminary identification of a coronavirus. 
Dr. DeRisi and his colleagues were eager to see ifthey, too, could identify the SARS virus with a tool they had created, a DNA chip or microarray. The chip is essentially a microscope slide spotted with gene fragments from 1,000 viruses. If a sample being tested has a stretch of genetic material that matches one on the slide, it will stick to that spot and light up when the slide is put into a scanning device.
The array of spots is then displayed on a computer screen, and sliding a cursor over any spot brings up the name of the virus whose DNA made the spot. 
By Sunday morning, Dr. DeRisi and Dr. David Wang had found several lit-up spots on their microarray. Within a few hours, they felt sure that the samples they had been sent were a coronavirus. It had genetic similarities to three coronaviruses that infect birds, cows and people, but it was not identical to any of them. In fact, it was not any known coronavirus.
"We thought it was a completely new coronavirus, between bird and animal viruses," Dr. DeRisi said.
By mid-April, two laboratories had mapped the genome of the SARS virus. First to finish was the British Columbia Cancer Agency in Vancouver followed by the C.D.C. The findings confirmed what initial studies had suggested: the virus was different from any known coronavirus, different enough, in fact, to become the first member of a new grouping of coronaviruses.

A 'Sleepy' Specialty at the Fore
Before SARS, few researchers studied coronaviruses. Known for making chickens cough and giving pigs diarrhea, coronaviruses were not seen as a path to scientific glory. In people they were thought to cause only mild diseases, and many researchers found them unexciting, difficult to grow and generally not worth the bother. Before SARS, one scientist said, coronaviruses were a "sleepy little corner of virology." 
Now, coronavirus experts are eagerly sought by the disease centers and the W.H.O. "Suddenly they're rock stars," said Dr. Donald Ganem, a virologist at the University of California at San Francisco. 
The expert most often named by other researchers is Dr. Kathryn V. Holmes, a professor of microbiology at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver. She has studied coronaviruses for more than 20 years, and is now turning her attention to the one believed to cause SARS.
"I'm doing it because people are sick and I want to help," Dr. Holmes said.
One focus of her research has been investigating how coronaviruses get into cells. All viruses must enter cells to survive because they cannot replicate on their own and need to take over the cell's equipment to make copies of themselves. 
"That's a hijacking step," Dr. Holmes said, adding that one invaded cell can churn out a thousand or more viruses. "It's an incredible assembly line." 
Eventually, the process kills the cell. The question of how viruses penetrate cells is central to understanding viral diseases. It can explain why a virus attacks only certain species and invades certain types of cells. 
"Why is there a coronavirus of chickens, and one of dogs, and one of rats, and why don't they infect each other?" Dr. Holmes asked. "We don't understand how a virus chooses a host, and we understand precious little about how they cause disease." 
It is known that an essential first step is for the virus to lock on to a molecule on the cell surface called a receptor. Cells have receptors of various types that link up with body chemicals like insulin and other hormones. Sometimes a virus happens to have a molecule that can grab a cell's receptors.
"The virus is the opportunist," Dr. Holmes said. "The host is not putting out a receptor to get infected. The receptor has a job of its own, and the cell needs it. But the virus can exploit it."
For coronaviruses, the burglar tools are the spikes that stud the surface of the virus, giving it a crownlike shape on certain types of electron micrographs. The spikes, made of proteins, are what grab onto cell receptors. Each type of coronavirus has a distinct spike protein. If the spike changes, because of a genetic mutation, the virus might, in theory, be able to invade a new host.
"Is it a changed spike, or just a terrible coincidence that somebody got infected with an animal virus, by coming in touch with something that normally nobody comes in touch with?" Dr. Holmes asked. "We know the people getting SARS now are catching it from people, not from being exposed to unusual animals. But where did it come from?"
Weeks before scientists working in China found the animals carrying a virus much like the one linked to SARS, Dr. Holmes had suggested that the disease was probably caused by an animal virus that acquired the ability to infect humans, perhaps because of a changed spike. If that is the case, and if the virus can still infect its original animal host, it may be impossible to eliminate, particularly if the host is a wild animal rather than a domesticated one that can be rounded up and slaughtered. 
But until that is known, Dr. Holmes said, it makes sense to study the SARS spike protein and to try to find its receptor. If a receptor is found, Dr. Holmes said, it may be possible to develop a treatment to keep the virus from getting into cells. 
Finding the origin of SARS, whether it is the civets and other animals or some other host, may also help researchers figure out how the virus evolved and how it found its way into people, Dr. Holmes said. That question extends far beyond SARS, to the larger problem of emerging infectious diseases, a category that includes scores of infections like West Nile encephalitis, hantavirus, Lyme disease and AIDS. 
"What makes these things appear and disappear?" Dr. Holmes asked. "What makes the host-pathogen pair? What makes virulence? People are trying to understand emerging infectious diseases."

Success Is Bittersweet At Food Banks

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
PORTRAIT of a thriving industry: food for the poor.
 The Food Bank for New York City supplies a vast majority of the food provided throughout the five boroughs at programs for feeding the poor. When it was founded in 1983, there were 35 food pantries and kitchens citywide. Today there are 967. 
 The Food Bank started out with a 35,000-square-foot warehouse and distributed 500,000 pounds of food a year. Today it occupies a 100,000-square-foot warehouse in the Hunts Point Market in the Bronx and distributes 61 million pounds of food a year to those 967 kitchens and pantries, and to 200 more community and homeless programs. That does not include Meals on Wheels and other food services for the elderly, or regular school meals. 
Most New Yorkers are probably vaguely aware of food kitchens, which serve hot meals, and food pantries, which distribute bags of groceries. But it is a good bet that the general public does not realize how the food network has mushroomed over 20 years, becoming a nonprofit success story.
It is so successful that it has become what Tyrone Harrysingh, the Food Bank's chief operating officer, calls a "mainstay" for the needy.
"I walked into this building 10 years ago and I was shocked," he said the other day in the Hunts Point warehouse, with its floor-to-ceiling storage bays. "I knew about pantries and kitchens, but I didn't know about this. I remember saying to myself, 'What's going on here?' "
What's going on is that what began as an emergency system has become an unofficial income supplement, compensating for welfare cuts. One pantry director calls it "institutionalized," growing in size, sophistication and effectiveness. 
It benefits not only the poor but also politicians, farmers, food manufacturers and corporate donors, who, under a 1976 change in the tax code, are eligible for enhanced deductions for food donations. It has lobbyists, public relations consultants, marketing specialists and a collection and distribution system coordinated by America's Second Harvest, a national network of 212 food banks with headquarters in Chicago.
Janet E. Poppendieck, a Hunter College sociologist and the author of "Sweet Charity: Emergency Food and the End of Entitlement" (Viking Press, 1998), suggested that growth spurred more growth: "Once a community has a food bank, it's easier to start a food pantry. You knew where to turn. And they had a voice that could appeal to government for support."
COULD, and did. Most of what food banks distribute comes from government, which channels farm surpluses and processed foods to the banks, to the benefit not only of the recipients of the food, but also of American agribusiness.
Only a small fraction of the food in New York's charitable kitchens and pantries comes from nongovernment sources, including private donations, foundations, food drives and City Harvest. Up to 90 percent comes from the Food Bank, which gets 72 percent of its food from government.
The Food Bank's records show that of the 61.5 million pounds of food it distributed last year, more than half -- 33 million pounds -- came from the federal government. City government provided 14 million pounds, food manufacturers like ConAgra and Kraft and produce dealers and processing plants donated 9.5 million pounds, and the rest came from several sources, including the state and food drives.
The industry serves all ideologies. Conservatives can say they cut waste and encouraged private munificence; liberals can say they preserved the safety net. The poor can do what they always do -- adapt by using the programs not just for meals but as an extra stream of income. Reliable statistics are elusive, but advocates say the numbers are growing as New Yorkers hit by the recession and impact of Sept. 11 struggle to make ends meet.
"It calls itself an emergency food system, but is much more a supplemental food system, a necessity," said Jeffrey Ambers, who runs the Yorkville Common Pantry in East Harlem. Use of his pantry is increasing, and other directors report the same.
Need drove the system's growth and made it the entrenched service so many now rely on, suggested Doreen Wohl, head of the West Side Campaign Against Hunger.
If we build it, they will come?
"I have no doubt about it," she said.
Who uses food programs? How do they learn of a system existing below the radar? 
"My friend just told me about this place," a mother of two said as she visited Ms. Wohl's pantry for the first time the other day, a year after losing her job.
Next: The clients.

HEADLINE: The Graduate Works at Starbucks 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In "Get a Job" (Op-Ed, May 19), former Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich says that in a weak economy, an advanced degree may not be the best answer. 
As part of the unemployed class of 2003, I disagree. In astruggling economy, the "opportunity cost" of a graduate education is lower because sacrificed wages are lower. 
 Mr. Reich says the median pay of doctors and lawyers is dropping. Yes, but the median pay of those with four-year degrees is declining even faster. This is why I still plan to go to law school after working one or two years, assuming I can find work.
I have, however, always respected Mr. Reich. So Mr. Reich: Do you need a go-for-coffee guy? I have a B.S. in sociology and a B.A. in economics, and I've memorized the entire Starbucks menu.

To the Editor:
 As a recent college graduate, I was disheartened to see Robert B. Reich, a former secretary of labor and a man whom I admire deeply, appear to be so out of touch with the lives and employment prospects of young Americans (Op-Ed, May 19). 
 During the worst hiring slump in two decades, it is unrealistic to suggest that recent college graduates take a gofer job to gain experience. These entry-level jobs were among the first to be eliminated when the economy soured, and they have yet to return.
As for unpaid internships, the average graduate of a four-year college has $18,900 in debt. Working for no wages is not an option many can afford.

HEADLINE: Some Firehouses Go Quietly, Some With Rage 

BYLINE:  By COREY KILGANNON 

 BODY:
At Engine Company 204 in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, the police used two vans to cart away 12 protesters who had invaded the firehouse to keep it alive. At Engine Company 212 in Williamsburg, protesters rushed in and jammed pieces of lumber to prop open the door. One man chained himself to the bumper of the fire truck, and others sat down in front of it. Eight people were arrested.
 After months of debate and legal battles, the city closed six fire companies yesterday in Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan. Several of the closings went smoothly, although bitterness and sadness lingered outside the buildings' front doors. But confrontations in Harlem and Brooklyn exposed emotions so raw that their intensity surprised the police officers and fire officials on hand to keep order on the overcast Sunday morning. 
 The six companies -- four in Brooklyn, one in Manhattan and one in Queens -- had been ordered to close down and cease responding to radio calls at 0900 hours, or 9 a.m. The city had long argued that in these six cases, other fire companies nearby could respond to emergencies just as quickly, and the overlap of coverage was too expensive in such perilous financial times.
There were hugs, tears and somber goodbyes among residents and firefighters at the firehouses where the order was quietly followed. At Engine Company 209 in Bedford-Stuyvesant, the closing barely interrupted the firefighters' morning coffee and treadmill workouts.
At Engine Company 36 in East Harlem, however, protesters chanted angrily. Waving banners reading "They Go, We Die," they lined up in front of the house and blocked firefighters from parking the fire truck inside.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, speaking to reporters in Forest Hills, Queens, reiterated his contention that the closings would not pose a safety threat to local residents. He said that all of the firefighters were being reassigned and that the six companies had been chosen carefully by fire chiefs because "all of them are reasonably close to other firehouses."
These were the first firehouse closings in the city in more than a decade, and the mayor faced political opposition, lawsuits and no small criticism over them. But the mayor, who was lightly booed at two Memorial Day parades yesterday in Queens, has maintained that this is a politically tough but necessary measure to balance the city's budget.
Closing firehouses has never been easy. In 1991, four days after Mayor David N. Dinkins ordered the controversial closing of Engine Company 294, in Richmond Hill, Queens, two brothers died in a house fire nine blocks away. Rudolph W. Giuliani seized on the issue when he ran against Mr. Dinkins for mayor in 1993, and reopened the firehouse shortly after he became mayor.
On Saturday, a man rammed a white van into the front doors of four firehouses in Brooklyn. One firehouse door was jammed shut, preventing firefighters from responding to two calls. None of those firehouses were among the ones scheduled to be closed.
As of yesterday, officials had not found the driver or speculated on his motive. But there was talk among firefighters that the incident could have been an attempt to keep the city from closing the four Brooklyn firehouses by disabling others that would assume their duties.
The 20 people who were arrested yesterday were charged with criminal trespassing and disorderly conduct, said Firefighter Robert Calise, a spokesman for the department.
At the firehouses that drew protests, demonstrators began arriving before 8 a.m., carrying coffee cups, waving signs and pushing baby strollers.
About 200 people gathered outside Engine Company 204 in Cobble Hill. There were parents, politicians, activists. There was a Sept. 11 widow, and there was the actor Steve Buscemi, a former city firefighter who lives in Brooklyn.
A handful of demonstrators began to voice outrage that the firehouse was being closed. Others put down their coffee and began chanting along. Speakers began lambasting Mr. Bloomberg's decision, and the gathering grew heated. Just before 9 a.m., protesters linked arms in front of the building, preventing the firefighters from leaving. A fire captain from the house, Brenda Berkman, stuck her head out a window and joined in the criticism of the mayor.
By 11:15, the protesters were storming the firehouse and opening the large door so others could enter. Just after noon, police officers arrived and began making arrests.
At Engine Company 212 in Williamsburg, there were about 100 protesters by 8 a.m., chanting in English, Polish and Spanish and setting up sidewalk barbecues to grill hamburgers. Two conga drummers arrived and began beating out rhythms.
Suddenly, Paul Veneski, 38, of Williamsburg, an unemployed truck driver, slipped into the firehouse through an open cellar door and opened the garage's large red door. Other protesters -- among them Bronislawa Hupalo, a rail-thin 80-year-old -- charged in and struggled to jam it open with discarded lumber. .
Mr. Veneski then chained himself to the fire truck. His 12-year-old daughter, Jennifer, cheered him on. Later in the three-hour standoff, she offered her father hamburgers through a small space in the door.
Apparently, trying to save firehouses runs in the Veneski family. Mr. Veneski's father, Adam Veneski, a local grocer, stormed this very firehouse when it was threatened with closing in 1975, the family said.
At Engine Company 36 in East Harlem, about a dozen protesters chanted against the closing. A sarcastic "For Rent" sign on the door listed some of the building's assets: "Eat-In Kitchen, Covered Parking, Sliding Pole."
Although unhappy to see them go, the protesters cheered the firefighters as they carried out their gear.
Lee Decker, 35, a firefighter with Engine 36, said that many firefighters from the company, both active and retired, spent the night at the house, rehashing memories and deciding who would keep communal possessions bought with their own money, including a washer-dryer, dishwasher, refrigerators, couches, televisions, stereos, VCR's and an extensive collection of exercise equipment.
"They're breaking up a big family here," Firefighter Decker said.
In Sunset Park, Brooklyn, a small group of teary-eyed firefighters and residents gathered outside Engine Company 278 at 9 a.m., not so much in protest as in resignation. As they hugged each other, Brian Horan, 48, of Sunset Park, a 13-year veteran with the company, loaded his belongings into his car.
"I think it's a disgrace to the members of the force who died in 9/11," he said. "It's a slap in their face."
The scene yesterday seemed just as poignant at Engine Company 261 in Long Island City, Queens. It shared a firehouse with Ladder Company 116, so the house itself would be staying open. 
At 8:30 a.m., a handful of firefighters there sat dolefully on the bumper of their truck and listened to local Democratic elected officials criticizing Mr. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki for cuts in financing.
At 9 a.m., Deputy Fire Chief John Acerno conducted a somber roll call, saluting their efforts and "dedication, loyalty and many sacrifices."
By the end, some firefighters were in tears.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: PETROLEUM INDUSTRY; 
Iraq Will Control Its Oil, Iraqi Official Asserts

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, May 25 

 BODY:
Three days after the United Nations gave the United States and Britain broad authority to govern Iraq, the interim head of the Iraqi Oil Ministry stated today in some of his strongest terms yet that Iraqis controlled the country's oil riches and would continue to do so in the future.
 Iraqi oil production has sharply increased in the last two weeks, and the country will start exporting by mid-June, said the official, Thamir Ghadhban. He credited the work of Iraqi engineers and technicians who still face difficult conditions like poor telecommunications and haphazard security. 
 Mr. Ghadhban said Iraqis would determine if and when contracts would be awarded to foreign companies to repair some of the long-term damage to oil wells and reservoirs caused by the lack of spare parts for maintenance under 12 years of sanctions. 
He also indicated that the Iraqi Oil Ministry would review contracts signed by Saddam Hussein's government with foreign oil companies to develop new fields to see if they should proceed. 
"Any contract will be dealt with on its merits and in due time," Mr. Ghadhban said during an interview today at the Oil Ministry. "We will open the door for foreign investment, but according to a formula that safeguards the interests of the Iraqi people. It will still be a win-win for both sides."
The contracts already given to American companies focus primarily on helping with shorter-term repairs of war-related damage and are unlikely to come up for review. 
The fast work the Iraqis have made of reviving oil fields whose offices and equipment were ravaged by looting did not surprise industry analysts, who have historically praised the competence of the country's oil technocrats. But some remained skeptical, believing that despite Mr. Ghadhban's intentions, the real power in Iraq rests with the United States-led civil administration.
"The Security Council resolution is quite clear: Iraq is under occupation, and there is no government, no ministries," said Walid Khadduri, editor in chief of the Middle East Economic Survey, a weekly newsletter based in Cyprus that specializes in the oil industry. "The Iraqi technocrats will manage on a day-to-day basis but the policy will be American, because there is no sovereign Iraq."
Mr. Ghadhban tried to douse persistent speculation that Iraq would leave the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries under pressure from an American administration that would want the country to pump as much oil as possible to drive down prices. However, he indicated that within OPEC, Iraq might produce oil without a quota set by the cartel, because it was exempted from the quota system in 1996 when the United Nations began to set Iraqi export levels under the oil-for-food program. 
Industry analysts have previously noted that when Iraq's oil exports were limited by penalties, especially during the five years before the oil-for-food program, and the country was not exporting oil at all, other OPEC members picked up the slack -- and Iraq's market share. Now, OPEC will have to cope with Iraq's desire to get that share back as it repairs its oil industry, those analysts have said. 
OPEC members will meet in Doha, Qatar, on June 11, but so far, Iraq does not plan to send a delegation, Mr. Ghadhban said. "To send a delegation to a meeting, there are procedures -- contacts between the members and the secretariat, a formal invitation," he said. "As far as we're concerned, we haven't seen any of these formalities toward us."
Mr. Ghadhban said Iraq should reach its prewar production levels of about three million barrels a day by the end of the year. Outside experts say that production was closer to 2.7 million barrels.
Flowing in a trickle during the first six weeks after the war, Iraqi oil production has risen to about 800,000 barrels a day, up from fewer than 300,000 barrels a day two weeks ago, Mr. Ghadhban said. Most of that, or about 600,000 barrels a day, is coming from the vast but badly looted northern Kirkuk field, he said. 
Mr. Ghadhban said that while security was still a problem across the oil sector, Kirkuk would increase production to 800,000 barrels a day by mid-June. 
The Rumaila field in the south, which produced more oil than Kirkuk before the war, is pumping about 200,000 barrels a day now, its enormous potential throttled by the looting of an industrial water plant needed for oil extraction. But Mr. Ghadhban said the field would soon come back on stream with new equipment for the water plant being provided by Kellogg Brown & Root, a unit of Halliburton, which has the Pentagon contract for short-term oil field repair. 
He predicted Rumaila would be producing about 500,000 barrels a day by the middle of next month.
All told, Mr. Ghadhban said he expected Iraq to be pumping about 1.4 million barrels a day by mid-June, a million barrels of which would be exported. Under the new Security Council resolution ending the penalties, proceeds from Iraqi oil exports would go into a development fund for the country that would be administered by the occupation authority led by the United States. 
But many hurdles stand in the way of the resumption of exports, Mr. Khadduri said, mainly security concerns and the near-absence of telephone service after the American bombing of the country's telephone exchange. "They have to be able to connect with each other, from the fields to Baghdad, the ports, SOMO," he said, referring to the State Oil Marketing Organization. "They have to be able to contact customers, who have to be able to open letters of credit."
Mr. Khadduri added: "I think they will issue instructions soon on all this. But how do you open a letter of credit with the Central Bank? What would the fax number be there now? And who would be there to receive it?"

HEADLINE: All of New York's a Stage for the G.O.P. Convention 

BYLINE:  By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

 BODY:
Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty are being considered for possible events or backdrops to festivities. There is also talk of forgoing elaborate stages in favor of something more down to earth at the convention hall, Madison Square Garden.
 But on a more sensitive matter, what, if anything, to do at or near ground zero has not been decided. 
 With 15 months to go before the Republican National Convention draws an expected 50,000 people to New York City, local and national officials, working closely with the White House, are drawing up plans to create an impressive showcase -- incorporating New York icons -- for the renomination of President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney. 
City officials see the convention, the first the Republicans have held in New York, as the city's biggest coming-out party since the terrorist attack on Sept. 11, 2001. Many also see the success of the Republican convention, to be held from Aug. 30 to Sept. 2, 2004, as a boost to the city's efforts to bring other big events to New York, especially the 2012 Olympics.
For the Republicans, the event is an opportunity for Mr. Bush both to highlight his strengths as a leader in a terrorist-threatened world and to broaden his appeal. By coming to New York, the president stakes a claim in a traditionally Democratic state that has not voted for a Republican for president since Ronald Reagan in 1984.
Though their goals may not always appear in synch, the party and city officials planning the convention portray the event and their willingness to work on it as a marriage of opportunities. 
"In a way that is different from the Republican National Committee, it is an opportunity to work for the renomination of a man who I greatly admire and at the same time work to enhance the luster of the Big Apple," said Lewis M. Eisenberg, who stepped down as finance chairman for the national party to help the city raise money for the convention.
But even as they think big, conceptual thoughts, much of the activity at this early stage is focused on a basic challenge at hand: raising $63 million in cash and in-kind services from private sources to help finance the convention's $91 million cost.
For that task, the Republicans have chosen one of their most prodigious fund-raisers, Mr. Eisenberg, who is also helping to lead the New York City Host Committee. The host committee, whose chairman is former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, organizes welcoming receptions, hospitality events, transportation, security and other activities outside the convention hall.
"It's a daunting amount of money to raise from the private sector," said Mr. Eisenberg, the former executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and a founder of an investment management firm.
Mr. Eisenberg, who has raised more than $135 million for the party, declined to release any figures, but said the fund-raising was going well, despite the weakened economy. 
To raise the $63 million, the committee will tap thousands of individual donors as well as 1,000 or so corporations with ties to New York. The rest of the budget will come from public sources to cover expenses for police, fire and other city services. The city plans to ask the federal government to reimburse such costs, given the presence of Mr. Bush.
Mr. Eisenberg is working closely with Mark Miller, the former deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Committee who is serving as deputy chairman of the host committee, and Cathy Blaney and Thomas Doherty, Republican fund-raisers in New York who have worked for Gov. George E. Pataki, and other politicians.
The host committee officials said they wanted to emulate the success of the 1992 Democratic convention in New York, the last presidential nominating convention held here.
Promotions like Restaurant Week, offering heavily discounted lunches and dinners, and the Broadway on Broadway free concert made their debut during that convention, and host committee officials said they were searching for similar ideas to make the convention memorable and provide lasting economic benefits.
Indeed, city officials tend to speak of the convention mainly in terms of its anticipated economic benefits.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg appointed Harvey W. Schiller, who has a long track record in the sports and entertainment business, as president of the Host Committee to handle the day-to-day operations.
Mr. Schiller, who has not been active in Republican Party affairs,also has served as a chairman for NYC 2012, the group promoting the city for the Olympics, and he is a former executive director of the United States Olympic Committee. He and other city officials acknowledge that they are under some pressure to ensure a successful, memorable convention in part as a selling point for large events like the Olympics.
Mr. Schiller, noting the city's track record of parades and sporting events, said "every one of those becomes an indicator of your ability to carry on events." But, he added, "this is not a vehicle" for the Olympics drive.
Mr. Schiller said he would work closely with the Republican National Committee's Committee on Arrangements, the arm of the party that puts on the convention and carries out planning for the program inside the hall, under close direction from the White House.
David A. Norcross, a Republican National committeeman from New Jersey, is the chairman of the arrangements committee, and William D. Harris, a Washington consultant who has worked behind the scenes at several conventions, is the chief executive officer, essentially the party's convention manager.
Mr. Norcross, who is entertaining the possibility of some events across the river in New Jersey, and others involved in planning said they were brainstorming ideas to make the staging in the Garden more creative than in years past. 
"In both parties, we have gotten sort of majestic in the podiums," Mr. Norcross said, implying that the party may be looking to simplify the look this year. Other planners have suggested the party may incorporate Ellis Island, the Statue of Liberty and other New York icons into the program.
"We are going to try to do events that celebrate New York's melting pot heritage," Mr. Norcross said.
Republican leaders in New York have pushed the idea that Mr. Bush could win the state. Aside from the hoopla of the convention, they point to the political success of his fellow Republicans, Mr. Pataki and Mr. Bloomberg, and Mr. Bush's high approval ratings in opinion polls.
But convention planners said right now they were mainly focused on getting the Garden in shape and setting up all the hoopla around it.
Said Mr. Schiller: "New York has a wonderful history of meeting every promise that is made."

HEADLINE: White House Letter; 
Drilling for Oil or Selling Tax Cuts, Texas Pals Are Still Sharing Adventures

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Donald L. Evans, the commerce secretary, who also happens to be President Bush's best friend in Washington, was sitting late last week in a corner of his colossal cabinet member's suite, an expanse even bigger than the Oval Office, recounting the wild old days of the 1970's when he and Mr. Bush had just moved to Midland, Tex., and were trying to make their fortunes in oil. 
 Mr. Evans was married to one of Mr. Bush's first-grade classmates, Susie, but the future president was still the unattached bad-boy son of West Texas aristocracy. 
 "He would bring his dirty clothes over to our house and my wife would wash them," Mr. Evans recalled in his grand surroundings, smiling at the memory. There were also barbecues and cocktails and, of course, the hunt for oil. "Yeah, we were drilling a few dry holes together," Mr. Evans said.
Nearly a quarter-century later, with most of those years spent at Mr. Bush's side, Mr. Evans has become the improbable anchor of the president's economic team, the one remaining player in a motley cast that keeps changing.
Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the White House budget director, is the latest to depart, most likely to run for governor of Indiana. Mr. Daniels went willingly, but Paul H. O'Neill, the Treasury secretary, and Lawrence B. Lindsey, the director of the National Economic Council, were jettisoned in December for losing the confidence of Republicans, Democrats and Wall Street. R. Glenn Hubbard resigned in February as chairman of the White House Economic Council. 
That now leaves Stephen Friedman, Mr. Lindsey's replacement, who has so far kept his head down, and John W. Snow, the new Treasury secretary, who has recently drawn criticism in financial circles for shrugging off a decline in the dollar. Neither, it is safe to say, has emerged as the administration's chief spokesman on the struggling economy, the issue on which Mr. Bush's political fortunes turn.
So that leaves Mr. Evans, the smooth, silver-haired first friend. Although business leaders have long said that Mr. Evans does not have the stature or the portfolio to be the economic voice of the administration, he was without question the chief salesman of the $350 billion package of tax cuts and state aid that Congress finally approved last Friday. 
From Jan. 7, the day that Mr. Bush announced his economic plan, to now, Mr. Evans, by his count, traveled to 19 states and 33 cities to talk up tax cuts. He also gave 81 interviews to reporters, held 21 news conferences and met with 7 newspaper editorial boards. Not least, he made contact with 128 members of Congress, either in Washington or their districts. 
"I talked to people all across America, the workers, and the small-business owners and the managers and the families," Mr. Evans said. "And once you had time to sit down and explain the bill to them, they all said, 'I'm for it, I like it.' " Then he added, as if he might be able to say it in his sleep: "First of all, it's all about jobs. Why is it all about jobs? Because jobs are central to the American dream. When you really boil it all down, you're trying to provide a paycheck for somebody that wants to provide for the needs of their family."
Mr. Evans, 56, is never, ever off message, and with his deep, mellifluous Texas voice sometimes seems to hypnotize, or sedate, his listeners. He has never, as far as anyone knows, said anything that could embarrass the White House or upset Wall Street, making him nearly unique among the president's economic advisers. He is also the one among them who is most like Mr. Bush in background and outlook, and who remains an utterly loyal friend.
Mr. Evans was with Mr. Bush during the president's hard-drinking Midland days, and he was with him the weekend in 1986 at the Broadmoor Hotel in Colorado Springs where the president decided after one last hangover to give up alcohol. Mr. Evans plays down any role he had in Mr. Bush's transformation.
"It's a two-way street, you know," Mr. Evans said. "Great friends through life, they share with each other, they work with each other. He helped me through a lot more than I helped him through, I'll say that." Mr. Evans has said in earlier interviews that the Bushes were an enormous source of support when his second daughter, who is mentally retarded, was born.
Mr. Evans grew up in Houston, the son of a Shell Oil executive, then got a degree in mechanical engineering and a master's in business administration from the University of Texas. He then moved to Midland in 1975, the same year as Mr. Bush. Although Mr. Bush was not particularly successful in the oil business, Mr. Evans was. He became the chairman and chief executive of Tom Brown Inc., a Midland oil and gas company. In 2000, Mr. Evans was the chairman and chief fund-raiser of Mr. Bush's presidential campaign, a job he says he will not take up again in 2004. He said he would remain at the Commerce Department, through what Republicans said on Friday would be more rounds of tax cuts.
Mr. Evans said he did not see Mr. Bush as often as he had when they lived in Midland. But he and his wife did have the Bushes over for dinner at their home in McLean, Va., a few Sundays ago. "It was nice, George and Laura, the president and Laura, and we cooked some hamburgers in the backyard," Mr. Evans said. "And we reminisced some about cooking hamburgers in the backyard in Midland, Texas."

Democrats Are Seeking More Focus and Money
Democrats lack unity, a coherent message and enough money to compete with the Republican Party. Though immediate attention may focus on the 2004 presidential election, which Democrats could win if the economy remains sluggish and voters blame President Bush, a victory would not necessarily reverse their long-run decline. A1

More Veterans Memorialized
The names of six men, newly inscribed on the the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, will be commemorated at Memorial Day services. The wall bears the names of 58,235 men and women who were killed in Vietnam or remain missing in action. Since 1982, when the memorial was dedicated, 296 names have been added. A1

HEADLINE: Democrats Seek a Stronger Focus, and Money 

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER

DATELINE: SANTA FE, N.M. 

 BODY:
Democrats from the West came here in mid-May to share political hopes and fears and to reassure one another that despite President Bush's popularity, their party has a future.
 Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, one of the party's handful of big winners last fall, said Democrats had to "develop a strong economic message" and "a strong national security message." Mr. Richardson said the security message had to make it clear that "if we need to use force, we do it." 
 But other Democrats at the meeting of the Western caucus of the Democratic National Committee either wanted to focus on what they called the Bush administration's misuse of force, or to attack the president personally as "the village idiot from Texas," as Julia Hicks, vice chairwoman of the Colorado Democratic Party, put it. 
Like their national counterparts, Western Democrats lack unity, a coherent message and enough money to compete with Republicans. Rachel Virgil-Giron, the New Mexico secretary of state, said, "We don't have the money." 
Karen Marchioro, leader of the caucus, said, "God knows we need help." Such laments are common in the party that once dominated American politics but does so no longer.
Nationally, more people, narrowly, call themselves Democrats than Republicans, and on many domestic issues the public trusts Democrats more than Republicans. The Democrats get about half the votes nationally, and their last presidential candidate actually won more votes than Mr. Bush.
But, however slim their margins, Republicans hold the offices of president, speaker of the House, and Senate majority leader. As George C. Wallace once said, "Close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades." So the Democrats' glass is not half full, but half empty, and it appears to be leaking.
Al From and Bruce Reed of the Democratic Leadership Council, a centrist group that was once the showcase for so-called New Democrats and rising stars like Bill Clinton and Al Gore, recently wrote, "No party ever needed definition, or redefinition, more than the Democratic Party today."
Though immediate attention may focus on the 2004 presidential election, which Democrats could win if the economy remains sluggish and voters blame Mr. Bush, a victory would not necessarily reverse their long-run decline. 
In the midst of another of their periodic painful identity crises, Democrats are composed of an awkward coalition whose clan chiefs have not yet gotten over the idea that power is the Democrats' entitlement and who therefore have not yet learned to sacrifice for the greater good. As Don Fowler, a former national chairman, observed, "Our party has so many disparate points of influence that we can never focus enough to achieve our programs."
They have been inattentive to fund-raising from small donors, especially by direct mail, a situation that has grown desperate now that the unlimited donations known as soft money have been outlawed under the McCain-Feingold law, though the measure is being challenged in court. As Donna Brazile, Al Gore's campaign manager in 2000, said, "Without soft money, the party is in poverty."
The Democrats have generally spent their energy defending past accomplishments, from Social Security to Medicare, rather than seeking to refocus that basic commitment to the middle class and the poor into ideas that reflect how the nation has changed since those laws were passed. President Bill Clinton tried to reframe the party agenda, failing with health care, though succeeding with welfare revision and a few other issues. Still, after his troubles with Monica Lewinsky, he largely gave up and instead pushed small ideas, like school uniforms.
For years, Democrats have focused on the short term, both in mechanics and ideas, concentrating on the issue of the month or the year rather than articulating a clear identity, and preferring to try to rally their own faithful rather than seeking to win over the middle or even chip away at groups now heavily Republican. This approach is all the more glaring when compared with the Republicans' success at planning and financing long-range projects and developing a clearly identified platform showcasing a consistent set of issues over the years.
As Peter Hart, a veteran Democratic pollster, put it: "My biggest problem with the Democratic Party is we think tactically and not strategically -- one election at a time." Mr. Hart said, "We take the issue we can exploit, but we don't take the party and say this is what we are about." The effect, he said, is that "we always seem to be buffeted by what's in the political winds."
A major reason was defined by Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., speaker of the House from 1977 to 1987, when he would say that "in any other country, the Democratic Party would be five parties." He meant it in ideological terms, from very liberal to very conservative. By now the very conservative wing has almost completely deserted to the Republican Party. But the Democrats are still a coalition of interests, notably African-Americans, labor, feminists and all-purpose liberals.
The party suffers when it is blinded to everything but the demand of one faction. Last fall, even though the issue was plainly hurting candidates like Senator Max Cleland, who lost his race in Georgia, Senate Democrats filibustered against the bill to create a Homeland Security Department, insisting it was a matter of principle to defend labor rights that President Bush wanted to curb. But right after the election, they gave up the principle and let the bill pass.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, after retiring as a New York senator and unworried about giving offense, said in an interview a month before he died in March that it was unfortunate that the first time all the Democratic presidential hopefuls got together it was to endorse an abortion rights agenda and not some policy more in tune with reaching out beyond the party base. Defense of the medical procedure that critics call partial-birth abortion, he said, "was not right with the American people."
A veteran Democratic consultant looked at the 2004 presidential field and found it symptomatic of a basic party problem: "Sometimes we're so respectful of our diversity that we take completely preposterous people seriously. We always run the risk of the follies of the absurd when people want seriousness." 
In particular, he said Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio, the Rev. Al Sharpton of New York and former Senator Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois were not real potential nominees but "products of the silly season." He said that because Mr. Sharpton and Ms. Moseley Braun are African-Americans, an essential block for any Democratic victory, white candidates were afraid to criticize them over either their effectiveness or ethics issues.
Mr. Fowler found a ray of consolation. He said that while the party's diverse components limit its ability to attain big majorities, they also mean "you're never going to wipe the Democratic Party out."
The Democrats' minority in the House seems sure to continue through the decade. Redistricting to protect both parties' incumbents has left few battleground seats, and Republican money puts many of them out of Democratic reach. The presidency and majority status among senators and state legislators may be attainable for Democrats, but the party's extreme financial weakness could easily cripple those hopes.
Of course American political history has almost as many examples of revivals from near-death as the Democrats have presidential candidates. Republicans were dismissed as finished after landslide defeats in 1964 and 1974. Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan disproved those expectations. Then in the 1980's the so-called electoral lock was believed to prevent any Democrat from ever winning a majority in the Electoral College. Mr. Clinton disproved that.
And there is at least some evidence of Democratic revival efforts, though hardly any Democrat who appears to be a quick fix. The chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Terry McAuliffe, talks of using computers to "find Democratic voters in those red states" (the ones that television showed going Republican in 2000) and to build a base of small donors. For more than 30 years Democratic chairmen have promised to go after small donors, and then have let it slide. 
But this time the effort seems real, as the national committee is using various commercial lists to find out more about its existing donors and to identify prospects like them. One early return is that e-mail fund-raising, a very inexpensive method, raised $486,000 in the first four months of this year, compared with $115,000 a year ago -- a pittance compared to Republican successes, but still a significant increase.
Other projects include an effort by Governor Richardson to create a political action committee to train Hispanic political operatives and unify Hispanic voters across current divisions of those with Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban or Central-American ancestors. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. has set up the Partnership for America's Families, an institution headed by the federation's former political chief, Steve Rosenthal, to do the on-the-ground organizing that political parties used to do (and Republicans have started to do again) including going house to house to get voters registered and discuss issues.
Another project nearing realization is the creation of a foundation like that of the conservative Heritage research group. The Democrats' organization will be led by John D. Podesta, President Clinton's last chief of staff. In September, Mr. Podesta said he expected to open the tentatively named American Majority Institute as "a think tank that both generates new ideas and provides a hard-hitting and consistent critique of the conservatives."
But Democratic efforts to build a new infrastructure pale next to the layers of affiliated political groups, research groups and like-minded media organs that the Republicans have fortified over the decades, especially since the election of Mr. Reagan as president in 1980. And, as Mr. Hart noted, Democrats are not trying to make inroads into Republican constituencies, like white male conservatives (who gave Mr. Gore only 11 percent of their votes in 2000) the way Republicans are going after African-Americans and Hispanics. On the other hand, Hispanic voters are becoming an ever-larger part of the electorate, and still give Democrats a solid majority of their votes.
If there is one thing all kinds of Democrats agree on, it is that they need a better message. Republicans have a very simple agenda of lower taxes, less government and more defense while Democrats have generalities like being for the little guy and attacking more than they propose.
Robert S. Strauss, the former Democratic national chairman who says Democrats seem to win the White House only on Republican mistakes like Watergate or that of the elder Bush in ignoring the faltering economy, calls last fall's performance on issues disgraceful. 
"We didn't stand for anything," Mr. Strauss said. "We got what we deserved -- nothing."
Will Marshall, an ally of Mr. From and Mr. Reed who leads the Progressive Policy Institute, said the party must "show that we can make progressive government work, not just defend the old New Deal monuments."
Bill Carrick, a more liberal Democratic strategist who is working for the presidential campaign of Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, said his party had "run out of gas." Mr. Carrick said Democrats would continue to fail if they chose to be "the party of incremental reforms, whether it's anything from school uniforms to prescription drugs, to patients' bill of rights." He said, "We've got to make the move away from incremental new reforms to big and broad issues."
There are two major elements of the Democrats' message problem. One is defensive -- on the issue of security. The public strongly prefers Republicans on national defense, and even though most Democrats in Congress backed the war on Iraq, at least a third of the rank and file was unhappy with it, which makes it difficult for party leaders to get too far out in front.
Democrats have argued that the Bush administration is weaker than they are on the other element of security -- domestic defense -- but have made no headway despite the fact that Democrats wanted a department created to coordinate the effort before Mr. Bush would accept it and have urged greater spending on domestic security than the Bush administration would accept.
A more general problem was identified by Governor Richardson. In an interview, he said it was "very vague, but I think it's out there, that we're not the party of optimism and opportunity, that we're the party of malaise, and we're the party of class warfare."
Two Washington academics, who often agree, take different views of the party's future. 
Norman J. Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute says Democrats may have passed a point where "minority status gels and makes it exponentially harder to get back in" because potential candidates and donors see only minority status in their future.
Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution disagrees, seeing parity between the parties as likely for some time. He argues that even the lack of a coherent positive message does not matter too much. "Most decisive elections are a consequence of the public rejecting something," he said. The most effective message, he said, usually is the simple "throw the rascals out."
But Democrats these days lack the killer instinct that it takes to sell blunt, demagogic messages. As Bob Shrum, a prominent consultant for 30 years, said: "It's probably a weakness that we're not real haters. We don't have a sense that it's a holy crusade. We don't have a sense that it's Armageddon."
Or, as Mr. Gore's former campaign manger, Ms. Brazile put it: "They play hardball. We play softball."

DEMOCRATIC VOICES
Identifying With the Party's Traditional Themes

"I think that the Democrats are more for the lower-class people. Didn't Clinton get the deficit down to practically paid for? And where are we now? We're back worse than ever."

LILA CAMPEN
Retired advertising manager, Renton, Wash.

"I think the Democrats look out for the small businesses and the independent businesses. They don't put big corporate America first. Bush's tax cuts all end up rewarding huge corporate America, and he makes a stink that it's the little man that's getting a break. He got a $600 break. That's not a break for a family."

LINDA NECOCHEA
Homemaker, Ojai, Calif.

"I don't consider myself a one-issue voter, but if I had to be, it would be the environment, and maybe that for me is the real difference between the two parties. We all live on this planet and we have to take care of it. There's no guarantee at the present rate that there's going to be a healthy planet a hundred years from now for our children, and our grandchildren, and our great-grandchildren. We have to take care of it now."

SAM ROSENTHAL
Professor of linguistics, Huntington Woods, Mich.

"I've always felt that the Democratic Party was more interested in the little guy. They seem to take all races, feelings and creeds into consideration. The Republicans, on the other hand, seem to favor big business. With the Republicans it's, 'I've got mine, you've got your own.' "

HEADLINE: A CONVERSATION WITH: ARLIE PETTERS; 
A Journey to Bridge Math and the Cosmos

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA DREIFUS 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
Dr. Arlie O. Petters grew up in a quiet corner of Belize, far from the intellectual centers of mathematics and physics and unaware of many of his career possibilities.
 Today, as a United States citizen and the Martin Luther King Jr. visiting professor of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dr. Petters, 39, is building a career bridging the fields of abstract mathematics and astrophysics. 
 He received his bachelor's and master's degrees from Hunter College in New York and his Ph.D. from M.I.T., studying at Princeton and later teaching there. Now, he is on leave from his post in the mathematics department at Duke. 
His book, "Singularity Theory and Gravitational Lensing," written with Dr. Harold Levine and Dr. Joachim Wambsganss, develops a mathematical theory of gravitational lensing, a phenomenon in space that distorts perceptions of stars and galaxies.
On a warm spring afternoon, at his M.I.T. office, Dr. Petters detailed the journey that brought him from the magic realism of rural Central America to the magical realities of cosmology and mathematics.

Q. As a child growing up in Central America, did you look up at the stars and ask big questions about them?

A. Yes, I did exactly that. My town, Dangriga, had no more than 3,000 people and barely any electricity. I studied under a kerosene lamp. There were barely any books.
At night, I'd look up at those stars and for some reason they captured me deeply inside. I'd ask questions like how did the stars get there, what were they? They twinkled; what was that, really? And the vast expanse of it all begged all kinds of philosophical questions.

Q. As a child, did you even know of anyone who was an astronomer?

A. No one around me had studied beyond high school. I had a cousin who did go to high school, and I viewed him as the smartest person around. I used to bug him with my queries. In the context of a poor rural community, you don't know where to take your inquisitiveness. You have to go after your ideas on your own.
Although I knew no astronomers, I knew artists and did art. There were artists in my town that made things for the tourists. What linked art with the cosmos and mathematics was, I discovered, that the same feeling you get when doing art comes when you solve mathematical problems related to the cosmos. With time, I realized that mathematics wasn't just calculating, but a powerful way of thinking.

Q. Without anyone to guide you, how did you work out a career path?

A. I was fortunate to meet people from outside of Belize. We had Peace Corps people teaching in our high school. From one of them I learned about physics, our solar system, galaxies and the universe. He was the first person to say to me: "It's O.K. to think about these things intuitively, but you also have to get a grip on your ideas in a scientific way. You need the language of mathematics to shape and process ideas to make predictions."

Q. How did a teacher's good advice lead to a career in mathematics?

A. I was raised by my grandparents because my mother had immigrated to New York. She married a U.S. citizen, and I joined them when I was 13. New York was like a candy store of knowledge. I was amazed by the amount of knowledge that exists in this country, just limitless.
I went to Canarsie High School in Brooklyn, which had courses for students like me who were obsessed with science and math. Seeing how math impacts the scientific process and vice versa inspired me to pursue mathematical physics. After Canarsie, I attended Hunter College.

Q. Were you in Hunter's special science program for minority students?

A. Yes, though not at first. It was interesting how that came about. I had a lot of tough personal problems at home. My stepfather and I did not get along. (We have since made up.) It came to a point where I couldn't take the situation anymore, and I left home. I was essentially on the streets of Brooklyn.
This occurred in my first year at Hunter College. And I remember reading a poster about this Minority Access to Research Careers, MARC, fellowship, which is sponsored by the N.I.H. This must have been like May or so. They had already selected the recipients for the next year.
I approached the head of the program, Jim Wyche, and said to him: "I've left home, I have no money, I'm bumming around, living in different places. My grandmother wants me to immediately return to Belize. Would you consider me for the fellowship this late?"
He spoke to people. Within like two weeks, I had the fellowship and he'd found housing for me at the Hunter dorm. Without that -- without what now would be called affirmative action -- someone like me would have ended up back in a field in Belize picking citrus.

Q. You've clearly benefited from affirmative action. Do you support the concept?

A. Passionately. I believe that minorities and white females have truly benefited from affirmative action. I think you could even broaden it for economically disadvantaged whites.

Q. Astrophysics is obviously a meritocracy. Nonetheless, have colleagues sometimes held your affirmative action background against you?

A. Oh, yes. You know, I didn't really understand race as a concept until I came to America, when strangers on the street called the "n" word at me. In Belize, I grew up my preteen years without being demeaned, and yet, once I got here, with all the opportunities I enjoyed, I've suffered from racism too.
I've gone to professional receptions and been mistaken for a waiter. I was at a certain prestigious institution, at a reception welcoming new students, and I was the only one of color there. When I walked into the room everyone turned around and stared at me.
I walked over to the nearest table of people that looked my age and introduced myself. To make conversation, I asked someone how one got to a certain office in the building. "Make a left, or you can tie a rope to the ceiling and swing over to the other side," this person answered.
When this happened, I went back in my mind to the whites I met in Belize, who'd treated me fairly. I said to myself, "Everyone is not like this person." If I had grown up in the U.S., where you get bombarded by this stuff from childhood on, maybe I wouldn't have had it within myself to go on. That's why I think we need affirmative action. Racism injures people and unfairly holds them back.

Q. Less than 1 percent of mathematics Ph.D.'s are African-American. Is there anything that can be done about that?

A. I feel that people like me and others can provide a powerful role model because we give young people an opportunity to see someone like them doing this kind of work. And they see that we're happy, not bitter, full of energy, planted in a solid place. That's powerful.
Every year during Black History Month I get about a hundred e-mails from kids doing projects. They ask about what it is like to have a career in math. I answer them all -- just like David Blackwell, who is one of the top African-American mathematicians in the country -- once answered my letter.
At a senior level, I am involved with the Conference for African-American Researchers in the Mathematical Sciences. We have an annual meeting where mathematicians and students come together in a nurturing setting. Role models are crucial.

Q. What difference does it make who teaches general relativity? If ever there was a raceless subject, wouldn't this be it?

A. Well, the classroom experience is not completely raceless. I know of cases where certain white professors ask minority students, "Are you sure you belong in this course?" and show shock when such students excel in their advanced courses. It makes a difference for minority students to see a person like them teaching such courses.

Q. Your specialty within mathematical physics is "gravitational lensing." What exactly is that?

A. Gravitational lensing is when gravity in space acts as a lens. This phenomenon produces cosmic mirages that carry signatures about the nature of dark matter, black holes and the age of the universe. My current research develops the mathematical infrastructure and tools for addressing these issues.
You see, in 1936 Einstein wrote a short essay where he studied a star lensing another. If the background star is off the line of sight, you'll see two images. If it's on the line of sight, it'll appear as a ring. You could then ask the question, Well, what if the lens is not just one star, two stars, what if it's a whole galaxy of stars, billions of stars? Or what, if it's collections of galaxies? 
In order to tackle something like that you have to lay a mathematical infrastructure to pose such questions and to develop a set of tools by which you could address the multiple imaging. I am the co-author of a book where we laid out an entire mathematical foundation for the subject of gravitational lensing, in a sense abstracting out of Einstein's essay.

Q. When you make your calculations about what the universe is like, is that a way of putting yourself into a place that is race-free?

A. Yes, it's the place where I can be with God. I am a person of faith, have been since childhood. When I do my work, I feel blessed with existence, blessed with life, and I can take refuge from human foibles.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL; 
Golf Starts Losing Grip And Croquet Moves In

BYLINE:  By MELINDA LIGOS 

 BODY:
On a recent business trip to the Coeur d'Alene Resort in Idaho, Robert Brooker faced a tough decision: Should he treat his prospective business partner to a round on the resort's golf course, much touted for its spectacular floating green, or should the two take a scenic airplane ride through the mountains?
 A few years ago, Mr. Brooker, who is chief executive of ICLUBcentral Inc., a software company in Cambridge, Mass., would have salivated at the chance to play on the famed golf course. This time, however, he decided on the airplane ride. Though an enthusiastic golfer, he is playing less and less of the game, especially on business trips. That is partly because, he admits, he is "short on skill" and, this year, on practice, and he doesn't want to look like a duffer in front of a colleague. 
 "Golf can be nerve-racking, and you don't want to put yourself in a tense situation, especially around a client or business partner," he said. 
Mr. Brooker is one of an increasing number of business travelers who are leaving their golf clubs at home. While there is no question that golf remains a popular choice, some executives are switching to other leisure pursuits on the road, from bird-watching to croquet to fly-fishing, business travel experts say.
Total rounds played at 2,191 American golf centers surveyed in March by the National Golf Foundation declined by 3 percent from 2001, the foundation said. It cited the poor economy and stagnation in the ranks of golfers as possible reasons, but some experts suggested time constraints also played a role.
"People don't have as much time to spend on recreational choices as they did in the past," said Dr. Lalia Rach, director of the Preston Robert Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University's School of Continuing and Professional Studies. "Who has five hours to play golf on a business trip anymore?"
The hectic pace of business travel may help explain the sudden popularity of croquet among business groups at the Rancho Valencia Resort, in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif. Since it opened 13 years ago, the resort has offered business groups access to its 10,000-square-foot croquet lawn. But it has only been in the last two years that the sport has really "taken off," according to Karina Patterson, director of marketing for the resort. Nearly every day, groups holding business meetings at the property will break for a one- or two-hour croquet match, she says "It's a great way to stretch your legs and get a little fresh air in between meetings," she said. 
Le Merigot Beach Hotel in Santa Monica, Calif., has seen a rise in interest among business groups for several of its recreational offerings, including its Go Fly a Kite program, which provides business travelers with a variety of games and toys including kites, tinker toys and remote-controlled boats that can be used in the resort's swimming pool and tools to build a sand castle on the beach.
Why this and not golf? Again, the press of their schedules. "Business meetings used to last four or five days, and people might have had time to board a tour bus and head off to the links," said Debra Rosenberg Matsumoto, director of catering and special events for the resort. "Now the average meeting lasts three days max, and people are asking us, 'What can I do to blow off steam for about an hour?' " Besides croquet being time-efficient, Ms. Patterson said, some executives relish it because it usually does not matter how good or bad they are. "We give everyone a quick lesson, and then you can go out there and still do pretty well," she said.
Daniel Nicholson, a marketing consultant for Wells Fargo Bank, said the group at his meeting played with Legos and scribbled in coloring books during its executive gathering at the resort last November. Mr. Nicholson, an avid golfer, said the activity was a refreshing change.
"It was so creative and mind-stimulating," he said. "It definitely enhanced the strategic thinking that was taking place in our meetings." It was also significantly cheaper than hitting the golf course, he said. "We didn't really have the time or money to play golf," he said. "That's really an all-day commitment."
Business groups that have 45 minutes to spare at the Ritz-Carlton Golf & Spa Resort in Rose Hall, Jamaica, have increasingly been opting to play helicopter scrabble, a game in which a helicopter hovers near the coastline and dumps hundreds of tennis balls with letters stenciled on them into the water. The players, divided into two teams, rush out into the waves and bring the balls onto the beach to form words. The team that comes up with the most words in a limited amount of time wins. 
Recently, a group of about 100 executives from the Young Presidents Organization tried their hand at the game. "It was a bit chaotic," said Delwin Rochester, director of guest activities for the resort. "You've had ladies stuffing balls into their bikini tops, and guys sticking them down their swim shorts. It's a riot."
But the best part about the activity, Mr. Rochester said, is that it levels the playing field among those of different ages and athletic abilities. Dr. Rach agreed that such activities were growing in popularity, especially among diverse groups of executives. "It's easier for people to bond over an activity that doesn't require an enormous amount of skill level," she said.
Not everybody is buying into this trend. David Kelleher, vice president and general manager of McGarrity and Moser Dodge, a car dealership in Havertown, Pa., said executives who do not see the value of business golf are "crazy."
"Croquet is for wimps," said Mr. Kelleher, who estimates that he plays more than 40 rounds with clients each year. It is precisely the time element that makes golf such a desirable business activity, Mr. Kelleher said. "How often do you spend four and a half hours with anybody these days?" he asked. "You'd never get that much time with a client in his or her office. For that reason alone, golf is the single best way to connect with clients. Even if they're complete strangers at the beginning of a round, you know them pretty well by the end."
Even so, some executives are convinced that there are better ways to connect with clients than on the golf course. Christopher Roslan, vice president of Dera & Associates Public Relations in Manhattan, has closed several large deals with clients in the entertainment industry while fly-fishing.
"I did the golf thing years ago, but I don't have any talent for it," he said. So a few years ago, Mr. Roslan, who has been a fly fisherman for most of his life, began taking clients fishing. "It's an amazing bonding experience, because it's just the two of you and the great outdoors," said Mr. Roslan. Last fall, on a fishing trip on an Arkansas river, Mr. Roslan and his client watched as a bald eagle soared over their heads. "That's an experience that neither of us will ever forget," he said.
Debra Warner, library director for Regional Academic Health Center, a branch of the University of Texas Health Science Center, likes to go bird-watching with clients. "It's the ultimate destresser," she said. "When you're concentrating on looking at a bird, your head is cleared of everything else."

HEADLINE: 'Leaves of Grass,' Anyone? A Reading Room Returns to Bryant Park 

BYLINE:  By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
In 1935, during the depths of the Depression, the Bryant Park Open-Air Reading Room was established in the backyard of the New York Public Library to engage the minds of the jobless thousands. 
 Now, during another economic crisis, and after an absence of 60 years, the reading room will return. Is this the dire omen of a new depression? 
 "The timing is coincidental," said Daniel A. Biederman, executive director of the Bryant Park Restoration Corporation, sponsor of the new outdoor library. "But in a bad time, it's nice to have a good book, and a nice place to read it." 
That nice place will be available next month under a new name, the Bryant Park Reading Room. The free lending library will offer 700 books and 300 periodicals to park visitors, who can informally check the publications out with library volunteers.
"I think people will be enchanted by a reading room in the park," said Mary K. Conwell, director of branch libraries for the public library, which is providing its expertise. She said that in a time of budget-cutting, it is useful to remind the citizenry of the importance of libraries, "for traditionally, libraries are used more in tough times, because people don't have as much money to buy books and do other things."
The outdoor library, with books donated by publishers, will be set up in mid-June in a tranquil oasis to the east of the entrance at 42nd Street and the Avenue of the Americas. It will be under a stand of maple trees near the statue of the industrialist William Earle Dodge.
The original reading room opened in August 1935, and was a collaboration between the public library and the Parks Department. It was staffed by five paid librarians employed by the Works Progress Administration, under the supervision of the library. By its second summer, it had attracted 64,624 patrons. 
"There were few rules and regulations," Ms. Conwell said. "People signed a card in each book, left it with the librarians, then put the card back when they returned the book." 
The original lending library was something of a Midtown institution, called the "book beneath the bough" program. "Photographs show people dressed for business," Ms. Conwell said. "Maybe some of them were office workers, but others could have been among the newly unemployed. We'll never know how many of them were too embarrassed to tell their families -- the ones who would dress for business in the morning, then come to the park and read." 
An unsigned 1936 article in The New Yorker took note of "the young lady librarians, as brightly officious as Mrs. Roosevelt," and said that they "sit thumbing over cards at a white garden table protected by a green umbrella, or lovingly pat the books in the bookstalls, making sure they're still alphabetical." Among the most popular loaners, the article said, was "John Brown's Body" by Stephen Vincent Benet, and "Red Bread" by Maurice Hindus. 
The reading room flourished through 1942, "but in 1943 we were at war, the W.P.A. librarians weren't available, and many of the formerly unemployed patrons were part of the war effort," Ms. Conwell said. 
The library suggested that the reading room be temporarily discontinued; the parks commissioner, Robert Moses, agreed, replying in a note: "I think I understand the park library situation. As you say, we can open it again when the war is over." 
That never happened. But now, Bryant Park officials are conducting interviews for volunteers who will staff the reading room, three at a time, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays. The great library next door will advise the volunteers and help them to refer readers to its collections. 
In Maspeth, Queens, four rolling reading carts are being fabricated at NE & WS Metal Works Inc., and painted a greenish blue. The rainproof carts -- 4.5 feet tall and a yard wide, made from steel and aluminum -- will hold 700 books and 300 periodicals. They are being created with a $35,000 grant from HSBC bank, which has underwritten the reading-room effort.
Ignacio Ciocchini, the industrial designer for the Bryant Park Restoration Corporation, said the new carts were inspired by photographs of the original reading room. "We want the carts to look as if they always have been there," he said.
The carts will offer protection for the books at night and during inclement weather, as they can be locked and swathed in vinyl covers.
There will be no library cards -- and no shush-ing. "I don't think we do that in libraries anymore, do we?" said Ms. Conwell with a laugh. 
The checkout system will be straightforward: books with red stickers -- expensive coffee-table art volumes and the like -- need not be signed for, but must be read on chairs within sight of the librarians. Books with yellow stickers may be read anywhere in the park, but people will have to show an ID, then put their names on a sign-out sheet.
And books with green stickers may be taken home and returned -- or substituted with any other comparable nonlibrary book that has been, Mr. Biederman said, "gently read." 
Mr. Biederman does not foresee fierce competition for the books, although the park draws a crowd of 5,000 during a sunny lunch hour. "We're thinking that we might draw 250 people a day." 
Predictions about theft greeted the initial outdoor library in 1935, but Ms. Conwell said that only 30 of about 900 books disappeared in that first season, including Emily Post's "How to Behave Though a Debutante." 
Is there concern that present-day New Yorkers are less honest? "Trust is the operative strategy in the park," Mr. Biederman said. "Even our chairs and tables aren't locked up at night. And we are going to trust people not to take the books."
Will books be checked out to homeless park visitors? "We welcome everyone," Mr. Biederman said, "as long as they follow the rules. Our strategy has always been to have such an overwhelming number of people in the park that they won't feel intimidated by the homeless." 
But why now? "It's something that we've always wanted to do," Mr. Biederman said, "and we were at last able to get around to it." 
"Already, there is a large group of readers in the park," he added. "But you can never have too many. Reading is a perfect passive activity for a park that has 3,000 chairs in it."

HEADLINE: Oceans in Peril 

 BODY:
It has long been clear that the world's oceans are in trouble, its coastal waters increasingly polluted and its fish stocks in various stages of decline. Now comes the most shocking news in years: a report from two Canadian scientists that says the world's mechanized fishing fleets have managed in a mere 50 years to wipe out nine-tenths of the world's biggest and most economically important species of fish, including cod, halibut, tuna and swordfish.
 The report, published in the journal Nature, is the first to present a global picture of the drastic declines that earlier studies had detected on a regional basis. It provides further evidence that fishing fleets have been able to sustain harvests at high levels only by venturing further and further out to sea in a desperate but ultimately self-defeating effort to stay in business. 
 The analysis also provides a timely prelude to a flurry of studies and conferences aimed at shedding more light on the problem and suggesting solutions: a meeting of experts, organized by Conservation International, to be held this week in Los Cabos, Mexico; the Pew Oceans Commission's coming final report on America's territorial waters; and, later this year, a long-awaited report from the Congressionally chartered Commission on Ocean Policy.
The crisis described in the Nature article obviously requires global solutions. When it comes to the strip mining of the oceans, it is hard to top Japan's heavily subsidized fleets. Some European nations are only slightly less predatory. But America is hardly blameless -- one-third of its fish stocks are in trouble -- and Americans can set an example for others. Experts identify three main strategies.
One is to shrink the industry. It will take political courage and money to fashion a soft landing for displaced fishermen. But there are clearly too many boats chasing too few fish. Another important step is to expand America's tiny network of marine sanctuaries. Protected zones that give fish a chance to reproduce have yielded encouraging results. Daniel Pauly, a noted Canadian scientist, argues that fully 20 percent of the world's oceans should be set aside for this purpose.
Third, America must reorganize the way it manages its oceans. At present, responsibility for rebuilding fish populations is divided between eight regional councils, which are largely interested in maintaining the harvest, and the Commerce Department, which does not give the matter the attention it needs and which, in any case, has tended to defer to the regional councils. Indeed, oceans policy is pretty much where federal forest policy was 30 years ago, when the rules were set by a logging industry eager to maintain the annual harvest in concert with a compliant bureaucracy.
Forest policy changed when the country realized that the national forests were not an inexhaustible resource and indeed belonged to all Americans, not just the loggers. A similar shift in attitude -- in the White House, in Congress and in the public mind -- will now be required to rescue the seas.

HEADLINE: At a Traumatic Moment, Morocco's King Is Mute 

BYLINE:  By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: RABAT, Morocco, May 23 

 BODY:
Though a direct descendant of the Prophet Muhammad, Mohammed VI is applauded by those around him as a thoroughly modern monarch.
 In his four years in power here, the 39-year-old king has promoted a policy of reform -- however slow, uneven and controlled -- intended to make this North African Muslim country of 30 million people less autocratic and more tolerant. 
 Aides describe him as close to the people, or at least closer than was his father, Hassan II. The young king jogs, races Jet Skis, wears business suits and sometimes drives his own car. When his wife, Lalla Salma, an engineer by training, gave birth to their first child, a son and heir, on May 7, the three posed for a family photograph -- a daring display of modernity for Morocco. Mohammed VI's mother never had her photograph, or even her name, published. 
But since Moroccan suicide bombers attacked five targets in Casablanca 11 days ago, Mohammed VI has also been the thoroughly silent monarch. He has appeared on state-controlled television surveying the damaged sites and visiting the wounded, but he has said nothing to his people. No prime-time television address, not even a royal proclamation issued in his name.
His silence reflects both the sensitivity of the subject of religious radicalism in Morocco and the trauma of the nation, aides and political observers say. Morocco has long portrayed itself as a peaceful place, a fiercely nationalistic oasis of stability largely untouched by terrorism or the civil strife in neighboring Algeria.
The terror of May 16, which is being called Morocco's Sept. 11, is by far the most profound crisis the king has faced since he assumed power after the 38-year reign of Hassan II.
"This king is not at all like his father, who was a despot," said Fatema Mernissi, a leading feminist sociologist and author. "He is not a man of the sword. Rather, he is like me. He doesn't speak because he's in shock, like all of us. He shows he is vulnerable." 
But the bombings shattered the government's image of itself as the liberal, unthreatening face of Islam. They also offered shocking proof of a strain of radicalism inside the country capable of producing bombers ready to die in the name of God.
Already a ripple effect has been felt. The film producer Dino De Laurentiis announced last week that he would move the filming of "Alexander the Great," starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Nicole Kidman, from Morocco to Australia. 
Moroccan officials and foreign diplomats said they expected at least some damage to Morocco's tourism industry, the lifeblood of the economy, which is still recovering from the fallout from the Sept. 11 attacks and the American-led war in Iraq.
As security forces struggle to uncover the plot behind the bombings and crack down on those suspected of involvement, the question now is whether the king will be capable of both combating extremism and moving ahead with reform.
"We were attacked because we are a democratic, open-minded society, because we built a model that shows the art of the possible in an Arab and Muslim society," said Andre Azoulay, a senior adviser to the king and the only member of his inner circle who is Jewish.
Indeed, throughout his brief reign, King Mohammed has been careful to present himself as a navigator between two Moroccos. One is secular, Westernized, urbane, French speaking, often with connections to Paris. The other is angry, alienated and poor, often with connections to mosques that sometimes preach messages of hate but offer the only unifying force and source of hope in many communities.
The king is widely credited in the United States for being an unabashed ally in the war on terror. Morocco has a very close relationship with the Central Intelligence Agency, which has used the kingdom to conduct interrogations of suspected terrorists, often without regard to due process. The king has also installed a number of reform-minded technocrats in key positions and is responsible for running a largely fair parliamentary election last September.
But even before the bombings, the king was faulted by many both inside and outside the country for not delivering on his promises for reform. Political decisions are still made at the top and in secret. The economy is dominated by monopolistic enterprises with connections to the state. Corruption is widespread; the gap between rich and poor a chasm.
Last week, Ali Lmrabet, editor in chief of the satirical magazines Demain and Doumane, was sent to prison for four years and fined $2,100 for defaming the king and undermining the country's national integrity. Before he was taken off to prison, Mr. Lmrabet, who declared a hunger strike May 6 and has since been hospitalized, faulted the Interior Ministry and the intelligence services for investigating the wrong targets. They "focused on my caricatures and drawings," he told reporters, "instead of looking after the security of the country." 
A quota system introduced in the parliamentary elections last September ensured that at least 10 percent of new deputies would be women. Now 35 women sit in the 325-member lower house of Parliament, compared with only a handful before.
But tensions between feminists and conservative Muslims have stalled the work of a royal commission to reform the country's family code. "There is a vision of the family in the law that does not reflect reality but was written for another century," said Nouzha Skalli, a deputy and former Communist who earns her living as a pharmacist. "If a man wants to divorce, all he has to do is say, 'I repudiate you,' three times, while a woman has to produce witnesses and give extensive proof that is subject to interpretation."
But as the king negotiates the treacherous terrain of reform, his greatest challenge lies in the poverty represented by a place like Sidi Moumen, a sprawling slum on the edge of Casablanca that produced most if not all of the 14 young suicide bombers believed to be involved in the attacks on May 16.
Sidi Moumen is a rough warren of mud alleyways, stray dogs and wandering sheep, where people live in shacks of one or two rooms with corrugated metal roofs. One section has been renamed Chechnya because it is so dangerous that the local police do not dare venture in.
Long before the terrorist bombings of May 16, that area was known for harboring elements of the Salafist Jihad, a murky radical Islamic umbrella group. According to senior intelligence and security officials, its members have been involved in killings, assault, kidnapping, drug dealing and petty crime, and were involved in the most recent bombings.
The strategy of the king in dealing with Morocco's politicized Muslims has been to try to neutralize them, bringing them into the system but approving the appointment of clerics and the sermons they deliver.
The Party for Justice and Development, an active Islamic party with grass-roots support that recognizes the monarchy and functions legally, is an active bloc in the lower house of Parliament.
In the September parliamentary elections, the party won 42 of the 325 seats, an extraordinary victory given that it ran candidates in only about half the country's districts. That made it the third largest party in the Parliament. 
Then there is the illegal but tolerated Justice and Charity Party. Shortly after taking power, the king freed its jailed leader, Sheik Abdel Yassine, after 10 years of house arrest.
Sheik Yassine's main political message -- that monarchy is an illegitimate form of government -- was reason enough for King Hassan II to send him to a psychiatric hospital and later to prison. While now free, he is still prevented from preaching or conducting political activities from his home in Sale, an impoverished town just across the river from Rabat.
"The monarchy for us is illegitimate because it was not chosen by the people," said Nadia Yassine, the sheik's45-year-old daughter and spokeswoman, in an interview in her office there. "But we are nonviolent and pragmatic. It is up to the people to decide what kind of government they want." 
Senior Moroccan officials say the only way to stem the tide of radicalism is by delivering on promises to reform the economy as well as the political system. There is deep resentment that direct United States aid to Morocco is a mere $5.4 million a year. That does not go far in a country with an unemployment rate of well over 20 percent, an illiteracy rate of more than 50 percent, five million people living under the poverty line and more than half the population under the age of 25.
"To convince we must deliver, and to deliver we know we can't do it alone, considering the economic difficulties we face with the growing needs of our population," said Taib Fassi Fihri, minister of state for foreign affairs, in an interview.
For now, the king is neither comforting his nation nor laying out a strategy for the future. Perhaps the search for a formula to reconcile democracy and Islam is too ambitious. As the king told an interviewer from Time magazine three years ago, "Whatever I do, it will never be good enough."

AT A GLANCE: Morocco

POPULATION: 31.2 million

AREA: 172,413 square miles, slightly larger than California.

RELIGION: 98.7 percent Muslim, 1.1 percent Christian, 0.2 percent Jewish

GOVERNMENT: Constitutional monarchy, ruled by King Mohammed VI

INDEPENDENCE: March 2, 1956

LANGUAGE: The official language is Arabic, but a large minority speaks Berber. Spanish and French are also spoken.

RECENT HISTORY: Most of Morocco became a French protectorate in 1912, with Spain controlling the balance. The country gained its independence from France in 1956 and soon afterward from the Spanish, though some disputed territories remain.

HEADLINE: Toronto Again Listed as City With Spreading SARS Cases 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: TORONTO, May 26 

 BODY:
The World Health Organization restored Toronto today to its list of places where severe acute respiratory syndrome is spreading, after the announcement of a fresh outbreak of the disease here.
 The W.H.O. decision came less than two weeks after Torontowas removed from its list, and just as Canada's largest city was beginning to recover from a serious blow to its economy. However, the W.H.O. stopped short of issuing a travel advisory. 
 The Ontario health authorities announced over the weekend that there were at least eight new probable cases of the disease. Two of those eight patients have died and several others are in critical condition. 
"This was not expected," said Dr. Paul Gully, a senior official at Health Canada, a federal agency for health education, at a news conference today. He said the risk of the disease's spreading to the general population was "minimal."
The W.H.O. decision was announced by federal health authorities in Ottawa, who said they were confident that a new travel advisory was not pending.
The United States Centers for Disease Control issued a new travel alert for Toronto late last week, delaying a planned television advertising campaign aimed at upstate New York, urging tourists to come back to Toronto. The C.D.C. alert did not warn travelers to stay away, but said there was a health concern.
A total of 27 people here have died of the disease, known as SARS, since it first appeared here three months ago, making Toronto the only city outside Asia to be struck so severely. There were no new SARS cases reported today, and all of the cases in the latest outbreak have been linked to one section of a ward at North York General Hospital, said Dr. Barbara Yaffe, Toronto's associate medical officer of health.
"We certainly need to do more investigations still, but this is a very good sign," she said. "We have no evidence that SARS has spread to the general community."
Officials say the new cluster of patients, which could number 30 or more, has been contained in four city hospitals. More than 2,000 people who visited those hospitals at different times in May have been urged to quarantine themselves at home.
The outbreak is believed to have begun with a 96-year-old patient at North York General Hospital who died of what was thought to be pneumonia on May 1 after surgery for a fractured pelvis. After several people who treated him and at least one other patient exhibited SARS-like symptoms, the authorities concluded that he had died of SARS.
"As some of the stricter precautions were relaxed and as some of our staff stopped using masks, very clearly some of them got exposed unknowingly," said Dr. Colin D'Cunha, Ontario's commissioner for public health.
At a separate news conference, Dr. Donald Low, chief of microbiology at Mount Sinai Hospital here, offered another explanation, speculating that an undetected SARS case may have entered the hospital ward as far back as late March, leading to the current outbreak.
The disease spread to other hospitals by patient transfers.
But the question remains how the elderly patient contracted a disease that was thought to be under control at the time. North York General Hospital was treating SARS patients while the unidentified infected man was at the hospital, but on a ward several floors away.
Health officials are investigating the possibility that the man came in contact with a piece of equipment that had been contaminated by a SARS patient. Perhaps, officials said, the patient came in contact with a health worker who unknowingly had contracted SARS but did not show symptoms.
Dr. Gully said experts have concluded that the 96-year-old patient at root to the new outbreak acquired the disease from the original cluster of cases thought to have been under control. He discounted the possibility that his illness was related to a separate importation of the disease by some recent traveler to Asia.

HEADLINE: Inquiry Into Death of Girl, 7, in Bronx Apartment 

BYLINE:  By DIANE CARDWELL 

 BODY:
The police are investigating the death late Sunday of a 7-year-old girl, whose mother told the authorities that she woke up to find the girl unconscious on the bathroom floor of their Bronx apartment.
 Investigators have been unable to fully question the girl's mother, who was undergoing psychiatric treatment yesterday at Montefiore Medical Center, said a police official speaking on condition of anonymity. 
 "Right now she is despondent," the police official said. "They can't talk to her." 
Emergency service workers, responding around midnight Sunday to a 911 call of an unconscious child at 3232 Hull Avenue, said they found the girl, Alise Nelson, 7, already dead. She had some injuries to her head, which the police said could have been consistent with a fall.
Investigators initially believed the girl's neck was broken, but preliminary autopsy results were inconclusive, said Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the city medical examiner's office. She added that the medical examiner's office may not be able to establish the cause of death for a few weeks. 
The girl's mother, Danielle Cohen, was taken to Montefiore Medical Center, where she was treated for taking a large dose of pills, a law enforcement official said. The official did not say what kind of pills were taken.
Ms. Cohen, who the authorities believe was estranged from Alise's father, told investigators that she had lost consciousness after taking the pills and that when she woke up, her daughter was on the bathroom floor.
Neighbors at the apartment building, a tidy walkup in a neighborhood north of the New York Botanical Garden, seemed to know little about Ms. Cohen, not even her name. They said that she was at different times cheerful and sullen when they saw her. Evelyn Verdejo, who lives directly beneath the apartment where Alise was found, said that Sunday was unusual because she did not hear any of the normal sounds of life coming from the apartment.
Law enforcement officials said that Ms. Cohen had recently been laid off and was living on a combination of child support and unemployment insurance. Ms. Verdejo, who is raising four daughters, said that she had noticed a decline in Ms. Cohen's appearance and behavior over the past year. Ms. Verdejo, who described Alise as "a normal, healthy little girl nicely dressed all the time," said that she used to see Ms. Cohen leave the building in the mornings, looking like a professional.
Lately, though, she would be home all day, dressed in house clothes or wearing slippers in the rain, Ms. Verdejo said. She said Ms. Cohen would frequently be late to pick up or drop off her daughter at school, across the street.
Raymond Reynoso, the building's superintendent, said that Ms. Cohen's apartment was well kept.
Once, when he went to fix the apartment door, the girl asked his name and showed him she could write it. " 'Oh man, you're smart and so beautiful,' I told her," Mr. Reynoso said, and shook his head. "Now, I know she's dead."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: REBUILDING; 
U.S. Says Bank Credits Will Finance Sale of Goods to Iraq

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, May 26 

 BODY:
The head of the occupation authority in Iraq, L. Paul Bremer III, said today that the Central Bank of Iraq and a group of private banks would begin providing "substantial" trade credits for exports to Iraq within weeks.
 Now that the United Nations has lifted sanctions on Iraq, and as the country resumes selling its crude oil in coming weeks, Mr. Bremer said the trade credit system would "lubricate international trade with Iraq" and would also serve to demonstrate symbolically "to the world that Iraq is open for business again." 
 In announcing the opening of bank credit lines to finance the sale of goods to Iraqi ministries, government-owned factories and private companies, Mr. Bremer said that the total amount was still under discussion but that American and British companies were expected to be among the first to benefit. 
Contracts are pending to sell everything from oil field technology to transportation services and telecommunications to Iraqi ministries coming back into operation under the occupying powers.
One good economic omen for Iraq, Mr. Bremer announced, was the discovery of $250 million in salvageable American currency in the flooded basement vault of the Iraqi Central Bank. In the last few days, American crews drained river water from the damaged building and opened the vault to find the currency.
American military forces earlier recovered hundreds of millions of dollars believed to have been looted from the Central Bank just before the war by Baath Party officials and relatives of Saddam Hussein.
Mr. Bremer's upbeat economic report was delivered on a day when United States military forces in Iraq suffered two ambush attacks. Two soldiers were killed and five others were wounded in attacks on convoys.
The first occurred 110 miles northwest of Baghdad just after dawn when an eight-vehicle convoy of the Third Armored Cavalry Regiment was on its way to resupply American forces near the city of Al Qaim close to the Syrian border. The convoy came under attack from gunmen who opened fire with rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns.
One American soldier was killed and another wounded in the firefight as attack helicopters and ground forces reinforced the besieged convoy, a military statement said.
This afternoon in Baghdad, four American soldiers were wounded when an explosive device believed to be a land mine was hurled by an unidentified assailant at a convoy on the road to the international airport on the western side of the capital. The United States Central Command later issued a statement saying one soldier had died and three others had been wounded in the incident, The Associated Press reported.
"A man came running straight out at the road, and I engaged," said Pfc. Dustin Meeks. "He just sprung out of the bushes, and I perceived him as a threat, and I shot at him."
Despite the gunfire, the assailant managed to throw the explosive device into the path of an Army Humvee, destroying it and wounding all three of the passengers, according to the Army sergeant riding in the second vehicle.
"The gunner of the truck was slung about 15, 20 feet," said Private Meeks, who was interviewed at the scene of the attack. He was the gunner of a Humvee driving in convoy with the destroyed vehicle. The two Humvees, part of a scout platoon of the Third Infantry Division, were driving north about three miles from the airport when they were attacked.
A fourth soldier, from the Third Battalion of the 69th Armored Regiment, was wounded by shrapnel from exploding munitions when he stopped to assist in pulling the soldiers from the smoldering wreckage.
The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed today that its inspectors were headed back to Iraq, but only to check the country's inventory of nuclear materials, which the agency is charged with safeguarding under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The Associated Press reported that the team was expected to leave for Iraq by week's end.
Also today, United States military officials said they had arrested a brother-in-law of Saddam Hussein after giving chase to a vehicle speeding through Mr. Hussein's hometown, Tikrit, according to Maj. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, commander of the Fourth Infantry Division.
The vehicle was spotted by an American patrol aircraft. The police followed the car to a hospital in Tirkit. Hospital employees led authorities to the man, Mulhana Hamood Abdul Jabar, whose name appears on a list of 245 wanted Iraqis, although not on the list of the 55 most wanted. The passengers in the car were two unidentified men suffering from gunshot wounds.
The car also contained $300,000 in cash and an equivalent amount of Iraqi dinars.
In his news conference today, Mr. Bremer said shortages of electrical power were still hampering economic recovery in the Iraqi capital.
Though power has returned to much of the city, industries, homes and business are plagued by rotating blackouts. Mr. Bremer also said that in a "matter of days" Iraqi oil refineries would begin producing gasoline to alleviate the long waits for fuel that have added to frustration and occasional violence in the capital.
On the political front, Mr. Bremer said he would provide no details of his plans to form an "interim administration" of Iraqi political figures, and he said he had asked Iraqi political figures to keep confidential their discussions with him about the country's political evolution.
The "leadership council" of the Iraqi political groups that worked with the United States and its allies to topple Mr. Hussein has expressed deep frustration with the shift in policy that has pushed them to the sidelines as the occupation authority was established.
Mr. Bremer said the United Nations Security Council resolution that last week lifted penalties that had been imposed on Iraq and recognized the United States and Britain as occupation powers "did not change the reality."
"The reality under the rules of war is that the coalition is the occupying power in Iraq," he said.
One Iraqi political figure said today that Mr. Bremer had discussed with Iraqi political leaders a plan to appoint a number of Iraqis to important ministry posts in coming weeks. This collective could become the interim administration, though it would have no political power.
In addition, the Iraqi said, Mr. Bremer has suggested that a national conference might be assembled this summer to select a commission to work on drafting a constitution.
Iraqi political groups say they are planning to send a delegation to Washington and London to protest the failure of the occupying powers to move more quickly to establish an interim government of Iraqis and pave the way for elections.

HEADLINE: Stating The Obvious 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
"The lunatics are now in charge of the asylum." So wrote the normally staid Financial Times, traditionally the voice of solid British business opinion, when surveying last week's tax bill. Indeed, the legislation is doubly absurd: the gimmicks used to make an $800-billion-plus tax cut carry an official price tag of only $320 billion are a joke, yet the cost without the gimmicks is so large that the nation can't possibly afford it while keeping its other promises.
 But then maybe that's the point. The Financial Times suggests that "more extreme Republicans" actually want a fiscal train wreck: "Proposing to slash federal spending, particularly on social programs, is a tricky electoral proposition, but a fiscal crisis offers the tantalizing prospect of forcing such cuts through the back door." 
 Good for The Financial Times. It seems that stating the obvious has now, finally, become respectable.
It's no secret that right-wing ideologues want to abolish programs Americans take for granted. But not long ago, to suggest that the Bush administration's policies might actually be driven by those ideologues -- that the administration was deliberately setting the country up for a fiscal crisis in which popular social programs could be sharply cut -- was to be accused of spouting conspiracy theories.
Yet by pushing through another huge tax cut in the face of record deficits, the administration clearly demonstrates either that it is completely feckless, or that it actually wants a fiscal crisis. (Or maybe both.)
Here's one way to look at the situation: Although you wouldn't know it from the rhetoric, federal taxes are already historically low as a share of G.D.P. Once the new round of cuts takes effect, federal taxes will be lower than their average during the Eisenhower administration. How, then, can the government pay for Medicare and Medicaid -- which didn't exist in the 1950's -- and Social Security, which will become far more expensive as the population ages? (Defense spending has fallen compared with the economy, but not that much, and it's on the rise again.)
The answer is that it can't. The government can borrow to make up the difference as long as investors remain in denial, unable to believe that the world's only superpower is turning into a banana republic. But at some point bond markets will balk -- they won't lend money to a government, even that of the United States, if that government's debt is growing faster than its revenues and there is no plausible story about how the budget will eventually come under control.
At that point, either taxes will go up again, or programs that have become fundamental to the American way of life will be gutted. We can be sure that the right will do whatever it takes to preserve the Bush tax cuts -- right now the administration is even skimping on homeland security to save a few dollars here and there. But balancing the books without tax increases will require deep cuts where the money is: that is, in Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security.
The pain of these benefit cuts will fall on the middle class and the poor, while the tax cuts overwhelmingly favor the rich. For example, the tax cut passed last week will raise the after-tax income of most people by less than 1 percent -- not nearly enough to compensate them for the loss of benefits. But people with incomes over $1 million per year will, on average, see their after-tax income rise 4.4 percent.
The Financial Times suggests this is deliberate (and I agree): "For them," it says of those extreme Republicans, "undermining the multilateral international order is not enough; long-held views on income distribution also require radical revision." 
How can this be happening? Most people, even most liberals, are complacent. They don't realize how dire the fiscal outlook really is, and they don't read what the ideologues write. They imagine that the Bush administration, like the Reagan administration, will modify our system only at the edges, that it won't destroy the social safety net built up over the past 70 years.
But the people now running America aren't conservatives: they're radicals who want to do away with the social and economic system we have, and the fiscal crisis they are concocting may give them the excuse they need. The Financial Times, it seems, now understands what's going on, but when will the public wake up?

HEADLINE: Editorial Observer; 
For Partisan Gain, Republicans Decide Rules Were Meant to Be Broken

BYLINE:  By ADAM COHEN 

 BODY:
There was a lot not to like about the new Congressional district lines Republicans tried to push through in Texas this month, the ones that made Democratic legislators flee to Oklahoma to prevent a vote. Democratic Austin was sliced into four parts and parceled out to nearby Republican districts. A community on the Mexican border and one 300 miles away were painstakingly joined together and declared to be a single Congressional district. But the real problem was that Republicans were redrawing lines that had just been adopted in 2001, defying the rule that redistricting occurs only once a decade, after the census.
 The Texas power grab is part of a trend. Republicans, who now control all three branches of the federal government, are not just pushing through their political agenda. They are increasingly ignoring the rules of government to do it. While the Texas redistricting effort failed, Republicans succeeded in enacting an equally partisan redistricting plan in Colorado. And Republicans in the Senate -- notably those involved in the highly charged issue of judicial confirmations -- have been just as quick to throw out the rulebook. 
 These partisan attacks on the rules of government may be more harmful, and more destabilizing, than bad policies, like the $320 billion tax cut. Modern states, the German sociologist Max Weber wrote, derive their legitimacy from "rational authority," a system in which rules apply in equal and predictable ways, and even those who lead are reined in by limits on their power. When the rules of government are stripped away, people can begin to regard their government as illegitimate.
The Texas redistricting effort was part of a national Republican effort to shore up the party's 229-to-205 House majority going into the 2004 elections. The House majority leader, Tom DeLay, who traveled to Austin to supervise the effort personally, was blunt about his motives: "I'm the majority leader, and I want more seats." Texas Republicans seized control of the Legislature last year, and they thought they could add five or more Republican Congressional seats. When the Democrats took off for Oklahoma, the Department of Homeland Security helped hunt down a plane filled with escaping legislators. Sixteen members of Congress from Texas wrote to Attorney General John Ashcroft asking him whether there had been "attempts to divert federal law enforcement resources for private political gain."
In Colorado, Republicans succeeded this month in redrawing the state's Congressional lines, which had been duly redrawn after the 2000 census. Republican state legislators, under the guidance of the presidential adviser Karl Rove, added thousands of Republicans to a district that Bob Beauprez, a Republican, won last year by just 121 votes, and excluded the Democrat who nearly beat him from the district. Democrats have gone to court, charging that Republicans violated Colorado's Open Meetings Law and legislative rules when they sneaked the plan through.
In the judicial battles in the Senate, Republican leaders, frustrated that Democrats have rejected a handful of Bush nominees, have declared war on longstanding Senate rules. Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has dispensed with procedures that allow senators to exercise their constitutional "advice and consent" function, in one case holding a single hearing for three controversial nominees, and he has stifled legitimate inquiry. When Senator Charles Schumer tried to ask one nominee about his legal beliefs, Senator Hatch snapped that he was asking "stupid questions."
The Senate majority leader, Bill Frist, has declared that filibusters, which allow senators to block action with just 41 votes, should not be used to reject judicial nominations, despite a history of using them to do just that. Abe Fortas was prevented from becoming chief justice in 1968 by a Republican-backed filibuster. While Senator Frist pushes "filibuster reform," Senate Republicans are also talking about a "nuclear option," in which Vice President Dick Cheney would preside over the Senate and hand down a ruling that Rule 22, which permits filibusters, does not apply to judicial nominations.
The Republicans' attack on the rules come at a time when they could easily afford to take a higher road. They have, by virtue of their control of the White House and Congress, extraordinary power to enact laws and shape the national agenda. And this administration is already getting far more of its judges confirmed, and more quickly, than the Clinton administration did.
Weber, in writing about rules, was concerned about what factors kept governments in power. That is not a concern in the United States -- there is no uprising in the offing. But when Americans see their government flouting the rules, as they did during Watergate, they respond with cynicism.
In these hard times -- with threats from abroad and a sour economy at home -- our leaders should be bringing the nation together not by demonizing foreign countries, but by instilling greater faith in our own. They should be showing greater reverence for the rules of government, and looking for other ways -- like tougher campaign finance laws -- to assure Americans that their government operates evenhandedly.
How likely is that? The word in Texas is that Republicans may try their redistricting plan again. Senate Democrats are bracing for Senator Frist's "filibuster reform," or the "nuclear option."
And Mr. DeLay recently revealed how he felt about rules of general applicability. When he tried smoking a cigar in a restaurant on federal property, the manager told him it violated federal law. His response, according to The Washington Post, was, "I am the federal government."

HEADLINE: Boom Times in the City's Housing Courts 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
Since its inception 30 years ago, New York City's housing court has sometimes resembled a chaotic netherworld worthy of Dickens. There some of the city's poorest tenants, or the most litigious, quarrel eternally with their landlords in courtrooms so wretched that even judges have described them as black holes of Calcutta.
 But the daily combatants are a much more mixed lot these days. On any given day now, one might find Josie Gomez, a former dental-office manager who was making $52,000 a year plus bonuses before the office closed a few months ago. Unable to find a job, Ms. Gomez, a 29-year-old Queens resident, finds herself a couple of months behind in her $865-a-month rent and facing eviction. 
 One might also bump into a former Bloomingdale's executive who once made $175,000 a year. She lost her job two years ago, bled through her retirement savings and ended up in Manhattan's housing court in October because she was three months behind on her $1,580-a-month rent. Eventually, she found a $26,000-a-year job and an apartment that was $500 cheaper. 
"You definitely see more working- and middle-class people coming through housing court," said Judge Fern A. Fisher, who was first appointed a housing court judge in 1989 and is now administrative judge of the Civil Court, which oversees housing court. "You see more nonpayments, you see more small owners, and you can expect that we all will be under the gun for the next few years."
The changing face of housing court, then, is but one more graphic, often terribly sad reflection of the city's stumbling economy. Simple job loss statistics or budget deficit projections can seem antiseptically quantitative, but housing court provides intimate accounts of how individual worlds are becoming unglued, apartment by apartment, month by month.
And no one -- not judges, tenants, landlords or housing groups -- believes that the situation will improve anytime soon. Middle class litigants are a further burden on a system already drowning in actions and petitions, eviction notices and stays. Discouraging signposts for the future abound, as well: thousands of municipal layoffs, the highest rent increases on regulated apartments in 14 years, soaring property taxes, dwindling emergency resources. Moreover, tenants' groups say, because the law now permits apartments with monthly rents of $2,000 to be taken off rent regulation (allowing landlords to charge whatever the market will bear), landlords of rent-regulated apartments have been aggressively trying to get tenants out and make upgrades that would allow them to charge the higher rent. And because the supply of regulated and cheaper housing has evaporated, the number of middle class litigants is proportionally greater than in previous slumps, said Judith Goldiner, a staff lawyer at the Legal Aid Society.
Andrew Scherer, executive director of Legal Services of New York City, said, "It's as bad as it's ever been, and it's likely to get worse."
The overall number of cases in housing court in the first four months of 2003 was 6 percent higher than in the comparable period last year. While evictions have declined slightly in recent years, the most current data are good only through 2001, or before the full effect of the downturn was felt. 
Still, last year Legal Services of New York City, which has traditionally assisted the most indigent residents, helped 69 people in five affluent ZIP codes, including the Upper East Side's fabled 10021, that had a total of zero cases in 2000. Those five ZIP codes -- all among the top nine in the city -- had median household incomes of at least $75,000, or double the citywide figure.
Eviction Intervention Services, on the Upper East Side, receives 90 calls a day, overwhelmingly because of lost jobs or economic woes, it says, up from 40 calls two years ago. In addition, while the group has traditionally helped families who make less than $20,000 a year, it has recently helped people who have made up to $180,000 a year, said Karen Ingenthron, the group's executive director.
The Bridge Fund of New York City, a nonprofit program that provides financial assistance to low- and moderate-income families in housing court, says it now helps some families who pay more than $1,100 a month in rent; a few years ago, $900 would have been the maximum level. Maria Toledo, the fund's director, says many applicants "typically don't access social services" and are from the airline, restaurant, hotel and investment fields.
Ernest J. Cavallo, the supervising housing court judge in Manhattan, says he now sees up to 40 cases a month involving people who are in arrears on rents of more than $2,000 a month. Two years ago, he never saw such cases.
"I always look at the addresses, and what I see is that I had just as many East Side and Greenwich Village and Midtown apartments as I had other places," he said. "We are seeing people working on Wall Street who got laid off, people with businesses whose businesses have collapsed."
To new litigants, housing court, with its unruly atmosphere of lawyers and tenants negotiating in hallways or yelling into cellphones, can be overwhelming. While about 90 percent of the landlords have lawyers, perhaps only 15 percent of the tenants do, Judge Fisher estimated. The hearings before some of the most overworked judges in the system are usually brief, so litigants often have but a few minutes to recount their emotional slide into debt.
Housing court is also more accustomed to handling poor tenants receiving public assistance, not unemployed middle class defendants who are delinquent on rent payments or co-op maintenance fees.
"People say, 'My rent is $1,100,' " Ms. Ingenthron said. " 'I'm not a drug addict. I don't have H.I.V. I'm not an alcoholic. I just don't have a job.' "
Because of the stigma associated with housing court, few litigants interviewed in recent visits to Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens housing courts would discuss their stories, but those who did said they wanted to remind people that all New Yorkers are vulnerable to economic changes, regardless of whether their rent is $300 or $3,000.
One middle class professional in Manhattan, for instance, said she had operated a publishing business in her two-bedroom, $2,000-a-month apartment on the Upper East Side for 12 years. Two years ago, just before the 9/11 terror attacks, business began to tail off, she said.
"It is embarrassing and it is humiliating," said the publisher, whose previous experience with courtrooms had been limited to jury duty. She said she was determined to pay the back rent.
"The judges are very nice, and they try to help you get yourself together," she said. "I just better not get SARS or even a mild case of the flu."
In Brooklyn, one litigant, Kara Rubinfeld, said she and her boyfriend, an ironworker, found themselves in a bind after she lost her job in a bakery and then gave birth to their son, Thoreau, who is now 13 months. They had been making $65,000 a year, but now find themselves about $5,000 in the red on their $1,200-a-month two-bedroom near Fort Greene.
"I've never been in this situation before, and I don't want to be again," she said, adding that their case included concerns about lead paint. 
No doubt, numerous small landlords, unable to collect from chronically late or troublesome tenants, are reeling, too, because of rising fuel costs, insurance rates, property taxes and other factors, said Frank Ricci, director of government affairs, and Mitch Posilkin, general counsel, of the Rent Stabilization Association.
More co-op shareholders have fallen behind their monthly maintenance fees as well. In Queens, the number of people in arrears on maintenance fees has climbed by perhaps 50 percent in five years, said Nicholas Bais, a legal aide to Judge Pam Jackman Brown.
The demand for help may be greater than ever, but the resources remain constrained. While the court has largely escaped the budget ax, Judge Fisher said, the workload is greater: civil filings involving insurance cases, student loans and credit card debt are expected to double from only three years ago. 
The City-Wide Task Force on Housing Court, a tenants' group, is fighting for its survival because of the budget cuts. Legal Aid and Legal Services, both pressed for funds, must turn away far more people than they can help.
Still, there is only so much that an emergency pinch of one or two months' rent can do, if the jobs are not there. Take the story of one female executive, in her mid-50's, who once earned up to $100,000 a year in engineering management.
In 2001, she was looking for a job. But after Sept. 11, she was told she had a rare liver disease, and quickly fell behind on her $1,100 Mitchell-Lama apartment on the Upper East Side. She ended up in housing court.
"I was surprised, because there were a lot of people who are not welfare beats, but who are professionals," she said. "And I was thinking to myself: 'Here I am, going from managing jobs worth millions of dollars to fighting these goons? What am I doing here?' "
At the last minute she received help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. But that help expired recently, and now the woman, still unemployed, faces eviction again.

HEADLINE: Bank of America Nears Agreement With Developer to Build 42nd Street Skyscraper 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Bank of America is close to signing a deal with the developer Douglas Durst to build a skyscraper on 42nd Street, near the Avenue of the Americas, which would become the bank's New York headquarters.
 The bank would be a partner in the project and occupy half the space in the proposed $1 billion tower, which is expected to contain 2 million square feet of space, according to real estate executives and government officials. It would stand next to the Conde Nast Tower, the 48-story skyscraper Mr. Durst built in Times Square four years ago. 
 If the project goes forward, it will strike an upbeat note at a time when the city is playing a blues medley of corporate layoffs, deep municipal budget cuts and tax increases. Little office construction is going on, because millions of square feet of office space are sitting empty. Yet when much of the financial industry is shrinking, Bank of America, which has about 3,000 employees at five locations in Manhattan, would be expanding its presence in New York with the new building. 
"It's proof that New York, despite the recession, has intrinsic strengths that no major bank can ignore," said Mitchell Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University. "You can't be a major banker and not be in New York."
The skyscraper would also be a personal triumph for Mr. Durst. He would be completing a development his father, Seymour, began 40 years ago when he bought his first parcel on the block between 42nd and 43rd Streets, from Broadway to the Avenue of the Americas. Seymour Durst died in 1995; the Durst family now owns or controls all but two parcels on the long block, where development has had a long and contentious history.
On Thursday, the city sent a letter to the state expressing support for the proposed project on 42nd Street. According to a senior state official, the state is considering condemning the block. If the state condemned the property, Mr. Durst would not have to negotiate a sale price with the owners of the two parcels he does not already have. In all likelihood, the state would take control of the land and lease it back to the bank and the developer for a nominal sum. The state would also have to persuade a court that the condemnation was for a public purpose.
The Empire State Development Corporation is expected to issue a notice this week that it will hold a public hearing on condemnation.
Peter G. Riguardi, president of Jones Lang LaSalle, a real estate company representing Bank of America, declined to comment, other than to say: "The bank is committed to New York City. We're looking at all deals seriously." But a state official said he considered the talks between the bank and Mr. Durst to be "very serious."
"Next week is a big week," said one executive who has been involved in the negotiations. 
Bank of America has also talked to state and city officials about an incentive package for the deal. The Bloomberg administration has often said it is reluctant to grant companies special tax breaks, which critics call corporate welfare. But earlier this month, the state and city granted Pfizer, the world's largest pharmaceutical company, up to $46.1 million in tax breaks and other subsidies in connection with the company's purchase of a building at 685 Third Avenue, at 43rd Street, and a pledge to transfer 1,000 jobs to Manhattan from outside of New York City.
Real estate executives said they expected Bank of America to get some sort of incentive package from the city, although some of the benefits would be tied to job growth. State officials had tried unsuccessfully to persuade the bank to move to Lower Manhattan, which has lost thousands of financial jobs since Sept. 11.
New York was still suffering a deep recession and a real estate depression in 1995 when Mr. Durst first announced plans to build the Conde Nast tower. Unlike many other developers, the Durst family had little debt on its holdings and was able to finance the project.
The following year, Mr. Durst quickly lined up two major tenants -- Conde Nast and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, the law firm -- and began building 4 Times Square, a structure that heralded a building boom.
"A new office tower will be music to the ears of the real estate community," said Ross F. Moskowitz, a real estate lawyer at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan. "As they did with the Conde Nast building in the mid-90's, the Dursts will look to be a first-market mover and trendsetter with this building."
But New York City is still losing jobs. According to Newmark & Company, a real estate firm, 58.1 million square feet of office space sits vacant or available, more than the entire commercial market in Boston.
A block away from Mr. Durst's project, the developer Boston Properties lost its anchor tenant last summer and is still trying to fill Times Square Tower, its building with 47 stories and 1.2 million square feet under construction on 42nd Street. To the east, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce is also chasing tenants to fill the 35-story office building under construction at Madison Avenue and 42nd Street. The bank is no longer planning to occupy most of the tower.
So far, The New York Times Company and its partner, Forest City Ratner, have been unable to lure a tenant to the newspaper's proposed new headquarters, on Eighth Avenue between 40th and 41st Streets. The Times plans to use about half the tower.
The Bank of America project has the support of state and city officials, but nothing is guaranteed on this block, where feuds and near-misses abound. In the past, the Durst family has almost struck deals with Morgan Stanley, Chemical Bank, Nasdaq, L'Oreal and Zurich Insurance.
But the Dursts now own or control more than 90 percent of the block. Susan Rosenberg owns a small building at the southwest corner of 43rd Street and the Avenue of the Americas where her late father, Harry Goldberg, opened a pawnshop in 1948. She has vowed to be the last to sell.
A group led by Joseph Bernstein owns an L-shaped parcel that fronts on both 42nd Street and the Avenue of the Americas. In 1985, the Bernstein group nearly bought out the Durst holdings, but the deal fell apart. Since then, the two sides have been at loggerheads, with Mr. Durst seeking to buy out the Bernstein group, while Mr. Bernstein has refused, offering instead to become Mr. Durst's partner.
The Bernstein group filed a lawsuit to block the state from condemning the property in the late 1990's, when Mr. Durst was close to striking a deal with Nasdaq to build a headquarters. That deal also fell apart and Mr. Bernstein withdrew the suit after the attack on the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001.
"We're willing to negotiate," Mr. Bernstein said. "We're definitely sellers at the right price."
Mr. Durst also needs permission from the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission to move Henry Miller's Theater, which sits in the middle of the block, west to a spot next to the Conde Nast Tower.

Central Bank Expected to Cut Interest Rate In Euro Zone

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, May 26 

 BODY:
It has become a consuming question for economists and corporate executives across Europe, discussed and disputed with the fervor of a theological debate: When will the European Central Bank cut interest rates?
 The conventional wisdom is that the bank, which sets monetary policy for the 12 European nations that use the euro, will reduce its key rate by at least one-quarter of a percentage point at its regular meeting next week. Given the recent surge in the euro and the tide of grim economic news in Europe, some experts predict it will cut by even more, perhaps half a point. 
 "My general feeling is that they will move in June," said Allan Saunderson, the chairman of EuroZone Advisors, a consulting firm in Frankfurt that follows the central bank. "With the currency moving so fast, I don't know how they can hold on without people laughing at them." 
The euro hit another four-year high against the United States dollar today, trading at $1.1852, before easing a bit to $1.1352. The currency has soared 12 percent against the dollar this year and 22 percent in the last 12 months.
Officials at the bank said the euro was merely reclaiming its proper value, set at $1.18 when it began trading four years ago. But the rapid rise has unnerved corporate executives here, who fear it could strangle Europe's economy by pricing their exports out of the American market.
Critics were already complaining that the bank, with its single-minded focus on curbing inflation, has paid little heed to the continent's more pressing problems, which include two years of near-stagnation, soaring unemployment and, in Germany at least, the specter of deflation.
Three countries that use the euro -- Germany, Italy and the Netherlands -- are on the brink of a recession, while Germany risks falling into a deflationary spiral, according to a report by the International Monetary Fund. Inflation here fell to 0.7 percent in May, its lowest level in four years.
"The E.C.B. has been overly restrictive in its monetary policy for the last two years because it has paid too much attention to inflation in smaller European countries," said Hans-Werner Sinn, the president of the Ifo Institute, a leading German economic research organization.
"Inflation rates in Europe are very divergent," he added. "Ireland has a higher rate than Germany because of its lower wage base."
The critics acknowledge that setting a uniform policy for 12 countries was never going to be easy. But they say the bank's bias toward Europe's smaller, faster-growing countries has left the two largest countries in the monetary union, Germany and France, with even deeper problems.
Mr. Sinn said he believed there was a one-in-three chance that Germany could lapse into deflation, a cycle of falling prices familiar in Japan and China, which can cause lasting economic damage.
Not all the indicators are negative. Mr. Sinn's institute issued its monthly survey of German business confidence today, which showed an unexpected improvement in sentiment in May. The Ifo index, as it is known, rose to 87.6 from 86.6 in April, which had been its worst showing in 16 months.
The index still reflects persistent weakness in Germany's current condition. Mr. Sinn said the improvement in corporate confidence was likely to have been a reaction to the speedy end of the war in Iraq.
"The Americans ended the war more quickly and effectively than anyone could have hoped," he said. "That led to a dramatic improvement in confidence, which gives hope for the business cycle."
The trouble is, stimulating growth has never been at the heart of the European bank's deliberations in setting interest rates. Founded on the principles of Germany's Bundesbank, it has always focused on inflation -- aiming to keep it at an annual rate of no more than 2 percent.
Defenders of the bank note that it has cut interest rates twice in the last year: in December and March. Its benchmark rate of 2.5 percent is already close to a post-World War II low in Europe. Some say it would have been unwise to cut rates again, while war was still raging in Iraq.
"They've done a better job than people are giving them credit for," said Ralph Solveen, an economist at Commerzbank.
Now that the war clouds have dispersed, the bank is sending out signals. Today the bank's vice president, Lucas Papademos, played down the risk of inflation in Europe, saying it is likely to hover around 2 percent for the rest of the year because of the strong euro and lower oil prices. It has already fallen to an average rate of 2.1 percent in April across Europe, from 2.4 percent in March.
Mr. Papademos, speaking to reporters here, also acknowledged that the strength of the euro would make it difficult for Europe to rely on exports to lift it from its malaise. After a rocky first year, in which the bank was faulted for confusing the market, it now carefully telegraphs changes in monetary policy.
Set against that, however, are comments made by the bank's influential chief economist, Otmar Issing. Speaking to a German news channel last weekend, he dismissed the threat of deflation in Germany and said he still expected the economy to recover in the second half of the year.
"The message seems very confused at the moment," Mr. Saunderson said. "But I can't believe, in my heart of hearts, that even the Germans in the bank would resist those who are worried about these trends."

HEADLINE: Proud Baymen, Scraping Bottom; 
Lobstermen Are Dredging Clams, and Earning Less

BYLINE:  By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: HIGHLANDS, N.J., May 23 

 BODY:
Paul Ritter used to be a lobsterman, until the lobsters in the bays around New York Harbor disappeared. Then he equipped his boat for gill netting, making his own nets as his dad had taught him. But overfishing out in the ocean ended that, too.
 Now Mr. Ritter is on what he thinks is his last stand as a waterman, digging clams in Sandy Hook Bay, just like the men in the few boats around him on another day of cold and spitting rain in May. They, too, had once been able to earn more with far less effort, fishing for high-value catches. 
 Mr. Ritter pointed them out:
"That one over there, he was a lobsterman," Mr. Ritter said. "The one next to him was a pound fisherman" -- a reference to a type of net -- "and the next one, he was a lobsterman, too. Now we do this. This is the last thing."
Mr. Ritter has painted the name Will Power on the transom of his old wooden boat, and the idea that his work runs on pure will as much as by muscle and diesel fuel seems about right, after the awful winter and spring that the bay's dwindling number of clammers have endured.
There was the ice and cold that kept them off the water until March. Then, after a week of good weather, one of the Middlesex County Utilities Authority's pipes burst and spilled 575 million gallons of sewage into Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays. That closed the waters to fishing for six weeks just as the weather turned sweet.
Now they are back out, but the weather is cold and wet again, and the wind is either too strong to work in or too gentle to give their boats the amount of drift they need to move the heavy clam rakes across the bottom.
In addition to bad weather, the cooperative that markets their clams, the Baymen's Protective Association, has lost many of its clients for all but topnecks and chowders, the biggest and least valuable clams. When the bay was closed, distributors from Rhode Island and Virginia, and the growing aquaculture clam beds in Florida, moved into the market to capitalize on the perception that the Sandy Hook and the Raritan Bay clams were polluted, even though all clams pass through a purification plant before they are sold.
The baymen's cooperative used to sell a total of 1,500 bushels a week, enough to earn each bayman $2,000 before expenses in a good week, said Keith Craffey, the association's president. Now they are earning half that, and the baymen's numbers have dwindled from several hundred to about 70.
"Some of the guys are getting part-time jobs and clamming part time, to be sure of a check," Mr. Craffey said. "Some are working on boat ramps, some guys are working on the SeaStreak" -- the new ferries to New York -- "and a few are bouncing in bars. Because the truth of the matter is, we feel we're being put out of business."
There are lots of other clammers in the New York region, on the South Shore bays of Long Island, on Long Island Sound and in Barnegat Bay, N.J., who are suffering to some extent from out-of-state competition. But the clam rakers of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays say they feel their catch is under a particular cloud from the sewage spill that a few thousand dollars from the sewer company will hardly compensate.
"The guys are upset because the perception is that the clams are no good is now prevalent," said Jude Welsh, one of the baymen. "The sewer shut us down, and the people in Florida found out how much they can dump on us, and that's really set us back."
Raking for clams is a solitary, arduous and repetitive life. The clammers use a combination rake and basket, like a big blueberry picker, on a long aluminum pole that they pull across the seafloor in short, jerky motions. On a breezy day, they will stretch common blue plastic dropcloths between makeshift spars to work as sails and help their boats drift along and make pulling the rake easier.
The baymen can guess how full their baskets are by the rattle of shells in the basket, transmitted up the metal handle. And by the weight, which needs the help of a winch to be pulled to the surface.
But a full basket does not yield much of a catch. The clams are shaken through a grid that excludes all but the smallest, most valuable clams. Two full rakes brought to the surface after about 20 minutes' work yielded about 100 keepers, worth perhaps $13, for Mr. Ritter.
"They call these bull rakes, because only a dumb animal would work with them," he said.
Other workers besides the clammers have seen arduous but well-paid jobs disappear -- steel workers in Buffalo, porcelain workers in Trenton, foundrymen in Bridgeport. But the baymen, although they may resort to other work in a pinch, say that a life on the water, following their fathers and grandfathers, has made them unfit for any other kind of work.
"I was on boats since I was in diapers," Mr. Ritter said. "What else can I do? Be a charter captain? I couldn't run around taking care of other people."
Even the old waterfront that has been home to the baymen for generations is yielding to the pull of new commuter economies. Waterfront condo developments crowd the shore where boatyards and fish warehouses used to stand, and the arrival of high-speed ferries to Manhattan has given Highlands and Atlantic Highlands an unfamiliar, touristy feel.
The influx of newcomers has at least driven up the value of the baymen's homes, and given some of them ideas about raising the money to build new businesses. Mr. Craffey, 37 and with a wife and three young children, thought he could mortgage his house for enough to buy an old marina that had come on the market, but the ferry service bought it instead, and for far more than he had expected to pay.
At least Mr. Craffey has a degree from Wagner College on Staten Island, which he attended on a basketball scholarship. For the men whose education is in the wind and the water, the bay is all there is, Mr. Ritter said.
"They'll just keep pulling on that rake until they're physically exhausted," he said.

HEADLINE: Battered Korea Steel Maker Looks Good to Wilbur Ross 

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK 

 BODY:
Even with the South Korean economy showing signs of slumping, Wilbur Ross is betting that there is still money to be made on a major Korean steel maker that collapsed in the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98. 
 Mr. Ross, an investor in distressed assets, has been buying steel makers in the United States to assemble his International Steel Group. He said last week that he hoped to conclude a preliminary agreement by the end of May to buy the Korean company Kia Steel from its creditors, who have been running it for five years. 
 An earlier foray into South Korea by Mr. Ross, in partnership with a big insurer, the American International Group, came to nothing: They tried to buy three financial services companies from the Hyundai Group, but the deal collapsed when American International wearied of protracted negotiations with Korean officials and withdrew. 
This time, Mr. Ross is bidding in a 50-50 partnership with Goldman, Sachs, offering $360 million for Kia Steel, once a mainstay of the Kia Group, which went bankrupt in 1998 and was broken up. Most of the Kia companies, including Kia Steel, fell into the hands of creditors.
"I can't get away from Korea," Mr. Ross said in a telephone interview from the New York offices of his firm, W. L. Ross & Company. 
He said he was sure that Kia Steel could be profitable making specialty steel and auto parts, despite debts of more than $800 million. And he said he was unfazed by the latest growth statistics from South Korea's central bank, which showed that the country's gross domestic product contracted slightly in the first quarter from the quarter before and was up only 3.7 percent from the corresponding period a year earlier -- a weak performance by South Korean standards. "In most countries, 3 percent would be greeted with cheers," Mr. Ross said. "We think the fundamentals are pretty good." 
Nor did he seem worried by tension between officials in Seoul and the Bush administration over how to deal with North Korea and its threats to develop nuclear weapons. "Their traditional response is a lot of talk and bluster," he said, "but North Korea doesn't want a war with anybody." 
Mr. Ross said he would not fold Kia Steel into the International Steel Group -- which combines the former Bethlehem Steel, LTV Steel and Acme Steel -- but it "would be owned in parallel" and would benefit from an exchange of management and technical skills with International.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
British Investors Bristle at American-Size Pay Packages

BYLINE:  By HEATHER TIMMONS 

DATELINE: LONDON, May 26 

 BODY:
Shareholders in Britain are wielding new voting rights to register their objections to hefty executive pay packages. And their next target may be an American, William F. Aldinger III, the former chief executive of Household International, who sold the company to the British bank HSBC Group in November for $14.2 billion.
 As part of the deal, Mr. Aldinger's contract with Household was terminated, although he was hired as head of HSBC's operations in the United States under a very similar pay package. The termination prompted a one-time payout of $20.3 million. 
 Mr. Aldinger's new three-year deal with HSBC guarantees him $5 million in cash and bonuses per year, plus an additional $20.5 million worth of shares over the period, unless he is fired for cause or decides to retire without "good reason."
None of the compensation is linked to the company's performance, says Stuart Bell, director of research for Pensions InvestmentResearch Consultants, or PIRC, a London-based shareholder advisory board.
PIRC has advised shareholders to vote against Mr. Aldinger's pay package at HSBC's annual meeting on Friday. Mr. Bell also objects to the $20.3 million payout to Mr. Aldinger that came after the deal was completed. "There wasn't really termination of employment," he said. "It was just sleight of hand."
The Trades Union Congress, Britain's largest labor group, also objects to Mr. Aldinger's guaranteed payouts. On Saturday, the group urged pension managers controlling HSBC stock to oppose the pay package and wrote in an e-mail message to 1,000 pension fund trustees: "This is our money. Our pension funds and insurance policies should be invested in a way that supports good businesses not platinum parachutes for failing directors."
An amendment to the Corporate Governance Act in January has empowered shareholders here. It requires public corporations that have holding companies registered in Britain to disclose executive compensation packages and then put them to a vote at their annual meetings. While the vote is nonbinding, it carries weight here because of its ability to chastise publicly corporations and their leaders.
GlaxoSmithKline shareholders proved this month that the amendment had teeth when they narrowly voted down the pay package for the chief executive, Jean-Pierre Garnier, mainly because of a midsize (by American standards) $23.7 million golden parachute he will receive no matter how the company performs.
To appease shareholders, the Glaxo board is being restructured, and Mr. Garnier's package will be re-evaluated. Though most of the outcry came originally from British labor unions and shareholder rights activists, American fund managers, including the giant California Public Employees' Retirement System, ultimately joined the side opposed to Mr. Garnier's deal.
The Trades Union Congress is also calling for companies to make voting records public. Several large British fund managers abstained from the vote at Glaxo, and at least one voted in favor of the pay deal, the labor group said. Because voting records are private, individual pension holders will be unable to tell if their savings have been "used to support feather-bedding for executives," the labor group said.
HSBC is not the only company that may yet come under fire in the annual meeting season. PIRC is also encouraging shareholders of Tesco, a large British grocery chain, to vote against a bigger severance package for its chief executive, Terry Leahy. Kingfisher, a large British retailing company, is revising the pay packages for its top executives before its June 4 meeting, in part to avoid the kind of public humiliation that Glaxo suffered.
A hefty package for an HSBC executive is especially notable because the bank has always had a reputation for thriftiness. Sir John Bond, the bank's chairman, did not pay cash bonuses in 2001, and gave employees stock instead. He often flies economy class and takes the subway to work. The value of bonuses, salaries and benefits given to HSBC's top 5 executives and 19 directors in 2002 was $14.6 million, according to the bank's annual report.
HSBC says that the payments to Mr. Aldinger are so large in part because he is an American. "He's a talented executive, and he's been given a package similar to what he's on already," said an HSBC spokesman, Jamie Harley. "It is comparable to what his peers get in the United States."
This latest shareholder vote is fueling a long-simmering debate over what constitutes appropriate compensation for an executive. The American standard of receiving tens of millions of dollars a year is still quietly viewed in Britain as a bit unseemly, even for the successful leader of a large company. Salaries for top executives here are about one-third of those in the United States.
Staples of American pay packages, like multimillion-dollar stock bonuses linked to duration on the job, rather than performance, or cushy severance packages, are unheard-of.
Money, after all, is not a top executive's only reward. "One might have thought having the responsibility of running a major business would be an extraordinarily satisfying thing to do by itself," says Richard Singleton, director of corporate governance for ISIS Asset Management in London, which controls $95 billion in assets. ISIS voted against Glaxo's pay package.
Still, as some British corporations go head to head against American competitors, they have begun to adopt American-style severance and bonus packages.
Some executives, including the Glaxo chairman, Sir Christopher Hogg, argue that for companies based here to attract top talent, they need to be able to compete with American companies on compensation. Some bankers and top executives fret that a strong shareholder rights policy could dissuade foreign companies from selling out to British firms, and slow down cross-border deals.

HEADLINE: Key to Iowa Caucus May Be the Living Room 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: DES MOINES 

 BODY:
Senator John Edwards of North Carolina flew here in April to talk up his presidential campaign at a crowded, high-profile televised forum before 300 Democrats at the Iowa Historical Building.
 But it is where Mr. Edwards went after the forum that could prove more significant come the presidential caucuses next January: to Ned Chiodo's living room, across the Des Moines River on the South Side. 
 For 90 minutes, away from the microphones and television cameras and over white wine, Mr. Edwards discussed his campaign with Mr. Chiodo, 60, his son Frank, 35, and a few friends from the neighborhood. 
Mr. Edwards talked about the economy, how he can beat President Bush, and the Italian roots of his wife, Elizabeth Anania Edwards, a bit of biography that drew approving nods in this heavily Italian-American community. 
He left the Chiodos impressed, they said, and promised to be in touch again. Many, many times.
For all the attention being paid to the public face of the Democratic presidential contest, there is today a less-noticed struggle that may be crucial to the outcome in Iowa: the competition for the support of Democrats like Ned and Frank Chiodo (pronounced CHY-doe).
The Chiodos are a dynasty of sorts, Democrats who, if little known beyond the Little League fields and small Italian restaurants that dot the South Side of Des Moines, are as critical to the contest as anyone paying attention to the 2004 race today. 
Senator Edwards sat in the same living room where Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, another Democratic candidate, spent 90 minutes a few weeks earlier -- making pretty much the same case. "We talked about politics and how he thought he was going to make it to the presidency," Ned Chiodo said.
When Frank Chiodo, a state representative until this year, organized a fund-raiser for his state legislative political committee in 2002, the host committee read like the first page of the program for a Democratic presidential debate: Mr. Kerry, Mr. Edwards, former Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri. 
Last summer, Mr. Edwards turned up at a fund-raiser for Frank Chiodo in Des Moines accompanied by three retired Chicago Cubs players, a contribution that for this baseball fan was arguably more valuable than a check.
The Chiodos are part of a select group of perhaps 300 Iowans who -- because of their stature in the community and their command of the cumbersome turnout effort needed to win the caucuses -- represent more than just one more vote in a living room next January.
"One thing about the South Side is relationships," Frank Chiodo said, as the sun slowly set over the Little League field where his son was playing third base. "The joke about me is that I was related to half my district, and I married the other half."
"Fortunately, there are a lot of people who, for whatever reason, rely on me for a lot of their guidance for whom they are going to support politically," said Mr. Chiodo, who was wearing an Air Force Two windbreaker, a souvenir from a flight with Vice President Al Gore when he ran the South Side for Mr. Gore in 2000. "They've got their business. They have other priorities. They don't pay attention to politics. That's what they've got me for."
The Chiodos have been prominent players in Des Moines politics since Ned Chiodo was elected to the State House in 1976. Frank got his start that same year, at 8. He knocked on doors and posted yard signs, helping his father capture the seat that Frank would later win himself.
Today Ned is a lobbyist and golf course owner and Frank is an official with the Department of Economic Development. They are leaders of the Democratic club known as La Macchina, or The Machine.
"They got their own Rolodex of supporters and friends," said Gordon Fischer, the state Democratic chairman. And, he added, "the Chiodos have quite a large family."
Not incidentally, they are also among the best informed in the nation these days when it comes to this Democratic presidential field. So far, they are not necessarily happy with what they have heard.
"Right now, most of them are not talking in terms that light any fires for the public," said Ned Chiodo. "They are arguing with Bush over the war. They are coming out with 14-point plans on health care policy, that kind of stuff."
"I don't think that is where it's at," he said. "I think they've got to talk about the economy."
The one candidate who appears out of the running in the Chiodo sweepstakes, it seems, is Mr. Gephardt. As the House minority leader, Mr. Gephardt backed a candidate supported by the United Auto Workers in a legislative race against an incumbent who was a close friend of the Chiodos.
"We took personal offense to it," Ned Chiodo said. "And his candidate got beat, 70-30." He smiled at the memory. "I hope he understood," he said of Mr. Gephardt.
Beyond that, the Chiodos are ready and armed with an early read on the flock of Democratic candidates.
Frank Chiodo said he was drawn by Mr. Edwards's fund-raising ability. "I'm attracted by the fact that he's from down South and canwin down South," he said.
Mr. Kerry "definitely has a presence about him," Frank Chiodo said. "I don't know about him in the South. I listened to him talk about what his vision of America was. But it seems to me lately he has been sticking his foot in his mouth."
Ned Chiodo said Mr. Edwards "probably listens a little better, which I think is both a plus and a minus because I don't think he's sure about where he's at on issues. And so he's willing to listen to people to help him formulate where he's at."
But, he said, Mr. Edwards came across much better in his living room than the senator from Massachusetts. "Kerry came across as much more cerebral; Edwards seems like a guy from the neighborhood," Ned Chiodo said. "Kerry didn't seem like a guy who grew up in the neighborhood. He looks like he grew up in the neighborhood you didn't like."
Dr. Dean is "very bright and very energetic," Ned Chiodo said. "But I don't think he can make it." He offered similar reservations about Mr. Lieberman. "I don't think he can win," he said. "One thing about politics, it doesn't do you any good to be on the second team."
The two Chiodos are generally of the same view, though some time spent with them suggests there are differences, with Frank taking a good look at Mr. Lieberman and perhaps a bit more willing to forgive Mr. Gephardt. 
One thing is for sure. These men have been around long enough to take their time. "Once you pull the trigger, for the most part, your importance goes away pretty damn quick," Frank Chiodo said. "Those phone calls you were getting every three days? You can't get anyone to return your phone call."
Indeed, asked if he was going to announce an endorsement any time soon, Frank's father shot his questioner a look of practiced innocence.
"I wouldn't want to do that."

HEADLINE: The Mideast Thicket 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26 

 BODY:
The phrase "arc of crisis" was coined by President Jimmy Carter's national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, after a revolution in Iran and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. It described the religious fervor, instability and strategic and economic importance of the world from South Asia to the Mediterranean.
 Today, the region is once again testing American leadership in ways that would tax any administration. But with the Iraq war over and many of President Bush's aides hoping for a peaceful period leading up to an easy re-election next year, the problems seem especially unwelcome. 
 The bombings in Saudi Arabia this month did more than destroy parts of three foreign compounds in Riyadh. They shook American complacency that the campaign against terrorism had been won along with the war on Iraq. The Saudi attacks also exposed deep new anxieties in Washington over the Saudi government's ability, and perhaps willingness, to help crush terrorist cells in its midst. 
Then there is the sharpened quandary over Iran, which some Bush administration analysts say is harboring cells of Al Qaeda that were involved in the Saudi bombings. American officials have said that Iran is already trying American patience by supporting militant Shiite groups in Iraq and, the officials believe, accelerating its nuclear arms programs.
The administration is to hold a high-level interagency meeting on Tuesday to decide whether to suspend diplomatic contacts with Iran or take even firmer actions, perhaps beginning to support opposition groups, to get the Tehran government to cooperate.
Some in the administration favor confronting Iran, pressing for sanctions on its nuclear program at the United Nations or becoming friendly with groups that want to overthrow the current government. Others argue that Iran should be given more time to identify Qaeda operatives and perhaps hand them over.
"They are not going to want to take a step that looks like they are catering to American pressure," said an administration official, referring to the government in Iran. "Ratcheting things down for a while might make it easier for them to cooperate."
Beyond Iran and Saudi Arabia, Al Qaeda is believed to be functioning in Afghanistan and further east in Pakistan, where it enjoys considerable popular support. American military officials complain that they are barred from going after Qaeda units in Pakistan. The fear is that an obvious American military presence in Pakistan would destabilize the government of Gen. Pervez Musharraf.
All these crises are unfolding against a backdrop of rising bitterness and confusion in Iraq, where the American failure to deliver basic services has set back national reconstruction and forced a deferral of American plans to install an interim Iraqi governing authority.
American credibility in the region has also been sapped, Arab diplomats say, by the failure to find Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden or any unconventional weapons in Iraq -- the rationale the administration presented for war.
The one bright spot, for now, at least, is that the Bush administration finally seems to have altered the grim status quo in the Middle East. Peace is far from secured, but at least the peace effort seems more alive than it has been in two and a half years. Over the weekend, the administration wonreluctant approval from Prime Minister Ariel Sharon for its peace plan for the Middle East, known as the "road map."
But the plan -- with its series of reciprocal concessions on both sides that are supposed to lead within three years to a Palestinian state and an Israel at peace with its Arab neighbors and inhabitants -- has raised a new set of problems for the administration. It has plunged Mr. Bush into what his aides agree is a risky new phase of direct involvement in negotiating a settlement on that most intractable of problems -- a morass that has dragged down many a negotiator before, including President Bill Clinton at the end of his term. 
"Are there a lot of ways this could go off the rails?" asked a senior administration official involved in trying to persuade Israel to accept the approach. "Of course." 
Among the tough choices lying ahead for the administration are how much to pressure Israel to compromise for the sake of peace and how much to continue working with European, Arab and other allies to bring about a solution in an arena where the United States has always played the dominant role.
Another fallout of the Iraq war is that the Arabs and Europeans who supported the United States are calling in their chits. In return for supporting the war in Iraq, they are demanding that Mr. Bush make a bigger push to help establish a Palestinian state.
Many people close to Mr. Bush say that a Palestinian state has never been the president's top priority. Conservatives in Mr. Bush's political base -- including evangelical Christians and many Jews -- oppose any steps to pressure Israel to make concessions to bring such a state about.
Prime Minister Sharon has been sounding conciliatory on a Palestinian state. Though he is considered the godfather of the Jewish settlement movement in the West Bank and Gaza, lately he has suggested that a Palestinian state "is good for us, and good for the Palestinians," as he said in an interview with The Jerusalem Post.
"I don't think we can continue to control another people," he added. "I think it is bad for us, and bad for the Palestinians. How long is it possible to sit in all those cities?"
The trap in the peace plan, as seen in Washington and Jerusalem, is the size and shape of such a state. By mentioning "those cities," Mr. Sharon may have been signaling that he only intends to withdraw from population centers in the West Bank, maintaining control in most of the rest of its territory.
Hard-liners in the Bush administration are sympathetic to Mr. Sharon's concerns. But some say that hard-liners have themselves become more supportive of the "road map" approach, if only to give the administration more latitude in dealing with other crises in the region -- diplomatically or maybe even militarily.
Mr. Bush will have to decide just how far to involve himself in the Middle East. European diplomats, who have lured the administration into the process so far, now want further commitments from the United States. 
Specifically, they want Mr. Bush to commit to American forces in the field to monitor progress on the peace plan and to appoint a special presidential envoy to broker a solution.
Among those mentioned by the Europeans as ideal for that job are a former Senate majority leader, George Mitchell, who helped broker agreements on Northern Ireland and led a task force to study the Middle East in early 2001; and former Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
Top administration officials say only that a special envoy is under consideration, and that it is something that may be adopted. First, they say, they want to see evidence of progress on the ground, including Israeli actions to ease conditions of Palestinians and Palestinian actions to disarm Hamas and other militant groups.
"The president has made clear that he thinks there's an opportunity to make progress on the Middle East, and that he's prepared to be engaged," said a senior official. "We are going to try and seize the opportunity that we think is here."

HEADLINE: A Sane Defense Budget 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "The Defense Budget Spills Forth" (editorial, May 20):
Let's put the "voracious old ways of military budgeting" in perspective. 
 The defense budget is now close to historic lows as a percentage of gross domestic product and will continue to shrink as a percentage of the overall federal budget, even with projected increases that will only partly compensate for past neglect. 
 A result of consistent reductions in military spending after the cold war is the average 25-year age of military aircraft and 35-year vintage of vehicles. Wholesale replacement is not feasible, so more must be spent to keep these aging systems in service.
Other effects of underfinancing include an unhealthy degree of industry consolidation, so that we are now dependent upon sole sources of supply or even foreign sources in several important areas. 
No new systems are designed to face the "defunct Soviet threat." They are produced to keep American technological capabilities intact while providing our people in uniform with tools that save lives and end conflict rapidly and decisively.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Growing the Political Economy" (editorial, May 23):
 Your finding that the Republicans have about a 3-to-1 advantage in money raising over the Democrats is no surprise. 
It will probably increase to a much higher ratio after the wealthy receive their tax cuts. 
 Surely President Bush's reasons for his tax cuts for the top tax brackets have something to do with the campaign financing the Republican Party expects to get back from the rich. 
That is only one of the many kinds of attempts by the Republican Party to eliminate opposition. 
The Republicans also do it by throwing unpatriotic and treasonous labels at dissent. Charges of "stubbornly blocking progress" and worse are hurled at opposition in Congress in attempts to stifle debate. 
If we allow this to continue, we will have a one-party system of the extreme right wing, not a democracy.

HEADLINE: Issues of Purity and Pollution Leave Farmed Salmon Looking Less Rosy 

BYLINE:  By MARIAN BURROS 

 BODY:
THE images of salmon farming that the industry promotes seem pristine and natural, of fish frisking in icy cold clean waters, of wise management saving an endangered species while providing shoppers with the fish they love. 
 But critics say that image of the regal salmon, America's most popular fresh fish, is not the whole reality. Recent lawsuits accuse the industry of polluting the ocean, endangering dwindling stocks of wild salmon and failing to tell shoppers that they use artificial colors to make the fish red. 
 The criticisms echo many of those leveled at huge corporate farms on land. 
"We've come to the point where we view these farms as hog lots or feedlots of the ocean," said Jeff Reardon, the New England conservation director of Trout Unlimited, which has worked with salmon farmers in Maine to reduce the number of fish that escape, to protect wild trout and salmon. "They breed disease and parasites. Like other big animal feedlots there are lots of problems. Some of their practices are beginning to improve, but over all the impact is not lessening." 
Industry officials say that some problems have been dealt with and that critics exaggerate others.
"Mistakes were made originally, but to damn the industry on the basis of the early years is unfair," said Des Fitzgerald, the former chief executive of Atlantic Salmon of Maine. "I would never suggest there are no pollution problems." He added, "I maintain that salmon farms that are well run leave very little pollution."
Last week, a judge in Maine accused one of the largest salmon farming operations in the country of putting its profits ahead of environmental concerns, and of violating an order not to stock its pens with more fish until those concerns were addressed. Earlier this month, a group of Indian tribes in Canada sued salmon farmers in British Columbia, accusing them of practices that have killed millions of wild salmon. And last month, markets around the country began scurrying to relabel their farmed salmon after a class-action lawsuit in Washington State accused retailers of failing to tell shoppers that artificial color was added to fish feed. 
As wild salmon have grown more scarce, the industry has increasingly used pens in coastal waters to raise salmon, growing them twice as quickly as fish in the wild. Eighty percent of the salmon sold in the United States were raised on farms. 
While all salmon in the store may look similar, the Department of Agriculture says farmed salmon contains almost twice the total fat, more than twice the saturated fat and fewer beneficial omega-3 fatty acids than wild salmon. 
Last month, consumers learned about another difference, when the class-action lawsuit in Washington called attention to the little-known fact that farmed salmon are not naturally salmon pink or red, and that if they were not fed artificial colors they would range from gray or khaki to pale yellow or pale pink. Wild salmon turn pink from the krill and shrimp they eat. (Farmed salmon eat a fishmeal diet.) The lawsuit accused three supermarket chains of violating Food and Drug Administration regulations by not telling shoppers that farmed salmon were artificially colored, thus leading them to think they were buying wild fish.
The federal government says that local officials are supposed to enforce the labeling law, but that until now no one has bothered to do so. Since the lawsuit was filed, the chains, Safeway, Albertsons and the Kroger Company, which have 6,000 stores in more than 30 states, have said they would label the fish. Whole Foods, the largest natural food chain, said it is following the label rules now. 
In New York, an official for Food Emporium said the information is being added to labels but is not necessarily in the stores yet. Officials at Gristede's and D'Agostino say labeling is under discussion. The owners of Citarella and Central Fish Market said they did not know about the requirement. 
Hoffmann-La Roche, one company that makes the dyes, canthaxanthin and the more expensive astaxanthin, from petrochemicals, offers salmon farmers the SalmoFan, a sort of paint wheel with assorted shades of pink, to help them create the color they think their customers want. 
The Washington State lawsuit does not address whether the chemicals are harmful. But European Union officials are reducing the permissible levels of canthaxanthin in fish and poultry from 80 parts per million per kilogram of feed -- the levels permitted in this country -- to 25 parts per million because there is some concern that high levels may cause retinal damage. In Canada the permissible level is 30 parts per million. 
The F.D.A. has concluded that 80 parts per million would not damage the eye.
While the lawsuit says farmed salmon have more antibiotics and pesticides than wild salmon, environmentalists and the farmed salmon industry agree that antibiotic use has been drastically reduced. The two sides disagree, however, about the amount of pesticides and other contaminants. 
In a pilot study conducted in 2000 by Dr. Michael Easton of International EcoGenInc in British Columbia, a company that specializes in the effects of contaminants and pollutants on animals, found that farmed salmon had "consistently higher levels" of toxic contaminants compared with wild salmon, including 10 times the level of PCB's. PCB's are far more concentrated in fish feed, particularly in the fish oil added to the feed, than in the natural diet of the fish. The findings were reported in 2002 in Chemosphere, a peer-reviewed international environmental journal, and the study was paid for by the David Suzuki Foundation, an environmental group. The findings have been confirmed in several larger studies, including one by the University of Surrey in England, reported in the peer-reviewed journal Environmental Science and Technology. 
Contaminants and pollutants are at the center of a lawsuit filed in Maine in 2000 by the National Environmental Law Center, a nonprofit center dedicated to enforcing antipollution laws. 
The lawsuit accused Maine's three largest salmon farms of operating without the permits the Clean Water Act requires of companies that intend to add pollutants to navigable waters. For years, neither the federal or state government got around to issuing the permits. The Environmental Protection Agency acknowledged that it had no idea of the extent of the pollution, from waste, pesticides, antibiotics and other chemicals, in the early days of salmon farming. In 2000, Maine took over the permitting process and was given a year to come up with final rules, a process it is only now completing.
The lawsuit also charges that the companies have degraded the water with fish waste, uneaten feed and the toxic chemicals used to kill pests and protect nets. The typical fish farm in Maine has 250,000 fish in about 20 pens. Each pen produces about two metric tons of waste, a volume of waste that surpasses that of a small city, according to Josh Kratka, a senior lawyer with the National Environmental Law Center. 
Sebastian Bell, the executive director of the Maine Aquaculture Association, a trade group, said: "Aquaculture is in the cross hairs" because well-heeled people who live on the coast where there are several salmon farms are also environmentalists. "Do we have a lot to learn? You betcha. Are we as bad as our critics say? Absolutely not."
The suit also says the companies continued to stock their pens with European salmon even after they were told not to, to prevent interbreeding. Many of these farmed salmon escape and compete for food and habitat, further weakening the tiny population of wild Atlantic salmon that are on the endangered species list in Maine. Two years ago, 100,000 farmed salmon escaped from Atlantic Salmon of Maine, one of the firms being sued. But the companies say they now have better safeguards in place. 
Steve Page, the environmental compliance officer for Atlantic Salmon, said, "Every one of these situations has been remediated." 
He disagreed with the scientists, including those from the Fish and Wildlife Service, who say the European salmon that escape weaken wild Atlantic salmon stocks through interbreeding. He said that interbreeding instead strengthens the wild salmon.
One of the three companies, Heritage Salmon, owned by George Weston, a Canadian firm, settled the lawsuit, paying a $375,000 penalty that is financing salmon restoration projects. The company agreed to limit the discharge of toxic chemicals and excess feed and to grow only North American strains of salmon. 
Judge Gene Carter of the United States District Court in Portland, Me., ruled in June 2002 that the two other companies, Atlantic Salmon, owned by Fjord Seafood of Norway, the third-largest aquaculture company in the world, and Stolt Sea Farm, owned by Stolt-Nielsen of Norway, had illegally discharged pollutants without a permit. Judge Carter is expected to decide on penalties this week. 
In February, Judge Carter ordered Atlantic Salmon not to restock its pens with new fish until he decided the case, but they did anyway. On May 9, he held the company in contempt of court. "It is the court's perception that A.S.M.'s leadership has single-mindedly pursued a policy, in the interests of the company's economic well-being and future profitability, of frustrating the fruition of all efforts by the regulatory authorities, such asthey have been, and by this Court to secure and ensure its compliance with" the Clean Water Act, the judge said in a later ruling, rejecting the company's request to delay an injunction on restocking. 
Last Wednesday, the company decided to drop its appeal and try to settle out of court. 
The State of Maine, meanwhile, is expected to introduce new rules for fish farming permits that prohibit the introduction of the European strains and require the marking of farmed fish, to track them when they escape. Details are being worked on. 
In April, in British Columbia, a lawsuit was filed by four Indian tribes against the provincial government and Stolts Sea Farm and Heritage Acquaculture, which operate in the Broughton Archipelago, near Vancouver Island. 
The lawsuit said that heavy infestations of sea lice from salmon farms attached themselves to wild pink salmon as they swam near the farms and killed them, sharply reducing the run this spring from the expected 3.5 million to 147,000. 
Environmentalists blame the salmon farms. Salmon farmers say there is no proof. 
But David Rideout, the executive director of the Canadian Aquaculture Industry Alliance in Ottawa, does not deny that lice from farmed salmon may be to blame for the decimation of the wild salmon run. But, he said: "At certain levels sea lice contamination at farms can be easily managed, but after a certain level they can have an effect on the wild stock and we have no surveillance data. 
"We need to find out a way to manage. In the intervening period we can't put the wild stock at risk."
Alaska has banned fish farms to protect its wild stocks.
Farmed salmon are here to stay, and Rebecca Goldberg, a senior scientist with Environmental Defense, said there are ways to make the process more environmentally friendly: raising the salmon in floating tanks that catch the waste, using second crops like oysters, mussels and seaweed that would make use of the waste. Others have suggested raising salmon in closed systems, and not in the ocean. 
But first, the environmentalists say, the authorities have to enforce the laws. 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 31, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article in the Dining section on Wednesday about pollution problems that affect salmon farming misstated Agriculture Department data on the relative levels of Omega-3, the healthful fatty acids, in farmed and wild salmon. Farmed salmon has about the same levels as wild Atlantic salmon -- not less -- and more than wild Coho salmon.

Commercial Time Is Selling Quickly For Cable, Too

BYLINE:  By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
The robust demand for commercial time on the broadcast television networks before the start of the 2003-4 season, as evidenced last week, is carrying over to their cable counterparts as both look to set records for revenue in the "upfront" market.
 The upfront market for broadcasters, now virtually concluded, is likely to total $9.2 billion to $9.3 billion, compared with $8.1 billion last spring. The deal-making for spots on the cable networks, being completed more quickly than usual, could result in increases of a similar or even larger percentage, reaching $5.4 billion to $5.6 billion, compared with $4.6 billion last spring; the negotiations are expected to wrap up in mid- to late June. 
 There had been fears among some cable executives that the robust upfront market for broadcast networks, which is ending even more strongly than forecast a couple of weeks ago, could potentially cut into their take. But it seems that the rising tide -- in the form of demand from marketers in large, important categories like entertainment, pharmaceuticals and restaurants -- is lifting all boats. 
"It's our impression there's a ton of money out there," said Mark Rosenthal, president and chief operating officer at the MTV Networks division of Viacom in New York, adding that the results for the broadcast upfront market appeared to be "a harbinger of greater strength" for cable networks.
The MTV Networks units like Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, TV Land and VH1 "will be engaged with all the major agencies by the close of business today," Mr. Rosenthal said yesterday afternoon, a pace "faster and stronger" than usual.
"Thus far," he added, "we're over-the-top happy."
Another ebullient cable executive, David Levy, president for entertainment sales and marketing for the TBS and TNT cable networks in New York, echoed Mr. Rosenthal's assessment.
"Some agencies couldn't place all their money down with the broadcasters," said Mr. Levy, who is also president for Turner Sports, "and we're getting some of that."
Among the busiest categories for TBS, TNT and Turner Sports, all part of AOL Time Warner, Mr. Levy listed prescription drugs sold directly to consumers, fast food, foreign cars, home entertainment (DVD's and video games) and movies.
Another reason for the strength of the cable upfront market, Mr. Levy said, was a decision by many advertisers to make commitments to buy commercial time now rather than wait until the season starts and buy spots in the "scatter" market. Time bought during the scatter market in recent months was in some instances 30 to 40 percent more expensive than in the upfront market last spring.
"Scatter money moving to the upfront" market is a big reason for handsome gains so far for the various Discovery channels, said Joseph D. Abruzzese, president for advertising sales at Discovery Networks in New York, part of Discovery Communications, along with "organic growth" and a belief among many advertisers and agencies that thenational economic climate "is going to get better."
"Our first indication is that the upfront for cable will be as strong as for broadcast, if not stronger," said Mr. Abruzzese, who last year was in charge of ad sales for a big broadcaster, the CBS division of Viacom. "It's moving at a torrid pace."
Among categories showing high demand for spots on Discovery networks like Discovery Channel, Animal Planet, TLC and Travel Channel, Mr. Abruzzese listed packaged goods and retailers along with pharmaceuticals.
For once, the two biggest cable news networks, the CNN division of AOL Time Warner and the Fox News Channel division of the News Corporation, agree on something: the upfront market seems as big as the market for playing cards bearing images of Iraq's most-wanted former leaders.
"It's going a lot faster this year," said Roger Domal, vice president and national sales director for Fox News Channel in New York, adding that his network even "did some business last week" during the broadcast upfront market.
"I would imagine we'll write the majority of our business by early next week," he added.
"We've been beating the bushes" -- that's with a small "b" -- "for the last nine months or so," Mr. Domal said, telling advertisers of the ratings gains for his network, which now exceeds CNN in domestic viewers, "and it's starting to click."
Also, "there's a bigger interest in cable news in general," he added, citing higher recent viewership for CNBC, CNN and MSNBC as well as Fox News Channel.
At CNN, said Larry Goodman, president for sales and marketing in New York, "demand has been wonderful," adding: "There's a lot of money in the market. And not all of it is finding its way to broadcast." Mr. Goodman said he expected to be mostly finished making deals in the next two weeks, which would be earlier than usual.
If advertisers are eager to be associated with the news, it stands to reason they would feel the same way about the weather. That is indeed the case, said Lyn Andrews, president for advertising sales at the Weather Channel in New York, owned by Landmark Communications.
"We've got a lot of deals working that we hope to close this week," Ms. Andrews said, adding that many are "integrated deals we took to agencies on behalf of specific clients" in categories like automobiles and drugs, which include elements like ad space on the Weather Channel Web site (weather.com) and tie-ins with local cable systems in addition to commercial time on the network.
Other categories "that are big for us," she added, include retailers and telecommunications.
At Game Show Network, integrated deals now being negotiated include product placements as well as other elements, said Michael Sakin, senior vice president for advertising sales in New York.
"We started to get in on the action late last week, and dollars are way up," Mr. Sakin said. "We hope to be able to close deals with some major shops this week." Game Show Network is owned by the Liberty Media Corporation and the Sony Pictures Entertainment division of the Sony Corporation.
Another cable network owned by Liberty Media, Court TV, which Liberty co-owns with AOL Time Warner, is seeing "more activity at this time of the year than ever before," said Charlie Collier, executive vice president for advertising sales in New York.
"A lot of midnight oil is being burned," Mr. Collier said, "even midday."

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE: REGIONAL MARKET -- Putnam County, N.Y.; 
A New Shopping Center in Semi-Virgin Territory

BYLINE:  By SANA SIWOLOP 

DATELINE: BREWSTER, N.Y. 

 BODY:
Construction is under way here on the final phase of the first major shopping center to be built in Putnam County since Putnam Plaza opened in Carmel in 1972.
 The new center, Brewster Highlands, is scheduled to have 370,000 square feet of space when finished by the end of the year. Situated on a 65-acre parcel at the junction of Interstate 84 and Route 312 in the town of Southeast, the center is already home to three large retailers, Home Depot, Kohl's and Linens 'n Things, which opened between December 2001 and June 2002. 
 Now the developers behind Brewster Highlands, Larry Nadel and Harold Lepler, of Emgee Highlands Inc., are building the final 100,000 square feet of space at the center, and Mr. Nadel says his firm has already signed deals with seven new tenants. These will include a 30,000-square-foot Marshalls store, as well as a 21,600-square-foot Michaels arts and crafts store, one of more than 700 that carry the name of that retailer, based in Irving, Tex. 
Local officials say that Brewster Highlands has already carved out a place for itself as the only home to so-called big-box retailers in Putnam County, an area north of New York City that is still substantially rural. They say that before construction on the center began in September 2000, residents seeking such stores usually had to travel to Westchester County, or to Brookfield, Conn., about 15 miles away. 
But lately, the big-box retailers already at Brewster Highlands have been a strong draw for smaller tenants, said David Landes, president of Royal Properties, a retail brokerage company based in Bronxville, N.Y. Mr. Landes said his company recently found space at the center for a new Applebee's restaurant and a Dunkin' Donuts store. "As soon as the big boxes started coming in, everyone wanted to be there," he said.
Ross M. Weale, president of the Putnam County Economic Development Corporation, said it was unlikely that Brewster Highlands would face competition anytime soon because the surrounding area, which supplies drinking water to New York City, is subject to strict new watershed regulations enacted in 1997 that severely curtail retail development throughout the county. Mr. Weale said that while he knew that a few developers had already asked the town of Southeast to approve more retail development, no major projects were now up for approval. 
That may change soon. Early this month, Breslin Realty Development, of Garden City, N.Y., closed on the purchase of a 55-acre parcel on Route 22 in Brewster that the company hopes to use for a shopping center -- even though some of the property is a wetland.
Wilbur F. Breslin, the president of the company, said that approvals for the proposed development had not yet been obtained. Still, he said, "we think that the area is an excellent market for retail." 
Watershed issues were not a concern for Mr. Nadel and Mr. Lepler when they first bought the land for Brewster Highlands in 1987. They planned to use it to build a half-million square feet of office space, but abandoned those plans during the recession of the early 1990's. In 1995, Emgee asked the town to rezone the land for retail use, but it took four more years, Mr. Nadel said, before the plans were finally approved.
As part of the approval process, he said, Emgee had to promise that it would build a special sewage treatment plant, as well as four monitoring stations, to ensure that any runoff from the shopping center would not pollute the surrounding area. 
Brewster Highlands still has about 19,000 square feet of space remaining to be leased, Mr. Nadel said. A potential tenant is a Chappaqua-based company called Satisfied Customers Inc., co-owned by Doug Crossett and Scott Pires. Mr. Crossett said his company, which owns five restaurants in Westchester County, hopes to build a new, publike 200-seat restaurant on a now empty 5,000-square-foot restaurant site at the center. 
Mr. Crossett said the company had been attracted to the center partly because the population nearby is growing strongly. Another draw was the close proximity of the Brewster North train station on the Harlem line of Metro-North. Indeed, the restaurant site that Mr. Crossett has his eye on sits next to the only road, Independent Way, that travelers can now take to the train station. 
"There are thousands of people driving right by that restaurant pad twice a day," he said. "It's a wonderful space."

HEADLINE: Ex-Technology Banker Pleads Not Guilty 

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Frank Quattrone, the former technology banker who rose to stardom during the dot-com boom, pleaded not guilty yesterday to charges that he encouraged employees to destroy documents sought by investigators. 
 Mr. 
Quattrone entered the plea in United States District Court in Manhattan. Judge Richard Owen scheduled a trial to begin Sept. 29. 
 Mr. Quattrone, 47, was highly influential at Credit Suisse First Boston in the technology stock bubble. He is accused of approving a December 2000 e-mail message urging workers to "catch up on file cleaning." 
A federal grand jury and the Securities and Exchange Commission were looking into how the company allocated shares of initial public stock offerings. The investigation was closed without charges in 2001. 
An indictment earlier this month charged Mr. Quattrone with obstructing the grand jury and S.E.C. investigations and with witness tampering, offenses that carry penalties of up to 25 years in prison. 
Both sides declined to comment outside court. During the hearing, Mr. Quattrone spoke only to say he understood the charges and to enter his plea: "I'm innocent."

HEADLINE: Sport Utility Vehicle Helps Sales Riseat Porsche 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Porsche A.G. said yesterday that its nine-month sales rose 18 percent, helped by demand for its Cayenne sport utility vehicle, which was introduced in December.
 Total sales were 3.9 billion euros ($4.6 billion) in the nine months to the end of April compared with 3.3 billion euros a year earlier. 
Unit sales rose 13 percent to 44,413. 
 Porsche, which is based in Stuttgart, Germany, is counting on the Cayenne, which has a base price of 60,000 euros, to boost revenue and profit. Sales of the company's sports cars, the 911 and the Boxster, fell 9 percent. Slowing economic growth, competition from other carmakers and aging models have cut demand.
The company has hedged against currency fluctuations until midway through 2006, and it has said the euro's rise against the dollar will not affect its earnings. The United States is Porsche's largest market.
The company said earnings and sales for the year ending July 31 would exceed last year's records. It has already sold 8,663 Cayennes.
"Lower consumer confidence is most evident in the sports-car segment," the company said. "The Cayenne will more than compensate for the sports cars' decline."
Sales of the 911 model fell 6.8 percent in the first nine months of the year to 22,888 units. Boxster sales declined 12.5 percent to 14,425 units.

Shares Rally as Economy Shows Some Signs of Recovery

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks surged yesterday after reports highlighting a strong housing market and an improvement in consumer confidence raised investors' hopes for an economic recovery and spurred buying in technology shares.
 The Nasdaq composite index jumped more than 3 percent, hitting a fresh 11-month high and racking up its biggest one-day percentage gain since early April. The broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index charged to a new 9-month peak. 
 A crucial gauge of consumer confidence set a six-month high in May as Americans looked forward to a turnaround in business and job conditions. Other data showed that buyers snapped up new and existing homes at a brisk pace in April, spurred by low mortgage rates. 
"There's relief that we're getting some good news. There was a little bit of a pullback last week, but it was relatively muted," said Edgar Peters, chief investment officer at PanAgora Asset Management. "There's just confidence coming back."
Worried they might miss a significant rebound in stocks after three dreary years, investors are re-entering the market, encouraged by a rally that has carried the S.& P. 500 up nearly 19 percent since mid-March, analysts said.
The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average climbed 179.97 points, or 2.09 percent, to 8,781.35, ending at its highest level since mid-January. The technology-packed Nasdaq gained 46.60 points, or 3.09 percent, to 1,556.69, and the S.& P. rose 18.26 points, or 1.96 percent, to 951.48.
Stocks slipped at the open after the euro touched a new high against the dollar. Shareholders feared that fewer foreign investors would want to buy United States securities with a weak dollar taking a bite out of any profits.
The economic reports, however, took the edge off those worries and fed expectations for a stronger economy later this year.
Biotechnology stocks were among the day's big gainers. Idec Pharmaceuticals rose $1.89, or 5 percent, to $39.65. Genentech, also up 4.8 percent, rose $2.92, to $63.85. Biogen jumped $2.38, almost 6 percent, to $42.88.
ImClone Systems soared 24 percent after Merck of Germany said it had made a $6 million milestone payment to ImClone under a license agreement for the cancer drug Erbitux. The news fueled hopes that clinical results for the drug to be announced this Sunday would be encouraging. ImClone rose $4.75, to $24.60. Merck of Germany is not related to Merck & Company of the United States.
The American Stock Exchange biotechnology index surged 5.38 percent.
Semiconductor stocks were another bright spot. Intel climbed 97 cents, or 5 percent, to $19.78, lifting both the Dow index and the Nasdaq market. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange's semiconductor index jumped 6.10 percent.

Treasury Prices Fall
(By Bloomberg News)
The price of the 10-year Treasury note fell yesterday, driving the yield up by the most in almost a month, after reports showed consumer confidence increased in May to the highest in six months and home sales rose in April.
The economic data was better than most economists expected, and led investors to shun government debt after a three-week surge in which 10-year yields hit a 45-year low of 3.32 percent on Thursday.
The 10-year note fell 24/32, to 101 23/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.42 percent from 3.33 percent on Friday.
The 30-year bond lost 2 12/32, to 115 23/32. Its yield climbed to 4.39 percent from 4.26 percent.
Here are the results of the Treasury's auction of 16-day cash management bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Price: 99.948
Investment rate: 1.190
High rate: 1.16%
Low rate: 1.13%
Median rate: 1.16%
Total applied for: $17,830,000
Accepted: $4,000,152
Noncompetitive: 0

The 16-day cash management bills mature June 13.
