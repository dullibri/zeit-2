HEADLINE: Judge Bars Tylenol PM As Lookalike

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Grabbing an advantage in a bruising market battle for combination pain-killers and sleeping pills, Bristol-Myers Squibb announced yesterday that a Federal judge had issued a temporary injunction barring sales of Johnson & Johnson's hot-selling Tylenol PM.
Bristol-Myers, which makes Excedrin PM, quoted Judge Arthur D. Spatt of United States District Court in Manhattan as saying that Johnson & Johnson's McNeil consumer products unit had "acted in bad faith." McNeil had named and packaged Tylenol PM in a manner that "would result in confusion" among aching consumers seeking Excedrin PM, Bristol-Myers quoted the judge as saying. 
 Lawyers for Johnson & Johnson asked the judge to lift the injunction yesterday, saying the action "essentially shuts down a "$60-million-a-year business."
 
A Hot Segment
 Analysts said that sales figure indicated that Tylenol PM was on the verge of overtaking Excedrin PM, less than a year after its nationwide introduction last May. They said the combination pain-killers and sleepinducers had become the hottest segment of the $2.5 billion market for analgesics, which relieve headaches and other pains.
Robert Kniffen, a Johnson & Johnson spokesman, said the Tylenol PM package "was never intended to confuse consumers by making them think that Tylenol was another product, not do we think this packaging had that effect."
Tylenol PM's blue-green box and Excedrin's royal blue box with a blue-green stripe both list the same two active ingredients: an analgesic, acetaminophen, and an antihistamine, diphenhydramine, which can induce drowsiness.
"The evidence is clear that McNeil's purpose was to trade on the Excedrin PM mark with full knowledge that the Tylenol PM mark would result in confusion," Judge Spatt wrote in his legal opinion, Bristol-Myers said. "McNeil did not innocently select its potentially confusing mark and trade dress."
In a written appeal to Judge Spatt yesterday, Johnson & Johnson said the order would "cause a serious financial loss to McNeil." It said the order would keep Tylenol PM off the market while its current inventory -- six to eight weeks' worth of sales -- was repackaged.
Gregory L. Diskent, a lawyer with Patterson, Belknap, Webb & Tyler in New York, added that "stopping shipments on such short notice would, to a significant extent, shut down all of McNeil's businesses for some period of time." He said this was because Tylenol PM shipments were mixed with those of other Johnson & Johnson non-prescription consumer products.
A Bristol-Myers spokeswoman said that Judge Spatt had rejected Johnson & Johnson's request yesterday afternoon for an immediate lifting of the temporary injunction. Johnson & Johnson said it would try again next week.
Despite the competitive heat generated by the analgesic sleeping pills, they are relatively small items for Johnson & Johnson, which had $12.45 billion in sales last year, and for Bristol-Myers, with 1991 sales of $11.6 billion.
Analysts said such legal actions, and some pushing and shoving to be noticed by consumers, were common in the crowded analgesic market. "It's a very competitive, static market, and everybody's trying to have the hottest brand," said Barbara Ryan of Prudential Securities. "The recession has put everyone's over-the-counter business under pressure."
Neil Sweig, an analyst with Brenner Securities, said that 1991 sales of Tylenol analgesic products were about $750 million, or 31 percent of the American pain-relief market.
He said Bristol-Myers Squibb's analgesics, including Excedrin, Bufferin and Nuprin, had sales of about $450 million, including $65 million to $70 million for Excedrin PM. The other main competitors are American Home Products' Advil and other analgesics, with $400 million in sales, and the Sterling Winthrop unit of Eastman Kodak, with $300 million, mainly in Bayer aspirin.
Bristol-Myers stock closed at $78.625 yesterday, up 12.5 cents a share, on the New York Stock Exchange. Johnson & Johnson was down 25 cents, to $99.50.

HEADLINE: Dow Off 0.45 to End Week Up 34.22

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks finished lower in cautious but heavy trading yesterday, brought on by the expiration of equity options and of February major market index futures. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped to 3,280.19, down 0.45 point for the day. The average gained 34.22 for the week.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was a strong 261.7 million shares, but it was down from the 270.7 million traded on Thursday. The Big Board composite index dropped 1.14 points, to 227.46. There were 971 losing issues and 727 gaining ones.
 
Broader Indexes Mixed
 The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 2.44 points, to 411.46, while the American Stock Exchange index ended virtually unchanged at 412.85, down a hundredth of a percentage point. 
 In over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite dropped 2.48 points, to 629.75, while the Russell 2,000 index of small company stocks lost 0.49 point, to 210.40.
Analysts said investors remained focused on economically sensitive cyclical stocks that were likely to bounce back when an economic recovery gathers steam. The Dow transportation average, which includes such cyclical companies, had reached a new high on Thursday.
Don Hays, director of investment strategy at Wheat, First Securities Inc. in Richmond, said that on the surface the market barometers did not move as much for a "double witching" day. He noted that trading came in waves and the volume was heavy.
"But under the surface, money-supply numbers are up significantly and point to an economic recovery," Mr. Hays said. "Short-term interest rates are higher, and there is increasing concern that all interest rates are headed in the same direction.
"And if rates move higher, some of that C.D. money that flowed into the stock market and helped underpin its recent advances could head back out."
Mr. Hays noted that the broad market indexes, both on Thursday and yesterday, were much weaker than the Dow industrials, a narrow measure of stocks. He said he thought the market was preparing for a more pronounced correction.
"I expect that when the correction takes place, it will come in two waves, with 3,080 on the Dow the bottom support for the first, and 3,040 for the second," he said. "This will set the stage for a later rally in May."
Blue-chip issues opened lower, as investors lightened their positions after a 50.32-point gain for the Dow on Thursday. Analysts said the weak bond market and the rise in money-supply figures weighed on the market as it opened, dampening hopes of another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.
 
Time Warner Higher
 Time Warner shares rose on the news on Thursday that N. J. Nicholas Jr. had resigned as co-chief executive and president and was replaced by the vice chairman, Gerald M. Levin. Traders said the moves were seen as positives for investors, since the changes address questions about Time Warner's future management raised by concern over the health of the company's chairman, Steven J. Ross. The stock was as high as 102 3/4 yesterday, before retreating to close at 99 3/4, up 1 7/8.
Morgan Stanley began its coverage of Perrigo Inc., a manufacturer of store brands for over-the-counter medication and personal-care products, with a "buy" recommendation. The stock rose 2 3/4, to 35 1/2.
 
Triton Off $3.125
 Shares of Triton Energy slipped after the flow rates of an oilfield partly owned by the company apparently disappointed investors. The stock fell 3 1/8, to 41 7/8, but analysts said investors might have been too hasty, since the measure of a field is not the flow but the size of the reserves.
After the announcement of a 5-for-4 stock split and a dividend rise, shares of A. G. Edwards & Sons, the St. Louis-based brokerage, rose 1 1/2, to 33.

HEADLINE: Few Gains Reported In 3-Way Trade Talks

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 21

 BODY:
The sixth major round of talks on a North American free-trade agreement ended today in Dallas with no breakthroughs on the most politically controversial differences among negotiators, further lengthening the odds against an agreement this year, Administration and Congressional officials said.
The biggest disputes among the United States, Canada and Mexico concern the energy, banking, automobile and textile industries. The details of the negotations are being closely guarded by the Bush Administration, which is worried about political fallout in an election year, particularly the reaction to any agreement that would open American markets to Mexico, where industrial wages are as low as one-twentieth that of wages in the United States.
 
Disappointment and Frustation
 The lack of significant compromises has produced frustration in all three Governments and mutual recriminations. A senior American trade official, for example, said that while President Bush and President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico both wanted a broad pact that would dissolve many barriers, "somehow that hasn't gotten across to the individual Mexican negotiators." 
 A free-trade agreement this year, "is entirely feasible, but it's going to take the Mexicans' realizing that it's a lot more significant for their economy than for ours," said the senior official, who insisted on anonymity.
A Mexican official who insisted on not being identified disputed any contention that his country's negotiators were quibbling, adding that progress had been made in Dallas.
And not all American trade officials are critical of the Mexican negotiators. Another senior official said today that descriptions of Mexican intransigence were "dead wrong."
Officials who have either seen the draft text or received classified briefings on it say the United States and Canada are arguing over how much of a car must be made in North America for the car to enter the United States free of duties. The existing free-trade agreement between the United States and Canada sets this figure at a minimum of 50 percent, and Canadian and Mexican officials want the figure to stay there in hopes of encouraging Japanese and other foreign auto makers to set up factories in their countries.
With the political spotlight on automobiles since President Bush's trip to Japan last month, the United States is insisting that a 60 percent minimum is needed.
As for Mexico, the United States wants it to open its market to American oil-drilling equipment and service companies, but Mexico has refused, citing a provision in its Constitution barring foreign participation in the extraction of natural resources. American negotiators say this provision does not extend to equipment and services used in drilling.
The United States also wants Mexico to open its banking and financial- services markets within 3 to 10 years, a period Mexico contends is too short to give its companies enough time to become competitive.
In textiles and glass, where domestic industries could suffer immediately, the United States is the one seeking a longer period of adjustment, possibly as much as 20 years.
 
Two Presidents to Meet
 President Bush and President Salinas will discuss trade, among other subjects, at a private breakfast on Thursday during a five-nation conference on narcotics in San Antonio, a White House official said.
Documents describing the United States negotiating positions, although already presented to Mexican and Canadian officials, have been classified as secret by the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills. That means only a few copies of the documents are available, in Congressional committee safes, and public discussion of their contents is illegal. Representative Marcy Kaptur, an Ohio Democrat who has been one of the leading opponents of the proposed agreement, said no one on her staff had read the draft text because no one had the necessary security clearance. And while Administration officials have held briefing sessions, "there's no opportunity for suggestions or changes," she said.
Kathleen A. Lydon, the spokeswoman for Mrs. Hills's office, said that members of Congress had been encouraged to seek security clearances for their staffs and that the secrecy was necessary. "You cannot negotiate in a fish bowl if you want a good agreement," she said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Broad Gains While Gold Prices Drop

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Israeli military clashes in southern Lebanon, economic problems in Germany and rising interest rates in the United States combined yesterday to bolster the dollar's value against leading foreign currencies.
Gold prices fell. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery dropped $2, to $351.20 an ounce. A late bid at the Republic National Bank in New York quoted gold at $351.20 an ounce, down $1.90. 
 Analysts said battles on Thursday between the Israeli military and Palestinian forces in southern Lebanon raised anxiety among currency traders, causing some to buy dollars, which are generally considered a safe haven at times of turmoil.
"People are a little skittish that there may be some strike, whether they are either pre-emptive or defensive," said Curtis Perkins, currency trader for the Chemical Banking Corporation. "That's helping fuel the upside for the dollar."
Also helping the dollar were rising interest rates in the Treasury bond market and a growing money supply, said Ronald Holzer, chief currency dealer at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
The Federal Reserve reported late Thursday that a widely watched measure of the nation's money supply, known as M-2, was growing at an annual rate of 5.5 percent. Economists say the growth, chiefly in cash in circulation and savings accounts, is a sign the economy will pick up momentum soon.
Germany's continuing troubles with reunification hurt the mark, analysts said. Labor talks between Germany's banks and workers are being closely watched because of a strike threat.
The dollar was quoted at 1.6590 German marks in late New York trading, up from 1.6450 late Thursday. In London, the dollar fetched 1.6495 German marks, up from 1.6470.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.7470, from $1.7505 late Thursday. In late trading in New York, sterling was quoted at $1.7400, less expensive than $1.7520 late Thursday.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a close of 128.65 Japanese yen, from 128.60 yen at Thursday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 128.70 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 128.95 yen, up from 128.60 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.5020 Swiss francs, up from 1.4865; 5.6390 French francs, up from 5.5950; 1,243.75 Italian lire, up from 1,234.00, and 1.18675 Canadian dollars, up from 1.18365.

HEADLINE: Bashing Is Dangerous and Avoidable

BYLINE: By Richard Holbrooke; Richard Holbrooke, a managing director at Lehman Brothers, was Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific affairs in the Carter Administration.

 BODY:
In the last two months, U.S.-Japanese relations have declined more than at any time since the anti-American demonstrations in Tokyo in 1960. Yet nothing fundamental has changed between the two nations to precipitate this shift. It is the result of nothing more -- or less -- than a failure of leadership on both sides.
Each side has always had its protectionist politicians, businessmen and journalists who criticized the other nation, sometimes fairly, sometimes not. But never before have the leaders of the two nations allowed themselves to become part of the problem by crossing the fine line dividing constructive criticism from demagogy. 
 This is particularly inexcusable because George Bush and Kiichi Miyazawa are personal friends and are knowledgeable about each other's nations. Neither would have wanted this to happen -- yet their own actions and statements created the current mini-crisis.
How it happened and what should be done about it are questions that must be addressed immediately, not only by the two leaders but by everyone affected by the relationship. And that means practically everyone in both nations.
When President Bush unwisely changed the focus of his December trip from cooperation on the global agenda to dealing with his domestic problems, his implicit message was clear: Japan was responsible for America's current economic problems. Mr. Miyazawa's response was also surprising. As the most fluent English-speaking leader in Japanese history, with hundreds of American friends (and an American son-in-law), he surely understood that comments such as those about the American "work ethic" would echo blatantly anti-American comments that have been made by other senior Japanese officials.
The truth is, of course, that trade questions cannot be reduced to simple formulas. The U.S., as President Bush himself admitted during his Asian trip in December, is not always "pure" itself. The economic differences between the two nations have actually narrowed significantly in the very period of time in which the noise level has risen. In fact, the American trade deficit with Japan has decreased 27 percent in the last three years. Hundreds of other statistics that show the true complexity of the relationship have been similarly buried in the avalanche of recent publicity.
But while the Japanese have taken many steps on trade that once seemed unlikely or even impossible, they have failed utterly to explain themselves to the American public. Passive for years, the Japanese now respond with highly inflammatory comments (some of which are already being used in advertisements on American television for American-made products).
Everyone knows -- and has paid rhetorical lip service for years -- to the proposition that these two mightiest of economies (together amounting to 40 percent of the world's gross national product) have a responsibility to address the pressing world problems that during the cold war received insufficient attention.
But just when the cold war has finally end and the moment had arrived to put substantive flesh on those rhetorical bones, two weak leaders allowed domestic politics to turn them away from their original (and worthy) game plan and toward pandering to their own protectionist constituencies. In a word, political weakness drove President Bush and Prime Minister Miyazawa into positions with which neither man could possibly feel comfortable -- and from which they must extricate themselves.
Instead of postponing his trip to Washington, as he has just done, the pro-American Prime Minister should reschedule his visit to the pro-Japan President. Then both men, even in this political season, should tell the people of both nations the truth: while we have many problems to resolve, we have even more opportunities before us if we work together. If they continue to fail in their responsibilities as leaders of two great nations, both countries will descend into economic and trade wars, whose effects would be disastrous.
Surely, Mr. Bush and Mr. Miyazawa both know this. Why don't they say so, loudly and firmly?

HEADLINE: The Pros and Cons of Using a Discount Broker

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 21

 BODY:
It's not just people who pump their own gas or buy groceries in bulk who are willing to make extra efforts to save money. People with capital to invest in stocks and bonds like low prices, too.
More and more individual investors, twice the proportion of a decade ago, are flocking these days to discount brokers. The discounters, born in 1975 when the Federal Government banned price-fixed commissions, now offer an increasing array of sophisticated products and services. 
 Discounters are enjoying the return to the market of individual investors who have helped to propel the Dow Jones industrial average and other economic gauges to new peaks in recent months. "The public's back in -- big time," said Leslie C. Quick 3d, the president of the Quick & Reilly Group, one of the discount industry's Big Three. Institutions do not use discounters because they have the leverage to negotiate very low commissions with full-service brokers.
Discounters don't suit all individuals, either, certainly not the investor who wants somebody to supply ideas or to help decide whether it's time to sell the General Motors shares inherited from a favorite uncle. But for do-it-yourselfers who generate their own investment ideas and who need no hand-holding when the market gets rough, discounters make a great deal of sense. They now collect at least 10 percent of all commissions paid by individual investors.
Besides commissions that are typically 40 to 50 percent of those charged by the large full-service brokers, discounters have another feature that many find at least as valuable: no salesman will call.
Charles R. Schwab, the chairman of the company bearing his name, set a goal of making his operation "a safe haven for the personal investor, a place free from sales pressure and conflict of interest." Only the investor who has been pestered at an inopportune moment to buy a hot stock that subsequently loses value -- and then had the broker feign ignorance as to where this dud came from -- can fully appreciate this.
Unlike brokers at the full-service firms, who are paid a commission based on the number of shares bought and sold, not the profits customers make, discounters use only salaried personnel. This means you are dealing with an order-taker who never faces the common industry predicament that what is best for the broker -- often a generous extra commission for helping to unload stock the firm has itself acquired -- is rarely best for the client.
 
The Big Three
 Although there are a few dozen discounters, three have come to dominate the field. The biggest is Charles Schwab & Company, with headquarters in San Francisco. Schwab has 158 offices and about 45 percent of the business. It is rapidly staking out the up-market territory between the bare-bones discounters, some of them one-office operations, and the full-service brokers like Merrill Lynch.
The other large discounters are Fidelity Brokerage Services Inc., part of Fidelity Investments in Boston, and Quick & Reilly in New York. Fidelity Brokerage has 66 offices and about 30 percent of the business, and Quick & Reilly has 75 offices and about 12 percent of the market.
Quick & Reilly, which generally has the lowest rates of the national concerns, is "more conservative" than the others, and its clientele, with an average age around 50, is somewhat older and wealthier, Mr. Quick said.
 
Sales and Services
 All the discounters sell a wide variety of stocks, bonds, options and money-market and other mutual funds. None of them deal in commodities. Schwab and Fidelity offer sophisticated all-purpose accounts -- Schwab One and Fidelityplus -- which have $5,000 initial-deposit minimums and incorporate Visa debit (not credit) cards. These accounts collect proceeds from the sale of securities, pay interest, offer check writing and produce a consolidated monthly statement that includes a valuation of the portfolio. The Quick & Reilly version has no Visa card.
Heavy investment in technology, especially by Schwab, has made it progressively easier to get quotations and enter trades, using a personal computer and telephone lines. In fact, automated trading is confined mainly to discounters since full-service firms shun it as a threat.
The discounters now even offer investment research, albeit at extra cost. Schwab promotes the availability of the latest information on 5,000 companies from such sources as Reuters, Standard & Poor's and Media General. The first report is $9.50; subsequent reports are $12.50 each. The company also provides copies of Standard & Poor's well-known quarterly stock reports on nearly 4,000 companies at $3.50 each.
Customers of discounters are of all kinds, ranging from the three-transactions-a-year investor who lives on dividends to the in-and-out trader who is the biggest beneficiary of low commissions. Mr. Quick said that 20 percent of his concern's customers account for 70 percent of its business.
One drawback of using a discounter, some customers maintain, is that annual reports and other company information seem less likely to reach them than the customers of full-service brokers. All brokers are obliged to relay such communications when securities are held in the firm's name. While acknowledging the problem, Mr. Quick said that in many cases, it reflected penny-pinching on the part of corporate management, which may treat a discount brokers' customers as second-class citizens.
While brokers increasingly discourage the practice, it may be worth the time, trouble and possible expense to have shares registered in your name and then to have the certificates mailed to you, insuring that you get all company reports.
 
 
 
WINNING STRATEGIES FOR INVESTORS
 It's essential that the do-it-yourself investor learn some time-tested rules. Here's some advice from experts on and off Wall Street.
Buy shares in good-quality, growing companies, preferably ones that you know about firsthand.
Spread your money over a variety of securities, and diversify further by investing in numerous industries. Don't hesitate to gain diversity by investing in mutual funds.
Be patient. Invest for a minimum of several years. If you wish, use dollar-cost averaging. This means you buy the same dollar-amount of stock at regular intervals, a technique that means you buy more shares when prices are low and thus insure that your average cost over time will be less than the stock's average price.
Find your comfort zone when it comes to risk. One Wall Street adage divides people into those who want to eat well and those who want to sleep well. But it's possible to do both, at least sometimes.
Ignore 95 percent of the tips you get, and keep in mind that some of the other 5 percent may involve information that can get you into trouble with the law: inside information, for example.
Hold on to your winning stocks, and jettison the losers. Many investors sell their winners much too soon, and hang on to their losers much too long, reluctant to admit their error.

BYLINE: By George Johnson

 BODY:
SOMETHING TO DIE FOR, by James Webb. (Avon, $5.99.) For purely political reasons, a Secretary of Defense schemes with a battle-hungry admiral to convince the President and Congress that a good war is just what America needs. Written by a former Secretary of the Navy and author of "Fields of Fire," this novel "should push Mr. Webb onto anyone's list of first-class military-political writers," David Murray said in The Book Review last year.
LUCIUS D. CLAY: An American Life, by Jean Edward Smith. (Owl/Holt, $19.95.) As head of the military forces that occupied Germany after World War II, Gen. Lucius D. Clay used his extraordinary powers as benevolent despot to help shape the vanquished country into the economic power it is today. In fact, his biographer argues, had it not been for Clay, the United States might have let the Soviet Union take all of Germany. "Mr. Smith's biography is masterly," Stephen E. Ambrose said here in 1990. "Mr. Smith provides large sections of his interviews with Clay, mixing them with his own research and analysis quite successfully. . . . I recommend this book without reservation." 
 REQUIEM, by Shizuko Go. Translated by Geraldine Harcourt. (Kodansha, $6.95.) In a novel that has been called a Japanese "Diary of Anne Frank," a girl whose parents, brother and friends are killed in World War II finds herself left with nothing but her patriotism. " 'Requiem' is a difficult but moving stream-of-consciousness work about the futility of war and the immorality of indoctrinating the young with imperialistic ideals," Carol Ames said here in 1985. As part of its new series of fiction by Japanese women, Kodansha has also republished Geraldine Harcourt's translation of CHILD OF FORTUNE by Yuko Tsushima ($6.95), which tells the story of a divorced woman struggling against her society's pressures to conform.
PRESIDENT REAGAN: The Role of a Lifetime, by Lou Cannon. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $16.) To Lou Cannon, the reporter who covered Ronald Reagan's political career from the Sacramento Statehouse to the White House, he "may have been the one President in the history of the republic who saw his election as a chance to get some rest." This book, Mr. Cannon's third about the Reagan phenomenon, "is the best study of that enigmatic Presidency yet available," our reviewer, Herbert S. Parmet, said in 1991.
THE KNEELING BUS, by Beverly Coyle. (Penguin, $9.) In one of these connected stories about growing up in Florida in the 1950's, the family of a liberal Methodist minister is scandalized when grandmother joins the Seventh-Day Adventists. In 1990 our reviewer, Pamela Cytrynbaum, said reading the book "is like roaming through Disneyland as a child: you wander from image to image, discovery to discovery, and when you're finished you want to do it all over again."
NOTHING IF NOT CRITICAL: Selected Essays on Art and Artists, by Robert Hughes. (Penguin, $13.) When this book by Time magazine's art critic was published last year, our reviewer, Paula Weideger, called it "the brainy, witty and perceptive chronicle of the mad honeymoon that followed the marriage of art and financial speculation."
SHADOWS ON THE MIRROR, by Frances Fyfield. (Pocket Books, $4.50.) Sarah Fortune, a promiscuous London lawyer, is being pursued by two colleagues -- Malcolm, her corpulent ex-lover, and Charles, a handsome man with a violent streak. Last year our reviewer, Marilyn Stasio, said Sarah and Malcolm are "the most endearing of lovers -- intelligent enough to be interesting, bruised enough to be sympathetic and unpredictable enough to be human."
DICKENS, by Peter Ackroyd. (Harper Perennial, $16.) At times this peculiar, 1,200-page biography of Charles Dickens "waddles along like a maudlin elephant that has attached itself to us against our will," James R. Kincaid said here last year. But he found virtue in the author's rare appreciation of how truly weird his subject was. "Mr. Ackroyd's great achievement is that he reinvests Dickens, that familiar figure of hearth and home, with an alien, slightly repellent mystery."
MAGIC HOUR, by Susan Isaacs. (Harper Paperbacks, $5.99.) A Long Island detective falls in love with the widow of a Hollywood producer who has been murdered at his home in the Hamptons. "Sailing through Susan Isaacs' new novel, 'Magic Hour,' is like polishing off an entire box of chocolate-covered chocolates," Helen Dudar said in The Book Review last year. "You know it can't be nourishing. But it is fun."
TALKING AT THE GATES: A Life of James Baldwin, by James Campbell. (Penguin, $10.) As a homosexual and a black, James Baldwin found life in the United States too much to bear. In this biography of the expatriate writer, James Campbell "has ably blended both scholarship and personal recollection," Michael E. Ross said here last year.
ANNE SEXTON: A Self-Portrait in Letters, edited by Linda Gray Sexton and Lois Ames. (Houghton Mifflin, $12.95.) When this collection of letters by the poet Anne Sexton was published in 1977, our reviewer, Margaret Atwood, said she was struck by "the sinuous, mercurial and engaging voice of . . . a flamboyant romantic, capable of extreme joy and extreme depression almost in the same minute." This edition includes a new foreword by Linda Gray Sexton, a daughter of the poet.

HEADLINE: FOOD;
Sweet on Yams

BYLINE: By Molly O'Neill

 BODY:
Everyone has a private dinner, at least everyone I know. A friend whose husband is out of town talks about her baked-potato supper as if it were a secret rendezvous. Another confesses to solitary evenings with Spam. On his bachelor evenings, one of my brothers looks forward to a meal of Frosted Flakes. Most private dinners are retro in origin and furtive in execution. In her book "Serve It Forth," M. F. K. Fisher calls such meals "secret eatings."
My mother's private dinner was a quart-size chocolate milkshake, and when she'd "had it with cooking," she served shakes to all of us. This happened perhaps five times in my entire life, but I remember each meal as an orgy, and I remember that she looked at once embarrassed and pleased. In the winter, her moments of despair or abandon, whichever it was, yielded hot chocolate and cinnamon toast. I adapted the menu during college: half a peck of popcorn, one tankard of instant hot chocolate. The meal endured for nearly a decade. 
 But now I bake yams. And so do a lot of people I know. They say it's because yams are so low in calories, high in carbohydrates and dense in beta carotenes, and because they pack such satisfying sweetness.
My own affair with yams began with their smell. That burnt sugary perfume reminds me of the pushcarts in Mexico City that hawk the toasted tubers. It takes me back to a New England fireplace where yams once roasted after a day of cross-country skiing. It reminds me of the smell that billows from Bob the Chef's restaurant in Boston, and from Sylvia's in Harlem. The smell is Thanksgiving, winter in Chinatown, a summer morning in a North Carolina market where I once sniffed sweet potato pie in the air. Every few months, on an evening when it's me and my yam, I waft among these places in the 40 minutes it takes to bake the sweet tuber, as the aroma slowly builds and detonates into one big blast of well-being in my kitchen.
Forgive the rhapsody. As Popeye would say, "I yam what I yam." And I am, by the way, not alone. In "Invisible Man," Ralph Ellison writes that the smell of Carolina yams roasting on a pushcart in Harlem, brought a "stab of swift nostalgia" that stopped him like a shot:
"At home we'd bake them in the hot coals of the fireplace, had carried them cold to school for lunch, munched them secretly, squeezing the sweet pulp from the soft peel as we hid from the teacher behind the largest book. . . . Yes, and we'd loved them candied, or baked in a cobbler, deep-fat fried in a pocket of dough, or roasted with pork and glazed with the well-browned fat; had chewed them raw -- yams and years ago."
What Americans call a yam is in fact a sweet potato, and the confusion is enduring and entrenched. The true yam, Dioscorea opposita, is a vining plant that probably originated in Asia, grows in the tropics and can reach a size of up to 600 pounds. On the Pacific island Ponape, writes Elizabeth Schneider in "Uncommon Fruits and Vegetables" yams are described as two-man, four-man and six-man yams, depending on how many it takes to lift them. It's tough to find even a two-hand yam in local groceries today.
According to "Seeds of Change," an exhibition at the Smithsonian that charts the interchange of Old and New World foods, Columbus may have started the confusion. On his famous journey of 1492, he was served sweet potatoes in the West Indies and wrote that they looked like yams and tasted like chestnuts. African slaves called them "nyam" or "nyami."
The sweet potato, or Ipomoea ba tatas, is a member of the morning-glory family that probably originated in Latin America. Today, Asia is a major producer, though the United States and Latin America are no weaklings in the international sweet-potato stakes. In "Why We Eat What We Eat," Raymond Sokolov writes that the International Potato Center in Lima, Peru, has identified more than 5,000 variations on the sweet potato.
The true yam has a neutral starchy flavor. The sweet potato, on the other hand, earns its name, even though the deeper its orange hue and the sweeter its taste, the greater the chance that it will be called a yam. In this country, the terms are interchangeable. So sacred is the tuber that the Trobriand Islanders in the South Pacific build ornate houses to display them. The Cubans reserve them for special occasions; in Japan they are used as a homeopathic fertility drug.
When Shakespeare was writing, the sweet potato, imported to England from Spain, was thought to be a potent aphrodisiac. "It was a luxury only to be enjoyed by the wealthy," according to "The History and Social Influence of the Potato" by Redcliffe Salaman. That reputation waned as sweet potatoes became a staple around the world. Yet the epicurean perversity to worship only the rare hasn't stripped the tuber of its mystique.
I have friends who now eat yams as they once ate an apple a day. They speak of yams as healthful, economical and convenient. But I suspect this is all just a way of rationalizing an evening alone with a yam.
I've edged toward going public with my private dinner. Even those who still think of yams as something baked with marshmallows have been converted. I began by slipping sweet-potato puree next to roast chicken and proceeded to scalloped versions, gratins and pan-fried cakes. Along the way I learned to buy medium-size yams that weigh about a third of a pound and are neither nicked or pocked; these tend to be sweeter and less woody than larger yams. It is best to store them in a cool place, but not the refrigerator.
The closest I've come to making yams the center of a meal was when I cooked them with risotto at a family reunion. And that may be as close as I ever get.
 
YAM SOUP WITH YOGURT
 
 6 medium yams, about 2 pounds, peeled, cut into 1-inch chunks
 1 red onion, peeled, coarsely chopped
 1 small clove garlic, peeled, finely chopped
 3 carrots, peeled, coarsely chopped
 1 rib celery, coarsely chopped
 1 bay leaf
 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves
1 1/2 quarts chicken broth, homemade or low-sodium canned
 1/2 teaspoon salt
 1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
 6 tablespoons plain low-fat yogurt
 6 sprigs flat-leaf parsley, stems removed, finely chopped.
1. Put the yams, onion, garlic, carrots, celery, bay leaf, thyme and chicken broth in a large pot. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Lower the heat and simmer until the yams are tender, about 30 minutes.
2. Puree the vegetables and broth in a blender until smooth. Pass the soup through a sieve. Continue to puree and strain until all of the vegetables and broth have been used. Season with salt and pepper.
3. Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with dollops of yogurt and chopped parsley.
Yield: Four to six servings.
 
BAKED YAMS WITH RED ONIONS
 
 3 medium red onions, peeled, cut into paper-thin round slices
 3 medium yams, about 1 pound, cut into thin round slices
 2 cups apple cider
 2 teaspoons brown sugar
 1/2 teaspoon salt
 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves
 1 tablespoon butter, cut into small pieces.
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a 9-inch round or oval gratin dish, place the red onion and yam slices in alternate layers.
2. Put the apple cider, brown sugar, salt and pepper in a small saucepan and stir over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Pour the hot cider over the onions and yams and sprinkle with the fresh thyme.
3. Distribute the pieces of butter over the top and cover the gratin dish with foil. Bake for 1 hour. Remove the foil and continue baking, basting often, until the onions and yams are tender, about 30 minutes.
Yield: Four to six servings.
 
RISOTTO WITH YAMS AND SAGE
(ADAPTED FROM THE UNION SQUARE CAFE, NEW YORK)
 
The broth:
 1 gallon chicken broth, homemade or low-sodium canned
 3 medium yams, about 1 pound total, peeled, cut in half
 1 carrot, peeled, cut into 1-inch pieces
 1 stalk celery, cut into 1-inch pieces
 
The garnish:
 1/2 teaspoon olive oil
 1 teaspoon water
 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
 1 cup shaved almonds
 
The risotto:
 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
 1 white onion, minced
 3 cups Arborio rice
10 cups broth (see above)
 1/2 cup fresh minced sage leaves
 1 tablespoon minced fresh chives
 1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese
 1/2 teaspoon salt
 1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
 2 cups bitter greens, like mustard or dandelion, rinsed and shredded
 1 cup fresh mozzarella, cut into 1/4-inch dice.
1. Combine the chicken broth, yams, carrot and celery in a large pot and bring to a boil. Lower heat and simmer until reduced to 10 cups, about 30 minutes. With a slotted spoon remove 1 yam, cut it into 1/2-inch dice and set aside to use in preparing the rice. Remove the broth and remaining vegetables from the heat, puree in a blender and set aside to cool.
2. Meanwhile, make the garnish. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Combine the olive oil, water, salt and cayenne in a bowl. Add the almonds and toss to coat them. Spread the almonds on a baking sheet and bake until golden, about 15 minutes. Remove from the sheet and set aside. The recipe can be done ahead to this point for up to 3 days before serving; refrigerate the broth and the diced yam.
3. Forty minutes before serving, warm the yam broth over low heat and bring the reserved yam to room temperature if necessary. In a heavy pot, melt the butter over low heat. Add the onion, cover and cook until soft, about 5 minutes, stirring to avoid browning. Add the rice and stir well. Ladle in 1/2 cup of the broth and stir. Increase the heat to medium-high and for the next half hour continue ladling in the broth and stirring the rice to help it absorb the liquid and to prevent it from sticking. After 20 minutes, add the diced yam. When 1 cup of yam broth remains, the rice should be tender. If it is not, add simmering water and continue stirring until it is. Removefrom the heat immediately.
4. Vigorously stir in the remaining yam broth. This should make a very soupy porridge. Quickly stir in half the minced sage and chives and the Parmesan. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper to taste. Stir in the greens and carefully stir in the mozzarella. Divide among bowls. Garnish with a sprinkling of the spiced almonds and the remaining fresh sage and chives and serve immediately.
Yield: Four large servings as a main course, or eight to ten as an appetizer.
 
YAM AND CELERY CUSTARD
 
 1 meaty ham hock, quartered
 1 bay leaf
 4 black peppercorns, crushed
 4 cups chicken broth, homemade or low-sodium canned
 2 medium yams, about 2/3 pound, peeled, coarsely chopped
 1 small onion, peeled, finely chopped
 1 small clove garlic, peeled, finely chopped
 2 carrots, peeled, coarsely chopped
 2 stalks celery, coarsely chopped
 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves
 1 tablespoon butter
 2 eggs plus 2 egg yolks
 3/4 cup low-fat milk.
1. Put the ham hock, bay leaf and peppercorns in a small saucepan. Add the chicken broth and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Lower the heat and simmer until reduced to 1 1/4 cups, about 45 minutes. Remove the ham hock and discard.
2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Put the yams, onion, garlic, carrots, celery, thyme and 1/4 cup of the broth into a small baking dish or casserole. Cover with aluminum foil and bake until the vegetables are tender, about 45 minutes. Set aside to cool.
3. Grease a 9-inch round baking dish with the butter. In a blender, puree the vegetables with 1 cup of the broth until smooth. Add the eggs and milk. Pour the custard into the baking dish. Bake at 350 degrees until set, for 30 to 40 minutes.
Yield: Six servings.

HEADLINE: Memo to the Democrats

BYLINE: By SIDNEY BLUMENTHAL AND JAMES CHACE; Sidney Blumenthal, a senior editor at The New Republic, is the author of "Pledging Allegiance: The Last Campaign of the Cold War." James Chace, the Luce Professor in Freedom of Inquiry and Expression at Bard College, is the author of "The Consequences of the Peace," to be published this spring.

 BODY:
George Bush's alpha and omega, the public opinion polls, are now signaling the most potentially important opening of the 1992 campaign: the foreign policy President is vulnerable on foreign policy. By late January, shortly after he limped back from Japan, polls showed that less than half of Americans approved of the way he was handling foreign policy -- the first time his approval rating had dropped below 50 percent in that vital category, the essence of his Presidential persona.
And yet the Democrats still don't seem to understand the political salience of confronting Bush on foreign issues. They either defer to his looming image as foreign policy wise man or render easy moral judgments about, say, his China policy. Both approaches play into the game plan of the Republicans, who will inevitably try to cast the Democratic nominee as weak and soft -- a "carping little liberal," as Bush has said -- incapable of a sustained and vigorous defense of the national interest. 
 The Democrats' opportunity to take the offensive on foreign policy is unparalleled since 1964. But for the Democratic candidate to defeat Bush and govern successfully, he must compellingly draw the connections between the Republican foreign policy and the insolvency that is sapping the country's strength. Suddenly, it is possible to depict George Bush as weak, an apostle of decline, while the Democratic nominee can present himself as the tribune of American strength and renewal. The Democrats, at last, have available to them potent themes -- progress versus paralysis, strength versus weakness. But their full political force can be brought to bear only by making the foreign policy case.
 
THE THEMES
The Democratic candidates must do more than claim the rhetoric of change. They must also display the substance that is the emblem of confidence and readiness. There are several central concepts that can provide the Democratic campaign -- and Presidency -- with a galvanizing sense of purpose.
The Democrats, to begin with, have neglected their own legacy, the legacy of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who forged a synthesis of idealism and realism and balanced the domestic and international agendas. Many of the candidates fatally assume that the path to success is to assign foreign policy to Bush (negative) and reserve domestic policy (positive) for themselves. With the end of the cold war, they seem relieved not to have to deal with foreign affairs.
But this is a staggering illusion. If they fail to redefine foreign policy, they will not only make themselves defenseless before Bush's attacks; without a new foreign policy, their hopes for the revival of domestic policy will be frustrated by continuing budget deficits. Quite simply, a new domestic agenda is impossible without a more realistic and less costly foreign one. While the candidates have put forward individual proposals, mostly for defense cuts, these in themselves do not constitute a foreign policy. What is missing at the beginning of a new era is the Rooseveltian imperative: the need for a new internationalism.
But the new internationalism must be based on the dictum of the great columnist Walter Lippmann. During World War II, while F.D.R. drafted plans for the postwar world, Lippmann laid down the cardinal principle of foreign policy: "Without the controlling principle that the nation must maintain its objectives and its power in equilibrium," he wrote, "its purposes within its means and its means equal to its purposes, its commitments related to its resources and its resources adequate to its commitments, it is impossible to think at all about foreign affairs." Insolvency, according to Lippmann, must eventually lead to nothing less than "disaster." It is this prospect that now faces Bush -- and the country.
During the cold war, our means expanded to meet expanded ends. Now our ends -- a crusade against "instability" and "uncertainty" -- are defined by the President so broadly and vaguely that they defy practical meaning. By the same token, the means to fight the cold war have not been remade to fit any new strategy. By failing to right an economy that has led the United States in less than a decade from being a creditor to a debtor nation that owes the world half a trillion dollars, Bush has violated the solvency principle. Through the peculiar combination of utopian rhetoric and myopic tactics that he substitutes for a foreign policy, the President is incapable of offering anything more than symbolic gestures to deal with the anarchic disorder that horrifies him.
Bush does not grasp the crisis into which he has plunged the country. But even if he did, his partisan commitments would make it virtually impossible for him to voice even a hint of understanding; for that would demand a searching critique of the past 12 years. Democrats should stress that Bush can no more break with the policy of insolvency than he can break from his party. The two have become one and the same. His Presidency, perforce, must lead to decline.
The Democrats should also hammer at the point that a second Bush term may well leave America ready to cede its place as the first economic power to Japan and soon thereafter to a united Europe led by Germany. On every major issue, the Democratic nominee should emphasize that the election will be a choice between decline and change, weakness and strength.
These are the themes. The next step is to translate them into concrete proposals that can emerge as campaign issues. We believe there are four central foreign policy issues that play into the Democrats' hands.
 
 
THE ISSUES
 NATO. The notion that Russia or the Commonwealth of Independent States is poised to send tank columns crashing through the Fulda Gap is patently absurd. Equally obvious is the fact that NATO has become obsolete. As an enormous, cold war military alliance, it is hardly configured to cope with the security needs of the new Europe. These include thwarting the rise of authoritarian regimes through military coups, intervening in civil wars and preventing existing boundaries from being altered by force. Still, the President stubbornly holds fast to the past, discouraging even a modest proposal by France and Germany to expand their joint military force to 50,000 troops from 4,200. Worse, by continuing to finance the anachronistic ends of the old order, Bush is deepening insolvency.
In his 1992 budget, President Bush calls for actual defense spending of more than $300 billion, and a five-year defense spending plan of $1.15 trillion (including the $50 billion in cuts outlined in his State of the Union address) -- numbers not adduced from any strategy but out of thin air. These projections are still loosely based on the now-phantom objectives of containing and deterring the defunct Soviet Union. Although the President has proposed withdrawing substantial numbers of troops from Europe, he plans to move them to the United States. This represents no savings at all; indeed, the costs of maintaining them at home may well be higher. At the very least, we will continue to allocate about half the defense budget -- some $150 billion -- to NATO's antiquarian defense of Europe.
Rather than clinging to a Western alliance that is directed at an invisible threat, the Democrats should propose a new European and Atlantic security organization that would include what remains of the former Soviet Union and the former Warsaw Pact countries, and insure that limited numbers of American troops remain on the continent with a purpose. The number of American troops could run as low as perhaps 50,000 -- the number is not a theological question -- but they would be there with a new mission. The central premise of the successor organization to NATO would be to assure Europeans that aggression by any country against its neighbor would be met with a united response.
Perhaps the most important element of the new alliance would be to compel the militaries of former Communist states to cooperate with their United States and European counterparts. Permanent participation in the multinational organization would lead inevitably to the democratic reform of the old military structures and mentalities, as occurred in the case of postwar Germany. The economic assimilation of eastern Europe into the West must be linked to military assimilation. Large-scale economic aid in the future would be contingent on military inclusion in the new security organization.
The establishment of a new Western alliance would be the rough analogue of the Marshall Plan and the founding of NATO -- the foundation for peace. It would also be the single greatest action in helping to bring our ends in line with our means. With savings of at least $150 billion (between $316 billion and $619 billion cumulatively for the rest of the decade, according to a Brookings Institution study), money would become available to support the numerous Democratic proposals to revitalize the nation, from health care to education to public works.
THE NUCLEAR THREAT. Our greatest military security threat today comes not from the weapons of the declared nuclear powers but from the proliferation of nuclear weapons to other countries -- North Korea, Iraq, Pakistan. Bush has rhetorically acknowledged the problem but has taken no effective steps to reduce the threat. He emphatically refuses to sign the comprehensive test-ban treaty, which is essential to induce the remaining nonnuclear countries to sign the nonproliferation treaty.
The Democrats should promise to sign the test-ban treaty, and further propose a suspension of economic aid to any nation that refuses to sign the nonproliferation treaty. The Democrats should point out that this policy would make it easier to isolate "crazy states" like Iraq from the start -- an alternative to Bush's early appeasement.
Having at last acknowledged the end of the cold war, and fitfully moving to reduce strategic nuclear warheads to perhaps as low as 4,700, Bush nonetheless has no strategic rationale for his numbers. The Democrats should argue for a policy of "minimum deterrence," which would mean reducing the long-range warheads on both sides to a minimum number, about 1,000 on each side and signing the test-ban treaty. Once again, the correct policy is also the less expensive policy, which allows Democrats to stand for growth and regeneration at home as well as strength and security abroad. In all this, Bush has again provided Democrats with a prime campaign issue, if only they would seize it.
BLOOD, SAND AND OIL. Bush will no doubt try to capitalize on the Persian Gulf war, which most Democrats opposed. So the Presidential candidates will have to concede that Bush achieved two of his aims: securing the Saudi frontier, thus thwarting Saddam's potential hegemony over the price of oil, and wresting Kuwait from Saddam. But they should stress how badly the President lost the peace. In retrospect, it appears that Bush went to war to make the Persian Gulf safe for feudalism. Not only was Saddam permitted to remain in power, he also was allowed to butcher Kurds and Shiites while our forces stood by.
The Arab-Israeli peace conference is one of the main means by which Bush is trying to justify the gulf war, as if the obligations incurred on all sides can yield a general conciliation. Certainly, it is praiseworthy to take up where Jimmy Carter's Camp David diplomacy left off. The conference may offer some promise of an agreement between Israel and the Palestinians on the West Bank for some form of autonomy and self-government. But it is hard to envision much else. In this respect, Bush risks American prestige on arranging a highly unlikely general peace that, should it fail, will arouse bitterness throughout the Middle East.
In any event, the Democratic candidates should stress that the gulf war belongs to the past, and they should emphasize where the war has left us strategically. In the world's most dangerously unstable region, the Administration has committed the United States as the guarantor of the balance of power. Hence, with no new world order in sight, the President seems on the verge of committing us to a longstanding and entangling involvement.
An alternative must include making a strong case for energy independence. Besides the obvious economic and environmental benefits, a renewed energy policy can be used to reduce the leverage the Persian Gulf states exercise over United States policy in the region. Once again, the Democratic candidates should expose Bush's posture of strength as a veneer for a deeper weakness. He is losing the future because he is bound to the past.
TRADE WARS. These days, most Americans feel more threatened by foreign trade than foreign military power. While ideologically committed to free trade, Bush has slid into a simplistic, unthinking version of "managed trade," extracting promises of foreign purchases in return for access to American markets. The Bush Administration's only other trade policy is to drive down the value of the dollar in an effort to make our goods cheaper. But a weak currency does not translate into a strong economy.
American voters consistently reject protectionist policies, sensibly recognizing that they sacrifice at least as many jobs as they save and that the reality of a global economy cannot be wished away. Thus, the Democrats should simply call for a "level playing field" and, once again, emphasize that it is the misguided Bush who is leading the country away from that goal.
The Democratic nominee should also strive to explain the cold war bargain that has landed us in this predicament. In the early cold war years, Washington actually granted allies, like Japan, special trade favors and access to our technology in return for allowing us to set up bases on their soil and provide for their security. In recent years, America has borne the exorbitant costs of maintaining a global military establishment in return for foreign capital to maintain the deficit that drains our ability to rejuvenate ourselves.
While the rest of the advanced economic powers engage in industrial strategies, Bush adheres to the myth of laissez faire. His ideological references to the strength of frontier individualism (a pose struck to fend off his right wing) obscure the actual insolvent bargain he has struck -- and his own reactive protectionism. Democrats should stress that as long as Bush clings to a foreign policy of insolvency, America can't hope to reverse the erosion of its technology, infrastructure and standard of living.
Clearly, the world needs new economic and financial institutions to replace or augment the trading system that was set up after World War II at Bretton Woods. There are no common rules for antitrust, dumping, subsidies or copyright of intellectual property, among other things. Without them, countries with coherent industrial strategies will always have an advantage. Free trade will not come about by ignoring these differences, nor by incantations of Ronald Reagan's rhetoric. Yet the ultimate practitioner of "voodoo economics" is none other than the one who gave it its fitting name.
GEORGE BUSH, unfortunately, is a man of the past. His reactive, patchwork approach in domestic policy is precisely mirrored in foreign policy. In both realms, Bush's ends are hollow, his means bankrupt. But his failure to conceive a solvent foreign policy is not due mainly to his reactive approach. By training and experience, Bush was admirably prepared to lead the United States in tactical, cold war maneuvering of the sort that has become obsolete. But his world view is now an anachronism. Further, he can hardly be expected to lead against the very policies of national paralysis he has promulgated for more than a decade. He has no choice but to take his place as the standard-bearer of decline.
The task of the Democratic Presidential candidate is to make clear just how costly it will be at home and abroad to continue with Bush's insolvent regime. In the triumphal aftermath of the cold war, George Bush is presiding over the dissolution of the American Century.

HEADLINE: ART VIEW;
J. Carter Brown . . . and Beyond

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
When J. Carter Brown surprised almost everyone last month and announced his resignation as director of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, he brought to a close a chapter in the evolution not only of his own institution but of all American museums. Such was the impact of his tenure that before Mr. Brown assumed his post in 1969, the image of an art museum was one thing, and today it is something else.
Although he was hardly alone in reshaping that image, his contribution was vital. The quiet gallery that he took over has become a strutting giant on the international stage, a purveyor of major traveling exhibitions and a center for the study of the visual arts. With its glamorous addition designed by the architect I. M. Pei that doubled the institution's physical size, and its wide array of educational and scholarly programs, the gallery is an exemplar of what museums aspired to become during the expansionist 1970's and 80's. And the brilliant and energetic Mr. Brown has come to epitomize the museum director. 
 Following upon the unsteady lead of his occasional rival, Thomas Hoving, the former director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Mr. Brown successfully realized the aim of expanding the role of museums in public life. In his resignation letter, in which he cited family and other reasons for his decision, he stated that "it is time the gallery should have the opportunity of fresh leadership." With major museums from Brooklyn to Boston to Detroit facing hard times, perhaps the 57-year-old Mr. Brown is anticipating that the museum of the 90's will be a less lavish place than the one he helped to create, and that the person at its helm will have to be his opposite, a master of retrenchment.
Central to his vision has been the big exhibition. It is fitting, and perhaps not coincidental, that he chose to resign shortly after the close of the largest show that the gallery has ever presented, "Circa 1492: Art in the Age of Exploration," which brought together about 600 objects from Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas. During the 1960's, when Mr. Brown was being groomed for the directorship by his predecessor, John Walker, the gallery had only one space devoted to temporary shows. Exhibitions tended to be modest, spartan affairs.
Since taking over, Mr. Brown has vastly broadened the offerings, staging temporary displays of the art of many cultures, not just the European and American art to which the gallery limits its own collection. He has proved to be a master at beguiling government and corporate officials into sponsoring mass-appeal shows. The $94 million, 450,000-square-foot East Building that Mr. Pei designed, which opened in 1978 millions of dollars over budget, may be the clearest expression of Mr. Brown's penchant for grand, theatrical statements.
Whether it was "Treasures of Tutankhamun" (1977) or "Treasure Houses of Britain" (1986) or the multicultural extravaganza that was "Circa 1492," Mr. Brown has embraced the blockbuster with an enthusiasm that has drawn criticism upon the gallery as it has also drawn large numbers of people to it. Annual attendance shot up from about one million visitors a year when he took over to a high of seven million.
Despite his roots (as a descendant of the family that founded Brown University) and his patrician manner, which have served him well at raising financial and political support in high places and at playing host at the gallery's glittering parties, Mr. Brown is at heart a populist. He conceives of the National Gallery as just that -- the nation's art museum, supported by taxpayers, and as such, a place that must be inclusive and accessible. This is one of Mr. Brown's greatest strengths. He has been an exceptionally eloquent advocate for the importance of art, and the gallery's popularity has proved his point.
The emphasis on special exhibitions has not come without costs. He has been criticized for putting too much stress on blockbusters and on shows that seem longer on style than on content, an attitude suggested by the unusual power that he has vested in the gallery's design department even over selecting and organizing exhibitions.
The criticism is not altogether fair. For every shallow exhibition like the one of Andrew Wyeth's "Helga" paintings in 1987, there have been many more substantive shows, both small and large. In recent years, the gallery has offered a string of displays focusing on single works of art, like Titian's "Flaying of Marsyas" and Bellini's "Feast of the Gods," that are models of their kind. It has organized major exhibitions of Veronese, Van Dyck, Matisse and Jasper Johns, to name a few, that are among the most stimulating and thoughtful shows to have been seen anywhere.
Mr. Brown has nonetheless thrown himself most enthusiastically and publicly into projects like "Treasure Houses of Britain," with its array of hundreds of decorative and other objects, and "Circa 1492." Whatever their intent, these gigantic displays flaunted the National Gallery's clout at extracting priceless loans from governments, institutions and private collectors around the world. In turn, the gallery has had to reciprocate by lending out its own treasures. Transporting valuable objects without compelling reasons has only heightened skepticism about the gallery's exhibition policies.
Mr. Brown has also stressed shows of private collections that can include remarkable and usually inaccessible works, but that have sometimes sacrificed scholarship to the stroking of collectors' egos. The gallery has hardly been alone in any of these practices, yet no American institution, except for the larger Metropolitan, has had a more ambitious and more high-profile exhibition program. The history of American museums during the last 20 years is replete with stories of Mr. Brown jousting, sometimes acrimoniously, with Mr. Hoving and Philippe de Montebello, Mr. Hoving's successor at the Metropolitan, over traveling shows like "Tutankhamun," "The Vatican Collections" and "Titian," and for the corporate support they require.
One often repeated story involves "The Splendor of Dresden" exhibition of 1978. Mr. Brown was incensed when he discovered that the Metropolitan had arranged to do the show. He had broached the idea with the State Department after learning that diplomatic relations between the United States and East Germany would soon be normalized. The department asked that he wait while negotiations between the countries were ironed out, and he complied, only to learn that the New York museum was pursuing the project. Mr. Brown called his friend David Rockefeller, whose name he had seen in a State Department cable mentioning the show, to referee a treaty with Mr. Hoving and the Metropolitan's chairman, C. Douglas Dillon. The result was a joint undertaking that began its American tour as the inaugural show at the National Gallery's East Building and concluded its tour at the Metropolitan.
The popular success of special exhibitions at those two institutions promoted a pattern for museums across the country through the 1970's and 80's. Blockbusters became one obvious way to fuel their budgets and build popular support for new buildings, acquisitions and programs -- which in turn had to be sustained by more blockbusters. What happened to overextended American businesses in the last few years happened to a number of museums. At a time when the economy is sagging and blockbusters have become riskier and more complicated, museums are scrambling to find ways to stay afloat and avoid crippling cutbacks.
As director, Mr. Brown has persuaded Congress to increase annual Federal spending on the gallery, from $3 million to $52 million. One obvious challenge for Mr. Brown's successor will be to sustain that level of support at a time of declining corporate help and widespread calls for slashing the Federal budget.
Another challenge involves the permanent collection. Mr. Brown is not best known for acquisitions, although he did strengthen the gallery's holdings in various ways. Some 20,000 works have come into the gallery's possession during Mr. Brown's tenure, among them Georges de la Tour's "Repentant Magdalene" and Jusepe de Ribera's "Martyrdom of Saint Bartholomew." The Old Master drawings department has been improved by recent acquisitions like those from the Ian Woodner collection. And Mr. Brown has overseen the creation of almost the entire 20th-century collection, which includes such postwar landmarks as Jackson Pollock's "Lavender Mist" and Barnett Newman's "Stations of the Cross."
A policy prohibiting the sale of works by the gallery has attracted various donors, like the Mark Rothko Foundation -- as that policy has also discouraged the gallery from acquiring objects by less established artists. And Mr. Brown has loudly touted the gallery's status as the nation's art museum to entice donors on patriotic grounds -- even if that sometimes has rankled with museums in the cities where those donors live.
Yet the astronomical prices for art in the 1980's rendered inadequate even the $56 million acquisitions fund that Mr. Brown worked hard to put together. And to see works of art that have been bought in recent years at museums like the Nelson-Atkins in Kansas City and the Kimbell in Fort Worth is to realize that ultimately he did not concentrate on this area with the energy he devoted to shows.
His sympathy for areas like 16th- and 17th-century Northern European paintings and his apparent lack of enthusiasm for German Expressionist paintings, of which the gallery has notably few examples, has skewed purchases. Publications devoted to the permanent collection have taken a back seat to exhibition catalogues. And although the curatorial and conservation staff he has assembled includes distinguished members, it does not challenge Mr. Brown's status as the gallery's star.
Now that the age of the imperial museum seems on the wane, the role for Mr. Brown's successor, as for American museum directors elsewhere in the 90's, looks increasingly to be as champion of the permanent resources rather than impresario of temporary spectacles.
This does not mean that museums will have to be less intriguing places. Their collections can be put to more creative uses in exhibitions like the ones that have been so successful at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the gallery's own focused displays. Museums that have justified blockbusters by claiming they made converts to art will be called upon to prove it in lower-budget shows that promote closer and more thoughtful looking. The possibility is an increased respect for the permanent holdings.
Mr. Brown has been America's premier art impresario for two decades. It will not be easy to find a director who can shape the future of museums as potently as he has helped to shape their past.

From Bill Morrissey, Blue-Collar Angst With a Folk Touch

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
In the title song on Bill Morrissey's fourth album, "Inside," the narrator admits to his companion that their treadmill life certainly "ain't Hollywood." Singing in a quiet, gravelly voice against which Suzanne Vega's softer harmony rings like a mournful echo, Mr. Morrissey, a 40-year-old folk singer and songwriter from New England, describes the dreary existence of an unemployed worker who has recently given up drinking. He fixes dinner each night when his wife, a waitress, returns to their furnished room. Then they wait up to watch the late movie on a black-and-white television set.
Winding through the stark, matter-of-fact language is a solo violin played by Johnny Cunningham that evokes all the regrets and disappointments that cannot be stifled. Despite adversity, however, the relationship seems to be holding. "And you won't leave soon/ Because I know/ You're just like me/ With no place to go," the singer reminds her. "Call it love if you think you should/ There's no need to explain." 
 "Inside," like Mr. Morrissey's best songs, has a terseness, precision of detail and a tone of laconic understatement that relate his lyrics to the fiction of writers like Raymond Carver and Richard Ford. In the lineage of pop, Mr. Morrissey belongs to a modern acoustic folk tradition that goes back to Woody Guthrie and that includes not only the early Bob Dylan and John Prine but also Bruce Springsteen and Tom Waits in their more folkish, songs-of-the-common-man modes.
Mr. Morrissey, who grew up in Acton, Mass., and Hartford and attended Plymouth State College in New Hampshire, is no overnight sensation. He has performed for two decades on the New England coffeehouse circuit while drifting from job to job and town to town, punching factory time clocks and working on fishing boats, in gas stations and fast-food parlors.
Many of his songs are steeped in a mood of stiff-upper-lip, blue-collar angst. Their grayness is often augmented by stark images of the landscape of industrial New England in winter. The pervasive chill is frequently thawed by whisky and a playfully ironic sense of humor.
Mr. Morrissey released his first album, "Bill Morrissey" (Philo/Rounder 1105; CD and cassette), in 1984, and re-recorded its songs last year with improved sound, adding three new selections. Two albums, the austere "North" (Philo/Rounder 1106; all three formats), and the more rollicking "Standing Eight" (Philo/Rounder PH 1023; all three formats) followed. "Inside" (Philo/Rounder PH 1145; CD and cassette) is Mr. Morrissey's best-sounding record, largely because of Mr. Cunningham's expressive fiddle, which threads through five songs, pining dolefully on some numbers, dancing the jig on others.
The tight-lipped blue-collar realist is only one of several aspects of Mr. Morrissey's musical personality to be showcased favorably on the new album. Another side is a surreal trickster who suggests a milder mannered offshoot of the mid-1960's Bob Dylan. "Everybody Warned Me" is a gently phantasmagoric road song that recycles "look out kid," the same warning that punctuated Mr. Dylan's "Subterranean Homesick Blues." "Gambler's Blues" is crowded with allegorical figures named the Jack of Diamonds, Miss Downtown and St. Louis, a fellow who toots a broken horn. The title character of "Sister Jo" is a close spiritual relative of the threatening harpies who appear in such Dylan songs as "She Belongs to Me" and "Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues."
On "Inside" Mr. Morrissey also has a streak of the blues singer in him, most strongly in "Robert Johnson," a tribute to the seminal blues guitarist in which John Jennings's electric twangs echo Johnson's signature sound. But it is in the sober confessional monologues of characters like the narrator of "Inside" and "Off-White" that Mr. Morrissey's talent burns most intensely.
A bare-bones waltz, "Off-White" describes two people who have been burned but who are still anticipating a second marriage. This time, the narrator promises, "We'll hire us a band/ That won't play 'Proud Mary'/ No matter how late it gets." He adds: "Maybe you weren't my first/ The way I wasn't yours. But the last love is the sweetest of all."
Even better is "Man From Out of Town," the story of a drifter who settles down only to watch his home and possessions go up in flames on a rainy night. In the middle of the fire he imagines he hears the telephone ringing inside. The story works as both a vignette and a bleak parable of a rambler's inability to put down roots once he has left home. In one verse, the man compares a priest heeding Jesus's voice to his own response to the alluring sound of a train in the distance.
Not the least of Mr. Morrissey's contributions to modern folk music is the way his songs imprint an indelible vision of working-class New England onto the broader map of American pop literature. At their best and leanest -- conjuring up a landscape of church steeples, silver maples and wind-blasted seacoast streets -- Mr. Morrissey's songs have the force of poetry.

A Wannabe Who Got to Be

BYLINE: By Bruce Weber

 BODY:
Some 15 years ago, Griffin Dunne became a movie producer because he wasn't getting work as an actor. Now he's working as an actor in a play about a guy who wants to become a movie producer.
The play, "Search and Destroy" by Howard Korder, which opens Wednesday at Circle in the Square Uptown, concerns Martin Mirkheim, a ne'er-do-well with big dreams and a big tax bill, who is convinced that if he can buy the movie rights to an obscure book by a mysterious self-help guru his problems will be over. Needless to say, he suffers disillusionment at the hands of the guru, and is swept into a maelstrom involving cocaine-dealing and murder. The play, a black comedy by the author of "Boys' Life," is directed by David Chambers. 
 "It's about a guy who wants to do what I do for a living," Mr. Dunne said over a plate of pasta, heavy on the garlic. "He wants to validate himself by doing something creative. But he doesn't want to do the work."
For Mr. Dunne, a boyish-looking 36 years old, the work has been divided between acting and producing since he and two partners, Amy Robinson and Mark Metcalf, bought an option on the Ann Beattie novel "Chilly Scenes of Winter." "We had no idea how to make a movie," Mr. Dunne said, recalling that the three made cold calls to production managers, asking, "What do we do now?"
The movie, which was released as "Head Over Heels" in 1979, featured Mr. Dunne in a small role, which, he said, attracted some acting offers. Since then, he's appeared in several films, including Martin Scorsese's "After Hours," and "Once Around," which was produced by Double Play Productions, the company he formed with Ms. Robinson. On the horizon for Double Play is "The Foreigner," a play by Larry Shue, adapted by the novelist Don DeLillo, and a screen version of Scott Spencer's novel "Waking the Dead," in which Mr. Dunne will also star.
It all began serendipitously in the late 1970's, Mr. Dunne said, when he was an unemployed actor managing the popcorn concession at Radio City Music Hall. One day, he and Ms. Robinson and Mr. Metcalf drove to Cambridge, Mass., unannounced and uninvited, to persuade Ms. Beattie to sell them the rights to the film.
"We called from a corner and said, 'Can we come over?' " Mr. Dunne remembered. "Later, she said she gave us the rights because when we arrived, it was like three of her characters walking in the door."

Pension Funds for One-Family Houses

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
THE recent decision by the California Public Employees Retirement System to invest $375 million in the construction of one-family houses within the state is being welcomed by builders here, who have been squeezed by a severe shortage of financing.
The first large-scale investment by a public pension fund in residential construction is being watched closely by builders across the country, who think it could spur similar moves by public pension funds in other states and open up a potentially huge source of new financing. 
 Officers of the California retirement system, known as Calpers, said in January that $75 million would be invested with each of three outside investment advisers to provide financing for home builders. Last week, it voted to give an additional $75 million each to two more advisers.
Although details are still being worked out, the advisers will most likely share ownership in new housing projects and help arrange financing packages that would also include bank loans as well as equity investments by the builders themselves.
Builders said the $375 million from Calpers, when combined with the bank financing, could pay for the construction of at least 5,000 homes in California. Because of the recession and the financing squeeze, the number of one-family housing starts in California, the nation's largest housing market, tumbled steadily and drastically from a high of 163,000 in 1989 to 74,000 last year.
Developers say they remain confident that the economy will right itself this year and that California, which has been hit hard by rising unemployment -- its unemployment rate was 8.1 percent in January, one point higher than the national rate -- will resume its course of steady growth
But builders have remained much more troubled by the lack of financing, a result of the failure of many savings and loan institutions and the tighter Federal regulation of banks and savings institutions.
The Calpers investment by itself will not solve the financing crisis, which has made it hard for most builders to get the acquisition, development and construction loans they need for their projects. Most estimates are that the total reduction in available financing amounts to billions of dollars a year within California and tens of billions nationwide.
Public pension funds, which provide retirement benefits for state and local government employees, have invested heavily in commercial real estate and in apartment buildings. But they have never shown much interest in one-family-home projects, in part because of the risks in buying land, improving it, winning all the necessary zoning approvals and then building and selling the homes.
But Calpers officials said they have come to believe that helping to finance new homes in California, especially homes affordable to first-time buyers, is a good investment.
The state's population, which rose 25 percent between 1980 and 1990, continues to grow rapidly -- it is estimated to have passed 30 million now -- and there is an acute shortage of affordable housing. In 1989, 54.6 percent of households in the state owned their own homes, compared with 64 percent nationwide.
Calpers, which has a reputation as an astute investor, believes it can earn as much as 22 percent on its investment. Last month, the pension fund awarded the right to invest the money to three real estate-oriented money-management firms: California Housing Advisors, a venture set up by Montgomery Securities of San Francisco; a unit of Wells Fargo & Company of San Francisco, and the Prudential Realty Group, a subsidiary of the Prudential Insurance Company of America. Last week, it added Alex. Brown Kleinwort Benson of Sacramento and AMB Institutional Realty Advisors of San Francisco to the list.
Those firms will select which projects to back and will arrange financing for each.
Calpers directed that most of the financing go for construction of affordable homes, which builders take to mean houses within reach of first-time buyers. The statewide median price of a one-family home, $198,000, masks significant regional variations, with the low end ranging from under $100,000 in a few areas to more than $300,000 in Los Angeles and San Francisco.
"In looking at the current situation in the housing industry in the state, the consensus seemed to be that there's still good demand out there," said DeWitt Bowman, chief investment officer for Calpers. "The demographics are good and when affordable housing does come on the market, it sells well."
Some investment analysts said Calpers was partially motivated by growing political pressure to use some of its huge investment portfolio to help the state's faltering economy. The analysts said that pension funds in other states may not have the same motivation as Calpers to enter the residential building field, and indeed that pension funds may continue to find the risk of investing in the land acquisition and housing development too high.
STILL, a growing number of pension fund advisers think other funds will follow the lead of Calpers and begin investing in residential housing development projects, becoming major sources of financing along with banks and savings institutions.
"Investment in single-family product will become de rigeur for public pension funds in the 1990's," said a new report from Equitable Real Estate Investment Management of Atlanta.
"The concept that the largest pension fund in California and one of the largest in the country is investing specifically in California is very encouraging," said Robert Rivinius, chief executive of the California Building Industry Association. "Other pension funds will be watching it, and I know they will find the returns to be good and the investments to be safe."
Ultimately, Mr. Rivinius said, pension-fund financing could go a long way toward replacing the old financing from banks and savings institutions.
"We're into a new way of doing business," Mr. Rivinius said. "We've got a new ball game and this is a new ball."
James Z. Pugash, an executive vice president of California Housing Advisors, said he envisions arranging financing packages under which the builder would typically have to put up 10 percent of the total cost as equity. The money management firm, using capital from Calpers, would put up another 20 percent of the cost in equity. The remaining 70 percent would come from banks in the form of loans.
The bank lenders would be paid interest; any profits from the venture would be divided by the builder and the money manager under as-yet undefined terms. Ultimately, the bulk of the profits earned by the money manager would flow to Calpers.
Calpers officials and the money managers said they hope to work out the details and get the program running within a few months.
The new financing cannot come too soon for builders like Bob Ragle of Eagle Ridge Developments in Santa Rosa, Calif.
"Half of the banks I used to use don't exist anymore and the others are extremely cautious," said Mr. Ragle, who because of the financing squeeze is now able to build one new project a year instead of the two or three he used to do. "Any kind of financial help as far as getting subdivision improvements and housing starts going would be an improvement.
"What I'm looking forward to is an additional source of funds that will allow me to get back to a normal situation in my business."

HEADLINE: Apartment Sales: Mixed Signals

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
SUSAN WEST recently inherited an eight-room co-op in a prewar building in the Carnegie Hill section of Manhattan. On Jan. 1, she put the apartment up for sale for almost $875,000. She then received seven bids and in three weeks sold it for close to her asking price.
"We really wanted to sell it quickly, but I was surprised that it happened this fast," said Ms. West, a book editor. "I think it happened because it is a very good apartment, and I think it was priced right." 
 As New York's real estate recession enters its fourth year, Ms. West's story offers a glimmer of hope for co-op and condominium owners saddled with high-priced, hard-to-sell properties. Unfortunately, though, the plight of Howard Diller remains much more common. His eight-room co-op on Central Park West has been for sale for 18 months. His asking price has dropped from $1.4 million to $995,000. He has had only two offers, both in the mid-$700,000's, and rejected both.
"In the mid-80's, people were pleading, they would try to bribe me to sell them the apartment," said Mr. Diller, a lawyer. "We could have had $1.7 million to $1.85 million, easily. There was nothing available on Central Park West at the time. Then it was like a bomb exploded -- the recession, concern where the city was going."
These contrasting experiences of sellers are examples of the increasingly mixed state of the New York City co-op and condominium market. Though it has been ravaged by recession -- brokers estimate that co-op prices in Manhattan have declined by 20 to 40 percent since 1988 -- the market is also showing some spotty signs of recovery.
Foremost, perhaps, has been a spurt of sales prompted by auctions and deep, one-time-only price cuts or rebates. At the mammoth Lincoln Towers complex on the West Side, for example, 1990 prices were cut 15 to 20 percent last year, resulting in the sale of 112 apartments and the buildup of a waiting list of more than 300 prospective buyers. This prompted MacArthur Associates, sponsor of the conversion of the 3,837-unit complex, to order price increases of 6 percent this year, phased in at the rate of 2 percent a month through March.
"It's a question of apartments being reasonably priced," said Elizabeth F. Stribling, of Stribling & Associates, a Manhattan real estate brokerage. "People are looking at a lot of apartments, 50 or 60. They know where the values are."
The condominium market, spurred by foreign money, also appears to be staging a small comeback, although the recession has still stalled virtually all new construction. Ambrose-Mar Elia Company sold 312 units in 1991, against 180 in 1990. One of those properties last year was an entire floor at 200 East 65th Street for $4.8 million, the top price paid for a condominium unit all year. "We have been extremely busy," said Jean A. Luban, the vice president of the company's condominium-sales department.
TO be sure, many sellers, particularly those with small, run-of-the-mill co-ops and condominiums in marginal areas, are still finding it difficult, if not impossible, to attract buyers. Others, though, especially those with large or high-quality units, are managing to seal deals thanks to realistic pricing, attractive mortgage interest rates and a growing belief that the market, overall, has just about bottomed out.
A cautionary note: This isn't the first time that real estate brokers were saying that the worst was over for city's apartment market. At this time last year, many brokers announced that that sales had picked up and prices had bottomed out and they were predicting an upward swing during 1991. As spring gave way to summer, however, the market slipped back into lethargy as the recession took a tighter grip on the economy.
"The market may go down another 3 to 4 percentage points, and then it may not," said Richard J. Steinberg, a broker with the William B. May Company, a residential brokerage and management concern in Manhattan. "And people do not care if it is going to go down another 1 or 2 percent."
"It is almost like purchasing stock," he added. "To buy at the absolute bottom or sell at the pinnacle is next to impossible."
Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, believes the drop in New York's apartment market is linked primarily to the city's job losses, particularly in the financial services industry. From November 1990 to November 1991, 167,000 jobs disappeared, and, the figure is close to a quarter million since the winter of 1988, when the recession started in New York City, long before it did in most of the rest of the nation.
"I haven't seen this kind of feeling about New York since 1975," Mr. Ehrenhalt said.
Rae D. Rosen, vice president and senior economist of the Federal Home Loan Bank in New York, said that the job losses and subsequent pessimism about the real estate market have been greater in the five boroughs than in most of the surrounding areas, with the possible exception of Long Island. "People are not convinced the market has hit bottom, and they are not convinced they are going to have a job," she said.
Assessing the impact of the recession on the apartment market is difficult because the selling prices of co-ops, which far outnumber condominiums, are not publicly reported. Several brokers have their own surveys and indexes for determining where the market is going. These reports, however, are, for the most part, only narrow snapshots, restricted in location, price range or sample size. And instead of closing prices, they often use asking prices that are adjusted for the double-digit drops that often occur during negotiations.
"It is hard to have a peg on this market," said Barbara S. Fox, president of the Fox Residential Group. "It is crazy."
In the largest survey, conducted by the Corcoran Group, a Manhattan brokerage, the average per-room sale price of 2,616 co-ops and condominiums in Manhattan dropped 3.4 percent in 1991, to $86,311, the lowest level since 1983. The average in 1990 was $89,349, a 17.3 percent decline from 1989's $108,040. The 1989 figure was an 8.2 percent drop from the high point: $118,040 in 1988.
"We are definitely seeing the start of a turnaround," said Barbara Corcoran, the firm's president, who cited a shorter listing time (26 weeks versus 30 weeks) and a smaller drop between asking and selling prices (20 percent, down from 23 percent) in 1991 as opposed to 1990.
Clark Halstead, the managing partner of the Halstead Property Company in Manhattan, said his offices have seen a rise in inquiries and closings in the last three months. "My expectation is that with the election-year politics, the easing of interest rates by the Federal Reserve and the stock market rally, there is a growing consensus that we are looking at the end of the recession," he said. "This will get the fence-sitters into action.
A more dire situation, however, is presented in a smaller but broader survey (888 units in all five boroughs) compiled by the National Cooperative Bank. It showed that the cost of buying a co-op dropped by 18.4 percent, from $77,858 a room in 1990 to $63,552 a room last year. The survey was based on appraisals of properties financed in the past two years by the bank, as well as other comparable co-ops.
"You could possibly see a little more weakening, but not very much," said Grace Ann Huebscher, a senior vice president at the bank. "We are close to the bottom, but, in the case of increases, I don't think they are going to be significant."
Ms. Rosen offered another gloomy appraisal. "We think we are near the bottom," she said, "but we have not hit it yet, particularly if you are talking about the ubiquitous one-bedroom unit."
Not to mention the city's thousands of studios, one of which -- in the Murray Hill section of Manhattan -- Neil and Mary Ellen Raphan bought six years ago. They paid $80,000 for the 400-square-foot unit. Their mortgage payment plus maintenance is $1,250 a month. "I thought it was the right thing to do six years ago, because my monthly costs were lower than rent," said Mr. Raphan, an advertising art director. "Now, it is higher because of the escalation in maintenance."
When the Raphans tried selling two years ago, the only nibble was a bid for $56,000, which they accepted, only to see it fall through when the buyer could not get financing. "I'll go lower," Mr. Raphan said. "I don't need this in my head any more."
In the meantime, the Raphans, who have paid more than $1,000 for classified ads in their unsuccessful attempt to sell the studio, have bought a home in Livingston, N.J., and this month they began renting out their co-op for $895 a month. "Even that wasn't easy," Mr. Raphan said.
Dror D. Shnayer, the manager of a real estate portfolio held by a private investor, also turned his co-ops into rentals when five units under his supervision in a prewar building at 181 East 83d Street in Manhattan failed to sell -- even after prices were cut by 20 percent. The one-bedroom units were listed at $200,000 and now rent for $1,500 a month. The two-bedrooms were offered for $400,000 and rent for up to $3,500 a month.
"I'M not terribly optimistic -- I think there is a glut out there," Mr. Shnayer said. "If you bought a decent-to-better apartment, you will not get hurt in the long term, but if you bought in '87-'88 and not in a prewar building, I think you're in trouble. There is just too much out there, and you're competing with your neighbors."
Ms. Rosen noted that although rents have not fallen nearly as much as sale prices (6.3 percent citywide, according to the National Cooperative Bank), there is a greater availability of rental units.
"Another sign that the market has not hit bottom is that rents are more negotiable," she said. "And for owners, that means that even the option of renting is gone because you might get less than you are planning on."
By far the biggest declines in co-op values in 1991 were in Brooklyn and Queens, where the average room price, according to the National Cooperative Bank, fell 52 percent, to $23,623 from $48,822.
But the bank also found a steep drop in the city's most expensive neighborhood, the Upper East Side. Its study showed a 39.2 percent fall in the average price of a room there, from $155,047 in 1990 to $94,321 last year.
The safest area, financially, in 1991 was Lower Manhattan, where the bank's study showed that the value of units below 14th Street rose 18.6 percent, to an average of $56,823, mostly because of the strong demand for lofts in SoHo and TriBeCa. Co-op values also increased slightly, by 3.2 percent to $45,068, in mid-Manhattan, from 14th Street to 56th Street.
"Six years ago, you had a single uniform Manhattan real estate market that was like a juggernaut," said Peggy Brim, a broker with the William B. May Company. "Any property that people bought appreciated no matter what it was. Since then you have seen it fracture, and you have a number of different markets that are all behaving differently. The one thing that is true is that the best apartments in any category are selling."
Ms. Brim said that, space and location aside, the infamous apartment quirks and annoyances (lack of light, fifth-floor walk-ups, kitchenettes) that many New Yorkers paid for, sometimes eagerly, in the last decade were now major barriers to selling. It used to be, she said, that 10 to 15 percent of apartments were marginal and hard to sell. "In a tougher market," she said, "60 to 70 percent" fall into that category.
Ms. Huebscher also noted that co-ops in buildings with financial problems, high maintenance costs or low owner-occupancy rates may continue to suffer deep declines in prices, regardless of where they are. "The worst off are going to be those who have significant sponsor ownership, greater than 40 percent," she said. "You are going to get scrutiny not only by potential buyers but from share loan and blanket loan lenders."
Ellen Feldschreiber, president of the Manhattan Mortgage Company, added, though, that while getting a mortgage may be difficult in cases where the sponsor is delinquent in payments or is in foreclosure, financing for co-ops today may be easier than many buyers believe. "Most banks have adopted their own co-op board supplement to be attached to any loan application, and there usually isn't a problem if at least 50 percent of the units are sold and the sponsor is not in default or behind," she said.
That is not to say that banks have not tightened up on co-op lending. Some require that at least 70 percent of the units in a building be sold. Others charge an interest rate that is a percentage point higher than for a condominium.
CONDOMINIUMS, which made up only about 17 percent of the apartment units in the city in the late 1980's, are considered a more stable investment because financing is easier. They are also unusually attractive to foreigners, who often have trouble getting the approval of co-op boards and have difficulty finding comparable property in their own country for the same price. Moreover, foreigners, especially Europeans, have not been greatly effected by this country's economic problems and benefit from a devalued dollar.
According to Yale Robbins, a real estate analyst, condominium sale prices changed little from the end of 1990 to the end of 1991; the prevailing price is about $330 a square foot. "If anything, they are down slightly, but it is hard to read from the statistics," he said, noting wide month-to-month and building-to-building variations.
Meanwhile, condominium sales in Manhattan for the first six months of 1991 (1,320), the latest period for which figures are available, were down slightly over the same period in 1990 (1,578). By comparison, according to the Real Estate Board of New York, there were 5,182 sales in 1989, 7,209 in 1988 and 7,234 in 1987, the peak year.
"There has been a revival of overseas interest, Spanish, Italian, South American, Hong Kong, into the condominium market, particularly in the high end," said Alan Rogers, managing director of Douglas Elliman, a Manhattan brokerage and management firm.
Sales of condominiums, like those of co-ops, are also benefiting from auctions, such as the one scheduled for next Sunday at the Strand at 500 West 43d Street. There, 42 units that were offered for $125,000 (studios) to $390,000 (two bedrooms, two baths) in the summer of 1989 will be auctioned off with bids starting at $65,000 to $195,000.
"It is all very much tied to the economy," said Susan M. Wachter, an associate professor of finance at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, who has studied New York City's condominium market. "If interest rates stay down and the economy recovers in the second half of the year, then I do think there will be a bounce up next year."
"However," she added, "those are two major ifs."

HEADLINE: Casino Raises Fears of Compulsive Gambling

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH

 BODY:
MARVIN STEINBERG said he found it ironic when a recent study commissioned by the state recommended a widespread expansion of gambling in Connecticut while also noting that the state had the highest rate of compulsive gamblers in the Northeast and perhaps in the country.
Like some other experts in the field, Mr. Steinberg, who is the founder and president of the Connecticut Council on Compulsive Gambling, said he saw a distinct correlation between the growing number of problem gamblers in the state and the variety of legalized gambling in Connecticut, which has more forms than any state except Nevada. 
 "There's no longitudinal data that proves legalized gambling creates more compulsive gamblers, but there's no doubt in my mind that as gambling proliferates, problems increase," said Mr. Steinberg, a clinical psychologist who is the assistant director of the Hamden Mental Service, an outpatient clinic. He started the compulsive gambling council in 1979. Unlike comparable organizations in Massachusetts and New Jersey, which receive state funds, the Connecticut council depends on private contributions. The opening last weekend of a gambling casino on the reservation of the Mashantucket Pequot Indians in Ledyard has heightened concerns about compulsive gambling among people like Mr. Steinberg and Chistopher Armentano, director of the Compulsive Gambling Treatment Program in Bridgeport. "It's definitely going to magnify the problem," Mr. Steinberg said. If the state allows the casino to add video slot machines, "the increase in the number of compulsive gamblers could change dramatically," Mr. Armentano said. The casino already is the only one east of the Mississippi permitted to have poker, he noted, "and we know that can be highly addictive."
Fifty video machines that can be used for 16 games have been installed at the Ledyard casino, but they cannot be used for gambling, since they are legally defined as slot machines, which are illegal in Connecticut. But the study commissioned by the state recommended that, to offset a loss of gambling revenue as a result of the new casino, Connecticut should install slot machines at six gambling locations in the state: three jai alai frontons, two theaters where viwers bet on televised horse races and the Plainfield dog track. In addition, the study proposed that the state consider building its own casino to compete with the one owned and operated by the Mashantucket Pequots, which, because it is on Indian land, is not subject to state taxes.
If slot machines, which account for approximately 60 per cent of the revenues at gaming establishments in Atlantic City and Nevada, are allowed in state-run casinos, under Federal law they also would be permitted at the Ledyard casino.
The state study, compiled by a Massachusetts research company that has done extensive work for gaming interests throughout the country, said that 6.3 per cent of the state's 2.5 million adults (about 160,000 people) have had a gambling problem. By contrast, the figure in Massachusetts is 4.4 per cent, while in both New York and New Jersey it is 4.2 per cent.
Neither Mr. Steinberg nor Mr. Armentano were surprised by those figures, they said. Noting that some state officials and legislators favor an expansion of legalized gambling as a way of offsetting declining state revenues, Mr. Armentano said, "Some people would like to wish these figures away rather than face up to them."
 
Fewer Therapists
 In a state where millions of dollars are gambled annually on state-run lottery and numbers games, at Off-Track Betting parlors and on jai alai and greyhound racing, Mr. Armentano is the only full-time employee dealing with the problem of compulsive gambling. Operating out of an office in the Greater Bridgeport Community Health Center, he counsels compulsive gamblers and refers them to Gamblers Anonymous, which has about a dozen chapters throughout the state.
"I certainly could use more help," said Mr. Armentano. He is assisted by two part-time therapists, he said, "but I lost two others last June because of the budget crisis." A few years ago, he said, the center had a director, two therapists and four other counselors.
"We had 40 active clients at the time my staff was cut," said Mr. Armentano, who also spends Tuesdays helping gamblers from an office in Hartford. "But now we're down to about 25. When their therapists leave, as happened last June, the people seeking help feel rejected, and many of them go back to gambling.
"I try to reach out to them. But I can only do so much. And there's also a whole large group of compulsive gamblers out there who've never showed up at our door. But even when they come in for help, a lot drop out and continue gambling. We try to help them to know themselves better and to make a complete commitment to abstinence. But it isn't easy."
Both Mr. Armentano and Mr. Steinberg say that not many people with gambling problems in the state are aware of the treatment center in Bridgeport.
Mr. Armentano's operation receives $200,000 a year from the state, "the same amount we've been getting every year since 1982," he said. "So when you take inflation into account, we're actually getting less and less each year."
 
Toll-Free Phone Line
 Fliers explaining the state's lottery games, which are available at all outlets where tickets are sold, provide phone numbers for the Bridgeport center and Gamblers Anonymous. But Mr. Steinberg noted: "It's in small print at the very end, and hardly anyone even sees it." Here we have the state spending millions of dollars encouraging people to gamble but refusing to spend anything to help people who develop problems from gambling."
The Ledyard casino, under an agreement with the Connecticut Council on Gambling, is paying for a new toll-free phone line that offers advice to state residents with gambling problems. The number is (800) 346-6238. (The last five digits correspond to the letters in "no bet.") In addition, the casino promised to give the council $16,000, the proceeds from a "play night" held at the casino on Feb. 13, two days before the official opening.
"They've been very cooperative," said Mr. Steinberg who helped train upper-echelon casino personnel to spot patrons with serious gambling problems. One of his talks has been made into a videotape that will be shown to all employees, said Bruce Einhorn, the vice president for casino operations.
But casino officials declined Mr. Steinberg's request that they display signs informing problem gamblers where they can seek help.
"We're sensitive to the issue, but we don't want to accentuate the negative," Mr. Einhorn said. "However, we will make some of Mr. Steinberg's literature available."
He added: "We realize that compulsive gambling is a problem. But we think that a very small portion of gamblers fit into that category."
 
'Unlimited Winnings'
 Dr. Rachel Volberg, an expert on compulsive gambling from Delmar, N.Y., who conducted part of the recent state survey, lauded casino officials for working with Mr. Steinberg. But she warned, "Any time you make gambling more accessible, you may have people getting in trouble."
Casinos can create problem gamblers, "because they offer fast action and unlimited winnings," Mr. Steinberg said. "Even when you talk high-stakes bingo, you can get more addictive gamblers."
Mr. Armentano said he knew cases in which gambling cost people their marriages, their jobs, their life savings and even their homes. One man who came for treatment "was still betting and had lost over $100,000," he said. "He told me he had $14,000 left, which was the amount he owed a bookie, but that he was thinking of gambling the money to try to recoup some of what he had lost. He never showed up again."
More sad stories of addictive gambling were recounted by Galen D., a spokesman for Gamblers Anonymous in Connecticut, who described himself as a former compulsive gambler. Like other members of Gamblers Anonymous, he said he would not divulge his last name when discussing the organization.
"We had a woman in our Hartford chapter who was the bookkeeper for her husband's business," he said. "She started out betting a dollar or two a day on the lottery and eventually was betting as much as $3,000 a day. One day she won $60,000, but she was so hooked that she ended up losing between $300,000 and $400,000 over a period of about four years, which almost cost her husband his business."
He added: "Quite often, you read or hear about people who commit crimes because of big personal debts. What those stories don't usually say is that many of those people have debts resulting from compulsive gambling."
 
'Created a Frankenstein'
 Galen D. said that when he joined Gamblers Anonymous 12 years ago, the Hartford chapter had 12 members. "Now we have between 35 and 40," he said.
State Representative Elizabeth Brown, Democrat of Waterbury, said she was working on a bill that, among other things, would provide more state funds to cope with compulsive gambling.
"We have created a Frankenstein," she said. "And we have to educate people about the problem of compulsive gambling."
While conceding that "gambling is here to stay in Connecticut," Mrs. Brown said, "I think it is bad public policy to try to balance budgets with money from gambling, especially when that gambling creates serious personal problems."

 BODY:
The recent decision by the California Public Employees Retirement System to invest $375 million in the construction of one-family houses within the state is being welcomed by builders here, who have been squeezed by a severe shortage of financing.
The first large-scale investment by a public pension fund in residential construction is being watched closely by builders across the country, who think it could spur similar moves by public pension funds in other states and open up a potentially huge source of new financing. 
 Officers of the California retirement system, known as Calpers, said in January that $75 million would be invested with each of three outside investment advisers to provide financing for home builders. Last week, it voted to give an additional $75 million each to two more advisers.
Although details are still being worked out, the advisers will most likely share ownership in new housing projects and help arrange financing packages that would also include bank loans as well as equity investments by the builders themselves.
Builders said the $375 million from Calpers, when combined with the bank financing, could pay for the construction of at least 5,000 homes in California. Because of the recession and the financing squeeze, the number of one-family housing starts in California, the nation's largest housing market, tumbled steadily and drastically from a high of 163,000 in 1989 to 74,000 last year.
Developers say they remain confident that the economy will right itself this year and that California, which has been hit hard by rising unemployment -- its unemployment rate was 8.1 percent in January, one point higher than the national rate -- will resume its course of steady growth
But builders have remained much more troubled by the lack of financing, a result of the failure of many savings and loan institutions and the tighter Federal regulation of banks and savings institutions.
The Calpers investment by itself will not solve the financing crisis, which has made it hard for most builders to get the acquisition, development and construction loans they need for their projects. Most estimates are that the total reduction in available financing amounts to billions of dollars a year within California and tens of billions nationwide.
Public pension funds, which provide retirement benefits for state and local government employees, have invested heavily in commercial real estate and in apartment buildings. But they have never shown much interest in one-family-home projects, in part because of the risks in buying land, improving it, winning all the necessary zoning approvals and then building and selling the homes.
But Calpers officials said they have come to believe that helping to finance new homes in California, especially homes affordable to first-time buyers, is a good investment.
The state's population, which rose 25 percent between 1980 and 1990, continues to grow rapidly -- it is estimated to have passed 30 million now -- and there is an acute shortage of affordable housing. In 1989, 54.6 percent of households in the state owned their own homes, compared with 64 percent nationwide.
Calpers, which has a reputation as an astute investor, believes it can earn as much as 22 percent on its investment. Last month, the pension fund awarded the right to invest the money to three real estate-oriented money-management firms: California Housing Advisors, a venture set up by Montgomery Securities of San Francisco; a unit of Wells Fargo & Company of San Francisco, and the Prudential Realty Group, a subsidiary of the Prudential Insurance Company of America. Last week, it added Alex. Brown Kleinwort Benson of Sacramento and AMB Institutional Realty Advisors of San Francisco to the list.
Those firms will select which projects to back and will arrange financing for each.
Calpers directed that most of the financing go for construction of affordable homes, which builders take to mean houses within reach of first-time buyers. The statewide median price of a one-family home, $198,000, masks significant regional variations, with the low end ranging from under $100,000 in a few areas to more than $300,000 in Los Angeles and San Francisco.
"In looking at the current situation in the housing industry in the state, the consensus seemed to be that there's still good demand out there," said DeWitt Bowman, chief investment officer for Calpers. "The demographics are good and when affordable housing does come on the market, it sells well."
Some investment analysts said Calpers was partially motivated by growing political pressure to use some of its huge investment portfolio to help the state's faltering economy. The analysts said that pension funds in other states may not have the same motivation as Calpers to enter the residential building field, and indeed that pension funds may continue to find the risk of investing in the land acquisition and housing development too high.
Still, a growing number of pension fund advisors think other funds will follow the lead of Calpers and begin investing in residential housing development projects, becoming major sources of financing along with banks and savings institutions.
"Investment in single-family product will become de rigeur for public pension funds in the 1990's," said a new report from Equitable Real Estate Investment Management of Atlanta.
"The concept that the largest pension fund in California and one of the largest in the country is investing specifically in California is very encouraging," said Robert Rivinius, chief executive of the California Building Industry Association. "Other pension funds will be watching it, and I know they will find the returns to be good and the investments to be safe."
Ultimately, Mr. Rivinius said, pension-fund financing could go a long way toward replacing the old financing from banks and savings institutions.
"We're into a new way of doing business," Mr. Rivinius said. "We've got a new ball game and this is a new ball."
James Z. Pugash, an executive vice president of California Housing Advisors, said he envisions arranging financing packages under which the builder would typically have to put up 10 percent of the total cost as equity. The money management firm, using capital from Calpers, would put up another 20 percent of the cost in equity. The remaining 70 percent would come from banks in the form of loans.
The bank lenders would be paid interest; any profits from the venture would be divided by the builder and the money manager under as-yet undefined terms. Ultimately, the bulk of the profits earned by the money manager would flow to Calpers.
Calpers officials and the money managers said they hope to work out the details and get the program running within a few months.
The new financing cannot come too soon for builders like Bob Ragle of Eagle Ridge Developments in Santa Rosa, Calif.
"Half of the banks I used to use don't exist anymore and the others are extremely cautious," said Mr. Ragle, who because of the financing squeeze is now able to build one new project a year instead of the two or three he used to do. "Any kind of financial help as far as getting subdivision improvements and housing starts going would be an improvement.
"What I'm looking forward to is an additional source of funds that will allow me to get back to a normal situation in my business."

TRIBUTE TO DEWHURST
 Two years ago Colleen Dewhurst was mistress of ceremonies at the Night of Stars fund-raiser for the Northern Westchester Center for the Arts in Goldens Bridge. She served in that capacity every year that she was at home in South Salem during the 12 years of her tenure as honorary board chairman of the organization.
This year the event, to be held next Sunday at 7:30 P.M. in the John Jay High School Auditorium in Cross River, will be dedicated to Ms. Dewhurst, who died last Aug. 22. 
 Many of the stars who will appear are associated with the center as supporters, parents or spouses of students or as teachers of classes at the center. Others knew Ms. Dewhurst as a colleague in theater, film or television. Among the actors are Lucie Arnaz and her husband, Laurence Luckinbill, E. G. Marshall and Jill Clayburgh. Representing music are the flutist and conductor Paul Lustig Dunkel, Rosemary Glyde, violist; Ani Kavafian, violinist, and two composers, Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz.
"Colleen was a tireless worker for the community and for us," said Bira Rabushka, the center's executive director. The actress, in addition to her busy career and her presidency of Actors' Equity in Manhattan, found time to speak at local high school graduations, coach Little League, participate as a Friend of the South Salem Library and support the Westchester Lighthouse.
She helped negotiate the center's contract with the town for the use of its building, narrated its promotional tape and attended planning meetings for a new facility to be built on a site in Katonah between the Katonah Museum and Caramoor.
Ticket sales will help replace the loss of $25,000 in state and county financing because of the recession and shore up existing programs. For reservations at $50, $75 or $100, call 232-5740.
 
POE SET TO MUSIC
 "The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar," one of Edgar Allan Poe's chilling short stories, has been set to music by Milton Rosenstock and will be performed today at 2 P.M. in Riverdale by the Bronx Arts Ensemble. Mark Zeller will be the narrator and singer, accompanied by the ensemble's chamber orchestra.
The tale hinges on delaying death by mesmerization, and at the time it was published the medical community mistook it for reportage of an actual case. Physicians were understandably shaken, and the public was horrified.
The 45-minute program will take place in the Russian Mission to the United Nations at Mosholu Avenue and West 255th Street, one of a series of "Glasnost in the Bronx" performances by the ensemble. Each program features works by American and Russian composers. Included today are Stravinsky's "Pastorale" and Tchaikovsky's "Souvenir de Florence."
Poe, whose cottage in the Bronx is preserved as a historic landmark, has been a continuing source of inspiration to the music group, which presented "La Chute de la Maison Usher," an opera fragment by Debussy, in 1978, and a trilogy of chamber operas by Russell Currie based on "The Cask of Amontillado," "Ligeia," and "A Dream Within a Dream" in the 80's.
Mr. Rosenstock has been the music director of more than two dozen major Broadway shows, the American Ballet Theater and the Dance Theater of Harlem.
Tickets are $35, $25 for students and individuals 65 and older. Call (212) 601-7399 for more information.
 
SAVING THE PLANET
 More than 100 heads of state are expected to gather in June in Rio de Janeiro for a United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. Their purpose will be to explore ways in which the deterioration of the planet can be slowed or stopped.
Wainwright House in Rye has scheduled a series of seminars focusing on the various subjects to be considered. The first session, from 2 to 5 P.M. today, will be an introduction to the conference and its agenda. Serving on the panel will be Jeane Sindab of the National Council of Churches, David Miller, Northeast regional vice president of the National Audubon Society, and a member of the United Nations Secretariat assigned to the conference.
On March 8 the religious community will be the focus of the meeting, with Sir Paul Reeves, Anglican observer at the United Nations and former Governor General of New Zealand; Mohammed Mehdi of the National Council on Islamic Affairs, Daniel Martin, director of the conference's coordinating committee on religion, and others.
Speaking on March 15 will be educators, students and environmentalists, including Allison Beall, curator of the Rye Marshlands Conservancy; Patricia Monahan, a Yonkers teacher, and others from Canada and the United States. The final two sessions, on March 29 and April 5, will be concerned with the contributions of women's organizations worldwide and the role of the business community, respectively.
Admission to the series will be $75; individual sessions cost $20. Call 967-6080 to register or obtain more information.
 
FRASCONI WOODCUTS
 Antonio Frasconi's woodcuts, on view through April 12 at the Neuberger Museum of the State University of New York at Purchase, range from powerful social statements to intricate depictions of plants and insects to light-hearted illustrations of the fables of Aesop.
The prints, created for more than 50 of his books, are indicative of the depth, style and variety of his work, much of which is in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the New York Public Library, all in Manhattan; the Library of Congress in Washington and the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris.
Mr. Frasconi, who came to the United States from Uruguay in 1945, has produced a substantial body of work on social injustice and humanistic philosophy. Taking his texts from Richard Wright, Federico Garcia Lorca, Bertolt Brecht, Walt Whitman, Edgar Allan Poe and Henry David Thoreau, he interprets the prose and poetry in drawings, melding literature with art.
The museum is open Tuesday through Friday from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. and Saturday and Sunday from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. Admission is free, but a donation of $3 will be welcome. Call 251-6100 for more information.
 
HISPANIC CONFERENCE
 The Hispanic community, according to recent census figures reviewed by Family Service of Westchester, is the fastest-growing ethnic group in the county. A conference titled "The Hispanic Community: Issues for Professional Practice" has been scheduled by Family Service on Friday from 8:30 A.M. to 1 P.M. in an effort to create broader understanding of cultural diversity among Hispanic residents and friction between them and other Westchester populations.
Josie Palleja, a family therapist specializing in the problems of Hispanic residents, and George Rios, the County Executive's assistant for minority affairs, will be the principal speakers, addressing the effects of changing demographics and the clinical aspects of dealing with Hispanic families.
While the program is aimed at professionals, anyone interested in the subject will be welcome. Registration costs $35, and more information can be got by calling 948-8004. The session will take place at the Andrus Retirement Community, 185 Old Broadway in Hastings-on-Hudson.
 
MAPLE-SUGARING TIME
 The sap is rising at the county's parks and nature preserves, and beginning this weekend sugar maples will be tapped, syrup will be boiled and samples passed out to visitors. The process will get under way today at 2 P.M. at Lenoir Preserve on Dudley Street in Yonkers, at Washington's Headquarters Museum in North White Plains and at the Trailside Nature Museum on the Ward Pound Ridge Reservation in Cross River.
Using a variety of old-fashioned tools and methods, staff members will take visitors through each step, accompanied by a running commentary on tree biology, the mechanics of harvesting the sap and how the syrup was used in Colonial times as flavoring in cooking.
Another session will take place at Lenoir next Sunday, and programs scheduled on Saturday at Lenoir and next Sunday at Trailside are designed for children to participate in everything from tapping to tasting.
Next Sunday at Muscoot Farm in Somers those who have sugar maples of their own may learn how to produce syrup the modern way. All programs start at 2 P.M. and are free.

Canada's Big Shin-Kicker

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH

DATELINE: TORONTO

 BODY:
In accusing the United States of playing "low-level politics" in a series of recent trade actions against Canada, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney has promised a "shin kicking" campaign to get them reversed.
His chief shin-kicker is Canada's 15th ambassador to the United States, a 52-year-old career foreign service officer named Derek Burney. 
 The burly Ontarian, born at Thunder Bay, who received Canada's Outstanding Public Service Achievement Award for 1991, says he has been preoccupied with trade issues since his arrival three years ago at the new embassy on Pennsylvania Avenue.
He says the recession has made American industry keen on import protection, but he believes that if there is a healthy recovery, some of the trade pressure will let up. "My job is to see to it that we don't have an accident on the way," he added.
Many Canadians see new walls the United States is building against Canadian-assembled Japanese cars as well as Canadian beer, lumber and magnesium as violations of the three-year-old free trade agreement between the two countries.
Canadians are especially sensitive to protectionism because of their own recession and high joblessness and because 80 percent of their total exports go south. The two countries exchange about $200 billion of goods and services.
Mr. Burney, a former chief of staff of Mr. Mulroney, agrees that the American trade actions are "cumulatively putting a lot of pressure on the trade agreement."
But he sees the accord, and especially the dispute-settlement provisions, which he helped to negotiate, as giving Canada the extra safeguards it needs to preserve its biggest export market.

Staying With the Hong Kong Play

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
The Hong Kong stock market is on a roll.
After a spectacular rise of more than 40 percent in 1991, Hong Kong has jumped 11 percent since the beginning of the year. Along the way it has passed 17 new highs for the blue-chip Hang Seng index. 
 Is it time for a correction?
"We'll stick with it awhile longer," said Thomas Robinson, chief international strategist for Merrill Lynch, which sells Hong Kong stocks to retail investors.
Normally, it would be time for a healthy consolidation, a fall of several percentage points that would give the market a breather and a more solid base on which to launch future gains. Many analysts would welcome such a correction because it would provide an opportunity to buy more stocks at lower prices, while anticipating a further rise. But several forces coursing through the market could delay a retrenchment for some time. Thus, many analysts say that getting in now could still provide some nice returns, even with the market, which closed Friday at 4736.47, not far off its all-time high of 4,772.32, at such exalted levels.
Some of these analysts, like Victoria Goodwin of James Capel Inc. in New York and Elizabeth Tran of Prudential Asia in Hong Kong, are cautious but admit difficulty finding reasons not to buy. Ms. Goodwin is looking for second tier-stocks, like Johnson Electric, which makes small electric motors. Ms. Tran is switching from some of the popular bank stocks, like Hang Seng, one of the colony's major banks, to companies that make or sell consumer goods and companies that develop real estate.
"Even we who are very cautious find it hard not to argue that the market is very cheap," Ms. Tran said.
Two forces are propelling the rally. One is market factors, the other the continuing lure of the "China play."
Market factors include Hong Kong's low interest rates and high inflation. With savings account rates around 3.5 percent, the prime interest rate at 8.5 percent and inflation around 11 percent, interest rates are negative. This is driving cash into real estate and the stock market in the quest for returns that will outstrip inflation.
Real estate companies are among the most powerful forces in the Hong Kong market. Property companies in general, including Cheung Kong, Henderson Land and New World Development, outperformed the Hong Kong market by more than 4 percent in January. The reason could be seen last week when a prime residential property was sold for more than 4,000 Hong Kong dollars a square foot. In general, residential prices are up at least 50 percent in the last year.
In addition, said Ms. Goodwin, company earnings across the board are expected to rise 17 percent this year, which would probably drive the Hang Seng index up by the same amount. And while inflation of 11 percent is very high, inflation in China, where more and more of the manufacturing for Hong Kong companies is now located, is lower. This means inflation will have a smaller than expected impact on earnings.
Manufacturers are also getting the benefit of savings from lower interest rates, which have followed the downward path of American interest rates, since the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the American dollar and the two currencies move in tandem.
Another market factor is known as the safe harbor draw, meaning that because the Hong Kong dollar is pegged, dollar-based investors won't get hurt by an American dollar rally. And earnings and price earnings ratios are especially attractive there because much of the rest of the world does not look so good right now.
The second force is the China play, the conviction that Hong Kong's entree to China makes it the way to play the biggest developing market in the world. This is not a new lure, but it seems it is overcoming long-held fears about what will happen when Hong Kong returns to China's control in 1997.
Barton Biggs, the global strategist at Morgan Stanley & Company, is in this school. He switched his position on Hong Kong a week ago in a report from Asia where he is on a tour. Before the trip he had cut back his investment in Hong Kong, saying the market was too high, too popular and too easy to spook. In announcing his change of heart, he wrote that "in the past it had almost invariably been right to buy Hong Kong when everyone was despairing and sell it when shares and speculation were high."
What changed his mind? "The China play aspect of Hong Kong is assuming big-time proportions." he wrote, backing his new sentiment by moving his Hong Kong investment up to 6 percent of his portfolio, three times its normal share. "China, the biggest emerging market story in the world, is beginning to boom, and it should last for years." Among his perferred stocks are Cathay Pacific, the airline; Swire Pacific, which owns Cathy and commercial property, and Hongkong Telecom, the phone company.
So, optimism reigns. "As usual, when things are going quite well in China and the Chinese are making the right noises, people tend to forget about the risks," said Ms. Tran of Prudential Asia.
But this is one of the most volatile markets in the world. The Chinese, who are sending favorable signals now, could stop. There are still some trade tensions with the United States. The Japanese stock market could turn around, which would drain money out of Hong Kong to take advantage of that rally. With any change, the market could fall quickly and sharply.
On the other hand, analysts have been issuing this warning all during the rally.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
As Rates Rise, Stocks May Be Vulnerable

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
The collapse of short-term interest rates has been the biggest factor in the changing investment outlook over the past year. With Treasury bill rates below 4 percent, billions have flowed out of banks and into stocks and bonds.
But now there are signs that the fall in short-term rates is ending. The rate on three-month Treasury bills has climbed to 3.92 percent from 3.72 percentin the past two weeks. 
 That move is consistent with the action of the stock market, where cyclical stocks -- the ones that need a healthy economy to prosper -- have been rising and growth stocks -- the ones that can produce profits whatever the economy -- have been slipping.
The trend can be seen in the market for Eurodollar futures. In essence, that market provides a way to bet on the course of short-term rates. Now it is predicting a sharp increase.
Interpreting that market is not always easy. There are lots of hedges that involve Eurodollar contracts, including some related to this coming week'sauction of two-year Treasury notes, and the removal of those hedges, after the notes are issued, could help to stabilize the Eurodollar market a bit.
Still, as Michael H. Sherman, Shearson Lehman's chief equity strategist, points out, the rising trend of Eurodollar futures rates seems to be clear. The rate on March futures -- essentially the market forecast of short-term bank deposit rates next month -- was 4.01 percent two weeks ago. Now it is 4.35 percent. And there are even larger rises in the later months, especially December, after the election.
If the decline in short rates has provided the best news for the stock market over the past year, the relatively small decline in long-term interest rates has proved to be the most troubling for some investors. At the same time that short rates have been edging up, yields on 30-year bonds have also risen, to the point that they flirted with 8 percent last week.
Those rate increases may yet set off warnings that the economic recovery may be aborted, as happened last spring. But it seems clear that such sectors as housing can do quite well at current levels, and some economists see signs of strong growth ahead.
"The facts that short rates have backed up, that economically sensitive stocks are up smartly, and that the dollar and industrial commodity prices have gained, together are at least a collective hint from the marketplace that the first stages of a more traditional economic recovery may be near at hand," said Robert M. Barbera, Shearson Lehman's chief economist. He thinks the economy will begin growing at a 5 percent annual rate by the second quarter of this year.
That would be great news for business and for George Bush. But it also would be likely to push short-term rates up further. Mr. Sherman thinks Treasury bills could get to 5.5 percent by year-end. If that does happen, he added, a stock market correction of at least 10 percent would probably follow.

HEADLINE: Stalking the Next Walkman

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
A few weeks ago, giving the toast at an annual Sony reception here, Norio Ohga almost sounded like a man who had forsaken electronics for the glitter of Hollywood.
The 62-year-old president of the Sony Corporation talked for 15 minutes without once mentioning the Walkman, the video camcorder, or any of the other gadgetry that propelled his company to huge profitability and tremendous growth in the 1980's. He made only a cursory mention of his pet technological project, Sony's billion-dollar bet on high-definition television. What he did talk about were Sony Pictures Entertainment and Sony Music Entertainment -- once better known as Columbia Pictures and CBS Records. 
 Since Sony dived into Hollywood in 1989, Mr. Ohga told the gathering, it has seized 20 percent of the American box office, "an all-time high for any one movie company in the past 10 years." He waxed on about the success of Steven Spielberg's "Hook" and the critical praise for Barbra Streisand's "Prince of Tides." Michael Jackson's "Dangerous" album, boasted Mr. Ohga, a former opera singer who admits that Mr. Jackson's music was an acquired taste, "has sold over 10 million copies."
Mr. Ohga may be eager to talk about movies and records because, quite frankly, it is easier these days than discussing electronics. Slammed first by the recession in the United States, then by a fast-strengthening yen, profit margins in the business that accounts for more than three-quarters of Sony's estimated $30 billion in sales this year have shrunk to a scant 5 percent.
On Wednesday, Sony issued a dreary financial report, saying that its operating income for the year that ends March 31 will decline 45 percent, to about $1.3 billion. The parent company in Tokyo will run an operating loss, of about $160 million, the first such loss since Masaru Ibuka and Akio Morita founded Sony in 1946. The entertainment business, which burdened Sony with billions in debt to buy and build and only two years ago looked as though it would have to be propped up by the company's electronic wizardry, now seems its healthiest arm, although it accounts for only about 20 percent of sales.
 
A Question of Focus
 Mr. Ohga's "hardware" woes seem particularly startling because throughout the 1980's even the company's biggest Japanese competitors stood in awe of its growth and its speed at rushing new products to market. But for the first time in a long while, Sony has nothing of the proportion of the Walkman or Handycam to give its researchers time to nurse other technologies -- and leeway for a few failures.
Indeed, this recession catches the company at a critical point. Some at Sony say that the attention of senior managers, once focused wholly on the "hardware" of consumer electronics, has been diverted by the new "software" -- the movies and music that, in theory, will fuel sales of its gadgets. That preoccupation has masked a major question: How can a company already competing with giant Japanese rivals, all of Hollywood and the entire record industry take on yet another set of rivals -- the world's computer makers?
It is a fundamental issue for Sony because at their core, its product lines for the 1990's are remarkably sophisticated, single-use computers disguised as easy-to-use consumer electronics. The Data Discman, Sony's 18-month old "electronic book," provides a way to carry around encyclopedias, law books and telephone directories in a Walkman-sized reader. The Palmtop, Sony's ingenious but still struggling entry into the new field of electronic notebooks, allows the use of a pen instead of a keyboard. Coming by the end of the year is Sony's riskiest bet of all: A completely reinvented Walkman that uses a compact disk instead of a tape.
Sony executives argue that the new Walkman, called the M.D., for Mini Disc, will do what the company has always done so brilliantly. That is, invent whole new categories of personal appliances, creating markets where none existed. The underlying technology of the M.D., for instance, could potentially be combined with that of the Data Discman to create a pocket-sized multimedia video player able to store everything from clips of "Gone With the Wind" to music from the latest Mariah Carey album.
But it could take years for these products to yield returns, and until then Sony is in retrenchment mode. Over the past few months, Sony's leadership -- Mr. Ohga; Ken Iwaki, deputy president, and Michael P. Schulhof, the former physicist who spends his days running Sony's huge American operations and negotiating with stars -- has called a halt to factory building and stopped the exponential growth of research and development spending. Capital spending for next year is being cut by $500 million. A giant high-definition television plant is being retooled for conventional TV's, a glaring symbol of Sony's overoptimism about market acceptance of new technology.
"Until last summer, Sony was aggressively preparing for growth," said Mr. Iwaki, who oversaw Sony's expansion in the 1980's, when revenue growth of 20 percent a year was common. "Then we saw the storm clouds growing. Now, it's raining a bit."
Sony's recovery depends largely on the accuracy of its vision of how computers and consumer electronics will mesh. The world, Sony executives think, is moving toward many one-pound "nomadic" computers that each accomplish a specific task -- and must each work with the simplicity of a Walkman. To brace for the day, Sony has entered into a secretive agreement with Apple Computer Inc. to combine Apple's easy-to-use software with Sony's friendly look and feel.
"It is the right approach," said Bill Joy, chief technical officer of Sun Microsystems, a work station maker. "People in the future will not buy computers as computers. But I am not sure the consumer companies like Sony have yet thought through all the software implications."
Indeed, that question is changing Sony today. "We are still debating how to incorporate computer-like attributes into our consumer products," said Mr. Schulhof, who is universally described as Mr. Ohga's American alter ego, with more power in the company than any other non-Japanese. "But the computer industry is moving in our direction, and it will play to our strength."
Mr. Ohga, characteristically, is at once succinct and cryptic about his plans. "If the computer business is a consumer business, we have to be in it. So we will be."
 
So Much for Synergy
 When Norio Ohga began creating the new Sony several years ago -- what Mr. Iwaki once called the "bicultural child" -- the buzzword was synergy. The idea that entertainment "software" could sell Sony "hardware" seemed to explain the purchase of CBS Records and Columbia Pictures. The purchases mean works of hit artists would be available on new, Sony-promoted formats. Sony had learned the importance of this the hard way, when an absence of "software" wiped out its Betamax videocassette player standard in the United States and Europe.
These days the word synergy isn't heard very often around Sony headquarters -- or, for that matter, at Matsushita, the electronics company that followed in Sony's wake and bought MCA Inc., owner of Universal Studios. "Quite frankly," said Mr. Schulhof, "there have not been many software-hardware synergies. Most of them have been software-software," like the early release of music videos drawn from movie soundtracks. One conspicuous exception is a Michael Jackson appearance in ads for Sony's new large, flat-screen television -- but, under Mr. Jackson's contract, only in Japan.
Synergy failed for the digital audio tape (DAT) player that a few years ago promised to be the company's hot product. The record industry worried that such tapes would undercut sales of CD's, and few DAT recordings were forthcoming -- even from Sony-owned CBS Records. Now DAT is reserved for "professionals" and "audiophiles."
Synergy also has not helped much, at least yet, with high-definition television. No sooner had Sony moved onto the Columbia lot than it installed one of the world's most expensive high-definition production facilities, hoping that producers would abandon film to produce programs on video for HDTV broadcast, in turn stimulating demand for the HDTV televisions. They didn't.
The whole HDTV concept has bogged down in international disputes over a broadcast standard. Japan, naturally, is pressing for the system it has spent 20 years developing. America is looking for something non-Japanese -- preferably an all-digital system that will take years to develop and give the nonexistent American television manufacturing industry a chance to rebuild.
"From a technical point of view, HDTV is there," said Mr. Iwaki. But, he added, "Our assumption was that one system would be adopted around the world. That is no longer a good assumption."
Making the humiliation even worse, Matsushita, usually known for eating Sony's dust, raced into the Japanese market with large-, flat- and brilliant-screen televisions. "We had the technology but unfortunately we were not first," said Mr. Iwaki, "Matsushita made a big hit, and we were not first."
At the same time, sales of Sony's 8 millimeter camcorders, the two-pound marvels that generated a fortune in the late 80's, have fallen off dramatically as the recessions in Japan and the United States deepened -- and just as Sony was building new factories.
The end result is what Boris Petersik, the electronics analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo, calls "an electronic void." Video exports for all Japanese manufacturers have dropped considerably. Sony, which sells 62 percent of its goods overseas, suffered the most. In the nine months ended Dec. 31, 1991, sales of Sony's electronics business grew only 5.8 percent, while entertainment revenues jumped 27 percent, though from a low base. On a percentage basis, electronics are far less profitable for Sony these days than music and movies -- if you exclude the cost of Sony's huge borrowings to buy Columbia.
Sony carefully masks the debt payments, leaving analysts to make educated guesses about their effect. But for two years now, Norio Ohga and Mickey Schulhof have heard the same Hollywood sniping: that Sony overspent for the studio, overspent to hire talent like Jon Peters (now, along with many Columbia principals, gone) and Peter Guber and overspent on big projects like "Hook."
"Everyone has accused us of overspending," said Mr. Schulhof. "But our average cost of production is 5 or 10 percent below the industry average."
Mr. Ohga admitted to being "a little bit afraid" of the amounts spent in Hollywood.
"Anticipation is really the right word," Mr. Schulhof interjected, stressing the need for "patience and a long view."
Hollywood, of course, is fascinated by such charges and rebuttals. But in reality, what Sony puts at risk there is relatively minor compared with what's at stake when it rolls the dice on the back streets of Shinagawa, the crowded Tokyo neighborhood that is dotted with Sony laboratories.
 
Mr. Ohsone's Gamble
 These days, Sony's biggest gambler is Kozo Ohsone, father of the Walkman. An amiable man with a broad smile, Mr. Ohsone has one obsession these days and that is to make his famed product obsolete. Quickly.
Over the last 10 years, the Walkman had been refined as far as it physically could be and shrunk to roughly the size of a plastic cassette tape carrying case. "When we realized we couldn't go any further," Mr. Ohsone said, wandering through the fourth-floor maze of desks piled high with prototypes of new models, "we knew the moment had finally arrived for new technology."
Mr. Ohsone reached for a technology bubbling in Sony's central research labs for years -- a compact disk that can be recorded on, erased and recorded on again. Unlike tape, optical disks like CD's provide random access, the ability to scan immediately to a musical selection. And they allow digital sound quality, something a generation of record-rejecting music lovers demand.
The engineers' problem was to design a player that could withstand the jostling a Walkman takes. They solved it, by continuously feeding three seconds of music into computer memory chips, which are impervious to shaking and bashing, creating a buffer so that a skip would never be noticed.
The resulting device is called the Mini Disc, which will use a mini CD. No one knows how quickly consumers will abandon the familiar and be willing to pay a premium price of $400 to $500 for a sophisticated data storage and recording device. "It will take a while," said Mr. Ohga. "But it took a while with the compact disk."
At its simplest, the M.D. is a music machine. But the underlying technology has a huge range of uses -- for mass data storage for portable computers, for video, text and a range of other "multimedia" uses.
Inside Sony's labs, the uses are already merging. It was Mr. Ohsone's audio engineers, not the computer division, who invented the Data Discman. With fewer than 200,000 sold, the $550 device does is not yet a hit. But combining it with the M.D.'s recording capability -- it already plays some audio -- is not a too-distant stretch.
Where Sony still needs the most help, presumably from Apple, is with the pen-operated Palmtop. When it was introduced in Japan, for more than $1,000, it was simply a curiosity. The price has been slashed in half, and the machine made to look more like a pad of paper, with a small printer attached. Combined with the Data Discman, the Palmtop has spurred debate about how computer-like to make Sony.
"The question is do we need computing technology as an internal technological resource, or do we need to be in the computer marketplace," one mid-level Sony employee said recently. "We don't plan to enter the PC market. Instead we meet computers at the appliance level, at the Data Discman."
So far, the idea is still clearer than the execution. Sony's new information and entertainment appliances are still incompatible with each other, meaning that disks that fit the Data Discman will fit none of its other products. Mr. Ohga and Mr. Schulhof express no worry, saying that each format was uniquely suited to a specific application. But many Sony researchers see the compatibility problems as a major obstacle.
The true test for Sony, though, is whether it can sustain its remarkable pace of innovation while management is diverted by Hollywood, by the political tensions between Japan and America and by running an enterprise now half the size of I.B.M.
Sony has always known how to create an aura as sleek as the cool, black metalic designs that have been its trademark. That is why it seemed to be the only Japanese firm capable of learning the strange ways of Hollywoods. "We've always prefered to wear the fashionable suits," said Mr. Iwaki. But for the next few years, it may have to pay less attention to wardrobe and more to production -- especially in Tokyo, where the screenplay needs another rewrite.

ECONOMY
 
Waiting for the Economic Nitty-Gritty From the Buchanan Campaign 

Even among conservatives, the charge leveled against Patrick J. Buchanan is that though he has support, he doesn't have an economic plan. "I'm not aware of any real economic policy emanating from Buchanan's camp, even on health care," said Edwin S. Rubinstein, a conservative economist at the Manhattan Institute. But on Feb. 9, Mr. Buchanan issued what he calls his seven-point plan. "He has his seven points, but he hasn't had time to write them out into a position paper yet," said John P. Cregan, head of the U.S. Business and Industrial Council and a Buchanan adviser. "They are an economic message for the post-cold war era," he said. The points include getting tough with Japan. "We call it being a 'trade hawk,' " said Mr. Cregan. There are middle-class tax cuts, a Government hiring and spending freeze and foreign-aid cuts. "Pat still has to flush out his health care plan," Mr. Cregan said.

Energy Policy or Energy Bill?
 
The best negotiations, it is said, are those that end with everyone feeling equally bad. The energy bill the Senate passed overwhelmingly last week was the product of that kind of give and take. Liberals wanted a bill favoring conservation. Conservatives pushed for more energy exploration. Environmental groups wanted tougher pollution limits. The White House wanted drilling in the Arctic National Wilderness Refuge. What they got instead was a bill that makes it easier to construct nuclear reactors, does not require increased fuel-efficiency for cars, curbs Arctic drilling and does little to promote domestically produced fuels like methanol. But it does oblige the Government to use alternative fuels in its fleet of vehicles and it allows utilities to sell electricity across state lines. It also sets minimum energy standards for products like air-conditioners and light bulbs. After all the wrangling, Senator James M. Jeffords, Republican of Vermont, said: "We still don't have a national energy strategy." That may be true, but the Senate went ahead and approved the bill 94 to 4.

No Fear of Inflation
 
This economic slump has at least one silver lining. With consumers shunning the malls, the nation's storekeepers have had the good sense to keep their prices flat. According to the Commerce Department, the Consumer Price Index, rose by just one-tenth of 1 percent in January. "This confirms that inflation pressures are abating," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch. "I think that will continue to be the picture for all of this year and probably for a chunk of next year as well."

Seeking One-Armed Economist
 
Harry Truman longed for a one-armed economist. That way he would never have to hear the words "on the other hand." But that's precisely what Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, told Congress last week. During testimony before a House subcommittee, Mr. Greenspan said, "We are beginning to see the stirrings" of a recovery. He said it would occur in the second quarter. But then Mr. Greenspan hedged. On the other hand, he said in his testimony about the recovery, "I don't want to overemphasize it. It's a series of weeks and it could just as easily peter out as indeed the much more vigorous recovery of last spring petered out." Mr. Truman would not have been amused.

Survival of the Weakest S.& L.'s
 
Capitalism's strength, the economist Joseph Schumpeter said, is that it lets its weakest institutions wither away, Darwin-style, so strong new ones can be built up. But if the nation's savings and loan regulators have their way, that aspect of capitalism may itself wither. Rather than shutting down ailing thrifts and liquidating their assets, as the Government now does, the regulators want to approach the problem another way. They want to become investors. Which savings and loans will they buy into? The ones that are "heading south," said T. Timothy Ryan Jr., director of the Office of Thrift Supervision. That's a contrarian approach, to say the least. But if tax money goes into these institutions, the Government will not only be bailing out the depositors, it will also be protecting the stockholders. That's not very Schumpeterian. The public has 30 days to comment.

Why Housing Helps
 
Housing starts are a leading indicator. Break ground and you must hire workers and buy supplies. And once the house is up, you have to buy all the doodads to fill it. And then there is insurance. So it was good news when the Commerce Department reported last week that housing starts increased by 5.5 percent in January, with most of the increases in the Midwest, and permits for new construction were up by 6 percent. "The trend is definitely positive," said David W. Berson, of the Federal National Mortgage Association.
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
Toeing the Line at Time Warner
 
It was no secret that Steven J. Ross, chairman of Time Warner Inc., and N. J. Nicholas Jr., co-chief executive and his designated successor, did not see eye to eye. "Their styles and temperaments were quite different and they couldn't agree on what kind of deals to do," said Richard M. Clurman, author of "To the End of Time," about the merger of Time Inc., and Warner Communications Inc. Mr. Nicholas is widely thought to have been against Mr. Ross's plan to take in Japan's C. Itoh and Toshiba as partners in the entertainment business last fall. "What was supposed to be a close, intimate working relationship never developed," Mr. Clurman said. And with Mr. Ross's health in doubt, those differences cast a pall over the direction the heavily indebted company might pursue. Still, it did come as a shock last week when it was announced that Mr. Nicholas had resigned. He will be replaced by Gerald M. Levin, currently vice chairman. With Mr. Levin as No. 2, and with Time Warner's board of directors strongly supporting him, doubts about the company's direction were largely quelled. Wall Street liked the news. Time Warner closed the week at $99.75, up $1.875.

Round-the-Clock Cartoons
 
When Time magazine made Ted Turner, chairman of the Turner Broadcasting System, its Man of the Year, it was because of the vision thing. Mr. Turner's CNN brought breaking news, 24 hours a day, to millions of people around the world. That was lofty. It raised people's consciousness. But last week Mr. Turner announced he was bringing something else into people's homes, and it probably won't do much to increase the world's wisdom. In October Mr. Turner will start a cable-television channel showing nothing but cartoons, 24 hours a day. It will air programs from the Hanna-Barbara and MGM film libraries, which Mr. Turner also owns. Why the new channel? "We're opportunistic," Mr. Turner said, adding that the channel was a "long-term play."
 
Bush's Hotel in Trouble
 
For President Bush, the recession must seem to be closing in from all sides. Not only did it hurt him in New Hampshire, but now it is hampering him where he lives -- or at least where he votes. Last week Houstonian Properties Ltd., which owns the Houstonian Hotel, filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11. The Houstonian is where Mr. Bush maintains a suite that is his official voting address.

Milken to Pay Up
 
Michael R. Milken, the imprisoned former head of Drexel Burnham Lambert's junk-bond desk, made more than $500 million in a single year. Still, the agreement he made last week to settle the more than 9,000 civil suits filed against him was for more than walking-around money. Mr. Milken agreed to pay $900 million in a deal worked out by Federal District Judge Milton Pollack, who is overseeing Drexel's bankruptcy. Mr. Milken's former colleagues will kick in $300 million and Drexel's insurers will add an additional $100 million. If all the claimants agree to the settlement, no more civil charges can be filed against Mr. Milken or Drexel.

Price Cuts, Not Coupons
 
Supermarket aisles are increasingly cluttered with coupon dispensers and displays offering discounts on products. Food companies have to pay premiums to have their goods displayed prominently. It's an expensive way to move the merchandise, especially in a lackluster year. So last week Kraft General Foods Inc., the nation's largest food company, said it would follow the example set last fall by the Procter & Gamble Company, and lower its prices. Procter & Gamble cut some of its prices by as much as 40 percent. Kraft did not say how deep its cuts will be. "We will approach it on a category-by-category basis," said Joseph P. Durret, senior vice president for sales. With the nagging recession, cheaper goods may help Kraft preserve its market share.

The Marriot Corporation expanded vigorously -- just before the recession. Now it is stuck with $2 billion in debt in the midst of a travel recession. So it was no surprise when it announced last week that it would sell six hotels and lease two others to the ITT Sheraton Corporation in a deal worth $160 million.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
The Narrowing Trade Deficit
 
Six years ago, the Plaza Accords went into effect. They brought down the value of the dollar against the world's other major currencies. Proponents said the accords would eradicate the trade deficit in five or six years. The world is still waiting. According to the Commerce Department, the nation's trade gap for 1991 fell to $66.20 billion, its lowest level in eight years. But not because of the cheap dollar. It was because of the slump. Consumers didn't spend much last year, on anything. "At least half, maybe two-thirds, of the year's improvement was due to the recession," said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington.

Can Korean Cars Buck a Trend?
 
You have to be awfully optimistic to begin selling cars in America this year. Detroit is losing billions of dollars and several foreign manufacturers have gone home in disgust. Still, Kia Motors of South Korea, is making plans to enter the American market, albeit slowly. (It already makes the Festiva, sold here by Ford.) Kia's strategy is to sell Japanese-style cars, but at lower prices.

HEADLINE: It's Flash, It's Dash and It's Out of Detroit

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
Detroit is once again turning heads with its car designs the striking forms of the Cadillac Seville, Buick Skylark and Chrysler's new family of mid-size sedans. The change has energized the Big Three's studios, where designers still wince at the memory of a 1983 Fortune magazine cover showing four General Motors models, one indistinguishable from the next. That image sent home the point -- "signed, sealed and delivered," as one designer put it: car styling, a traditional American strength, had become a weakness.
In recent years, even while battling the incursions of foreign car makers and retooling to meet ever-stricter Federal standards, they have kept a wistful eye on design. And in recent months, they have rolled out the fruits of their new visions, designed to distance themselves from the drab decades, to return to the days when the whole car -- not just the vanity plate -- made the statement of who you are. It's hardly a return to the be chromed land yachts of the 1950's, but it is a world of "cab forward" design, cat-eye headlights and even plastic cladding around the bottom, an upscale image borrowed from Europe that lends a racy line (as well as protecting the paint job from road debris). 
 The bolder, sometimes overstated shapes signal one of Detroit's strategies to win back market share lost to foreign brands. In contrast to Japanese auto makers, G.M., Chrysler and, to a lesser degree, Ford, say they are designing to inspire strong feelings -- adoration or revulsion, anything but indifference.
"The new production stuff seems to show a pretty confident hand," said David E. Davis, editor of Automobile magazine.
The new direction is particularly evident in three G.M. models derived from the same chassis: the Oldsmobile Achieva, Pontiac Grand Am and Buick Skylark. Despite their common provenance, these cars put on individual displays that send Japanese sedans -- the Toyota Camry, Nissan Maxima and Honda Accord -- into the shade.
These and other Japanese models suffer from a "dreadful sameness," said Thomas Dukes, director of competitive assessment for J. D. Power & Associates, auto industry consultants based in Agoura Hills, Calif.
Industry analysts acknowledge that the move to bolder styling will not, by itself, halt the erosion of the domestic companies' market share. Buying decisions in these economy- and safety-sensitive times are still guided more by perceptions of quality, performance and value. But distinctive exteriors pique consumers' interest and as domestic brands close the value gap, stronger designs may give Americans an edge.
"If the quality were the same, then I would say the Japanese would be at a disadvantage right now," said Jean-Claude Gruet, an analyst with UBS Securities in Manhattan.
The early success of the restyled Cadillac Seville supports the widely held belief that Americans will favor American cars when all else is perceived to be equal.
Unfortunately, auto executives must flirt with disaster before they approve daring designs. Ford, for example, was in deep trouble in 1985 when it introduced the Taurus, a risky, revolutionary form. It had to pull things together, and the Taurus did the trick. But now the company is showing classic unwillingness to tinker with a winner. Ford, flush with cash, spent more than $600 million to revamp the Taurus for 1992, but made few noticeable changes to the exterior. Detroit, in fact, does not always follow its own advice, that the biggest risk is taking no risk at all.
Still, Big Three designers say they are wielding more clout than they have in years. More than a decade ago, new requirements for better fuel economy forced auto makers to downsize their models, causing a head-on collision with the styling trends of the day.
"Longer, lower, wider; that was our creed," said Charles M. Jordan, G.M.'s chief designer. "All of a sudden, cars had to be shorter, narrower and higher."
The myriad engineering changes required to meet Federally set fuel targets forced designers into the back seat. To cut down on manufacturing costs, common body panels were used for models from separate divisions, creating an inevitable cookie-cutter result. Then too, there was overreliance on focus groups, or "clinics," in which consumers are polled for their reactions. To please the greatest number, rakish touches were sacrificed. "If everybody says it's beautiful, it's going to look old by the time it gets to market," said Maryann N. Keller, an analyst with the brokerage firm Furman Selz Inc. in New York.
Today, the Big Three say they are using clinics differently. Chrysler, for example, no longer chooses designs that score the highest average, but rather ones that elicit the highest and lowest scores. The theory is that a bold shape will cut through the clutter of hundreds of available models and grab drivers' imaginations.
"We believe very strongly in a love-hate relationship, something that is very polar," said Thomas Gale, Chrysler's chief designer.
Ford's strategy is focused more on the middle ground. . Fritz C. Mayhew, Ford's chief North America designer, said the auto maker has too few models to risk outlandish styles. Instead, Ford is developing a functional, industrial look, a simple aerodynamic appearance that it is spreading across its product line.
Of course, risky designs that polarize opinion can flop. (Remember Ford's Edsel?) And in G.M.'s line-up of dozens of models, many, like the futuristic minivans with their moonwalker look, have struck off-note chords with consumers. The minivans' sharply raked windshields have also drawn criticism for creating pillars that obstruct the driver's peripheral vision, and drivers have complained that the car's protruding nose makes it difficult to park in tight spaces.
"You could argue that G.M.'s designs are more individual. The question is: Are they better?" said C. Edson Armi, author of "The Art of American Car Design" and an art history professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He prefers the products of Mr. Jordan's predecessor at G.M., Irv Rybicki, whose models consistently rated a B-plus because of a "Brooks Brothers quality of bland, but well-executed, design."
Today, that description better suits many sedans from Japanese auto makers. To be sure, many of the Japanese companies sought to put themselves in closer touch with their growing base of style-conscious American customers by establishing American-staffed studios in California in the late 1970's and 1980's. And they have turned out some remarkable styles with the help of American teams, from the one led Chuck Jordan's son Mark that put out the Mazda Miata to the one headed by David Doyle of Calty Design Research in Newport Beach, Calif., creators of the Previa minivan.
But what is behind the almost generic look of so many of their models? Designers and industry analysts suggest several things.
Because Japanese brands are lauded for their quality and performance, design is considered a lesser concern to their buyers. This did not stop Honda from displaying an eye-catching concept car, the aggressive-looking, low and wide, designed-in-Japan FS-X sedan at recent auto shows. But given the success of such uninspired exteriors as that of the also designed-in-Japan Honda Accord, there is little reason to toy with the conservative look. Why change the shape of the best-selling sedan in the United States?
A historical focus on perfecting manufacturing and engineering techniques has also overshadowed design. And, as Ms. Keller puts it, the Japanese "take a much more evolutionary approach."
Designers of Japanese brands believe that discerning consumers will appreciate their models' "subtleties," understated variations on a theme of gentle curves. Gerald P. Hirshberg, head of Nissan's studio in La Jolla, Calif., argues that some Big Three designers are making a mistake by focusing so intensely on making their models unlike the competition. It translates, he says, into the difference between "having style, and doing style for style's sake."
Mr. Hirshberg and others say they prefer mass appeal to customer polarization. "Toyota would rather sell its styling to everybody," said Dennis Campbell, senior chief designer of Toyota's Calty studio. Honda executives defend the incremental changes to their Accord model as honoring tradition, a strategy of many staid European brands and of Ford in its latest redesign of the Taurus.
What will be the shape of cars to come? The biggest hits at the recent Detroit Auto Show included Chrysler's mid-sized sedans. Some designers and industry watchers believe they are leading a trend toward so-called cab-forward design, in which the passenger compartment is moved forward in the car's body. The lower and shorter hood lends a wedge shape, and pushing the wheels farther to the corners creates more of a performance-oriented stance.
While many designers believe that cab forward will be a major theme of the 1990's, they also expect diversity to be the watchword. The move toward niche vehicles for specific market segments -- made possible in part by lean production techniques that make small-volume models profitable -- will grow, multiplying designs and further blurring lines among minivans, cars and sport-utility vehicles, for example. The regulatory mandate to build electric vehicles is also expected to force broad changes in design.
As bolder designs become more the rule than the exception, designers admit they will be harder pressed to turn consumers' heads. That will inevitably force them back into borrowing a leaf from the Japanese, trying to win over customers with subtleties. Said Mr. Mayhew of Ford: "It will be much more difficult to do a design that is radically different from what is out there."
 
 
 
WHAT'S GOING ON ON THE INSIDE
 While automotive designers often disagree on how cars should look, they roundly agree that interiors are in for innovation. For decades, by tradition, interiors were modeled by designers who worked on nothing else. The result was foreseeable: Interiors often didn't match the design theme of the exterior. For example, the now-discontinued Buick Reatta was a curvacious two-seat coupe -- with an oddly squarish, angular dashboard. "It was just so jarring," said Maryann N. Keller, an automotive analyst with Furman Selz in Manhattan.
The idea now is to get a better match, and, in some cases, for interior and exterior designers to learn each other's craft. "We want Renaissance designers," said Fritz C. Mayhew, Ford's chief North American designer. Nissan has granted its American studio its own interior design capability, instead of reserving that for Japan.
Car interiors will probably be simpler in the future. Buttons will be eliminated with the help of voice activation technology, for example. But some could be more complex, with more telecommunications technology to help create mobile offices.

HEADLINE: Protect Us From Government Protection

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The theme running through "Deep-Freeze the Regulatory Freeze" (Forum, Feb. 2) was summed up by one phrase indicating that Americans generally "want government to protect them" from the ills of the world. Decades of government "protecting" Americans got the United States into its current mess. Government-subsidized education, health care and housing has encouraged costs to zoom out of control and quality to decline in many areas. The auto industry is an example of how government involvement can turn what was once a bastion of free enterprise into a virtual public utility. For the sake of our great free and democratic society, don't advocate increasing ever-stifling regulation.

HEADLINE: The Uses of Anti-Dumping Laws

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I read with great interest James Bovard's thesis (Forum, Feb. 9) that United States trade laws "reduce competition and raise prices to protect consumers against the one-in-a-million possibility that foreign companies could corner the market -- and raise prices." Further, he argues that Congress should repeal the country's antidumping laws. 
 The repeal of our antidumping laws could help to maintain lower prices on some imports, at least in the short run. Yet far more is at stake in enforcing the antidumping statues than, as Mr. Bovard suggests, simply raising import prices now to prevent foreign producers from gaining monopoly power and raising their prices later. Rather, the laws seek to remedy the situation where foreign producers, free from significant import competition at home, use their surplus profits from domestic sales to subsidize low-cost export sales that injure American companies and their workers. Dumped imports that undersell United States products even slightly can lead to declines in production and market share, reduced cash flows, cutbacks in R.& D., and disinvestment, not to mention employee layoffs and plant closings.
Mr. Bovard also ignores the fact that foreign firms can substantially increase their production through dumped sales into the United States market and reap significant economies of scale and improvements in technological and manufacturing skills. This makes them stronger competitors in other export markets and in markets for other products.
We can all agree that our lack of competitiveness in certain industries is not just the result of unfair trade practices by others. In fact, it may be that too often our manufacturers fail to use the assistance received under our trade laws to take the steps necessary to improve their competitiveness. United States antidumping laws help to preserve our national manufacturing, technology and tax base, and, in so doing, enable millions of Americans to earn a good living and then reinvest those earnings as consumers. To quote a 1974 Senate Report: "Unemployed persons are not happy consumers."

HEADLINE: 'Swaps' and the Next Great Banking Crisis

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Floyd Norris' column on how the next great banking crisis could result from their dealings in new financial products like interest rate swaps (Market Watch, Feb. 9) was perceptive and timely. Unfortunately, the article gives the impression that it is merely particular products that pose risks for the world financial system. 
 There is a more basic issue, with ramifications far beyond bank capital adequacy and other forms of banking regulation. A distinct process of financial innovation arose in the 1980's. At the vanguard, there has been a shift to institutionalized research and development of the type associated with high-technology companies. Abstruse theory, rocket scientists and powerful computers play major roles. Whether driven by rocket scientists or merely by lawyers relying on the Internal Revenue Code, innovation is now built into the system. There is now a continuous and rapid flow of new financial products throughout the world's major capital markets.
This process, not particular products, poses especially difficult issues for governments, in banking or securities regulation, taxation and corporate law. The process undermines the ability of regulators, legislators and judges to know what is going on.

HEADLINE: Japanese Didn't Invent Military Sex Industry

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Lest your report on karayuki-san, "comfort women," forced into prostitution by the Japanese army in Korea (news article, Jan. 27) be used to fuel the fires of Japan-bashing, let us be clear that the military exploitation of women through rape and prostitution has a long history in every military society, including ours.
A former Navy chaplain who served in Japan during the post-World War II occupation told me that when he protested the American base commander's efforts to set up prostitution centers using Japanese women, he was reassigned stateside. 
 As a Japanese-American woman growing up on United States military bases, I faced the assumption that any woman who looked Asian was sexually available to soldiers. I was often called "geisha-girl" or "Suzy Wong" (soldiers usually couldn't tell Japanese from Chinese). Every base I ever lived on, in the United States, Okinawa and Germany, had a thriving red-light district near it.
The enormous growth in the Thai sex industry occurred with the escalation of the Vietnam War, in which Bangkok was a major rest and recuperation spot for United States troops. When the war ended, the economy was so dependent on the revenues generated by the sex industry that Thais shifted their sales pitch to tourism. Underground best-selling guidebooks give advice about where to find particular kinds of prostitution, including children. Some travel agencies arranged sex tours for Western European, American and Japanese men to Thailand.
The largest users of Korean women for prostitution now are United States soldiers. My Sister's Place, an agency that works with Korean women who marry soldiers or work as prostitutes, estimates that one of every six Korean women 15 to 35 years old works in the sex industry. The women have few other economic options, especially if they have run away from abusive homes or are divorced. The situation was similar around Philippine United States bases and continues on Okinawa, where women from the Philippines and Thailand are illegally imported for the sex industry.
Women in virtually every Asian country are organizing against the economic structures, military bases and social patterns of male dominance that force hundreds of thousands of women and children into the sex industry. If we are shocked by the story of karayuki-san, which ought to shock us for its brutality, we also ought to assist the women of Asia in their struggle against similar abuses now.

HEADLINE: Meadowlands No Place For a Large Complex

 BODY:
Re: "Vision of Rail and Office Complex Moves Closer to Reality," Jan. 26: William McCann's vision of a "gleaming oasis of glass and steel," proposed for construction in the Hackensack Meadowlands, is a futile one.
The idea of a major office and hotel complex's being built at a time of office glut and hotel room vacancies is misguided. Other Meadowlands hotels are suffering. 
 We could dismiss or forget that valuable wetland and habitat resources will be lost; that the promised jobs will be short-term and will just as likely go to construction workers from out of the region; that New York City's skyline is now more than ever a symbol of greed gone sour rather than of something to emulate; that Newark and Hoboken are already "intermodal transportation hubs"; that additional car traffic will lead to worsening air quality; that the circle of mobility may be outdated and designed to accommodate a timeworn paradigm, or that the existing rail lines would be better used as trails or light rail -- forget all that, and the Allied Junction project is still doomed to fail.
The concept of a large, citylike paved area in the Meadowland marshes is contrary to every planning fundamental.
The stress this project will cause on the Meadows ecosystem is unconscionable. Runoff, non-point source pollution from the large paved area alone will contaminate large areas of marsh and river. Oil from the cars, rubber, asbestos, antifreeze and grit will form a noxious stew that will run raw every time it rains. This "pointless pollution" will contaminate fishery habitat (the marshes and estuarine streams) critical to the health of the inshore fishery -- the fish we eat.
We must inaugurate a moratorium on development in wetlands, on mud flats, on platforms in rivers and on barrier beaches. It is a small price to pay for healthy food, open space preservation and cleaner air and water.
Large-scale developments like this one benefit only a small group of people while marsh and open space benefit all of us. The short-term monetary gains from wages and taxes do not come close to the cost of servicing the ratable.
We can always build later once we know whether or not mitigation (fake wetlands) techniques work, but we can never restore the open space lost if it is developed now. Urban open space is analogous to an endangered species; it is more valuable, because there is less of it.
Allied Junction is not a "rail project"; it is a private development project with a de facto subsidy because of its location near a rail line. The real rail complex already exists in Newark.
I agree that it makes sense to put economic development around the transit hub, but not with the conclusion that it should be in the Meadowlands. The New Jersey State Plan and common-sense planning say that the older urban areas are the logical place for large-scale development; that farmland and open space are at a premium, and should be spared.
Downtown Newark could be the setting for additional "economic development" and already has the rail, road, sewer, water and electrical infrastructure necessary for a development of this size.
It would be a rare treat if developers, redevelopment-hungry large-city mayors, labor, the State Plan and public policy could all be accommodated in an environmentally benign economic revitalization. Allied Junction in the Meadowlands is not the solution.

HEADLINE: In His Various Defining Moments, Has Bush Clearly Defined Himself?

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
GEORGE BUSH has been in public life since the 1960's, and he has been President of the United States, scrutinized every day in every way, for more than three years. Yet as he labored last week to recover from a Republican primary in New Hampshire in which he was able to attract only 53 per cent of the vote, his managers were still struggling to find some way to present a clearer impression of the man and his policies.
A New York Times/CBS News poll conducted last week dramatized the depth of the President's problem: the poll showed that more than half of registered voters find it hard to say what Mr. Bush hopes to accomplish in a second term -- although, of course, Mr. Bush still has several months in which to refine his message to the nation. 
 Coming up with an agenda is usually a challenger's problem. But Mr. Bush has never struck most people as a man with a solid core of political beliefs. Personal character and values, yes; he is well known as a family man, a modest and self-effacing man, by the standards of big-time politicians, at least. But deep political roots like Ronald Reagan's or Harry S. Truman's? Not really.
In the battle for the 1980 Presidential nomination, George Bush ran as something of a Rockefeller Republican, dismissing the program of his rival, Mr. Reagan, with the caustic jab, "voodoo economics." When Mr. Reagan chose him as his running mate (which says a lot for Mr. Bush's ability to utter harsh words without making enemies), that sort of talk was quickly shelved.
Mr. Bush quickly took on the ideological coloration of the Reagan Administration; not once during its whole eight years did he distance himself from any of its policies in any significant way. George Bush the Planned Parenthood advocate became George Bush the foe of abortion, for example.
 
Ambiguous Record
 In the 1988 primary and general election campaigns, it was George Bush the Reaganite who showed up, painting Bob Dole as a spineless wonder with a dangerous predilection for big government spending, and Michael S. Dukakis as a softie who let violent criminals out of jail to commit more crimes.
Lately, the record has been ambiguous. As Patrick J. Buchanan kept reminding the voters of New Hampshire, Mr. Bush reneged on his campaign slogan, "no new taxes," and he has a confusing record on civil rights. He signed the Civil Rights Act of 1991 while continuing to appoint judges and make speeches that civil rights leaders could not stomach.
Contradictions abound. The self-proclaimed education and environment President, he habitually takes what experts in those fields deem half measures. A foe of censorship, he dumped the head of the National Endowment for the Arts the moment that Mr. Buchanan threatened to make an issue of arts policy in the culturally conservative Southern states.
The useful aspect of such pragmatism, of course, lies in opening the way to compromise -- always valuable in foreign affairs, long Mr. Bush's prime interest, and increasingly valuable in the new world of domestic affairs, where a Republican President and a Congress controlled by the Democrats has come to be the rule, not the exception.
Less welcome is the harsh political fact that pragmatists have trouble building constituencies, especially in this era of single-issue politics. Mr. Reagan had a band of die-hard supporters who could be counted upon no matter what. Mr. Bush's fans come and go with the changing political weather, which is why he fell so rapidly in the polls when the economy turned sour. And he has never quite convinced conservatives that he is one of them.
It may be that the President's pragmatism derives from his early life, when, as a son of the liberal Eastern Establishment, he found himself in Texas, a land of tough, self-reliant conservatives.
Mr. Buchanan derided Mr. Bush's patrician background in a speech last week, mocking his prep school education, his membership in Skull and Bones, the toniest Yale club, and his wealth. The Mercedes-driving Mr. Buchanan even took a shot at the President's summer house, where, he said, "the Walker's Point G.O.P. salves its social conscience at other people's expense" by backing "reverse discrimination," the challenger's term for affirmative action.
He doesn't mention George Bush the Texan, the horseshoe-tosser, the nibbler of pork rinds. Those are the symbols that the President has used to conjure up the ordinary-guy image he deems politically preferable, to which he adds conservative political language, if not always conservative actions.
 
Indecisive Tactics
 The White House said last week that there would be no change in the President's policies, not even the economic proposals that failed to stir the country in the State of the Union speech. What was needed, it was said, is some limited tactical fine-tuning.
With voters still blaming the Administration, not Congress, for the recession, that is a debatable judgment. But even on tactics, there was indecision; at first it was said Mr. Bush would attack Mr. Buchanan, a vulnerable foe with a long paper trail of contentious and questionable statements. Then the handlers decided that going on the attack would "demean the office," as one said. Snarling-dog duties would be performed by Vice President Dan Quayle and perhaps by some less anodyne television ads.
If Mr. Buchanan can be dispatched without too much self-definition by the President, the ambiguity might prove beneficial in holding the party together in November. Mr. Bush has hoped, and apparently still hopes, that he can avoid offending the right-wingers whose support he will need in the fall.
The Democrats, meanwhile, struggle with their own problems of definition. Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts and Gov. Bill Clinton have jumped clear of the pack, the Times/CBS poll shows, and Democratic voters, if not Democratic leaders, are starting to get a bit more comfortable with the idea of one of the active contenders as the nominee.
But not one of the five hopefuls has made enough of a splash that even half the voters are willing to rate them in the most general way: Do you approve or disapprove of this guy? In addition, Mr. Clinton has high negative numbers, a legacy, perhaps, of allegations of marital infidelity and draft avoidance.
Unless things change radically in the next few months, those factors could give Mr. Bush and the Republicans a chance to daub the opposing nominee with colors of their own choosing, something they did to the hapless Mr. Dukakis in 1988.
Perhaps slogans and reputation-busting will be less successful this year. But don't count on it. Dwight D. Eisenhower observed hopefully four decades ago that the American people wouldn't buy a President sold like toothpaste; he hasn't been proved right yet.

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
Plastic Surgery: A Profession In Need of A Facelift?

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
"DOC HOLLYWOOD," a comedy-cum-morality play that appeared in theaters last year, pits the seductions of the big city against the virtues of small-town life. For the prototype of the slick, the soulless and the rich, the scriptwriters picked a plastic surgeon. Will Michael J. Fox amass a fortune in Los Angeles making the beautiful more beautiful, or become a country doctor in South Carolina?
You can guess the outcome, and also the outrage of many of the country's plastic surgeons, who felt they were being stereotyped. Most have spent seven years after medical school learning their specialty. And, they insist, they are not simply catering to vanity. Seeing themselves as inheritors of a medical tradition that goes back to the battlefields of World War I, some plastic surgeons trek regularly to Mexico or the Philippines to heal the burns and the cleft palates of the poor. Others work in inner cities. Still others have pioneered advances in microsurgery or implant technology. 
 But there is also the allure of the fees to be made on procedures that are purely cosmetic -- facelifts, wrinkle removal, eyelid repair, liposuction to vacuum out fat. According to the American Medical Association, the number of plastic surgeons has increased fourfold in the last quarter century while the total number of physicians has little more than doubled. In 1965, the A.M.A. counted 1,133 doctors who called themselves plastic surgeons. In 1990, the number increased to 4,492, although those actually certified by the plastic surgery board numbered only about 3,850.
Attention to the profession has increased with the dispute over the safety of silicone gel breast implants, which are inserted, mostly for cosmetic reasons, more than 100,000 times a year. Thursday, an expert panel recommended that David A. Kessler, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, allow the implants only on a tightly controlled experimental basis, although it found no conclusive evidence to justify suspicions of a link between autoimmune disorders and leaking silicone.
 
$5 Million War Chest
 Dr. Kessler's decision is due in 60 days, and in the meantime, many surgeons are closing ranks. Last year, in response to the implant debate, the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons assessed its members $1,050 to accumulate a $5 million war chest -- $500,000 for research, $4.5 million for lobbying, or "public education." But others within and without the specialty have been troubled in recent years by the direction the specialty has taken. What do the critics say is wrong?
Exhibit A: Advertising. A scantily clad brunette, in a pose that seems lifted from a Victoria's Secret lingerie catalog, looks out proudly from an advertisement in the current issue of New York magazine, next to a text that purrs: "It used to be that if you looked in the mirror and saw something you didn't like, you had to live with it. Thankfully, those days are over." Advertising by lawyers and doctors won Supreme Court approval more than a decade ago, but most doctors still frown on it.
Exhibit B: Income. Plastic surgeons' median pre-tax income was measured at $211,250 in 1989 by the research firm Medical Economics. Though this figure ranks in the middle of all surgical specialties, it is nearly double that of family medicine and pediatrics, and well in excess of psychiatry and obstetrics.
Exhibit C: Absence. In a 1989 survey paid for by the Massachusetts Medical Association and the state's emergency physicians, plastic surgeons led the field of the hard-to-get. Two-thirds of the emergency-room directors who responded said they had trouble getting plastic surgeons to respond to emergencies at some time during the previous six months. About 60 percent had some problems with neurosurgeons, 51 percent with orthopedic surgeons, 46 percent with psychiatrists.
Joseph E. Murray, a 72-year-old plastic surgeon, said he feels that his colleagues have, in some measure, earned a reprimand. Dr. Murray learned his trade in Veterans Administration hospitals during and after World War II, when there were about 100 plastic surgeons nationwide. In 1989, he won the Nobel Prize in medicine for his work in kidney transplants in the 1950's.
"The motivation for plastic surgeons has pretty much been the same throughout the ages -- imagination, perseverance and curiosity," he said. "I found when I got out of the Army that I was much more interested in the reconstructive aspects of surgery than the excisional aspects. We had done tremendous hand surgery, we fixed lost noses and orbits. In the decade after the war, we interested a fine new generation of doctors.
"But somewhere in the 1960's," he said, "a group of plastic surgeons began to concentrate on esthetic or cosmetic surgery. They got out of the mainstream. They were interested in an easy work life. Scheduled patients. No emergencies. Cosmetic surgery is wonderfully rewarding. When you change a patient's nose or help the kid with the jug-handled ears -- that's wonderful. About 15 percent of my practice was cosmetic work. But it bothers me when doctors lose their professionalism and sell their services to the highest bidder."
Boyd R. Burkhardt, a Tuscon-based plastic surgeon who once trained with Dr. Murray, argued that "some things have been forced on plastic surgeons by the way medicine has developed."
"There are only so many head injuries, so many cleft lips and palates," he said. "The one expandable part of the territory is cosmetic surgery."
Since cosmetic surgery rarely qualifies for insurance reimbursement, many patients are likely to be well-to-do. Thus plastic surgeons are also facing competition from ear, nose and throat doctors who do nose jobs, ophthalmologists who fix eyelids, general surgeons who do facelifts and general practitioners who do liposuction.
The number of reconstructive procedures performed was 1,250,000 in 1990, double the approximately 640,000 cosmetic procedures, according to the plastic surgeons society. The amount of hand surgery and laceration repair decreased between 1988 and 1990, while breast augmentation operations increased 25 percent.
"There is no question that the remunerative aspects of our profession sometimes attract a certain type of personality," said James H. Wells, a plastic surgeon in Long Beach, Calif. "That personality gets stereotyped and our profession gets stereotyped."
But, Dr. Murray argued: "There's a fine new generation of doctors coming up. They just need good role models, good leadership."

HEADLINE: The Trains Are Ready, The Parking Isn't

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
ANYONE who's gone near some train stations in the New York area recently, especially during the morning rush, has seen chaos in motion. The trains aren't the problem. It's the scowling commuters circling the packed parking lots, looking -- often in vain -- for a spot.
Two weeks ago, about 80 Long Island Rail Road commuters angrily stormed a makeshift impound lot at the Ronkonkoma station after their illegally parked cars were towed into it. 
 But the outburst there, and the widespread frustration over parking at many stations, is actually a measure of how much the region's railroads have improved. More trains run on time, the heaters and air-conditioners usually work and commuters seem happier, so ridership has grown.
Last week, the Metro-North Commuter Railroad, which is used by commuters from Connecticut and north of the city, announced a personal best: 97 percent of its trains have been on time so far this year. In 1983, only 80 percent of its trains ran on time.
The L.I.R.R. went from 83 percent on time in 1980 to 89 percent last year, and trains in New Jersey went from 88 percent on time in 1983 to 93 percent last year.
Ridership on Metro-North rose from 40 million in 1983 to 57 million in 1990, but dipped to 56 million last year because of the recession. In New Jersey, it rose similarly, from 32 million in 1983 to 45 million in 1988 before dropping to 42 million last year. On Long Island, ridership rose from 71 million in 1980 to 75 million in 1989, only to drop back again to 71 million last year.
More people still drive: a one-day survey in October 1990 by the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council estimated that 165,000 people took trains into Manhattan below 60th Street while 221,000 drove.
Among the factors that have pushed more people onto the trains: Outlying diesel lines have been electrified in recent years, and road traffic has become more miserable.
"We're a victim of our own success," said Daniel Brucker, a Metro-North spokesman. "The service is fast. It's efficient. It's comfortable. But now comes the problem of where do people park. If we can't get people on the trains, we're limiting our growth."
Plans to relieve the pressure are under way. New Jersey Transit is scrambling to build new lots or garages and has created more than 3,000 new spaces since 1985. The Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North are each committed to spending $20 million on parking, splitting the costs with the towns they serve. But a lack of vacant land near stations and a resistance to ugly parking garages have made for slow going. Even though Metro-North is adding 2,685 new spaces in Westchester County, it expects to be 3,300 spaces short by the year 2001.
The commuters who want those spots say train service is far better than it was a few years ago. David F. Freeman, a foundation executive in Manhattan, has been riding from the Red Bank station in New Jersey for 40 years. For 36 years, the train had to stop to take on or drop off a diesel engine where the overhead wires ended. When the route was electrified four years ago, almost half an hour was shaved off his daily commute. And, he said, "they've added new cars -- actually new, not rebuilt, like we used to get."
Harry P. Harris, chairman of the Connecticut Metro-North New Haven Rail Commuter Council, an advisory board appointed by the state legislature, said: "We now have the luxury of complaining about little things. You used to have to stand on trains which were frequently late. We even had a stretch when wheels were falling off. You now gripe because a train is a couple of minutes late."
Every day, railroad managers gather at Metro-North's Madison Avenue headquarters to dissect that morning's delays. "Everything that causes a delay is hunted down," Mr. Brucker said. "A few months ago, a squirrel on the New Haven line had crawled up in the overhead wires and got itself electrocuted. That created a short in the system and stopped a large number of trains. That squirrel, as well as the wires, was brought into the second floor, into the meeting."
 
400 on Waiting List
 As complaints about train service have faded, the complaints about parking have gotten louder. In Rye, N.Y., some 400 people languish on a waiting list for 625 parking permits. Before the mid-1980's, there was no list. In West Windsor, N.J., where the Princeton Junction station attracts commuters to both Philadelphia and New York City, 400 residents and 800 non-residents are waiting for spaces. Commuters may have to get up before dawn.
"By 6:45 in the morning, the paid parking is full," said Donald M. Rizzo, chairman of the West Windsor Parking Authority. "If you don't have to get to work that early, you've got a problem."
At some Metro-North stations, people have parked so close to the tracks that their cars have been hit by trains, Mr. Brucker said.
On Long Island, improvements have been less dramatic. "Most commuters would say that while the service they're getting is probably adequate, it's probably not adequate relative to the price of the ticket," said Sheldon Schachter, chairman of the L.I.R.R. Commuters Council.
Because the L.I.R.R. must compete with Amtrak for use of the East River tunnels, its problems scheduling trains are trickier and some experts are not sure it can ever match Metro-North's record.
At Ronkonkoma, the scene of the near-riot this month, a new plan for a larger parking lot is going slowly. Traffic rose from 2,000 riders per morning to 5,000 after electrification. "The capacity of that station was expanded four years ago," Mr. Schachter said, "and yet no one has gotten off their rear end to solve the parking problem."

HEADLINE: Housing Chief Quits Her Post Under Pressure

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
Laura D. Blackburne, the chairwoman of New York City's Housing Authority, resigned under pressure yesterday after a week of mounting criticism of her spending practices, including the hundreds of thousands of dollars she spent on office furnishings and business trips.
At a hastily arranged news conference at City Hall yesterday afternoon, Mayor David N. Dinkins said that Ms. Blackburne, 53 years old, submitted a letter of resignation yesterday and that he had accepted it. 
 Mr. Dinkins said Sally Hernandez-Pinero, Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, would immediately step down from her post to succeed Ms. Blackburne as chairwoman of the authority.
 
'Confidence Shaken'
 While citing Ms. Blackburne's accomplishments in improving living conditions in the city's public housing projects, Mr. Dinkins said, "Public confidence in her has been shaken, and her ability to function effectively as chair of the authority is irreparably damaged."
The system she has run since 1990 is the nation's largest housing authority. It shelters more than 600,000 people with a budget of $1.3 billion and staff of more than 15,000 employees.
Ms. Blackburne is the subject of five investigations, by the inspector general of the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Manhattan, the State Attorney General, the city Department of Investigations and the Mayor's office.
"The investigations which have been launched limit the time and energies she would otherwise devote to her responsibilities as chair," Mr. Dinkins said.
Ms. Blackburne was not at the news conference yesterday. But she said in a statement issued by her office: "I have appreciated Mayor Dinkins' support, particularly during these last few trying days. Circumstances have forced me to resign in the best interest of the people of public housing."
Mr. Dinkins refused to comment on the investigations or to criticize her actions, other than to say her effectiveness had been undermined.
Beginning with an article in The Daily News on Feb. 12, a string of highly publicized reports have revealed that Ms. Blackburne had redecorated her office lavishly, with a $3,000 couch, among other things, and had used public money to pay for her to accompany the Mayor on his trip to South Africa.
The Mayor had asked all his commissioners to pay for the trip themselves, and earlier last week directed her to pay back the money. The Mayor said yesterday that he did not know if Ms. Blackburne had returned it yet.
Newly released records of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority also revealed that her spending habits as an M.T.A. board member had come under criticism there, and had prompted changes in the agency's rules on reimbursements. She did not resign her M.T.A. seat yesterday, transit officials said.
 
Embarrassments for Dinkins
 Her troubles were the latest in a series of embarrassing revelations about Dinkins aides that began last month with the admission by his former campaign treasurer that he stole $158,000 from its accounts, and continued Friday with a Department of Investigations report concluding that his Commissioner of Youth Services improperly awarded a contract to a foundation he formerly led.
The well-publicized incidents have each raised questions about the Mayor's choice of high-level appointees, and have each put him in the difficult position of choosing between demonstrating loyalty to a supporter and friend or jettisoning a liability.
On Friday, Mr. Dinkins appeared to be standing by Ms. Blackburne, saying he would make no decision on her tenure until all investigations were concluded. But he had actually made up his mind to seek her ouster earlier that day after aides had told him the accusations against Ms. Blackburne were serious and not likely to go away quickly, city officials said.
That evening, the Mayor instructed Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch to meet with Ms. Blackburne and inform her that he no longer had confidence in her ability to do her job because of the investigations and public perceptions.
"What I did was send word to her that I felt she could no longer be effective," the Mayor said yesterday.
Asked if it was difficult to seek Ms. Blackburne's resignation, Mr. Dinkins said: "Yes, because she's a friend. She's someone who's done a good job in the Housing Authority."
 
Mayor Valued Her Services
 Aides to the Mayor said yesterday that he had hesitated to dismiss Ms. Blackburne because she was a close friend and had performed a valuable service when she wrote the report that praised his handling of the Korean grocery boycott in Brooklyn. But at the same time, they said, he grew increasingly angry during the week, and felt betrayed by her spending and unsatisfied with her explanations of it.
The Mayor also valued her as an effective Housing Authority advocate, winning tens of millions of dollars in Federal housing money for New York City and working to rid projects of drug dealers.
Last week, supporters of Ms. Blackburne demonstrated outside City Hall. C. Vernon Mason, a lawyer who took part in the demonstration, said yesterday that she had been held to a different standard from that for officials in previous administrations, as well as the current one, because she is black. Mr. Mason said her actions warranted neither the swirl of publicity nor her resignation.
"The target of all that's been going on is not Laura Blackburne or even other people in the administration," Mr. Mason said. "It's David Dinkins himself."
As head of the Housing Authority, Ms. Blackburne expanded the range of social services offered to housing project residents, whose problems mirror those of the troubled neighborhoods where they are most often situated. Projects, Ms. Blackburne once said, should be "a place of hope and promise, not a holding pen for the poor and damaged."
Her agenda including job training, dropout classes, Scout troops, youth corps, stepping up eviction of drug dealers and the relocation of doubled-up families.
Federal and local housing officials give her high marks for innovative programs that have greatly improved living conditions in public housing projects.
Joseph G. Schiff, Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, had said he was impressed with Ms. Blackburne's work, particularly in monitoring systems for heating-oil deliveries, high school education programs and tenant organizations.
Mr. Schiff said yesterday that Ms. Blackburne's resignation would not affect the department inspector general's inquiry into her handling of Federal housing money.
Investigators are also looking into whether Ms. Blackburne violated any laws by setting up a nonprofit foundation with Housing Authority money and later accepting $3,100 from the foundation to pay for her trip to South Africa with the Mayor in late November.
Late last week, it was revealed that the chairwoman and seven other Housing Authority officials spent $16,000 in Federal money on a weeklong trip earlier this month to Puerto Rico, with excursions to St. Croix and St. John's in the Virgin Islands. The purpose of the trip, the city's Housing Authority said yesterday, was to help the Puerto Rican Housing Authority deal with drug problems and maintain buildings.
Many details of Ms. Blackburne's spending were disclosed to the press by employees of the Housing Authority and the M.T.A., who said they had been annoyed by Ms. Blackburne's brash, arrogant manner.
Ms. Hernandez-Pinero, 38, is leaving as the administration's chief promoter of economic development even as the city struggles to overcome one of the worst fiscal crisis since the 1970's.
After an initial period in which she was perceived by many in the business community as weak and inexperienced, she gradually earned respect from many of those same critics.
Ms. Hernandez-Pinero, who has told the Mayor that she wanted to shift to a less taxing post to spend more time with her children, said yesterday that her new job would give her more control over her schedule.
Mr. Dinkins declined to name a successor to Ms. Hernandez-Pinero. Barry F. Sullivan, a longtime banker and retired head of First Chicago Corporation, has been reported to be Mr. Dinkins's first choice.

HEADLINE: DELAY BY THE U.S. SAID TO IMPERIL AID TO EX-SOVIET LANDS

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22

 BODY:
A delay by the United States in approving a large financing increase for the International Monetary Fund -- motivated in part by election-year politics -- is threatening to upset the West's efforts to provide billions of dollars in aid to Russia and other former Soviet republics, I.M.F. officials say.
The United States had promised other I.M.F. members that it would approve a new $12 billion contribution to the lending agency sometime in 1991, but its failure to do so has stalled plans to increase overall financing by $60 billion and thus threatened plans to grant aid to the Soviet Union. 
 Bush Administration officials say they have urged Congress to approve the $12 billion, although members of Congress say the Administration's pleas have been neither loud nor persistent. Democrats in Congress say they are leery of approving the move unless the White House takes the lead on the issue.
 
Electoral Considerations
 Officials of the I.M.F. attribute the delay to a desire by the White House and Congress not to offend the electorate by voting billions of dollars more in foreign aid when the economy is in recession.
Officials of Russia and the other republics have appealed repeatedly for help from international agencies and the industrialized nations for their economy. I.M.F. officials and aid experts say that unless the additional funds are approved soon, the I.M.F. and other agencies could face serious problems in planning a comprehensive aid program and providing the tens of billions of dollars in aid that the republics say they desperately need. Russia and several other republics have already requested membership in the expectation that they will get aid when they become members, which is expected in late April.
The republics are expected to formally request billions of dollars in assistance from the fund after they join it, which officials say they might do in late April at the fund's spring meeting. "There is an undercurrent of distress about America's leadership on this," said one I.M.F. official. "Our resources will be squeezed very seriously by the end of the year when the demand for financing by Russia and the republics hits the system."
I.M.F. officials say they have about $15 billion available for loans to nations in need. Russia alone is seeking about $6 billion for a fund to stabilize the ruble and $12 billion to help it finance crucial imports. Some economists say Ukraine and other republics will be seeking at least $10 billion more in aid. Many Western officials now say the increase in financing, which was planned in 1990, is inadequate because it was planned even before the Soviet Union collapsed and turned to the West for aid.
Some officials and economists fear that with the cold war over, Washington's hesitation on the funds is a step back from America's international commitments even as Washington has sought to portray itself as a leader of the effort to help the former Soviet Union.
"This, by itself, is not a huge signal of that, but combined with other concerns it is causing some nervousness," said Gregory A. Fossedal, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution who heads a study commission analyzing the I.M.F.'s operations.
 
Effect of New Hampshire Vote
 Members of Congress and many economists say that after President Bush's weak victory in the New Hampshire primary, it is less likely that the Administration will push hard for the financing increase, especially since many polls show that Americans believe that the President has paid too much attention to foreign affairs.
"Unless the White House is prepared to put a lot of effort into it, it's not going to sail through Congress," said John Williamson, a senior fellow with the Institute for International Economics, a Washington policy research institute. "I'm worried that New Hampshire will increase the Administration's reluctance to do anything that may displease the Republican right wing. I don't think the Bush Administration is showing much courage on this issue."
Representative David R. Obey, the Wisconsin Democrat who heads the House Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, noted that Republicans have accused Democrats of favoring foreign aid at the expense of domestic needs, a touchy issue in an election year.
 
'Shooting at Us'
 "The last time that foreign aid authorization was on the floor, the room was filled with Republican rhetoric attacking the Democratic foreign aid bill because it contained aid for the I.M.F.," he said. "If the Republican Party thinks the Democrats in the House are going to carry the Administration's water on this issue while they are shooting at us, they must be smoking something that's illegal."
Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, said he told the Administration last year "that they ought to try to move this effort through." He said, "A substantive case can be made for a quota increase, but as a practical matter the Administration squandered or missed the opportunity last year to push it through."
Mr. Sarbanes, chairman of the Senate's subcommittee on international economic policy, said the fund increase was "probably not going to go anywhere" this year. He added that it would not go forward unless there was broad support from Republicans in Congress.
 
Approval Is Doubted
 Two weeks ago, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who is chairman the Senate appropriations subcommittee in charge of I.M.F. financing, also said he did not see Congress approving the $12 billion contribution this year.
Testifying before a House subcommittee on Feb. 5, Under Secretary of the Treasury David Mulford said of the I.M.F. financing increase that "at some time, there will have to be a big push to get it done" but he said it was "very difficult" to say when that might be.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d has expressed support for the financing increase, and the official said Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady will soon also speak on its behalf.
 
'A Lot More Difficult'
 One Administration official said: "The Administration still wants it passed, and wants it passed as soon as it can be. But it is clear that in an election year, this sort of issue is a lot more difficult."
Under I.M.F. rules, the additional $60 billion in funds will not take effect unless countries with 85 percent of the votes approve their contributions. Since the United States has 19 percent of the votes, its failure to approve its one-time $12 billion financing increase has blocked the overall increase. The current American stake in the I.M.F. is almost $24 billion out of a total of $120 billion.
In June 1990, I.M.F. members agreed in principle to raise the group's total financing to $180 billion from $120 billion, but that agreement was contingent upon most members approving their portion of the overall increase. I.M.F. officials say the money nations give to the fund is an investment on which donors receive interest each year.
The I.M.F. could allow the financing increase to take effect after June 30, with Washington's approval but not its participation, so long as members with 70 percent of the votes approve their contributions. According to I.M.F. officials, 110 nations, accounting for more than 70 percent of the votes, have already approved their contributions.
 
Reluctance Among Members
 But I.M.F. officials say that the United States and other I.M.F. members are reluctant to see the financing increase go through without Washington's share.
American officials say they are averse to a capital increase without Washington's joining in because that would reduce Washington's portion of the total financing as well as reducing its voting power at the fund to 14 percent from about 19 percent. This would mean that the United States would lose its veto over I.M.F. policy decisions because I.M.F. rules require 85 percent support for any important actions.
The I.M.F. will not be providing all the financing needed by Russia and the other republics; the World Bank and aid from other nations will also help. But I.M.F. officials say the fund will face a liquidity squeeze without a financing increase, especially since poor African, Asian and Latin American countries are seeking more aid. The I.M.F. grants loans to help the developing world and former Communist countries shape up and rebuild their economies. Loans are granted only to member nations, and are usually made only after the nations agree to a program of economic changes approved by the fund.

HEADLINE: The Path of Andrew Carnegie Leads to the Neediest Cases

BYLINE: By J. PEDER ZANE

 BODY:
Just as aspiring basketball players tack posters of Wilt Chamberlain on their wall, Peter W. Janssen kept a book commissioned by Andrew Carnegie on his nightstand. "Think Rich and Grow," by Napoleon Hill examined the lives of some of the world's richest men in order to provide a blueprint for success.
"The book helped me achieve my goals and financial security," he said. "But now it is time to go on from there, and like Carnegie, put that money to good use." 
 Mr. Janssen, a 32-year-old investment banker, says his goal is simple: "I want to be the world's greatest philanthropist."
Why? After soaring through the roaring 80's, he says, he needs another reason for creating wealth. "When you make enough money where you're comfortable, then you're not striving," he said. "I needed a new goal and this gives me one with the right focus."
Mr. Janssen, a senior vice-president at D.H. Blair in Manhattan, took his first step toward his goal last week when he donated $10,000 to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. He also convinced five co-workers to donate an additional $11,800.
While Mr. Janssen may be modeling himself after Andrew Carnegie, he might also want to learn about Lillian Kent of Manhattan, a model of persistence. Despite tough times, she sent her 30th annual contribution to the Neediest Cases. "Although my income is lower this year than last and will be even lower next year (as a retiree the lowering of interest rates is not a joy to me)," she wrote in a letter attached to her $100 donation, "I am maintaining the level of my 1990 contribution."
And there is the example of Phyllis and Martin Zelkind of Queens Village, a model of flexibility. "For the past 27 years our contributions were equal to the number of years we had participated," they wrote. "Consequently our check this year was to have been for $28. But, the increase in the numbers of needy people and the problems they face compel us to double our contribution. Enclosed is a check for $56."
Since it was founded in 1912 by Adolph S. Ochs, who was then the publisher of The New York Times, the Neediest Cases Fund has raised money for New York's sick, poor, and disabled. So far the 80th annual appeal, which concludes Feb. 29, has raised $4.7 million from more than 15,000 donations.
The Times covers the campaign's overhead so that every dollar collected can be passed on directly to seven charities. The money provides many forms of relief, including food for the hungry, homes for the homeless, and clothing for those without. The seven charities also use the money to help people pay for operations, to help foster parents care for children with AIDS, and to help emotionally troubled adolescents get their lives back on track.

HEADLINE: Political Talk

BYLINE: By Sam Howe Verhovek

 BODY:

 Like Nelson, Like Nephew
While troops of national reporters were camped out in Albany waiting to hear whether Gov. Mario M. Cuomo would make a last-minute entry in the New Hampshire primary late last year, another New Yorker with a famous political name was wrestling with the same decision -- and was finally talked out of it by the White House. 
 The would-be candidate was Laurance Rockefeller, 47 years old, an environmental lawyer and nephew of the late Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, and the primary he wound up forgoing was the Republican vice presidential contest.
Like Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Rockefeller prepared filing papers and agonized up until the end about whether to run. But unlike Mr. Cuomo, he did so privately. Details of the non-campaign have emerged in a somewhat self-deprecating essay about his short-lived political career, "On New Hampshire and CO<2>."
Under a quirk of New Hampshire law, residents are able to vote on a separate line for vice president. Since no other state has the provision, the contest means little. But Mr. Rockefeller and several other Republican environmentalists -- including Theodore (Ted) Roosevelt 4th, a Manhattan investment banker -- seriously explored entering the primary to protest what they said they believed was the Bush Administration's failure to address global warming.
The environmentalists settled on Mr. Rockefeller, he writes, in part because he had "crisscrossed New Hampshire for a month leading up to the 1964 primary, organizing students for my Uncle Nelson and campaigning myself."
As word of the budding campaign filtered to Washington, Mr. Rockefeller was summoned to the White House on the night before the Dec. 20 New Hampshire deadline to meet with the White House chief of staff, Samuel K. Skinner, and Mr. Bush's campaign chairman, Robert M. Teeter. Among other things, the officials argued that the insurgent campaign "might lead the President to feel he didn't get enough credit from environmentalists and lose interest rather than being encouraged to do better," Mr. Rockefeller wrote.
As the minutes ticked by and Mr. Cuomo was hand-wringing himself out of the race, Mr. Rockefeller was doing much the same. One reason, he said, was that Mr. Skinner was new on the job and deserved a chance to stake out a more concerned position on global warming than his predecessor, John H. Sununu; another was that Dan Quayle was not listed on the ballot so "no real contest was possible."
So Mr. Rockefeller pulled back, although he sent a long note to the President expressing concern about his environmental policies that quickly drew letters from Mr. Bush, Mr. Skinner and Mr. Teeter, all pledging to re-examine the issue. Mr. Teeter's note not only expressed relief that Mr. Rockefeller, who lives in Manhattan, would not be running in the New Hampshire primary, but also added that he was "even more pleased that your Governor has decided to take a pass."
In the end, the vice presidential contest in New Hampshire was won by Herb Clark Jr., a political gadfly from Concord. In one little-noted phenomenon, though, Mr. Quayle actually drew 6,613 write-in votes in the contest, 36 more write-in votes than Mr. Cuomo received in the Democratic Presidential primary.
 
Conservatives Are Hedging
 As if the threat of revolt from the left were not enough for President Bush, the success of Patrick J. Buchanan in New Hampshire has now emboldened the Conservative Party in New York State to threaten to withhold its endorsement for this fall's election.
Mr. Bush drew 243,457 votes on the Conservative line in the 1988 presidential election. While that was only about one-tenth of his vote total as a Republican, the Conservative ballot line could provide a critical margin in a close election.
But Michael R. Long, the party chairman, hedged in an interview on giving Mr. Bush the 1992 line, saying he wanted to see several cabinet members replaced with conservatives and a renewed "no new taxes" pledge from the President first.
Mr. Long said Bush campaign officials had asked him recently whether the "door was closed" to the Conservative nomination. "I said no," he recounted, "but it's not exactly wide open either."
 
Keeping Options Open
 A scramble is under way in the Connecticut General Assembly to fill two legislative auditors' posts that were last vacant when Lyndon Johnson was President. The problem, which threatens to raise tensions among both the majority Democrats and minority Republicans, is that at least half a dozen lawmakers are interested in the jobs, but state law prohibits any of them from even being nominated while serving in the Legislature.
For the would-be applicants, including both Deputy Speakers of the House, the options are sticky. They could resign from their jobs now, to be nominated without guarantee of confirmation. Or they could push the leadership to name temporary auditors, then wait to see how they do in the general election in November, when voter anger about taxes and the recession is expected to sweep many legislators onto the street. Or they could push to scrap the restriction and allow open nominations.
Still another option is to stall until the regular session ends in May, when leaders in the House and Senate could fill the $74,000-a-year jobs on their own from outside the legislature. The wrinkle is that any job filled this summer would have to be ratified next January by the full legislature.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
Arriving at the Next Battleground, Clinton Attacks Tsongas in Maryland

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, Feb. 22

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who has spent the last few days attempting to lower expectations about how well he can perform against Paul E. Tsongas in the Maryland primary on March 3, indicated today that he planned to turn Maryland into a battleground after all.
Without mentioning Mr. Tsongas, a former Senator from Massachusetts, by name, Mr. Clinton took him to task for criticizing proposals to cut taxes for the middle class and to create a student loan fund. Mr. Tsongas has said such ideas, which Mr. Clinton has proposed, were irresponsible and insufficient to meet the nation's needs. Mr. Clinton called this "pious rhetoric." 
 "One of my opponents in this race never tires of saying he's no Santa Claus," Mr. Clinton said at a rally sponsored by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. "The American people don't need a Santa Claus. They don't want a Santa Claus. They don't want a handout, but a hand up.
"We don't need Santa Claus," Mr. Clinton said, appropriating one of Mr. Tsongas's catchiest campaign phrases. "We need a leader."
Until Mr. Tsongas's victory on Tuesday in the New Hampshire primary, Mr. Clinton had praised rather than criticized him. His more direct attack seemed calculated to counter what voters have described in opinion surveys as Mr. Tsongas's strengths, including the specificity of his plans for economic growth.
"Every plan is just a piece of paper," Mr. Clinton said. "And all that matters in the long run is who can energize people."
Mr. Clinton was endorsed today by Mayor Kurt Schmoke of Baltimore and by Representatives Benjamin L. Cardin and Steny H. Hoyer, and his campaign planned to begin broadcasting television commercials in the Baltimore market this weekend.
But even as Mr. Clinton was stepping up his attacks on Mr. Tsongas, leaders of his Maryland campaign continued to play down expectations.
"Tsongas has picked one state, and we're running a national campaign," said Joel Rozner, the Clinton campaign's Maryland state director. "Tsongas has sort of drawn the line in sand here."
 
Resisting Predictions
 Mr. Rozner said Mr. Clinton would "do well" in Maryland. Other Clinton advisers, however, have resisted making any prediction about whether the Arkansas Governor can win here. They have said they expect Mr. Clinton to be weakest in affluent suburban Montgomery County, where they fear many Democratic primary voters have been scared away by negative publicity about Mr. Clinton's personal life and accusations that he tried to avoid the draft during the Vietnam War.
Mr. Clinton said at a news conference in Washington this morning that he had not yet decided how worthwhile it would be to use limited resources in Maryland. "I just instinctively feel there are a lot of upper-income voters who will believe in the sort of we-don't-need-a-Santa-Claus message that Mr. Tsongas is putting out," he said.
Most of Mr. Clinton's pitch today was to black voters in Baltimore and Washington, where he appeared with a group of city officials and repeated his support for statehood for the District of Columbia.
Larry Gibson, a lawyer who has managed Mr. Schmoke's campaigns, said the Baltimore Mayor had met with each of the Democratic Presidential candidates before deciding that Mr. Clinton's urban agenda was the best.
"Most of them are acting as if only suburbanites are going to vote in this election," Mr. Gibson said.
 
'It Will Be a Close Race'
 Prince George's County and the city of Baltimore are two of the most populous areas of the state and both have black majorities. But Clinton campaign officials worry that lower voter turnout in the state's urban areas might be offset by higher turnout in the more affluent suburbs.
"It will be a close race," Mr. Rozner said. Mr. Tsongas, he said, will be aided by the publicity he attracted by winning the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday. "Whoever wins New Hampshire gets a tremendous bump," he said.
But Mr. Clinton is clearly taking no chances with the outcome of the Maryland contest, which falls on the same day as the Georgia primary, where Mr. Clinton is thought to hold a regional and organizational advantage over Mr. Tsongas.
Likewise, Mr. Tsongas is making a run at Mr. Clinton's Southern base and won favorable reviews in the South on Friday. He charmed a large audience at a Democratic money-raising dinner in Atlanta when he took jabs at Gov. Zell Miller, a Clinton supporter.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: South Dakota;
Rival Senators Face Showdown In the Heartland

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SIOUX FALLS, S.D., Feb. 22

 BODY:
This is the state that rewards political victors by carving their faces in a mountainside. But if you lose here, it could be your last stand.
No one knows that better than two Senators from neighboring states: Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Tom Harkin of Iowa. A loss in the Democratic primary on Tuesday by either man could spell the end of his quest for the Presidency. 
 But "the battle for the heartland," as the South Dakota Democratic Party is billing the primary, has escalated into more than a do-or-die showdown between those two candidates from the Farm Belt.
Seeking to capitalize on his victory in the New Hampshire primary, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts rushed here from New England to pose with livestock. Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the New Hampshire runner-up, has been flooding the state with television commercials. And all five major candidates will take part in a nationally televised 90-minute debate here Sunday evening.
 
First Test in Midwest
 This sparsely populated state is taking on particular importance this year because its primary closely followsNew Hampshire's and, in contrast to the 1988 primary, will take place on a day when there are no other Presidential contests to overshadow it. It is also the first true test of the candidates' strength in the Midwest because the other candidates conceded Iowa's caucuses to that state's favorite son, Mr. Harkin. Fifteen delegates to the Democratic National Convention are at stake.
President Bush has no challenger in the Republican primary here; Patrick J. Buchanan lost a court fight to have his name added to the ballot.
Appealing to South Dakotans' farm-bred values and their distrust of big-city politicians, and enticed by one of the cheapest media markets in the country, all the major candidates except former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California are inundating the state with commercials. And the advertisements, with their scenes of wheat fields and farm animals, are distinctly different from those that the candidates broadcast in New Hampshire.
"If they ran ads on unemployment, they'd be wasting their time in our state," where the unemployment rate has hovered around 3 percent, said Senator Tom Daschle, a Democrat. "Our concern is not the availability of jobs, but what jobs pay. We have the lowest wage rate in the country."
Senators Kerrey and Harkin are trying to outdo each other in putting forth their farm credentials. Mr. Harkin's campaign is running an advertisement that credits him with "battling to save America's family farms." Mr. Kerrey's commercial offers an almost identical message, that he is "fighting to save the family farm." But the advertisement jabs his rival from Iowa by noting that Mr. Kerrey is "one of us -- from the Great Plains."
The Kerrey commercial also directly attacks Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Clinton as being anti-farmer.
By his own admission, Mr. Tsongas knows little about agriculture. But his campaign has been running a testimonial from his father-in-law, Russ Sauvage, a local hero who was captain of the University of South Dakota's football team. In those ads, Mr. Sauvage appeals to the no-nonsense sensibilities of residents here by calling Mr. Tsongas "a straight shooter -- tells it like it is."
Though the race here has attracted all the candidates, the Harkin and Kerrey camps have portrayed the primary as a battle between the two Senators. "It's like the Hatfields and McCoys," said Lorraine Voles, press secretary for Mr. Harkin. "This date is critical to us."
But a poll published today by The Argus Leader, the newspaper here, suggested that the race was not so close. The telephone poll, of 288 Democrats who said they were likely to vote on Tuesday, found that Mr. Kerrey was the choice of 26 percent, with three other candidates bunched far behind: Mr. Clinton, 16 percent; Mr. Harkin, 15 percent, and Mr. Tsongas, 12 percent. Mr. Brown got 3 percent. But 28 percent said they were undecided, so the outcome appeared hardly certain.
The poll, conducted right after the New Hampshire primary, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus six percentage points.
Campaigning today at the Sioux Falls Fire Station, Mr. Kerrey, who many Democrats in the state say has the best organization here, said he was "pleased to be way ahead in South Dakota." The Senator insisted that he was the candidate who best understood the state. "I don't think South Dakota will ever have a better President than Bob Kerrey," he said.
Mr. Harkin also campaigned today across this state of frozen plains and mountains, insisting that even if he does not finish first in South Dakota he will press on at least through the following week for the Colorado and Maryland primaries and Minnesota caucuses.
Senator Daschle said Mr. Kerrey's emphasis on national health care and his service in vietnam have an appeal in a state with high concentrations of elderly people and veterans.
But he also said he expected Mr. Harkin's populist themes and attacks on President Bush to go over well among some Democrats in this state where registered Democrats are barely outnumbered by Republicans. "South Dakotans are extraordinarily independent," Mr. Daschle said. "They like to see little guys take on big guys and win."
Yet winning here guarantees little more than a temporary lift. In 1988, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri easily beat Michael S. Dukakis on the Democratic side, while among Republicans, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas defeated Mr. Bush. Neither winner won his party's nomination.

HEADLINE: Views on Foreign Cars Cost Salesman His Job

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 22

 BODY:
A Chevrolet salesman who questioned the value of the "Buy American" movement in a nationally televised interview has been dismissed by his employer, who says his customers are angry about the comments in the interview.
The episode highlights concerns about the popularity of foreign cars and the loss of jobs among American auto workers. It also put the salesman, 31-year-old Matt Darcy, at the center of the debate between those who believe buying a domestic car is a duty and those who are offended by efforts to coerce consumers. 
 Gordon Chevrolet in Garden City, Mich., dismissed Mr. Darcy on Feb. 12. The owner, Gordon Stewart, said that he sold many cars to auto workers, and that his primary goal was to please his customers. Mr. Darcy did not have the right to make his views known if they threatened his business, Mr. Stewart said, adding: "Truth is not an issue. You have to be careful."
 
Other Job Offers
 Mr. Darcy has since received job offers from many employers, who say he was a victim of misguided patriotism. "All that we accomplished was to put another American out of work," said Forrest Scott, sales manager of Tamaroff Buick in suburban Detroit.
Mr. Darcy, whose parents are General Motors assembly line workers, made his comments to Lesley Stahl, a reporter on the CBS News program "60 Minutes," while manning the Geo car exhibit at the Detroit auto show in early January. Mr. Darcy dissented with a colleague's opinion that Americans should buy only American vehicles. "If America makes a good product, I buy it," Mr. Darcy said on the program. "If they don't, I buy what's good for my money. I don't have to spend money because it's American."
Many second Mr. Darcy's opinion, including economists who think his position ultimately helps rather than harms the American economy. Some dealers also say that recent anti-Japanese car advertisements are unwise. They say the advertisements should focus instead on the quality of American models. Most callers to a Detroit radio show agreed that Mr. Darcy was unfairly let go, and that consumers should buy American cars for their workmanship, not as a charitable act for the Big Three auto makers.
But Mr. Stewart said Mr. Darcy's comments offended some customers, about half of whom work at nearby General Motors plants. Mr. Stewart said he had received telephone calls from several members of the United Automobile Workers who insinuated that Mr. Darcy's statement could prompt a boycott. U.A.W. officials said there was no such threat.
Mr. Stewart said he had no choice but to dismiss Mr. Darcy, a former appliance salesman who joined Gordon Chevrolet 13 months ago. In his explanation, Mr. Stewart wrote, "Matt's philosophy about the domestic automobile manufacturing industry is in direct conflict with at least 50 percent of our customer base."
Daniel Hayes, who heads the Detroit Auto Dealers Association, said Mr. Darcy had been disloyal. "Mr. Stewart is not paying this gentleman to tout the opposition," he said.
But other dealers noted that Mr. Darcy, who drives a domestically made Geo Prizm, was representing a brand that sold models made in America as well as the Geo Storm model, which is made by Isuzu in Japan.
In recent months, the difficulty of figuring out which vehicles, or parts of vehicles, are American made has been highlighted in several reports, including the "60 Minutes" segment. Many foreign companies operate factories in the United States, and the Big Three put their name plates on many models they buy from Japanese manufacturers.
Mr. Stewart has learned this year about the strength of the "Buy American" sentiment. In a recent promotion, he offered shoppers prizes that included a camera made in China and a videocassette recorder made in Japan. A General Motors worker reportedly complained to a radio station, and Mr. Stewart has replaced the gifts with American-made cooking sets and $500 cash.

HEADLINE: South Koreans Express Pent-Up Anger at Japan

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Feb. 22

 BODY:
Along the narrow streets of Apkujung Dong, a fashionable neighborhood of boutiques, restaurants and night clubs, things Japanese are very in. Women's baggy dresses, men's short hair cuts and video games all take their cue from Tokyo.
But when some visiting Japanese diners complained noisily the other evening that prices at a Japanese restaurant were higher than at home, the strains underneath the surface flared into the open. 
 "Go back to Japan!" some Korean men shouted from another table, nearly causing a fight to erupt.
"The Japanese are our neighbors, but they behave as if they are better than us," said Kang Chae Young, a restaurant employee, who broke up the argument. "So when Japanese customers come in here, I don't feel like treating them very well."
 
Colonial Subjugation
 Korea's ill feelings against Japan have been smoldering for decades, if not centuries. Among other things, they are the legacy of a history of brutal colonial subjugation from Tokyo for most of the first half of this century.
Unlike virtually every other country in Asia, South Korea maintains a ban on major Japanese exports. There are no Toyotas, Nissans or Japanese cars of any kind on the streets and few Japanese appliances or electronics goods. There is even a prohibition against public performance of Japanese music.
Having been subjugated and seen its cultural institutions denigrated or even destroyed by the Japanese occupation, Koreans today are determined to keep from being engulfed by Japan.
The ban has not been easy to enforce, given Koreans' taste for everything from video games to sumo wrestling on television. But the theory is that by keeping out Japanese cars, electronics goods and scores of other consumer items, the integrity of Korean culture can be maintained.
 
Miyazawa Fuels Bitterness
 With the ban, Koreans have successfully nurtured their own industries and their own confidence. But there seems little doubt that anti-Japanese sentiments are on the rise again, despite intense efforts between Japanese and South Korean leaders to improve relations between the two countries.
Last month, Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa came from Tokyo to try to assuage wounded feelings and ended up making many people even more bitter. A major problem is that Korea, like many other countries, has a rising trade deficit with Japan that Tokyo does not seem to want to do much to solve.
Like the United States, South Korea instead receives lectures from Japan about working harder and improving the quality of its goods. That galls the Koreans, who point out that despite the highest trade surplus in the world, Japan maintains high tariffs on Korean textiles, shoes and clothing.
In addition, Koreans asserted that Mr. Miyazawa gave a callous and legalistic response to requests for compensation for prisoners of war in World War II, particularly the thousands of women shipped off to become sexual slaves for Japanese troops on the front.
 
'Closed-Minded and Cold'
 "In general, we Koreans are a very emotional people," said Kim Kyong Dong, professor of sociology at Seoul National University. "But when it comes to dealing with the world, Japanese seem to be very closed-minded and cold, perhaps even cruel."
In some ways, feelings between the two big rivals of Northeast Asia are a mirror image of the slide in relations between Japan and the United States. The more efforts are made to improve things on a diplomatic level, it seems, the more feelings deteriorate.
Of course, Korea's sharp restrictions on imports have also been directed elsewhere. The United States has spent the last few years trying to batter down what it regards are unfair barriers to American products, too. But in American-Korean relations, there is nothing like the visceral animosity that Koreans direct at the Japanese.
In the last few years, Japan has sought to make amends but only succeeded in coming across as half-hearted. Under pressure, for instance, Tokyo promised to stop requiring that the 600,000 ethnic Koreans who live in Japan be fingerprinted. But the promise has yet to be carried out.
 
Forced Prostitution
 The plight of the so-called comfort women, the name given to the women forced to become prostitutes for the pleasure of Japanese troops, has surfaced as a public issue only in the last year. But it has seared the consciousness of Koreans and unleashed an outpouring of shocked responses.
Only now, those women say, have they been able to set aside a lifetime of shame to tell their stories, and they are not in a mood to forgive. Hwang Kum Joo, 69 years old, said this week that she still finds it humiliating to talk about her experiences.
"The Japanese treat their dogs better than they treated us," she said. "When I saw Miyazawa in Korea, I wanted to hurt him physically. He's just like all the Japanese. He wants us all to die out so there will be no one left to tell the truth."
Sitting near a heater in the tiny restaurant she owns, Mrs. Hwang recalled how she and other teen-age girls from a village in the southern Korean Peninsula were put on trains and told they were being given manufacturing jobs, like hundreds of thousands of men drafted into forced labor.
 
Tokyo Spurns Payment Idea
 Instead, she said, the young women -- many as young as 12 years old -- were kept like animals in filthy barracks, where they had to service 20 or 30 or 50 men a day. Women who contracted venereal disease were simply left to die or shot. Anyone resisting the advances of the men was beaten, she said.
"There's still a feeling of humiliation in talking about it," said Miss Hwang. "Young women in their 30's come up to me and ask, 'Why did you go?' How could anyone ask me that? How could anyone be willing to go into such indescribable conditions?"
Mr. Miyazawa offered abject apologies when he was here. But the Tokyo Government continues to spurn the idea of compensation for the handful of women left to tell those harrowing stories. So emotional is the issue that Japan's response has been devastating to its image in Korea.
A newspaper cartoon, for instance, showed Mr. Miyazawa arriving at the airport and grabbing the arms of a flower-bearing girl greeting him.
"You are a pretty girl," he says, leering. "How old are you?"
Shaking with fear, she answers, "I am 12 years old, sir, and I am a primary school girl."
This is a time when South Koreans are also hoping for reconciliation with North Korea. But in that area again there is suspicion of Japan. At the most recent talks between the Prime Ministers of North and South Korea, one thing the two sides agreed on was joint criticism of Tokyo.
Moreover, there is widespread suspicion in South Korea that Tokyo has been cozying up to the north lately because it wants to keep the peninsula divided. Japanese officials deny the assertion, although some acknowledge that a united Korea could pose an economic or political threat to Tokyo.

HEADLINE: Gun Runners From Miami Give Brazilian Drug Gangs Lead in Arms Race

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Feb. 19

 BODY:
With smugglers funneling high-powered rifles and pistols from Miami to Rio's hillside slums, the police say they are losing an arms race here with drug gangs.
Facing new, military-style weaponry in the hands of traffickers, Rio's police commanders last month threw out most of their bulletproof jackets as useless. After a police helicopter was shot down, pilots have standing orders to avoid low passes over shantytowns during drug raids. In a recent scene on the television news, antidrug police armed with .38-caliber revolvers were shown retreating from a slum in the face of semiautomatic weapons fire. 
 "The criminals are much better armed than the police," said Carlos Eustaquio de Almeida Pacheco, president of the state's civilian police fraternal association. "It is frightening the amount of sophisticated weaponry that has come in in the last five years."
To be sure, many of the arms wielded by criminals here bear the stamp "Made in Brazil." They are either military weapons stolen from Brazil's Army, or are produced by Brazil's handgun industry, one of the largest in the world. But much of the new, high-powered weaponry -- Colt AR-15 semiautomatic rifles, Uzi 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistols, and AK-47 assault rifles -- can be traced back to southern Florida gun shops.
"The main source is Miami -- either from Miami directly, or from Miami via Asuncion, Paraguay," said Aledio Americo dos Santos, director of firearms control for Rio state's civilian police. "It could be a Dutch Browning, an Italian Beretta, or an Israeli Uzi -- but Miami is the source."
 
Hot Line to Be Set Up
 With both the United States and Brazil alarmed by the growth in gun smuggling, a hotline is being established this month between the Rio office of Brazil's Federal Police and the Miami office of the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Bypassing bureaucratic obstacles, the police here will send serial numbers and weapons makes directly to Miami to help the bureau break up arms trafficking rings.
This direct link comes as the United States is taking greater steps to crack down on illegal gun exports to Latin America. Last year, the Firearms Bureau stationed an agent in Colombia, the agency's first full-time foreign assignment. This year, the Bureau is to open an office in Mexico City.
Brazil, Latin America's most populous nation, demonstrates the often hidden nature of the North to South arms trade. In recent years, the Firearms Bureau and the United States Customs Service have only intercepted a handful of arms shipments to Brazil. But the police in Brazil say that a series of seizures point to a growing underground trade.
In mid-1988, Brazil's Federal Police investigated 98 Brazilians -- including several Rio policemen -- suspected of smuggling in more than 300 weapons from Miami, including 9-millimeter Intratec assault pistols, AR-15 rifles, and Uzis. In July, 1990, police in Brasilia arrested Joao Pedro de Aquino for possessing Israeli pistols, a Czechoslovak rifle and United States-made rifles and pistols. Mr. Aquino, a congressional aide, had made six trips to Miami in the preceeding nine months.
Last April, Firearms Bureau agents in southern Florida arrested five Brazilians on charges of violating Federal firearms export laws. Agents seized 55 arms as evidence and said they suspected that the group had smuggled to Brazil over 400 weapons, largely Uzis and AR-15 rifles.
Motivated by markups as high as 500 percent, Brazil's gun smugglers provide a bridge between relatively lax gun controls in the United States and stringent laws in Brazil. The traffic specializes in weapons banned for civilian use in Brazil -- semiautomatic rifles and handguns with gauges higher than .38-caliber.
Under Florida law, nonresident foreigners need written approval from their consulates before they can purchase a gun. Few Brazilian or Paraguayan buyers take this step, instead relying on local contacts to make their purchases for them.
 
Paraguay Tightens Law
 In July of 1990, Paraguay, a traditional transit country for arms destined for Brazil, started to require written approval from the Foreign Ministry in Asuncion before consulates could approve gun purchases. Consular officials in Miami say that since then they cannot recall issuing any gun purchase approvals to visiting Paraguayans.
"The percentage of guns bought legally in the U.S. and used in a crime in Brazil is very small," said Claudio Barroin Mello, Rio's acting regional superintendent of Federal Police.
If the weapons do not come directly on one of the 35 flights a week between Miami and Brazil, they enter through the Paraguayan border towns of Pedro Juan Caballero and Ciudad del Este. Owing their existence largely to Brazil's thirst for contraband, these two towns have long conducted a flourishing trade in weapons banned in Brazil.
 
Knives for Guns
 Brazil's thirst for weapons has grown in recent years as rapid urbanization and economic hardship has produced increased crime rates.
In the 1960's, Rio's favelas, or hillside shantytowns, charmed a generation of American moviegoers with the lyrical carnival film "Black Orpheus." Far from lyrical today, Rio's slums are more often than not controlled by units of the Red Command drug mafia.
"Through the mid-1970's, Rio's favelas were marked by the figure of the 'malandro' -- a guy who didn't want to work, who used a knife for petty holdups," said Alba Zaluar, a anthropologist who studies one of Rio's largest slums, Cidade de Deus. "After the mid-1970's, a new figure appeared -- the 'bandido,' who kills people with guns."
In Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city, the number of registered gun purchases jumped from 9,832 in 1983 to 59,954 in 1991. In Rio, the numbers of guns sold legally jumped from 4,500 in 1982 to 18,590 last year. In 1991, Rio de Janeiro police seized 7,123 unregistered guns, and the true number of guns held illegally among the populace is believed to be huge.
The majority of guns here, legal or illegal, still are not the high-powered smuggled weapons but handguns.
"The 1980's were our years of biggest growth," said Carlos Murgel, president of Forjas Taurus, S.A., Brazil's largest handgun manufacturer. With worldwide annual sales of 400,000 handguns, Taurus is the third largest manufacturer in the world and last year started making them in Miami under the name Taurus International.
But with $100 .38-caliber revolvers becoming so commonplace, criminals now put a premium on more sophisticated weaponry. Last year, according to official data, 164 weapons disappeared from Brazil's Army, either through theft by outsiders or through sale by soldiers. The Red Command drug gang is believed to infiltrate young members into the army so that they can later steal the military's rapid-firing light automatic rifles.
Many sophisticated weapons are even traded on Rio's black market. "In Caxias," Mr. dos Santos said, "if you take the time, you can get a cannon."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: White House;
BUSH PUSHES PLAN TO REVIVE ECONOMY

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22

 BODY:
President Bush took to the airwaves today to generate support for his economic recovery legislation, saying that an alternative Democratic plan would "give you two years of pocket change in exchange for a lifetime of higher taxes."
The President cast his plan, which will be pitted against the Democrats' measure in House votes next week, as a common-sense attack on the recession that would stimulate growth by boosting the homebuilding industry and putting money in consumers' pockets. He again urged the public to demand that Congress enact a core package of his proposals by March 20, a deadline he set in his State of the Union Message in January. 
 Mr. Bush's brief address, released to radio stations this morning, is part of a White House plan to sharpen the President's image among voters by refining the themes of his re-election campaign in a variety of addresses and staged events.
 
Getting the Message Across
 Some of Mr. Bush's chief political advisers said this past week that the campaign's disappointing showing against Patrick J. Buchanan in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday stemmed from problems in getting voters to understand what Mr. Bush's proposals were and why they were worth supporting.
"One of the things it takes to get across any political message is repetition," one of those advisers said in an interview on Wednesday, "and I think the longer he goes, the more it will get across."
In today's speech, Mr. Bush described his economic package as a sure-fire method of stimulating growth by creating jobs and reducing taxes. The core of the plan includes a sharp cut in the tax on capital gains, a tax credit and a tax break on savings for first-time homebuyers, as well as new tax breaks for the real estate industry and for buyers of new business equipment and buildings.
By contrast, he said, Democrats "huddled behind closed doors and played games with the tax code" and finally "settled on a scheme that makes no economic sense."
"In other words," Mr. Bush said, "the Congressional leaders want to give you two years of pocket change in exchange for a lifetime of higher taxes. And that is a very bad deal for us and for our children, who must pay the bill." He said his plan would not raise taxes but would require "some tough choices" on Federal spending.
"Put the plans side by side and here's the bottom line: my plan works; theirs doesn't," he said.
 
The Democrats' Plan
 The Democratic proposal, prepared by Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, would halve the capital gains tax on investments held more than five years and grant a two-year tax cut of $200 for individuals and $400 for couples. It would also offer tax breaks for real estate and new equipment similar to Mr. Bush's.
Mr. Rostenkowski would finance the proposals with a permanent increase in the top personal income tax rate to 35 percent from 31 percent and a surtax of 10 percent on taxable income over $1 million.
To Mr. Bush's argument that the middle-class tax cut was too small to matter, Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the third-ranking Democrat in the House, replied in another radio broadcast, "Is this Administration so out of touch that they can't imagine what it's like to get enough in the checking account to pay tuition for school, or pay the dentist's bill, or pay a mortgage check without dipping into savings?"
 
Jobs and Tax Breaks
 Mr. Bonior, the Democratic whip, also disputed that Mr. Bush's plan would combat the recession, saying it relied on ineffective "trickle-down" economics. He went on: "We're for jobs and tax breaks for the middle class. The President is for tax breaks for the wealthy."
In an apparent bow to Mr. Buchanan, Mr. Bush also devoted several lines of his short speech to another White House request that Congress enact a $500 increase in the income tax exemption for children.
Mr. Buchanan has assailed Mr. Bush for omitting this provision from the core package of growth legislation he sent to Congress.

HEADLINE: Aid Cuts Vex Connecticut's Less-Than-Gold Coast

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., Feb. 22

 BODY:
When Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. unveiled a budget earlier this month that featured deep cuts in state aid to cities and towns, he sent a shudder through this city and the rest of Fairfield County.
Famed for its millionaires and their palatial estates, Fairfield County is by far the wealthiest corner of Connecticut and one of the wealthiest areas in the nation. Yet it also harbors a large middle class and many working-class people. And amid a recession that has put many out of work and left the real-estate market stagnant, most towns were already struggling to meet expenses long before the Governor announced his budget. Even though state aid is a small part of most local budgets in the county, the cuts have upset many officials and forced deeper reductions in spending. 
 Stamford, already facing a deficit of $7 million, must now pare even more to accommodate a $5 million proposed reduction in state aid, most of which is spent on education. One of the biggest blows would be a $2.1 million bill to cover a pension plan for teachers, formerly paid for entirely by the state.
"Our backs are going to be up against the wall," said Stanley J. Esposito, who was elected to a two-year term as Mayor of Stamford in November. "I just don't know where we're going to get this money."
 
'Tough Job Even Tougher'
 Total state aid to Stamford would fall more than 43 percent, a reduction to $5.8 million from $10.4 million last year, in a $257 million budget for the next fiscal year. Some of the cuts were anticipated, but not all: Stamford is left with a $3.6 million deficit because of the reduced state aid.
"It means that we either have to raise taxes or reduce spending," said Frank Harrison, Stamford's budget director. "We're thinking about both things. It makes a tough job even tougher, because there are less resources than last year."
His complaint is echoed around the county, where many officials were grappling with higher costs and an anti-tax mood long before the state budget was announced on Feb. 5. The situation has led some legislators and others to call on the state to develop an alternative means for determining state aid. At the moment, aid is parceled out using a formula that measures property values around the state against each other.
"That formula inveighs against Fairfield County, because it compares a dollar in Fairfield to a dollar in New London," said State Senator William H. Nickerson, a Republican from Greenwich who also represents northern Stamford and part of New Canaan. "Connecticut is unusual in its disparity in what a dollar buys. A $100,000 house might be a very nice house in Pomfret, in the northeast corner of the state, but no such thing exists in Fairfield County."
 
Fewer Garbage Pickups
 Many officials say they believe the cuts will not be reversed in negotiations over the budget, and the new reality from Hartford has hit hard at many wealthier towns. "We planned our budget thinking we'd have $3 million less in state aid," said Jack E. Miller, finance director for the town of Norwalk, "but the Governor has cut us far more drastically than we'd anticipated." A big shock was the assessment for the teachers' retirement fund, which he said will cost Norwalk $1.3 million if it is passed by the state legislature. Mr. Miller said the cuts for Norwalk would total $3.8 million, $800,000 more than he had expected.
At the same time, income on investments has slipped with the cut in interest rates, and property values have not increased for the most part. For Norwalk, the situation may mean layoffs. And it has already been determined that garbage will be picked up only once a week, instead of twice, until things get better. "It's making life miserable for everyone," Mr. Miller said.
Even decidedly well-off towns are trying to cut costs. "Now we have to go back to the drawing board if this goes through," said Caroline Rothschild, New Canaan's finance director. She added: "Every town is faced with a struggle, and no one wants to be the one who says, 'Well, the sky's the limit.' "
New Canaan would actually owe the state about $35,000 under the proposed state budget because of the payment to the teachers' pension fund.
Stamford has an unusually high proportion of poor people for Fairfield County, according to 1990 census data. It is the fifth largest city in the state, with 108,056 people. Between 10 percent and 15 percent, or as many as 16,000 people, could be classified as poor, city officials say. The city has urban problems like illiteracy, homelessness and AIDS. It also has highly paid executives and lavish estates.
 
Extreme Wealth and Poverty
 "Stamford is the only town in the state where there are such extremes of wealth and poverty," said William R. Papallo, the superintendent of the Stamford schools. "The city gets penalized for being wealthy and gets very little of the assistance for being poor."
Taxes are a delicate business. With much of the state in an anti-tax mood following the imposition of a personal income tax last year, local officials have set caps, in many cases, to keep property taxes from rising more than the bare minimum.
"If we continue to put pressure on the local taxpayer, we could have a lot of people leave us," Dr. Papallo said. "We have many people here who have the wherewithal to go somewhere else."
 
Fewer Reading Teachers
 Only about 5 percent of Stamford's $100 million education budget comes from the state, but the proposed cuts come as many programs are being held at last year's levels.
The Stamford schools this year have cut out an intern program for teachers to learn administration, Dr. Papallo said, and there are fewer reading teachers and guidance counselors in elementary schools. "We have also cut out any thought of increases in texts, supplies or equipment for next year," he said, "which really means a reduction because of inflation."
At the same time, a new education expense has been added -- that of contributing to the teachers' retirement fund. Contributions are based on a municipality's wealth, and Stamford, assessed at $2.1 million, faces the biggest bill in the state.
Officials from other towns say they are incensed at the perception in Hartford that they have money to burn.
"Contrary to popular belief, everybody in Greenwich and all of Fairfield County are not millionaires," said William Bliss, the Greenwich Comptroller, who faces a proposed $3.3 million cut in state aid, to $944,733 from $4.2 million. Salaries and overtime have already been cut in the town's $154 million budget to keep taxes from rising more than 5.5 percent.
"We have unemployed people, we have homeless, we have working people," he said. "We don't all sit around and clip coupons all day."

HEADLINE: Building Unions Protest S.R.O. Project on 43d St.

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER

 BODY:
For nearly a month building-trade unions have picketed the Times Square Hotel to call attention to the high unemployment in their industry and protest that the hotel is not paying prevailing wages for transforming it into the largest single-room-occupancy residence in the city.
In the building on the northeastern corner of Eighth Avenue and 43d Street, the residents, many of them elderly or infirm, are coping with the disturbance of the two-year renovation and the intermittent hoopla outside their front door. Outside the pickets contend that the project employs unqualified workers and illegal aliens so that the contractor can pay unconscionably low wages. 
 The rehabilitation is to provide low-income housing for the homeless, the poor and the mentally ill. The owner of the building, Common Ground Community Inc., has received a $28 million loan from the City Department of Housing Preservation and Development. The loan is to be repaid with tenants' rents. About $16 million of the loan is allotted for construction.
Common Ground said there was not enough money to pay prevailing wages to builders. It added that prevailing-wage statutes, which require that wages and health benefits at public construction sites be no less than those under union bargaining agreements, were not applicable because Common Ground is a private company.
The unions call that a ruse to avoid hiring union workers and paying them the prevailing wages, which vary depending on the work. A spokesman for Local 3 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Mark Hansen, said the city loan made the argument about prevailing wages hazy at best.
"Should this be a prevailing wage project?" the executive director of Common Ground, Roseanne Haggerty, asked. "Well, you can ask all kinds of questions that are not resolvable without the city funds that are necessary. We have what we have."
In a response Mr. Hansen said, "No one came to us saying: 'This is a nonprofit project. What can the building trades do to help?' "
A spokeswoman for the housing department, Valerie Bradley, said no law was broken because the agency was "not a party to the contract between Common Ground and Constantine D & B" of Queens, the general contractor. The owner of the construction company, Constantine Iannou, said he had worked on many union jobs, "but they want these homeless projects to cost less."
"These rehabs are not prevailing-wage jobs, because the money's not there," he said.
Two laborers at the hotel, James Riddick and Lamont Fries, said they were paid $10 an hour, which is about what they had earned on other jobs in the last two or three years. Mr. Iannou said that $10 was the minimum he permitted his subcontractors to pay on the site and that skilled carpenters made up to $25 an hour plus benefits. He said his employees were not illegal aliens.
"We examine green cards and I.N.S. documents for all of our workers," he said. "Most of them are citizens, anyway."
 
Tempers Are Rising
 An organizer of Local 3 of the Carpenters and Joiners' Union, Maurice McGrath, said the prevailing wage for a carpenter was about $43 an hour, including benefits.
Tempers have flared. Ms. Haggerty said, "I think it's outrageous that union leaders have targeted this nonprofit building for venting their frustrations." She added that the pickets had harassed tenants and hotel workers.
The construction supervisor, Bob McLoughlin, said pickets had prevented a few deliveries. "That could shut us down," Mr. McLoughlin said. "But I feel for those guys. What can be done? I could quit and give them my job."

HEADLINE: Suits Pushing Banks To Obey State Laws On Credit Card Fees

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Although half the states in the country have laws limiting or banning credit card fees for late payments, for annual renewals and for exceeding credit limits, banks have largely charged the fees anyway. They argue that they are governed only by the laws in the states where their credit card operations are based -- not where the customers live.
Now, that argument is being challenged in more than a dozen lawsuits in four states. Their aim is to see that the laws in the states where the customers live are enforced, and more suits are expected. 
 Some banks and credit card companies, like American Express, are bringing their interest rates and fees in line with state laws. One solution is to drop the late fees and raise interest rates for delinquent accounts.
The suits strike at the heart of one of banking's biggest sources of profit. Last year, annual fees plus the penalties collected for paying late, exceeding credit limits and bouncing checks amounted to an estimated $1.13 billion, or nearly a third of the $3.5 billion of all profit that banks collected from their credit card businesses, according to the Nilson Report, a Santa Monica, Calif., newsletter that monitors the credit card industry.
The catalyst for these suits was a ruling in Massachusetts by a Federal judge, who found that the Discover credit card issued by the Greenwood Trust Company, a Delaware-based bank subsidiary of Sears, Roebuck & Company, violated Massachusetts law when it collected monthly late-payment fees of $10. The bank has appealed the decision and submitted arguments on Friday to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston. Since the Massachusetts decision, won by Attorney General Scott Harshbarger, more than a dozen similar suits have been filed by private lawyers on behalf of consumers in Alabama, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Pennsylvania.
"I'm sure there are going to be quite a few more," said Michael Donovan, senior associate at Greenfield & Chemicles, a law firm based in Haverford, Pa. Greenfield & Chemicles filed suits in December against Citibank (South Dakota) and Greenwood Trust for charging Pennsylvania residents late fees that were not allowed under Pennsylvania law.
Alan S. Kaplinsky, partner at the Philadelphia law firm of Wolf, Block, Schorr & Solis-Cohen, which is representing Greenwood Trust, noted that for many years before the Massachusetts decision, lawyers and bank customers had accepted the right of banks to levy charges regulated by the banks' home states. A 1978 Supreme Court decision involving Marquette National Bank of Wisconsin established the rule in the credit card business that banks could charge the interest rates allowed under laws of their home states.
While the Massachusetts Attorney General contends that the Marquette decision covers only interest payments, not fees, many bankers say the Marquette decision also covers fees.
Mr. Karplinski said the lawsuits were based on a mistaken idea that fees and interest rates were separate. He said he would argue for a broad interpretation of the term interest to include fees as well as interest on borrowed money. "When the term interest is given its proper economic definition," he said, there is clear precedent for allowing banks to charge the interest that is allowed in their home states.
The problem is serious enough that at least one card issuer, American Express, whose Optima credit card has about 3.1 million accounts, announced plans this month to charge higher interest rates to customers with delinquent accounts instead of its $15-a-month late fee. The new arrangement is to take effect on June 1, American Express said.
 
Citicorp Is Experimenting
 Citicorp, the giant in the credit card business with 21.4 million accounts in the United States, is also experimenting with a credit card that would charge an annual interest rate of 15.9 percent, but would climb to 19.9 percent for a year if a customer failed to make a monthly payment on time.
Even if banks win the legal battle, which many lawyers expect to be appealed all the way to the Supreme Court, the future for fees is unclear. As the credit card business becomes more competitive with new entrants like the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, fees, along with interest rates, are one of many important criteria customers use for comparison shopping. The promise of a lifetime exemption from annual fees was a key part of A.T.& T.'s rapid ascent to the top ranks of credit card issuers. It issued 12 million cards and opened 7.6 million accounts in just 22 months.
Even now, to keep customers from canceling their cards, banks do not always charge their posted fees. And fees for late payments or for exceeding the credit line are enforced selectively, depending on the bank or the customer. Some banks are now quietly granting several days' grace before assessing late payment penalties.
"If a bank starts hitting people with the late payment fee on the first day, or even five days after the payment is due, you could argue that they are making money with the fee," said one banker who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
He said that if the bank waits until the payment is past due for 10 days before charging the fee, the fee is justified, because it covers the extra cost of sending letters and making telephone calls to prod the customer into paying. Banks are inclined to begin collection efforts within 30 days after an account becomes delinquent, because they have learned that their losses are higher if they wait until accounts are past due for 60 or 90 days.
No one knows how many banks abide by the laws of the state where their customers live because no one has surveyed the 6,000 banks and savings institutions on that question. But Robert McKinley, president of RAM Research, a firm in Frederick, Md., that monitors the credit card industry, estimated that about half of card issuers pay attention to the laws of states where their customers live.
Among them is Fleet/Norstar Financial Group, in Providence, R.I. Its credit card application states where local laws do not allow it to collect its standard $10 late payment fee, its $7.50 fee for exceeding the credit limit or its annual fee of $20 or $25.
"We have spent tens of thousands of dollars keeping track of the exceptions in state laws," said Chris Fredrick, vice president at Fleet. "I want this issue to be straightened out, preferably with a Federal law overriding the state laws."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Owners Know It's Spring When Chilling Arbitration Process Hibernates

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Contrary to the nostalgic belief of misguided romantics, baseball's version of winter does not end with the first pop of ball in mitt or first crack of bat against ball. In these modern times, it ends when the last salary-arbitration case is decided.
Winter, it can thus be proclaimed, is gone, and spring has arrived. Lingering in the fresh air of training camps, however, is the economic carnage arbitration has left in its wake. 
 Can the brain trust of the Texas Rangers really enjoy the sights, smells and sounds of spring when they are still reeling from the double jolt it received last week, the back-to-back losses to Ruben Sierra and Rafael Palmeiro, which cost them an extra $2.7 million?
Can the Pittsburgh Pirates sigh with the relief spring brings knowing they have to pay Barry Bonds, Doug Drabek and John Smiley a total of $12.64 million this year and they could still lose them all as free agents after the season?
Sure, the Cincinnati Reds are delighted that they could forge their way through 12 arbitration cases and emerge in one piece, but their elation might be just a bit deflated when they realize that 10 of those players will earn $1 million or more this year, with two of them signing multiyear contracts that each average more than $2.4 million in raises alone from 1991.
 
Hot Topic of Discussion
 Of course, the clubs want to banish salary arbitration from their lives; they want to do that more desperately than they want to win the World Series.
"In the last 15 to 18 months," Bud Selig said, "talking to every club, asking what do you hate most about the system, the bottom line is if they had their choice, without a doubt, it's salary arbitration. Free agency at least you can elect to do, but in salary arbitration you're somewhat a prisoner of what other people have done."
Selig is the owner of the Milwaukee Brewers and a member of the economic-study committee that was formed in the 1990 labor negotiations to determine where baseball is headed economically. Salary arbitration has been a major topic of discussion at committee meetings.
It has been a constant topic of discussion, as well, among club owners and general managers. Some have talked about trying to trade it out of existence, offering players free agency sooner than they can attain it now, which is after their sixth year in the major leagues. Despite the intense dislike for arbitration, though, not all club officials endorse that sort of swap.
"To ask a baseball man that question, you're going to get a different answer than you would from a financial guy," said Joe McIlvaine, San Diego's general manager. "Something like that would be strictly for financial reasons. Baseball people would be against that; they would go kicking and screaming. I've heard it whispered. It pains me to even hear that."
 
MacPhail Voices an Objection
 Al Harazin of the Mets basically concurred with McIlvaine.
"When you spend a lot of money on player development, you'd like to feel you can retain the players you develop for a reasonable amount of time before they go somewhere else," Harazin said. "Also, if you're going to be asked to sign a player to a long-term contract after he's been in the big leagues three years, you might not even know how good a player he is. With six years, maybe five, you have a pretty good idea what kind of player he is and know if you want to commit yourself to a long-term contract. But after three or four years, you're sometimes guessing."
Andy MacPhail of Minnesota registered his objection to the idea of earlier free agency because "it exacerbates the problem of big market, small market."
"Right now when a guy is a free agent, he's 31 years old or so," MacPhail said. "At least a small market can hold onto players longer. If you start turning the real young players loose and let the Dodgers or whoever have those guys, you're going to make the balance of power issue worse."
Sandy Alderson of Oakland suggested that granting free agency earlier could be costlier in the long run. "You pay players year after year for performing, and you have a decision to make each year," he said. "Even though the decision is in the hands of an arbitrator, some of that is predictable within a range. That's opposed to paying over a longer period and not knowing how the player will perform."
Swapping earlier free agency for arbitration, of course, has its advocates. Fred Claire of Los Angeles said he wasn't sure what the reduced requirement for free agency should be, but given the percentage of salary increase that occurs each year, the idea has "a lot of merit to it."
Al Rosen, who has never met an arbitration case he didn't want to settle, said he has always believed that unlimited free agency would be better than arbitration.
"I feel arbitration is counterproductive to managing your money," the San Francisco general manager said. "You have a choice of whether you want to sign a free agent. You don't have a choice with a player eligible for salary arbitration. You're at the mercy of other signings. You are subjected to an arbitrator's ruling for negotiations where both sides are higher than you want to be. You have no control over it."
The clubs also don't have control over the future of arbitration. They can't scuttle it unless the players agree.
"People who see the elimination of salary arbitration on the horizon should not get their hopes up," Eugene Orza, a lawyer for the players union, said. "It's a valuable right and one people should not assume or contemplate will not be around for a long long time."
Now why did he have to spoil the start of spring for the clubs, too?
 
Smaller but Gigantic Raises
 It's small consolation, but the salaries of the players who filed for arbitration this year rose "only" 99.9 percent, the lowest increase in the last three years (103 percent last year, 102 in 1990). With Jose Lind of Pittsburgh winning his case and a $2 million salary over the Pirates' $1 million figure yesterday, the average salary of 157 arbitration players has soared from $713,132 to $1,425,312.
Three players gained raises of $3 million or more, the first time anyone has received such a raise after filing for arbitration. Roberto Alomar's three-year contract with Toronto computes to an average raise of $3,366,667, Barry Larkin's five-year deal with Cincinnati represents a $3.02 million increase, and Cecil Fielder of Detroit added $3 million to the average of his expired two-year contract.
Eight players emerged with raises in the $2 million to $3 million range, and 29 have salaries that are between $1 million and $2 million higher. In all, 40 players received raises of $1 million or more, 13 more than a year ago and twice as many as two years ago.
Six players wound up with less money: Mark McGwire and Walt Weiss of Oakland, Billy Ripken of Baltimore, Al Leiter of Toronto, Joe Magrane of St. Louis and Kelly Downs of San Francisco. Jerry Browne of Cleveland and Kevin Seitzer of Kansas City agreed to the same salaries.
Clubs won 11 of 20 hearings this year, making the 17-year arbitration results read 187 decisions for the clubs, 154 for the players. Despite the clubs' won-lost advantage this year, players emerged with five of the six highest salaries awarded in the 341 hearings.
Dann Bilardello of San Diego wound up with the lowest salary in a hearing, $125,000, since Alan Knicely lost at $80,000 in 1986.
 
Nothing Personal, Jeff
 Last year, Jeff Hamilton of Los Angeles was the only player who came out of arbitration with a pay cut, although the bonuses he went on to earn during the season enabled him to make more money than in the previous season. This time Hamilton gained the smallest raise, $5,945, of the 149 players who got raises.
"I have nothing against Jeff; I like Jeff," Fred Claire, the Dodgers' general manager, said. "But you have a player who had a good season three seasons ago and seemed to be emerging as a solid, everyday player but the last two years has been sidelined by injuries. He just hasn't been able to be in position to play enough games. Hopefully, Jeff will not have a complex over it. Hopefully, he'll play enough and produce."
 
Angels' Sierra Strategy
 Because the California Angels need a heavy dose of hitting, some baseball people assumed that Whitey Herzog would race for the telephone as soon as the Rangers lost the Ruben Sierra arbitration at a record $5 million. The Rangers will almost certainly try to trade the outstanding hitter rather than lose him as a free agent next November.
But Herzog, the Angels' general manager, said he is not in a hurry to pursue the outfielder. "If I trade for him, I'm going to have to give up one of my three left-handers," Herzog said, referring to the pitchers Jim Abbott, Chuck Finley and Mark Langston, who are the strength of the team. "If I do that, I'd be looking for a pitcher. I'm probably going to sit and wait. If you wait, you can get him just for money."
Of course, the Angels were unable to get the free agents Bobby Bonilla, Danny Tartabull and Otis Nixon "just for money" this winter.

Unlikely Eden

 BODY:
A lot of apples grow in New York State. So do a lot of cows. Painters from the Hudson River School found its landscape majestic. Folk artists like Grandma Moses remembered it as the most peaceable of rural kingdoms. Even so this is not a place one associates with Eden. Perhaps one should.
Only California, Florida and Texas, The Times reported last week, make more money from nurseries and greenhouses than New York. Here, the geraniums are too many to count and the incidence of hanging plants too frequent for even the most assiduous knotters of macrame. Here, seedlings shiver in cold frames and pachysandra gets ready to sprawl. Here, gardenias grow for prom nights and baby's breath for wedding days and sycamores start on their shady careers. Here is a garden. 
 Better yet, this garden is growing very well indeed. It supplies trees to the company that wants to prove it really cares about the environment. It supplies the backyard farmer with tomato vines. It supplies supermarkets with the houseplants that are the city dwellers' response to mean streets and meaner weather. And it supplies everyone faced with a heart-sinking grocery bill or plumbing that needs repair the means to feel rich on very little money. There's nothing like a recession to make a bunch of tulips or a pot of primroses look like an acre of orchids.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
Where Bush Is Right

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
President Bush is under such attack these days for lacking principle -- for wavering on issues -- that he is entitled to credit for one area in which he has made a principled commitment and stuck to it. That is his policy for peace between Israel and the Arabs.
No one can doubt that Mr. Bush cares about the issue, deeply and personally. He has worked at it from the beginning of his Presidency. He seized the moment after the Persian Gulf war to press a new proposal that actually got the parties to the negotiating table. And in all this he has taken considerable political risk. 
 Now his policy is up against an especially prickly question: whether to insist that Israel, in order to get American loan guarantees, stop building settlements in the occupied territories. In this time of political difficulty for him, will the President stay the course? I believe he will.
One reason for thinking so is that continuation of the peace talks hangs on the settlement question, as Mr. Bush is well aware. Any formula that provides billions of dollars in guarantees to Israel without effectively stopping its creeping annexation of the West Bank and Gaza would make it impossible for the Palestinians to stay at the table.
The key word, for American policy makers, is "effective." For more than 20 years U.S. Administrations have opposed the seizing of land and building of settlements in the occupied territories, but the opposition has been pathetically ineffective.
The President and Secretary of State Baker know about that first-hand. In 1990 they arranged $400 million in loan guarantees to Israel for housing new immigrants. Mr. Baker arduously negotiated conditions: that none of the money go to the occupied territories and Israel provide full information on what it spends in the territories.
But the conditions have had no effect. A report issued by the General Accounting Office last week found that the U.S. guarantees simply freed up other money that Israel spent in the West Bank and Gaza. And the Israeli Government did not provide the promised information.
Once burned, Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker will no doubt be twice shy. They are likely to require firm and enforceable rules that any U.S. loan guarantees will not allow Israel to spend other funds on housing and infrastructure in the occupied territories, and that there will be no new settlement construction.
The President is also likely to stick to his guns because his policy is good for Israel. It encourages Israel to make a choice that its political system has been avoiding but that world trends demand.
The choice is between peace and annexation. Israelis have long wanted peace. But their Governments have pursued expansionist policies incompatible with peace.
It was possible to fudge the choice so long as there was no one to negotiate with anyway -- so long as the Arabs refused to make peace. But now Arab delegations are actually negotiating.
An Israeli policy of refusing to make the territorial compromise necessary for peace has also required enormous American subvention. The billions in annual military and economic aid could be counted on while the cold war was on and Israel helped to block Soviet ambitions in the Middle East.
But the cold war is over now, there is no Soviet threat and it is not so clear that American support at such levels can continue indefinitely. Israelis themselves are increasingly restive at their dependence on the United States.
Moreover, the end of the cold war presents Israel with a great challenge and opportunity: to build a high-tech civilian economy that would employ immigrants. But that can happen only if there is peace.
Secretary of State Baker, in talking with Israel's Ambassador about the request for $10 billion in loan guarantees, has made it clear that the choice is Israel's. The United States wants to provide the guarantees, but only on terms that do not destroy the chance for peace.
If the President holds to that position, he will be doing both Israel and the United States a service. He will put their crucial relationship on a more realistic basis for the post-cold-war era, to their mutual benefit.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Georgia;
Carter Welcomes Tsongas to Plains

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PLAINS, Ga., Feb. 22

 BODY:
Former President Jimmy Carter met with Paul E. Tsongas here today and, though not endorsing the former Massachusetts Senator, said Mr. Tsongas's honesty and message of economic truth could appeal to Georgia voters.
Mr. Carter emphasized that he would not endorse any Democratic candidate in advance of the March 3 primary here, and he stressed two of Mr. Tsongas's favorite themes: no tax cut for the middle class and telling the American voters the truth. 
 He advised Mr. Tsongas to make a maximum campaign effort in every state and to use his Massachusetts friends to campaign "person to person" for him as Mr. Carter's friends, the "Peanut brigade," did for him during his successful 1976 Presidential bid.
 
Sought Visit With Carter
 Taking Mr. Carter's advice, and as a result of a warm reception at a Democratic money-raising dinner in Atlanta on Friday, Mr. Tsongas, who has neither a strong financial nor organizational base in the South, said he was considering spending one more day in the state at some future date.
Mr. Tsongas had asked for today's visit with Mr. Carter. Other Democratic candidates have sought advice from the former President, but Mr. Tsongas was the first to be invited to Mr. Carter's home here.
The two spent an hour in private conversation with their wives and then held a joint news conference in the driveway. "I think the South is quite receptive to the kind of message that Senator Tsongas brought to New Hampshire," Mr. Carter said.
Mr. Carter compared Mr. Tsongas's campaign to his own Presidential campaign, when Mr. Carter, a former Governor of Georgia and peanut farmer, became the Presidential nominee without the backing of the Democratic Party hierarchy. He said that the lack of support had given him "an element of freedom" to follow his own conscience.
 
Give People the Truth
 "The beginnings are very similar," Mr. Carter said of his and Mr. Tsongas's campaigns. "Nobody thought we had a chance."
Mr. Carter said he would not predict the outcome of this year's election, but he said the country was in a cycle of change similar to the one occurring when he was elected in the wake of the Vietnam War and Watergate.
"Then people were looking for somebody to tell the truth and I promised to tell the truth," Mr. Carter said. "I think that there is a kind of similar desire on the part of the American people now just to have a candidate tell them the truth and be honest and acknowledge maybe some unpopular positions.
"The more Democratic candidates yield to transient demagoguery like tax cuts when we will probably be facing a $400 billion to $500 billion deficit this year is a step backwards," Mr. Carter said.
Mr. Carter suggested that Mr. Tsongas take a lesson from Senator Wyche Fowler's 1986 campaign against an incumbent Republican, Mack Mattingly. Mr. Fowler, a liberal Representative from an Atlanta district, campaigned in the rural southern part of the state by telling voters he did not know anything about farming, but was willing to learn. He did not apologize for his opposition to the United States-backed war in Nicaragua, a war that was popular among rural voters.
 
'Mecca Steps' for Tsongas
 "He was honest and and he told the truth and acknowledged the areas of the state that he didn't know," Mr. Carter said. "People are looking for somebody who is honest and tells the truth."
Mr. Carter said that the Democratic establishment here supported Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, but that the only support that really counted was that of the voters.
In the last several days Mr. Tsongas has repeatedly been asked about his ability to be elected. Today he cited a recent New York Times/CBS News Poll that said that among the announced Democratic candidates he would do the best in a contest against President Bush.
On arrival at the rain-washed airport in nearby Albany, Mr. Tsongas said that he had visited with Mr. Carter at the Carter Center at Emory University in Atlanta last September.
At that time, Mr. Tsongas said that he had "to go out and prove myself."
Today's visit, he said, constituted "one of the Mecca steps along the way" toward the Presidential nomination.
"You can't run for President without going to Plains," Mr. Tsongas said.
Mr. Tsongas was in the state for the annual Jefferson-Jackson dinner that Democrats here use as an annual fund-raising event.
 
Tsongas Criticized
 Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Clinton were the only Democratic Presidential candidates to appear at the dinner. Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska sent a videotape that was played to the audience of 3,000 people.
Representative Newt Gingrich, the Republican House Whip, and Gov. Zell Miller of Georgia introduced the candidates.
Earlier this week, Governor Miller had criticized Mr. Tsongas's opposition to a tax cut for the middle class and erroneously accused Mr. Tsongas of being opposed to capital punishment. Mr. Miller had said Mr. Tsongas would take the Democratic Party down the "well-worn path to defeat."
At the dinner, Mr. Tsongas said he was not the "enemy"; the Republican Party was. He gave a speech long on jokes about his outsider status with only a bit of his standard economic message.
One state legislator summed up the audience's reaction to both Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Clinton, noting that Mr. Tsongas had come without any friends and impressed everyone and Mr. Clinton came with friends and impressed them all.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 25, 1992, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about a campaign trip to Georgia by former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts misidentified a member of Congress who helped introduce the Democratic Presidential candidates at a Jefferson-Jackson Day dinner in Atlanta. It was Senator Wyche Fowler, Democrat of Georgia, not Representative Newt Gingrich, a Georgia Republican.

HEADLINE: When City Officials Make a Move, Who You Gonna Call?

 BODY:
NO New Yorker is short of opinions, but some New Yorkers' opinions on public policy get asked more often than others'. To journalists, they are the "usual suspects," people whose expertise, verbosity and often wit make them particularly quotable. To City Hall, they are an unelected Greek chorus, critiquing every official move. To readers, they are seldom more than a name and a phrase. Here are brief profiles of some of the many members of that chorus.
 
Raymond D. Horton
President, Citizens
Budget Commission
When Raymond D. Horton talks about New York City's finances, people may not listen, but they can't help hearing. For more than a decade, this son of a Chevrolet dealer from Sibley, Iowa, has been one of the most vocal critics of the nation's largest municipal budget. "Over time, we got to feel like, 'Oh God, he's pushing that idea again,' " said Alair A. Townsend, a former deputy mayor who heard many Horton ideas. But, she added, "He's a smart guy." 
 Besides his post at the commission, a private group financed by business that has second-guessed city spending since the Depression, Mr. Horton holds a tenured professorship in business at Columbia University. "I just find it satisfying to wage war on a non-political basis with the political process," said Mr. Horton, 52, who has a law degree from Harvard and a doctorate in politics from Columbia. He worked for Mayor Abraham D. Beame's Temporary Commission on City Finances in the 1970's, but "the city didn't agree with our research, so they cut off our money," he said. That prompted him to seek more independence.
 
Rosemary Scanlon
Port Authority's
chief economist
"It is not just my viewpoint, but my view," said Rosemary Scanlon, meaning that the vast urban landscape that stretches beneath her office on the World Trade Center's 67th floor is also essentially her statistical fiefdom. Her office studies everything from tourism to home prices to waterfront development and international investment.
Ms. Scanlon, who lives in Brooklyn Heights, is a native of rural Nova Scotia. Her mother taught in a one-room schoolhouse; her father was killed in action with the Royal Canadian Air Force in World War II. She earned her master's in economics from the University of New Brunswick, then spent years following her husband, an actor, to regional theaters. At times "there was really no function in life except to get the wardrobe trunk on the bus," she said, but playing ailing industrial cities made "my interest in economics cross over into urban issues." She taught economics at the College of William and Mary and Old Dominion University, and joined the Port Authority in 1969.
 
Samuel M. Ehrenhalt
Regional commissioner,
Bureau of Labor Statistics
One day when Samuel M. Ehrenhalt was walking near his Brooklyn home, a vague acquaintance drove up alongside him and kept pace for two full blocks, shouting repeatedly: "Sam! Sam! The C.P.I.! How can it be only four-tenths of a percent?" The monthly reports Mr. Ehrenhalt's staff of 135 collects on everything from manufacturing's decline to teen-age joblessness to executive salaries are required reading on Wall Street, at City Hall and apparently even for neighbors interested in the consumer price index. Born in Krakow, Poland, in 1925, Mr. Ehrenhalt lived briefly in Nazi Germany and then emigrated to Brooklyn's Crown Heights at the age of 11. With degrees from Brooklyn College and Columbia, he joined the bureau as an economic analyst in 1955.
A Midwood resident who is married to a nursing teacher and deeply involved in his Orthodox synagogue, he considers himself a devoted New Yorker. But as an analyst, he warns: "Remember that New York is a voluntary place. It will only be a great world city as long as people decide this is where they want to be."
 
David R. Jones
President, Community
Service Society
David R. Jones, president of the 150-year-old private agency that monitors the treatment of the poor, often tells about the time he ran with his son, who had been hurt on an iron railing, to a private hospital's emergency room. Seething as minutes passed and doctors barely moved, he finally flashed a city official's identity card. He got help, but still worried about the others waiting. "It typified the whole problem of people trying to defend themselves in a society where they have no influence," he says.
Mr. Jones, 43, grew up in Bedford-Stuyvesant as the son of an assemblyman and State Supreme Court judge. He was educated at Wesleyan University and Yale Law School, worked as a lawyer for Cravath Swaine & Moore, and became a special adviser to Mayor Edward I. Koch in 1979. When he and the Mayor disagreed over issues like homelessness, he left to run the city's delinquency prevention programs.
Now, he says, "I have a lot more sympathy for some of the difficulties bureaucrats run into, but I recognize they can do better in some ways."
 
Norman Siegel
Director, New York
Civil Liberties Union
Norman Siegel says his days on the streets of Brooklyn -- as a "two sewer" man in punch ball, singing do-wop on the corner, joining the last generation of Dodgers fans in Flatbush -- left several enduring legacies. First, they spawned his life-long hatred of bullies, be they local toughs, undisciplined policemen or public officials abusing their authority. Second, cheering on black baseball stars like Jackie Robinson and Don Newcombe at Ebbets Field fed feelings of racial tolerance. "To me, black and white together means 'winning,' " he said.
Mr. Siegel, 48, was born in the Borough Park section, the son of a printer. He attended New Utrecht High School, where he now helps teach a class in constitutional law. From there he went to Brooklyn College. Only when he reached law school -- at New York University -- did he shift to Manhattan. And apart from time spent on civil rights activities in the South, he has been there ever since, for seven years as legal director of MFY Legal Services, which gives legal aid to the poor in civil suits, and since 1985 at the N.Y.C.L.U.
 
Sally Goodgold
Chairwoman,
City Club of New York
The lawyer glanced impatiently at his watch as he faced the City Planning Commission. His client, the developer of a big new building, wasn't prepared to make a single concession. "I can't do anything you want," the lawyer told the chairman. "So could you just vote it out? I'm in a hurry."
"How can we do that?" the chairman asked. "Sally is sitting and watching."
Sally Goodgold, 59, tells this story when asked why she spends countless hours at municipal meetings, where she is often alone in the gallery. Public bodies behave differently under scrutiny, and if anyone can be counted on to show up at a hearing, it is Mrs. Goodgold.
She became president of the City Club in 1984, after three years leading an Upper West Side community board, and has a segment on the radio station WNYC. A Bucknell University graduate who studied urban planning at the New School for Social Research, she grew up in the Plymouth Hotel on West 49th Street, where her father was treasurer of the hotel chain and her mother worked at the United Nations Association.
 
Thomas A. Reppetto
President, Citizens
Crime Commission
Thomas A. Reppetto has a simple motto: "I try to avoid bordellos and jails." But it takes his knowledge of the obscure history of the various New York crime commissions to decipher it. (The Rev. Dr. Charles H. Parkhurst, who delivered a famous 1892 sermon against police corruption, was accused of enjoying investigating bordellos, and William Keating, head of a 1950's crime commission, went to prison rather than divulge his underworld sources.)
The son of a tavern owner on Chicago's South Side, Mr. Reppetto became a patrolman there in 1952 right out of high school, and 18 years later was detective commander in charge of all burglary investigations. Along the way, he earned two B.A.'s and a master's from Roosevelt University and the Illinois Institute of Technology, and a doctorate from Harvard. He came to New York to teach criminal justice administration at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, and in 1979 was asked to help form the commission and find someone to head it. But none of the high-powered candidates he interviewed wanted the job, he said. So he took it.
 
Henry J. Stern
President,
Citizens Union
"When you're not rich or beautiful and when you're Jewish and of medium height you sometimes have to do things to get noticed," Henry J. Stern once said. Restrained only by his own imagination and drawing on his vast reservoir of municipal arcana, he has gotten notice while advancing good government causes. Born 56 years ago in Manhattan, the son of a tent manufacturer and a bookkeeper, he graduated from Bronx High School of Science, City College and Harvard Law School. Torn between journalism and government, he chose the latter after clerking for a State Supreme Court Justice and serving as secretary of the Borough of Manhattan. He was a deputy consumer affairs commissioner, then served nine years on the City Council, which he said amounted to less than a rubber stamp, "because at least a rubber stamp leaves an impression." In seven years as Parks Commissioner, he demonstrated a sometimes exasperating quirkiness that once prompted Mayor Edward I. Koch to exclaim: "There aren't any other cities that have a parks commissioner who can talk to trees."

Robert M. Hayes
Chairman, Coalition
for the Homeless
For much of the last decade, Robert M. Hayes has been taking reporters out to meet the homeless, in the streets, soup kitchens and city shelters. "It's one thing to give a reporter a quote," said Mr. Hayes, who filed the landmark lawsuit in 1979 that established a right to government shelter for homeless men. "It's something else to force the journalist to see, hear and smell homelessness up close."
Mr. Hayes prepared the suit as a young lawyer at a prestigious firm, Sullivan & Cromwell, and he left it in 1982, helping found the Coalition and running it as it grew into a $5 million-a-year enterprise that does everything from lobbying to running soup kitchens.
Mr. Hayes, the youngest of three children, grew up in Valley Stream, L.I. His father, a small businessman, died when Mr. Hayes was 12. His mother is a retired New York City teacher. Soft-spoken and often self-effacing, Mr. Hayes gave himself the title of counsel at the coalition, an indication, he now admits, of his ambivalence about running a large organization. He returned to private law practice two years ago.
 
Gene Russianoff
Staff attorney,
Straphangers' Campaign
For someone who spends as much time as he does criticizing the subway system, Gene Russianoff is oddly fond of riding it, which he calls "the part of the day I most look forward to. It's air conditioned. I can read a book. And nobody can call me to tell me to do something I don't want to do."
Even as a teenager growing up in Brooklyn's Sheepshead Bay, he was fond of the D train, he said, because it meant "you didn't need your parents' car keys to get out of the house." As senior attorney for the New York Public Interest Research Group begun by Ralph Nader, he takes stands on many issues, but Straphangers is best known for its report cards on subway cleanliness and timeliness. Mr. Russianoff, 38, the son of a maintenance man and a city accountant, majored in history at Brooklyn College, went to law school at Harvard and joined NYPIRG in 1978. He is particularly proud of getting a state Public Transportation Safety Board established and an independent inspector general for the M.T.A. appointed. "The system is drastically better today than it was 10 years ago," he says.
 
George Sternlieb
Rutgers professor emeritus
of urban planning
George Sternlieb, now a professor emeritus of urban and regional planning at Rutgers University, first gained attention in academia for his treatises on tenement landlords, rent control, the ecology of welfare and gambling in Atlantic City. He became well known to journalists and mayors by synthesizing complex thoughts into zinging one-liners. Once, making the point that Edward I. Koch had inherited a badly neglected infrastructure, he launched into a turn-of-the-century music hall song about a fallen woman: "She is more to be pitied than censured."
At one time, he said, he was getting eight to ten calls a day from journalists. "Most academics really would like to be philosopher kings," he said. "I always told people, 'Do the numbers right and eventually they'll come to you for advice.' " Born 63 years ago in Manhattan and raised in Flatbush, he graduated from Brooklyn College and earned a master's in business from Harvard. He spent five years at Bloomingdale's -- "finishing school" -- then returned to Harvard. His doctoral dissertation: downtown department stores.

BYLINE: By William H. Pritchard; William H. Pritchard is the Henry Clay Folger Professor of English at Amherst College and the author, most recently, of "Randall Jarrell: A Literary Life."

 BODY:

OUTERBRIDGE REACH
By Robert Stone.
409 pp. New York:
Ticknor & Fields. $21.95. 
 ROBERT STONE'S fiction has always been preoccupied with the unlovely underside of American life. Eighteen years ago, soon after the conclusion of the Vietnam War, he published his second novel, "Dog Soldiers," a book that made connections between folly and violence in Southeast Asia and countercultural disorders back home in the Age of Aquarius. "Dog Soldiers" won the National Book Award, and with good reason. It spoke to American disenchantment, it was a compellingly executed tale of action, and the witty brilliance of its prose created a dark comedy of disaster -- of attempted heroic gestures that were also, as its unheroic hero, John Converse, observed, "peculiar and stupid."
Nothing in the novels that followed it -- "A Flag for Sunrise" (1981) and "Children of Light" (1986) -- suggested that Mr. Stone had embraced a more "balanced" view of the world; indeed, when talking about his vision of things, balance seemed hardly the word to use. But his latest novel, "Outerbridge Reach" -- which, like "Dog Soldiers," centers on a triangle of husband, wife and friend who is also betrayer, and which frequently alludes to Vietnam as a gathering focus of troubled memories -- also brings a new possibility into the novelist's work: that not to believe in anything, to see through everything, may be a peculiarly stupid way to cheat oneself of life.
In "Outerbridge Reach" the Converse figure, much cleaned up, is a handsome fortyish husband and father named Owen Browne. A 1968 graduate of the Naval Academy who served in Vietnam, Browne uses no drugs and drinks very sparingly, reads, keeps himself fit and tries to be a good man around the house. Soon after we meet him, he thinks about the morning he left Penn Station bound for Annapolis and wonders how the Owen Browne of those days might have imagined himself 20 years later: "The image would have been a romantic one, but romantic in the postwar modernist style. Its heroic quality would have been salted in stoicism and ennobled by alienation. As an uncritical reader of Hemingway, he would have imagined his future self suitably disillusioned and world-weary." The trouble is that Browne has become an unsatisfactory parody of that disillusioned figure, since his work consists of writing advertising copy for Altan Marine, a yacht brokerage firm in Connecticut. (One thinks of lines from Robert Lowell's poem about his father, "Commander Lowell": " 'Anchors aweigh,' Daddy boomed in his bathtub. . . . When Lever Brothers offered to pay / him double what the Navy paid.")
The Hylan Corporation, the parent company of Browne's firm, has planned to advertise its boats by having its head man, Matty Hylan, sail one of them around the world by himself in a highly publicized race. When Hylan, a buccaneering entrepreneur, disappears amid evidence of financial disarray, Browne decides that he will enter the race in Hylan's place, even though his solo sailing experience is limited. His wife, Anne (who works for a sailing magazine, is handsome and tends to drink too much), perceives that her husband has been mourning an unrealized dream and sees the race as an opportunity to move their marriage onto a new track -- so she resists her fears that the venture is really a desperate one. For all their self-doubts, both she and Browne are idealists, unwilling to believe that the advice Browne later enters into his log of the race -- "Be true to the dreams of your youth" -- is really a fool's counsel.
INTO their orbit comes a documentary film maker named Ron Strickland, hired by the Hylan Corporation to make a movie about its entry in the race. Strickland prides himself on his lack of illusions, his way of penetrating to the false heart of every plausible or pretentious human affirmation; his business is to expose ideals as trumpery, to exploit "the difference between what people say they're doing and what's really going on." In what he sees as the All-American marriage of the Brownes, Strickland finds a rich subject for exposure; and since "almost all the attractive women Strickland knew had been to bed with him," Anne Browne is of special interest.
The novel divides almost exactly in half, with its first part patiently interweaving the narratives of Browne, Anne and Strickland, placing these principals in relation to a number of strongly presented subsidiary characters -- particularly Strickland's sometime companion, Pamela, a prostitute ("ho" as she calls herself) and drug user who starred in one of his earlier documentaries: "Her eyes were a caution, warning away the faint of loin, the troubled and the poor." In Part Two, the race begins and we move back and forth between the tumultuous course of Browne's voyage and the equally vivid and self-destructive course of Anne's affair with Strickland.
The novel's movement is leisurely, but the narrative has shapeliness and great cumulative power. The source of that power -- and pleasure -- is, of course, Mr. Stone's language as it creates a style. On every page something verbally interesting happens: the insolent voice of a Hylan executive "suggested gulls over India Wharf"; Strickland's 1963 Porsche has rusty fittings, "but the engine reported like a Prussian soldier on the first turn of the key." Captain Riggs-Bowen, club secretary of the Southchester Yacht Club (where a publicity party for the race is held) "had a brick-red blood-pressure mask around his eyes, which resembled those of a raptor." Anne's father, who disapproves of Browne, calls the sea a desert ("Nothing out there but social cripples and the odd Filipino"), while his 60-year-old secretary, Antoinette Lamattina, looks "as though she thrived on chaste bereavement, frequent communion and the occasional excursion to Roseland Ballroom." As with Mr. Stone's earlier books, there's an edge to the gritty idiom of description and dialogue that makes us think of Hemingway, certainly, but also of Raymond Chandler. In fact, "Outerbridge Reach" is like a thriller in that we're made to care intensely about what happens next and who's going to get hurt.
Mr. Stone's novels are always heavily allusive, to previous books and styles as well as to places and their names. This one about the sea contains, among many others, references to "Moby-Dick" and "Billy Budd" (Browne is the Handsome Sailor, thinks Strickland ironically); moments from "Richard III" ("What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears! What ugly sights of death," thinks Browne), as well as "Henry V" and "Romeo and Juliet"; lines from Marlowe's "Doctor Faustus," Henley's "Invictus," Hart Crane's poem "The Bridge" and even John Gillespie Magee's "High Flight" ("I have slipped the surly bonds of earth / And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings").
The allusion needn't be explicit and isn't inevitably ironic or parodic. When Browne, on the voyage, recovers from what at first looked like a case of tetanus, he cooks himself a cheese omelet with fried ham that tastes "marvelous," "as things did at sea" -- and as those canned pork and beans and canned apricots tasted to Nick Adams on the fishing trip in "Big Two-Hearted River." As for the spirit of places, the novel is full of New York City (Mr. Stone grew up there, but New York has been largely absent from his books), from Penn Station to Staten Island to the Brooklyn Bridge, as well as more exotic neighboring spots like Atlantic City, Bayonne, Port Newark, the Arthur Kill and the Outerbridge Reach of the title.
AT a key moment early in the book, Browne, on an impulse, takes out the Parsifal II, a boat from the Altan repair yard on Staten Island, and comes upon a salvage yard where the hulks of old tugs and ferries rot in ominous peace. (The moment recalls an eerily memorable one in "The Best Years of Our Lives" when Dana Andrews walks among disused aircraft.) The yard belongs to Anne's father and is an unlikely scene for a quest:
"On Browne's left, the hulks lay scattered in a geometry of shadows. The busy sheer and curve of their shapes and the perfect stillness of the water made them appear held fast in some phantom disaster. Across the Kill, bulbous storage tanks, generators and floodlit power lines stretched to the end of darkness. The place was marked on the charts as Outerbridge Reach."
My reading of the novel says that the phantom disaster in which Browne later involves himself also involves a discovery -- which his wife and Strickland also make -- that Outerbridge Reach reaches further and deeper than anyone could have thought. So when, deep in the Southern Hemisphere, he sees an iceberg, it appears to him as a steam tug, "like the ones his father-in-law owned at Outerbridge Reach." And as, in relentless succession, he confronts high winds, freezing rain and the second-rate qualities of his unworthily built boat -- "plastic unmaking itself" -- Browne understands at last that he is "about to experience the true dimensions of the situation in which he had placed himself."
At any rate, it's impossible to read the final, dazzling hundred pages of the novel without feeling that something terrible has happened for which nobody is to blame. Alone at sea, Browne muses that "it was necessary to experience life correctly but at the same time compose it into something acceptable." (Melville may have had a similar notion when he attached the motto "Keep True to the Dreams of Thy Youth" to his writing desk.) Robert Stone's blend of heroic aspiration and mordantly deflationary irony results in something like tragicomedy -- maybe even something like Shakespeare, our best tragic comedian. But whatever you call it, "Outerbridge Reach" seems to me a triumph -- a beautifully and painstakingly composed piece of literary art.
 
 
 
MISERY COMES ABOARD
 In midafternoon, he sighted an island off his starboard bow that was black but inlaid with a deep delicious green, a festive sight in the glare. A hill rose from it to a height he reckoned at four hundred meters. Referring to the Admiralty sailing guide, he decided it was the Cape Verdean island of Boa Vista. Later, a little boat painted in violent African colors went across his bow at a distance of a mile or so. Through binoculars he could make out a shirtless brown man with a red bandana across his head standing behind the wheelhouse. The boat seemed top-heavy and tossed alarmingly in the mild sea. The name Sao Martin da Porres was stenciled across its stern.
At four o'clock, the marine operator broadcast a roll call of the entries. The stars of the race, the big boats, were already closing on Cape Agulhas. Browne's competition was spread westward over several hundred miles. Of the lot, only Preston Fowler was ahead of him, clearing the equatorial doldrums at about latitude 11 south. When the broadcast ended, a weather fax arrived announcing a tropical depression off the horn of Brazil.
Boa Vista passed out of sight before sunset. The moment the sun was down, equatorial darkness closed around him, black on black under the cold stars. Worried about the current and his proximity to land, he stayed late on deck. His mind's eye refused to give up the image of the black and green island. Finally he played the game of refusing the image, trying to force it from his imagination. Eventually he nodded off to sleep. Awakening with an odd but familiar sensation, he discovered himself in tears. The same thing had been happening all the way across the Atlantic. It was strange because his easting had been a particularly invigorating run, spinnaker set and westerlies across the port quarter at 17 knots. Brilliant autumn weather. But night after night he would go to sleep in perfectly good spirits and wake to feel some old misery slinking away with an unremembered dream. -- From "Outerbridge Reach."

HEADLINE: The Mood As G.M. Plant Starts Up Again

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: NORTH TARRYTOWN

 BODY:
RETURNING to his job last week at the General Motors plant on Beekman Avenue here, Pat Martelli was in an optimistic mood. The 2.5-million-square-foot assembly plant where he has worked for more than 13 years had just reopened after a two-week shutdown, the second since the middle of December.
Although another furlough is scheduled for early March, Mr. Martelli said he believed the worst of the recession and hard times for the automaker were over and that he and his fellow workers need not fear for their jobs. 
 "I think we've hit bottom," the body shop worker said. "Sure, people are still worried, but personally, I don't think we're going to have a major layoff. We've got a good product, and everything is going to be all right."
In December, G.M. officials in Detroit announced that as part of a broad restructuring, the largest automaker in the United States would close selected assembly plants and component operations nationwide, trim its salaried work force and, primarily through attrition and retirements, reduce the number of hourly employees.
The plant here, a one-of-a-kind factory that assembles all-purpose vans and the only G.M. assembly plant in the Northeast, was not among those scheduled to be closed. But temporary shutdowns, which are "a matter of volume adjustment to balance production and sales," said Nettie Seabrooks, G.M.'s director for government and civic affairs in Warren, Mich., would affect some 3,100 hourly workers at the plant. The Chevrolet Lumina, the Oldsmobile Silhouette and the Pontiac Trans Port are assembled in North Tarrytown.
"People have been nervous," said Donald C. Martino, president of Local 664 of the United Auto Workers. "We're not closing, but we're afraid we'll lose a shift like we did in 1982. The down time is upsetting. It generates uncertainty."
 
Unpleasant Memories Rekindled
 The plant operated on a single production shift from 1982 to 1985, the union leader said. Before that, in 1974, it went to one shift from two for a two-year period.
For Philip Gustaferro, a G.M. hourly employee who works on the soft trim of automobile interiors, rumors of one production shift rekindle unpleasant memories. "If we go to one shift, it will definitely mean layoffs," he said. "I'm worried because I was laid off for two years in 1983 when that happened."
In Detroit, Dee E. Allen, director of media relations for G.M., would not say whether the North Tarrytown factory would go to a single shift. But the volume adjustments "are a way of life in a plant," he said. "They are relative to what's going on in the market."
During temporary shutdowns, workers receive up to 95 percent of their salaries for a 40-hour week from a combination of unemployment insurance and payments from a G.M. and U.A.W. supplemental unemployment benefits fund.
"It's not the money," Mr. Martino said. "That doesn't bother the workers. Their unemployment and supplemental payments are all set up, and they like getting time off. But it's questions about the future that bother us. If not now, will G.M. eventually close this plant?"
In another development late last week, it was announced that G.M. would ask workers to take a mandatory two-week vacation in July. But Mr. Martino said: "That's not going to happen. Vacations are not paid, and volume-related adjustments are. G.M. can't force us to take a vacation."
While the workers worried about their jobs, shopkeepers in the neighborhood said they were also concerned.
 
Impact on Retail Businesses
 The General Motors plant, at the west end of Beekman Avenue on the Hudson River, has a direct impact on retail establishments in the neighborhood, said William T. Regan, Village Administrator for North Tarrytown.
"There are a number of small businesses -- food stores and taverns, in particular -- that are affected when there are furloughs," he said.
Howard Shelton, manager of the Tarry Inn, said G.M. workers account for about 15 percent of the tavern's business. "The street in general is a lot busier when they're working," he said. "And when they are working steady and overtime, there's more money to spend. Over the last couple of years, there has been a lot of down time. It really affects us."
At Greene County Importing Corporation, an Italian delicatessen and pasta factory, the manager, Addie Rezza, said: "There's definitely a difference when the plant is down. We don't get the draw. A third of our lunch trade is from General Motors."
 
Memories of a Ghost Town
 Mrs. Rezza said that she and her husband have diversified their operations by manufacturing pasta so that the business is not solely dependent on the fortunes of the assembly plant. "We will stay in business no matter what happens at G.M.," she said.
But Nina Suchy, owner of Beekman Express Deli, is trying to sell her business. "It doesn't sound good," she said. "I see a few hundred customers a week from the plant. They're talking about buyouts and early retirements, and some of the guys that will be affected haven't even reached 50."
In previous years, when G.M. went to a single shift, the neighborhood became a ghost town, Mr. Martino said. "Small shops, luncheonettes closed. People do a lot of business here."
 
Payments in Lieu of Taxes
 For the village of 8,100 residents, the factory generates $1.1 million a year in payments in lieu of taxes, or close to 20 percent of the municipality's $5.56 million budget. Even if the plant closed, the automaker -- which has tax-exempt status -- must still pay the village through 1994, Mr. Regan said. But the agreement is to be renegotiated in 1995.
The Union Free School District of the Tarrytowns, which had a $22,669,062 budget for 1991-92, received $1.9 million from G.M. for that period. The funds are administered by the Industrial Development Agency of Mount Pleasant.
In Mr. Martino's opinion, G.M.'s current problems and the pressures that hourly workers are experiencing are directly related to the policies of the Reagan and Bush Administrations. "We blame them for allowing the Japanese to bring in so many cars," Mr. Martino said. "We need more protectionism."
"Our problems are also that G.M. doesn't advertise enough, and they cut staff to the bone," Mr. Martino added. "If they hired more workers, it would be more relaxed around here, and we could build a better car.
"We've adopted some of the Japanese concepts, like the team concept and rotating jobs. But in general I can't stand the Japanese concepts and all that rah-rah stuff."
The union leader added: "Whatever they say about American workers is not true. We have the best work force right here, and we build just as good or better than the Japanese. People will just use any excuse to buy foreign."

HEADLINE: Cut Off From the New Reality

BYLINE: By David Gelernter; David Gelernter, associate professor of computer science at Yale, is author of "Mirror Worlds."

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Conn.

 BODY:
When The New York Times uses the term "operating system," it usually feels obliged to define it. Other newspapers do the same. They're not patronizing the readership. They're just facing facts. But suppose they felt the same way about "election" or "touchdown"?
"Operating system" is that kind of term. An operating system is a fundamental item in the world of software. If you don't know what one is, you're not going to learn on the basis of a single phrase, no matter how artfully crafted. And how likely are you to grasp the point of the news story when you literally don't know the first thing about the topic? 
 Whenever this newspaper defines operating system for you, it's assuming that you don't give a damn about technology. The topic finds most people bored and disengaged. They are diners at a high-tech feast, wolfing down the latest goodies without wasting a thought on the mere science going on in the kitchen. This rift between the patrons and the help is growing worse and getting dangerous.
For one, we're not getting the people we need. In 1991, a Department of Commerce report concluded that the U.S. "is in danger of being surpassed by the Japanese in 11 major 'emerging' areas of technology." Meanwhile, the number of computer science majors at American universities continued to drop, down by almost 25 percent since 1986. In 1990, the proportion of U.S. computer science doctorates awarded to non-U.S. citizens was 45 percent, up from 36 percent a decade earlier. Students at Yale are five times more likely to pursue law, business or finance than graduate school in science or technology.
In the technology community, we need people. Even more, we need engagement. Your reactions to our new ideas, your own new ideas in turn. It used to work like that. Technology would play a theme; urban planners, industrial designers, architects, painters, writers and random visionaries would respond. The 1939 New York World's Fair perfectly captured that vanished music. Today, silence. Plans for the U.S. pavilion at the 1992 World's Fair in Seville call for a limp bunch of geodesic domes.
Telecommunications and multimedia are stymied: great technology, but what to do with it? The newspaper industry withers slowly, refusing to face the electronic future creatively. A few sponsor database services; almost none shows interest in electronic editions. In the humanities, computers are ubiquitous, doing tired, primitive chores: creating and printing documents, once in a blue moon handling electronic mail. In commercial settings, desktop computers are routinely idle 98 percent of the time. No engagement.
In a recent issue of The New Republic, Martin Peretz wrote feelingly about our "drastic shortage of young scientists." But he's part of the problem, part of the intellectual establishment that regards science and technology as unfit topics for a real intellectual's attention. The last 28 issues of The New Republic published, on average, one-quarter of an article each on technology or science. The competition is a lot worse.
The feelings are mutual. Scientists and technologists are getting comfortable behind their wall, too. They do not solicit meddling by outsiders, whom they have always considered -- they weren't going to tell you this, but since you insist -- just the tiniest bit dim. Explaining research clearly to the nontechnical community is widely placed, in the pantheon of scientific duties, right up there in urgency and appeal with emptying the pencil sharpeners.
A leading electronics engineering magazine, IEEE Spectrum, publishes wistful musings about the fading of the "heroic image of the scientist"; young people in the field don't even realize that the public once found technology downright inspiring. In the 1950's, popular culture was a fantasy on technology themes: jet planes and atomic power, miracle fibers and electronic brains, the rockets and robots of the future. Remember?
The need for engagement will grow steadily more acute. Today's technology crisis is a slow boil. Tomorrow's will be an explosion. However large it looms today, technology is guaranteed to grow radically more important. We will stop looking at computers and start gazing through them. They will be our windows on the world, purveyors of repackaged reality. The images we know and deal with -- of our businesses, hospitals, governments, communities -- will be computer-generated.
But this "mirror reality" of the future is a score for many voices. The lay public has charge of the crucial parts dealing with political, esthetic and ethical issues. The technical stuff merely fills in the harmonics. This performance will transform the social world -- whether or not we bother to do it right. Repackaging reality is a big responsibility. Are you content to wash your hands of it? To leave it all to the computer sciencearchy?
Recently, technology issues have been shooting off like fireworks. You will find them at the heart of public policy disputes, major industry realignments, entire regional economies, progress in science and the threats and promises of a software-powered future. Meanwhile, of Stanford, Berkeley, Princeton, Harvard and Yale, exactly one requires a technology course of every student. Top U.S. universities were far more interested in debating "multiculturalism" -- a masterful response to modern times. It has all the cogency of smashing Japanese cars with pickaxes.

HEADLINE: Friends Don't Let Friends Write Bad Poetry

BYLINE: By Elizabeth Frank; Elizabeth Frank is the Joseph E. Harry Professor of Modern Languages and Literatures at Bard College. She won the Pulitzer Prize in 1986 for her biography "Louise Bogan: A Portrait."

 BODY:

POETS, POETICS, AND POLITICS
America's Literary Community Viewed From the Letters of Rolfe Humphries, 1910-1969.
Edited by Richard Gillman and Michael Paul Novak.
Illustrated. 295 pp. Lawrence:
University Press of Kansas. $35. 
 THE poet and translator Rolfe Humphries (1894-1969) was an American original who deserves to be better known. He was a vital presence in the life of American poetry from the early 1920's until his death, and an active player in the literary and political battles of the 30's. Writing letters was a natural part of his daily life, and fortunately for us, in "Poets, Poetics, and Politics," a selection has been made and edited by Richard Gillman and Michael Paul Novak, with an elegant biographical essay by Ruth Limmer.
Late in life, Humphries wrote to a former student, "Don't over-feel that poetry is a solitary business. . . . I think poetry is also a social business, I don't mean sociological, though that too at times, but social in the sense that even a lyric poet will get the job done better if he cares about people, can learn to say You once in a while, not always 'I,' and can write out of love."
His working life as a poet began with his participation in Genevieve Taggard's San Francisco poetry workshop just after World War I and continued in New York, where he moved in 1923 (soon counting among his friends Louise Bogan, Edmund Wilson, Malcolm Cowley and other writers just beginning to publish poetry and reviews in little magazines and journals). Throughout it he recognized, respected and drew out the talents and personalities of others, not requiring a reservoir of envy or flattery to deal with their often substantial achievements.
Ms. Limmer quotes Louise Bogan's memorial portrait of Humphries: "Rolfe presented, in those days, a seemingly uncomplicated attitude toward life and art. He was continually belying what was patently a gentle and cultivated nature by flights of rather tough and fanciful humor. He was interested in baseball, in the race-track, in vaudeville and musical revues; and he used these locales in his work, long before pop art existed. He could speak the American vernacular with skill, in a period when American poets were not giving 'slang' much attention. He seemed somewhat older than the rest of us."
Humphries was attracted to strong women, seeing in them perhaps traces of his schoolteacher mother, a determined, high-minded woman who worked all her life and who had, Ms. Limmer tells us, "once grasped Emerson's arm to save him from stumbling." While still living in California (where his family had moved from Pennsylvania in 1912), he fell in love with Helen Spencer, a spunky young medical student, whom he married in 1925 and who went on to have a long and successful career as an obstetrician and gynecologist. "Helen usually gets my supper and we have an hour or two together doing dishes," he wrote to a friend shortly after the marriage. "Then she crosses the park to the hospital and sleeps in expectation of a call, or else delivers babies all through the long watches of the night. This to the great distress of Bob Wolf [husband of Genevieve Taggard] who thinks no marriage is complete unless every night is a bridal night. This is that same Wolf who thought Helen would give up medicine and be a domestic millstone about my neck."
With Louise Bogan he had a lifelong friendship marked by mutual artistic respect, shared humor and bitter political quarrels. From the beginning he thought her a great poet, but he was wary of her demanding and troubled nature: "It is not hard to fight with Louise," he wrote to his friend E. Merrill Root, a poet and English professor, in 1925, "for all she is a great woman, the greatest I have ever known, she is sometimes as cuckoo as a loon. So am I; and in the right conjunction of the stars, there are explosions. Oh hell."
The main reason for these "explosions," which occurred also with other people, was his honesty. Root appears to have broken off their friendship for close to seven years after Humphries sent him a no-punches-pulled critique of his poetry. Occasionally unsure of himself, he sometimes deferred to the taste and judgment of those he respected, Bogan's and Wilson's in particular. More often than not, however, Humphries held fast to his own point of view. He once wrote Wilson, for whom he was preparing, late in 1929, a review of Robinson Jeffers's "Dear Judas" in The New Republic: "On the places where I have not yielded [to Wilson's suggestions], I do not admire your points at all, and must insist on being clumsy or whatever it is in my own sense or lack of it, rather than adopting yours."
Every poet should have a friend like Humphries with whom to exchange drafts. He and Bogan had a tough, frank and entirely workmanlike approach to each other's productions. They offered changes in sound, diction and the sequence of lines, queried the accuracy of details (keeping each other's perceptions keen and true) and actually took each other's suggestions to heart. Humphries, for example, questioned Bogan's grammar in the draft she had sent him of her "Baroque Comment": "The only place where I do not feel sure you have made the effect you want is at the two end lines -- 'palm and laurel chosen as noble and enduring' . . . 'death held as sacrifice.' The repetition of as, chosen as, held as + predicate modifier I am not sure of -- are you writing a kind of prose line for ironic effect? If so maybe . . . you want something like considered?" Bogan changed the line to "death considered sacrifice."
Early in 1934 Humphries met Theodore Roethke, then a young instructor at Lafayette College in Easton, Pa. "You are a poet -- a rather delicate and sensitive one: pour your contempt on this lousy world," he urged in response to Roethke's initial letter. For years afterward he gave Roethke detailed, unsparing help with poems, reminding him always that poetry is written for the ear as well as the eye. Unlike Edmund Wilson, whose need to correct others had a certain undermining and competitive brusqueness to it, Humphries wasn't entirely comfortable with his role as mentor. "Is this all too tricky or am I being a dull and witless oaf deluded by his own conceit and failing to see at all what you are driving at?" he wrote to Roethke, after a particularly severe schoolmasterish workout. "I always mistrust myself when I start thinking I am Father Superior among the novitiates."
HIS letters open a window of special clarity onto the troubled political landscape of the 30's. Humphries, who had since adolescence been attracted to the left, felt strongly about the plight of the working class and the threat of fascism, and joined both the League of American Writers, essentially a Communist front organization devoted to antifascist activities, and the Communist Party itself, and he was very active in both. Sophisticated about political commitment and its risks for an artist, he nevertheless wrote out and out political poetry and worked tirelessly for any number of causes, including the plight of Spanish intellectuals interned in concentration camps near the French border during the Spanish Civil War.
He and Bogan, who had nothing but contempt and derision for his politics, fought savagely during this time. She ridiculed his belief in Marxist doctrine as well as his Stalinist faith in the Soviet Union; he failed utterly to convert her, much less to persuade her that the left had truly humane intentions or respect for the individual. Stung once too often, he struck back with his knowledge of her emotional instability and marital failure: "If you know that I am not a nincompoop you also know that I know that a lot of your communistic antipathies proceed from springs that have nothing to do with critical and aesthetic logic but from what might be termed a nice disorder of the private economy," he wrote in August 1935, when political antagonism between them was at its fiercest. The friendship survived.
By 1940, disillusioned and disgusted, he left the Communist Party. Although he never disowned his political poetry, he never again embraced a political party or cause. In late 1948, James Laughlin, publisher of New Directions, asked Humphries to write the introduction to Ezra Pound's "Selected Poems." Humphries insisted on mentioning Pound's anti-Semitism in the introduction; Pound insisted that he delete it. In the end Humphries wrote to Pound: "Look -- all I want to say that you will consider unpleasant is simply this: that I don't endorse certain opinions and/or statements of yours that I, perhaps erroneously, consider anti-Semitic." Humphries admired Pound as an artist, but would not "go in for tergiversation and weasely circumlocution." Neither side would relent, and the volume was published without the introduction.
A more subdued and inward Humphries devoted his remaining years to poetry, publishing six volumes of distinctive, often beautiful lyric verse, as well as remarkably high-spirited translations of the "Aeneid," Ovid's "Metamorphoses" and "Art of Love," Juvenal's "Satires," Martial's "Epigrams" and "De Rerum Natura" of Lucretius. He edited anthologies, including, in 1953, the first number of the influential "New Poems by American Poets." After 32 years of teaching Latin at Woodmere Academy on Long Island, he joined the faculty of his alma mater, Amherst College, where he spent eight happy years teaching and writing. He hankered for more recognition, and although he did not allow its far-from-total absence to sour him, one can sense his frustration in the frequent shots he takes at Robert Frost, something of a bete noire to Humphries, who lacked Frost's careerism, malice and megalomania though not his ambition. "Frost has a mean ungracious I-am-the-only-pooh, pooh-Great Man streak in him, which is not pleasant to watch," he wrote to Charles Bell in 1954, and this is only one of many complaints.
His friend E. Merrill Root had by this time become an extreme right-winger (later a dedicated John Bircher), and Humphries's letters to him are a fine example of exasperated affection and candor. Seeing Root's name "in a list of highly obnoxious characters" scheduled to address the Tory Law Club at Yale (where Humphries held a graduate seminar in Latin verse translation on Friday evenings), he wrote, "I think I disapprove of this strenuously but I don't disapprove of you -- though I did want to ask, after I heard you on the air, why your passion for individual liberty doesn't include the right of anybody to make a Horse's Ass of himself in any way he chooses, including being a Communist. You've either got to be for liberty or against it, seems to me."
When his only son died in a car accident in 1965 at the age of 33, Humphries asked friends not to call: "Phone calls of sympathy lead us to our worst behavior of emotional choke-up." A year later he and his wife moved to their son's house in California for their retirement. "We are saddened, of course, but not hopelessly or helplessly so, and still find much to do, and much worth doing."
Humphries relished life with a full-blooded joy in creaturely pleasures and the (both serious and nonserious) use of words. He refused to stand aloof from experience, whether political or personal, that might leave him at a loss. In "Meditation for Sext," one of his finest poems, he wrote:
 
 Fasting, faint, mortal appetite
 Craves less than quintessential certitude,
 Refrains from alien unfamiliar food:
 Give us our daily darkness.
The most moving quality in Humphries's letters, and in his poetry, is his awareness and acceptance of imperfection -- his own, and that of life itself. "I work so hard at being humble, trying to do better in my own work, risking my life, in various ways," he wrote to Root in 1944, "in order to have it grow so that the art can grow with it. Maybe the reason is that I like in art what, physically, anyway, I am not -- I myself am clumsy and sprawl, or, roar and shout." His letters commemorate not a period figure, as the book's title somewhat misleadingly suggests, but a man whose warmth, kindness, robust irreverence, deep love of his art and courage in living give us the impression of a human wholeness so often lacking in his better-known peers.
 
 
 
CLASS AND WHERE TO FIND IT
 The class angle I was taught by my parents was the vulgar vs. the educated, and the technique of identification was by their grammar and whether they liked to read comics. But I learned for myself that the kids whom it was most fun to play with were the kids of janitors, and brakies, and farmers, and not the soft and yellow slobs whose parents owned the water-works and the gas company. And I had the same lesson submitted to me at college, where I belonged to a third-rate fraternity whose members were sons of poor teachers and ministers like myself, though some of them rose to be business men, and in the army again where the people with most wit and salt were the draftees from the trucks and orchards and oilfields of Ventura County and not the college punks from Stanford. And among the private school kids I have taught I have liked a lot of them, and found them amusing, and not all swine by any means, but almost always something rickety about them. From "Poets, Poetics, and Politics."

HEADLINE: The Executive Life;
How to Squeeze Money From the Tightwads

BYLINE: By Michael S. Malone; Michael S. Malone writes frequently about Silicon Valley from Los Altos, Calif.

 BODY:
The high-flying, high-tech superstars of California's Silicon Valley are justly famous for their expensive Christmas parties and perquisites like company gyms and sales meetings in Hawaii. But when it comes to philanthropy this crowd of overnight tycoons is notoriously stingy. "It's only been in the last 18 months of so that some of the valley's biggest companies like Sun Microsystems have even set up corporate giving programs," said Leigh Weimers, a columnist for The San Jose Mercury-News.
But judging from the success of the Silicon Valley Charity Ball, the real problem may not be with the givers, but with the approach of the askers. Now in its sixth year, the ball is expected to raise as much as $700,000 April 25 in San Jose. That will bring total donations to more than $2 million since the ball's creation, making it the biggest one-night annual charity event in northern California, and one of the largest in the West. Past beneficiaries have ranged from the California Parkinson's Foundation to a local repertory theater. 
 One of the key reasons for the ball's success is that its founder and chairman, Gerry Beemiller, is himself a fast-talking valley success who understood, as only an insider could, the competitiveness and need for respect that drives the high-tech set. Mr. Beemiller, who started and sold a chip distribution company, I Squared Inc., and has recently formed a new company that makes computerized cribs called Infant Advantage, also appreciated that, for all its global influence, Silicon Valley is really a small town, where career paths inevitably cross. But perhaps most important, he realized that, in the words of Steve Tedesco, the president of the San Jose Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, "You don't appeal to the companies' charitable contribution accounts; you sell to their advertising budgets."
Indeed, in an innovation this year, Mr. Beemiller created the Big 10 designation for the first 10 companies that contribute $25,000. Individual tickets are $250. Explains Mr. Beemiller: "People want to be thought of as givers. That's why we publicize table buyers and corporate donations."
There is almost a running contest among companies to see who which can buy the most tables -- at a cost of as much as $5,000 each. Though he normally relishes the role of outsider, T. J. Rodgers, the chief executive of Cypress Semiconductor Corporation, a semiconductor maker, has been a decisive winner for the last two balls, with 15 tables each year. "This is not a year to just party, but to really give," Mr. Rodgers said, referring to Silicon Valley's current economic woes.
Just as important to donors as a competitive spirit, however, is that the event be as high-profile and flashy as the products they turn out. Big-name entertainers like Jay Leno and Natalie Cole have taken the stage; this year's fete will have laser arcade games.
Yet compared with the old-money elegance of galas in San Francisco 50 miles away, the ball can sometimes look like a Boomtown fandango. Some attendees, flummoxed by the very notion of a formal ball, dress as if it were the last such event of their lives. Mary Gottschalk, who has covered the ball since its inception for The San Jose Mercury-News, notes that the nouveau riche "sometimes have trouble spending it." While a $200,000 Ferrari is an accepted display of wealth, a $5,000 Bob Mackie gown is not as easily justified. The result is a sometimes disorienting mix of elegance and fashion felony, where a designer gown is hip-to-hip with a plaid tuxedo.
Some, however, have caught the spirit of the event. An annual ball highlight has been the arrival of San Jose municipal Judge Robert Baines and his wife, Bette Lindermann, an artist. Over the years, members of their group have arrived in a white Bentley, an armored car and, most recently, in Lawrence Welk masks that emitted bubbles.
Conscious of the power battles that define Silicon Valley, the ball kicks off with an attenuated cocktail hour. "It gives you a chance to see people you worked with, say at Fairchild, three companies ago," Mr. Beemiller said. "Now you're at Cypress and he's at Chips and Technology, so for the moment you're competitors and this is about the only place you can talk."
Still, some people, like the heads of companies feuding in court over patent infringement as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices are, might prefer to avoid each other.
For the rank-and-file, the ball is a place to be seen. Cypress, for example, reserves its tables for vice presidents and those who report to them. "There's a real stature that goes along with being invited because it shows that you report directly to a vice president," said Mike Starnes, vice president for process development at Cypress.
But the notion of socializing as advertising has not been lost on hungry outlanders either, as they search for ways to penetrate into high-tech's halls of power. Last year, the Normandie region of France, looking for valley investment, gave $50,000 to local charities in exchange for the ball making life in Normandie its annual theme. By the same token, the Big 10, besides including such well-known locals as Apple, Advanced Micro, ESL, Adaptec and Cypress, also lists American Airlines, the HMO Healthnet, Advanced Cardiovascular Systems and non-valleyite NCR.
But like the computer companies, the Silicon Valley Ball has begun to feel competition from clones. Taking some tips from the ball, the San Jose Symphony has made its C.E.O. Night more exclusive and more casual, requiring only business dress. On the other hand, notes Tom Hayes of Applied Materials Inc., a maker of semiconductor-making machinery, who participates in both events, C.E.O. Night's cocktail hour is more brightly lit than the ball's, and that "leads to even more tension and competitiveness."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
San Diego Newspaper Adjusts To Merger

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Feb. 23

 BODY:
After the walls separating the news rooms of the competing San Diego Union and Tribune recently came down, literally, the staffs of the papers stared across the expanse at one another.
"It was as if we were afraid of moving to the other side, like a border guard might shoot us," said Elizabeth Douglass, a Tribune financial writer. 
 The two papers, competitors for more than 60 years under the same ownership, were merged on Feb. 2 into the new Union-Tribune, a morning paper with afternoon editions.
The new paper has more pages of business, sports, entertainment, opinion and comics than either of its predecessors.
It has a circulation of about 390,000, compared with 271,000 for the morning Union last year and 117,000 for the afternoon Tribune.
It also has one editorial voice -- The Union's -- where there once were two.
 
New Paper's Rivals
 And, in a way, the combined paper might be more vulnerable to competition than its two predecessors were.
Competition for Tribune readers began soon after the merger announcement in September. The Los Angeles Times, which publishes a San Diego County edition, is advertising on San Diego radio and television for the first time. Its circulation totals about 74,000 in the county.
"We sampled some Tribune readers in November and decided to rachet up our visibility," said Phyllis Pfeiffer, general manager of The Times's San Diego edition. "But face it, no one has the bucks to flaunt around like they did in the 80's."
Herb Klein, editor in chief of Copley Press Inc., parent of The Union-Tribune, said he welcomed competition. But, he added, "I'm not worried about The L.A. Times succeeding."
 
Potential for Weeklies
 Indeed, the biggest competition may come from local weeklies. The San Diego Community Newspaper Group, for example, has three weekly newspapers in three communities in the city, with a combined circulation of 65,000.
John Gregory, editor in chief of the group, said that The Union-Tribune might be strong for now, but that "within a few months we will probably expand and profit from their problems of covering a city this large with one paper."
Despite their common ownership, The Union and The Tribune differed on their approaches to news and editorial policy. The Tribune was considered more aggressive in its news coverage and was more politically independent than the conservative Union. Indeed, The Tribune won a Pulitzer Prize in 1979 for its coverage of a midair collision and another in 1987 for its editorials on immigration.
The Union-Tribune offers a broader range of political commentary than its predecessors. But in the new combined paper, "the editorial policy of The Union hasn't changed," Mr. Klein said.
 
Management Lineup
 The former editors of the two papers, Gerald L. Warren of The Union and Neil Morgan of The Tribune, had battled each other for more than 10 years over news coverage, subscribers and the favor of their publisher, Helen K. Copley.
Now, Mr. Warren is editor of the combined paper. Meanwhile, Mr. Morgan is the associate editor and writes a daily column on local issues. Karin Winner, managing editor of The Union, is the executive editor, in charge of the day-to-day operations.
Before the merger, The Tribune, like many afternoon newspapers, had watched its circulation fall for years. Indeed, the paper's circulation dropped even further after the merger was announced, slipping below 100,000. "It was clear that the decline would continue," Mr. Klein said.
In addition, advertising in both papers was down, as it is throughout the industry because of the recession. The two papers lost about 8.5 percent of their advertising last year, compared with 1990, with most in the very profitable category of classified ads.
The Union and Tribune had employed a total of about 450 people in their news rooms. But as a result of the merger, the news staff was reduced to about 310, with most people accepting buyouts to leave.
The newspaper said less than 30 jobs were lost in other departments. It now employs slightly more than 1,700 people.
 
Readers' Reaction
 So far, The Union-Tribune has received somewhat mixed reviews from its readers.
For example, Mike McKinney, a lawyer and former Union reader, seemed pleased with the new paper, noting the opinion pages were more balanced. "You can actually find some liberals," he said, adding, "Now, they even have 'Doonesbury.' "
But Bill Hobbs, a mathematics professor at Point Loma College in San Diego and former Tribune reader, was disappointed. "For all the falderal, I can't tell that the paper has changed a bit," he said.

HEADLINE: CHINA IS SOFTENING ITS ECONOMIC LINE

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Feb. 23

 BODY:
In a strong sign of shifting political winds in China, the official press is abruptly attacking the hard-line attitudes it espoused for the last two years and has instead started to call on the nation to emphasize economic growth and even adopt useful elements of capitalism.
The pirouette was reflected in a front-page essay today in People's Daily, which in the past carried mostly dour warnings against Western subversion. Today's article, headlined "Opening up to the world and using capitalism," was the boldest in a monthlong flurry of signals that change-minded leaders may be gaining the upper hand over ideologues. 
 "All of modern Chinese history has demonstrated that China can travel only the socialist road, not the capitalist road," the article began. "At the same time, recent world history shows us that economically backward nations -- especially those with long histories of feudalism -- must correctly use capitalism, rather than rejecting it out of hand. Only by critically absorbing those elements of Western culture that are useful to us, rather than disdaining them, can we prosper and flourish."
The wave of recent editorials apparently reflects a push by Deng Xiaoping, the 87-year-old paramount leader, for China to devote more energy to becoming prosperous and less to remaining ideologically pure. The Politburo is believed to have confirmed this moderate line, and the new articles indicate that the hard-liners are losing control even over the newspapers that they have dominated for more than two years.
Still, political fashions in China often change quickly, and it is unclear whether the recent articles reflect a major and irreversible trend to speed up economic liberalization. Even if economic growth is back at the top of the agenda, there is no hint that the regime will release political prisoners or tolerate challenges from Tibetan separatists or underground Catholic priests or disgruntled university students.
Calls for ideological vigilance and tributes to model Communists generally filled the front pages in the two and a half years after the June 1989 crackdown on the Tiananmen democracy movement. The crackdown, in which the army killed hundreds of protesters and wounded thousands, was accompanied by the rise of hard-line leaders who installed their lieutenants as editors of the major newspapers.
The People's Daily article appears days before the United States Senate's vote, scheduled for Tuesday, on renewing most-favored-nation trade status for China. The Administration is urging the Senate to renew the favorable tariff treatment, continuing President Bush's policy of trying to change China's behavor on human rights, arms sales to the third world and other issues by contact rather than by confrontation and punishment.
 
No Shift on Rights Seen
 While there is no evidence of any major change by China on human rights, on economic topics there is no doubt that a switch has taken place. The People's Daily article published today called for tolerating a measure of capitalism in the Chinese economy, and gave a ringing endorsement of stock markets and other practices associated with the West.
On Saturday, People's Daily carried a front-page editorial calling on the nation to focus more attention on economic development -- and, by implication, give less attention to the Marxist ideology that the same newspaper has emphasized since the rise of the hard-liners in June 1989.
Also on Saturday, the official Guangming Daily filled most of the top two-thirds of the front page with a call to "liberate our thinking, deepen reform, open the door more widely." It was a dizzying change in emphasis for a newspaper that just last month carried a front-page appeal for universities to select students more on the basis of loyalty to Communism.
Mr. Deng began the new drive for reform with a trip last month to the southern Chinese special economic zone of Shenzhen. He called for more rapid change and went out of his way to praise Shenzhen, a symbol of economic experimentation that has shown spectacular increases in prosperity but also in prostitution and drug abuse. The tide shifted apparently in part because Mr. Deng and other leaders determined that the best way for China to avoid the fate of the Soviet Union is to make people richer, and in part because other octogenarians who take a harder line are too feeble to fight back.
Today's article in People's Daily carried the byline Fang Sheng, which is almost certainly a pen name of an individual or a group of people in the central leadership. The fact that it was published on a Sunday -- when almost no one reads the newspaper, which is delivered to offices and factories rather than homes -- suggests that a Politburo member may have ordered the top editors to publish it but that they did their best to insure that as few readers as possible would notice it.
 
Adapting Capitalism
 "Using capitalism includes developing an appropriate capitalist economy within our country, as a useful supplement to the socialist economy," the article said. "As our country is in only the preliminary stage of socialism, it is impossible to wipe out capitalism completely, and some exploitation will linger for a long while. So the important thing is to improve our guidance of these phenomena, and direct them onto a course where policy allows them."
Many elements of today's long article had appeared previously in one place or another, but they had not been combined with such force or clarity. The tone throughout sounded like a rebuke to the hard-liners. In particular, the article indicated that most Communists now acknowledge the need to use foreign capital and technology.
"On other matters, it seems that there are still some differences," the newspaper said, in a clear reference to hard-liners who are wary of capitalist influences. The article added that instead of fearing contacts with the West, China should expand exchanges "to enrich our culture."
 
Defining Socialism
 "In the past we took the tortuous path of sealing ourselves off from the world and refusing to use capitalism," the essay declared, in a reference to the Maoist era. "Leftist errors and other factors were behind this, but they have nothing to do with socialism. On the contrary, in principle socialism means an open system and a reform-oriented economy."
A People's Daily editor said by telephone that the essay today was not an editorial or a commentary, but simply an "article." He said he did not know the identity of the author.
Wu Guoguang, a former People's Daily editorial writer now studying at Princeton University, said he could recall only one other case in the last 15 years in which the newspaper carried a front-page commentary with a byline that was a pen-name. The other one was arranged by Mr. Deng's family and published last year, and Mr. Wu said an essay like today's would have to have the approval of a top leader.
While recent commentaries have been short of specifics, their tone is important because officials at every level are what the Chinese call feng pai -- weathervanes. In other words, they watch for hints of prevailing political winds before taking any action.

HEADLINE: American Business Starts A Counterattack in Japan

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 23

 BODY:
After spending much of the 1980's struggling to survive against its Japanese competitors, Harley-Davidson Inc. has joined hundreds of American companies in doing something that would have seemed unthinkable a decade ago: it is challenging the Japanese manufacturers that almost put it out of business by revving up its sales on their home territory.
Following an increasingly familiar pattern, the motorcycle maker has acquired the Japanese company that distributed its products, so that Harley can take a stronger hand in expanding its sales network. It has beefed up its staff and it is concluding a deal to market a line of clothing to the Japanese who, despite growing disillusionment with the United States, still have a romantic attraction for the kind of muscular American image the Harley-Davidson name still evokes. 
 "If you want to be competitive in this day and age, you have to be a competitor in Japan," said Jeffrey Bleustein, Harley's executive vice president. "It's the most difficult market in the world, and we have some real challenges there, but you have to do it." Harley's sales here have increased to 3,000 motorcycles a year, Mr. Bleustein said, with the number still rising slowly.
President Bush's ill-starred visit earlier this year, the carping by American auto makers about their modest exports to Japan and the increasingly bellicose rhetoric from politicians on both sides of the Pacific have heightened trade tensions between Japan and the United States markedly in recent months.
But the bitter sniping and complaints about the closed nature of the Japanese market have obscured an important fact: a growing number of American companies have decided that the best way to compete with their Japanese rivals at home is to compete with them in Japan. These companies are becoming more assertive here not because that will correct America's $43 billion trade deficit with Japan -- few believe that will happen anytime soon -- but because it is good business.
 
The Time Is Now
 "If you can compete in Japan you will be competitive anywhere," said James C. Morgan, chairman of Applied Materials Inc., which has successfully established itself here as a leading producer of equipment used to manufacture computer chips. "And this is the time to do it. The opportunities have gotten much better."
The attractions are simple. With roughly 125 million generally affluent citizens, Japan's market consumes large amounts of imports, and the once-frugal Japanese are becoming increasingly acquisitive, wanting many of the things they did without during years of sacrifice.
"The Japanese have become voracious consumers of imported luxury goods, and we've been able to do well partly because we are an imported luxury good," said H. Chris Killingstad, managing director for the East Asian operations of Haagen-Dazs ice cream, whose sales here have been soaring after big investments by the company.
And while the United States is languishing in a recession, the Japanese economy is expected to grow by close to 3 percent this year -- a significant slowdown by Japanese standards.
Some executives add a more strategic reason for the need to increase their Japanese sales. "Japan is not only a big market, but it is also a very important market in that you can't allow the Japanese to nurture their products there without being challenged, as a kind of sanctuary," insisted Arnold Brenner, executive vice president in charge of the Japan business of Motorola, the electronics and telecommunications giant. "That's why it's so important to crack the barriers that exist and make the effort."
Although it can take years to build a significant market presence, most agree that the payday can make it worthwhile -- eventually.
"Generally profit margins are quite good if you can make it through the first seven years or so and work your way into a solid position," said William J. Best, managing director here for A. T. Kearney International Inc., a consulting company. "Once you get to that point, it's almost obscene what some people make."
What the trend underscores is that the long-debated question of whether the Japanese market is open or closed is far more complex than it has often been made out to be, and should not by itself discourage companies.
 
Lopsided Investment Flow
 Unquestionably, foreign businesses here still face some unfair barriers trying to build their operations. Just consider the startling fact that Japanese companies made direct investments abroad in factories, real estate and other business operations between 1985 and 1990 of $239.4 billion, of which $110 billion went to the United States, according to the Bank of Japan. Meanwhile, foreign companies made just $5.3 billion of direct investments in Japan during the same period, only a portion of which were from American companies, according to the bank.
Many American executives say the interlocking shareholdings that make takeovers all but impossible and the extraordinarily high price of land inhibit investments in Japan.
Many of the companies that are now increasing their market shares would not be expanding in Japan at all were it not for the efforts of American trade negotiators in attacking barriers.
For instance, Toys "R" Us, the huge toy retailer, was able to open its first store in Japan in December only after the United States forced the Government to ease restrictive laws.
More and more, though, American companies are not waiting for the playing field to be completely leveled. They are eager to cash in on one of the most vibrant consumer markets in the world. In one sign of the trend, the membership of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan has risen to 2,047 today from 1,345 in 1985.
A variety of products are making headway, too. Sales in Japan of American-made apparel have risen to $400 million last year from $65 million in 1987. American-controlled companies hold a 16 percent share of the retail gasoline market and nearly 17 percent of Japan's gasoline refining capacity.
McDonald's is the country's largest fast-food operator. Salomon Brothers and Morgan Stanley were the second- and the third most profitable securities houses in Japan in the first half of the current fiscal year.
 
Progress Hard to Measure
 American farmers export more products to Japan than to any other market; in fact, American agricultural exports to Japan total more than all agricultural exports to the European countries combined.
The proliferation of American brands here does not indicate as much progress as some argue, however. For instance, some point to the saturation of Japan with 7-Eleven convenience stores as a sign of the Japanese love for things American. In fact, the American parent company of the chain is now owned by Japanese, after the company fell into bankruptcy following an ill-advised leveraged buyout. Talbots clothing stores are popping up in Japan, but that company is also owned by Japanese. And the lucrative McDonald's franchise here is 50 percent owned by Japanese.
In addition, some Americna experts insist that in the long term it is not a wise trade-off if the Japanese are eating American hamburgers, while Americans are buying Japanese autos and electronic gadgets, products that are regarded as closer to the cutting edge of technological advancement. But at least in the medium term, more opportunities are opening up, and they are being seized by a variety of American businesses.
Many companies that have been here for decades lazily allowing Japanese trading companies to sell limited amounts of their goods are revitalizing joint ventures and strengthening their presence. Monsanto and Ralston Purina, for example, have recently ended joint ventures and have taken control of their businesses in Japan. The following are other examples of this trend.:
*Harley-Davidson has been selling its oversized motorcycles in Japan since 1913, but only recently bought out its distributor so that it could get a better feel for what Japanese consumers want and determine better ways to sell its products here -- making Japan its second-largest market outside of North America.
*Eastman Kodak began selling its photo products in Japan nearly a century ago, but recently took control of all its joint ventures here to increase sales and make it tougher for its archrival, Fuji Photo Film. Kodak has also built a new research center and is increasing its staff. Given that the Japanese spend roughly twice as much per capita on film products as Americans, this has proved a rich market, said Robert L. Smith, who heads Kodak's photo products business in Japan.
--Haagen-Dazs ice cream infused its Japan operations with new capital and has spent heavily on new products and on upgrading its shops. Its efforts here have made the Haagen-Dazs label one of the 10 most-respected consumer brands in Japan, according to a trade journal survey.
"It takes an enormous commitment from the chief executive and the whole board of directors because you have to be ready to lose money for several years," said Mr. Brenner of Motorola. "That's obviously a very scary tactic for a lot of companies. But the question is how do you get U.S. companies to do that?"
Mr. Morgan of Applied Materials said he had been angered sometimes listening to the complaints of American executives about Japan's closed markets -- not because they are wrong, but because they often use the criticisms as an excuse not to tackle the market head on.
 
'Really a Question of Will'
 "It is really a question of will," he said. "You have to keep a strong focus on market access. The pressure has to be constant. But you have to believe it's important for your company to be competitive or you won't have the commitment you need to make it in Japan."
Mr. Brenner of Motorola was one of several who said a crisis might actually be useful for motivating American companies to become more committed and show staying power in Japan. "Americans tend to work better with their backs to the wall," he said. "There are a whole lot of Americans waking up to the fact that their country is not healthy. One of the ways I think we're going to get healthy is to be able to compete with the Japanese on their own turf."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: South;
Support for Clinton Appears Firm in Home Base

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Feb. 23

 BODY:
Mildred Bryson, who sells fruit from the back of her truck in the nearby town of Social Circle, is not an expert on politics, but she can sense a politician she likes, and she likes Bill Clinton.
"I don't think his character is a problem," she said. "He seems like a good man to me. He doesn't brag like some of the other candidates." 
 In other words, Mr. Clinton as soft-spoken, Dixie-inflected, yes-ma'am, no-ma'am son of the South counts for more than Bill Clinton as tabloid target.
Interviews with a number of voters and public officials throughout the South suggest that sentiment for Mr. Clinton is holding firm in spite of reports in a supermarket tabloid of marital infidelity and assertions that he had tried to avoid the draft in the Vietnam era. Many analysts had wondered whether the accusations would erode support in his conservative home base.
A strong showing in the Southern primaries culminating on March 10, Super Tuesday, in which he has long been expected to do well, could provide the Arkansas Governor with a significant lift in his quest for the Democratic Presidential nomination.
There is no question that some Southern voters have been put off by the reports about Mr. Clinton. At the least, the questions have erased the sense of Mr. Clinton's invincibility in the region.
"I think he's got problems," said Larry James, a painter who works at Newton General Hospital in nearby Covington. "People pick up on that, particularly his marital problems. We're just not like people up North. There are things they don't care about there that make a difference to us."
Mr. James said he was leaning toward President Bush, regardless of what happened with the Democrats.
But among Southern Democratic officials, Mr. Clinton retains the support of the overwhelming majority.
He has resources and an organization that dwarf those of his rivals, and his main opponent seems to be a heretofore little-known former Senator from Massachusetts with no real organization in any Southern state.
Thus, when Paul E. Tsongas, the top vote getter in the New Hampshire primary last week, and Mr. Clinton arrived here on Friday to address the annual gathering of Georgia Democrats, the front page of The Atlanta Journal featured a large color picture of Mr. Clinton with a quote above it from Lieut Gov. Pierre Howard reading: "Tsongas is not Greek for Bubba."
Representative John Lewis, the Georgia Congressman and civil rights pioneer, who endorsed the Arkansan on Friday, said Mr. Clinton would "win the Southern primaries in a sweep and will be the nominee of the party."
 
'Referendum on the Future'
 "The rank-and-file voters here in the South are not going to be concerned with the draft issue," Mr. Lewis said. "They want to get good health care, to send their children to good schools, to get a job. This election is a referendum on the future, not the past."
One of the important Super Tuesday primaries will be in Texas, and a poll there reported in The Houston Chronicle today showed Mr. Clinton with the support of 40 percent of the state's likely Democratic primary voters. Mr. Tsongas was backed by 9 percent, and 42 percent remained undecided. The poll of 400 Democrats had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points.
In the full poll of 835 likely voters of both parties, conducted Feb. 12-19, two-thirds said the press had paid too much attention to Mr. Clinton's personal life, and more than half said the personal issues would have no effect on their voting. But 3 in 10 said they would be much less or somewhat less likely to vote for Mr. Clinton because of the questions. These figures had a four-point margin of error.
 
'What the Democrats Need'
 Few Southerners seem willing to say Mr. Clinton is home free, and additional damaging publicity could transform the campaign, which includes primaries in Georgia on March 3 and South Carolina on March 7, followed by Super Tuesday balloting on March 10 in Texas, Florida, Mississippi, Tennessee and Louisiana. But for now, Mr. Clinton seems to have weathered the storms that set back his campaign for weeks.
"He's a Southerner, who can get the support of blacks and whites," said John Corbett, pastor of Springfield Baptist Church in Greenville, S.C. "He's what the Democrats need. He's moderate, mainstream, a decent man."
Asked about accusations of infidelity, he said: "I do believe in forgiviness and grace, and I'm just not willing to cut somebody's neck off because they've done something in the past."
Of 14 people interviewed in South Carolina last week, only one cited the marital and draft questions as a reason for voting against Mr. Clinton
 
Many See Problems
 Other Southerners, however, do see fundamental problems.
When Mr. Clinton campaigned Thursday in Savannah, his audience included John Siebert, an unemployed disabled veteran from nearby Hinesville who came with six other disabled veterans to protest the appearance.
"A lot of people served their country, and he ran off to England," said Mr. Siebert, who carried a sign reading, "No draft dodger or playboy for President."
Similarly, the Rev. Joe Lovelady, pastor of the East Edgewater Baptist Church in New Orleans, said he was troubled by both questions and thought Mr. Clinton had been seriously damaged in the South.
"There is a strong streak of Puritanism, in this country," he said, adding that although people talk about a liberal approach, "when we close the curtain to the voting booth, we find the Puritanism creeping in."
But even in Hinesville, Ga., with an economy heavily dependent on the military operations at Fort Stewart, there is sympathy for Mr. Clinton and doubt about the validity or relevance of the accusations against him.
 
'Reached a Saturation Point'
 "Every time, somebody runs for office, whether it's in the White House or here in Hinesville, they're going to dig up dirt, whether it's true or not," said Sheila Bowdle, manager of Leroy's, a pawn shop.
And, even among conservative voters, Mr. Clinton may be benefiting from a kind of scandal fatigue and a backlash against what some see as the constant drumbeat of stories about the private affairs of public people.
"I think people have just reached a saturation point," said Ida Vaughn, a 66-year-old grandmother who owns a feed store in Simpsonville, S.C. "First there was that Supreme Court deal and the Kennedy affair and by the time we got to this, people were sick of it. This was just a lot of stirring."
Still, Mrs. Vaughn, who describes herself as a Democrat who voted in 1988 for George Bush, said she was not overly impressed with any of the Democrats and hoped someone else ran.
In fact, most people interviewed said they had not made up their minds about how they would vote.
But Mr. Clinton's advantages in the region appear enormous. With endorsements from powerful black leaders like Mr. Lewis and Representative Mike Espy of Mississippi and most of the influential Hispanic politicians in Texas, he is the only candidate with a base in the minority populations that are critical in Southern Democratic primaries.
The Rev. Zebadee Bridges, pastor of the Asia Baptist Church in New Orleans and president of the Inter-Denominational Alliance of more than 300 black churches in the New Orleans area, said he and many of his colleagues were praising Mr. Clinton.
"This is politics," he said of the questions about Mr. Clinton. "These are issues that were brought up to destroy this man. We're not concerned about those issues. We're concerned about this country."
Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, a Clinton supporter, said Friday that he did not think the accusations would damage Mr. Clinton unless another candidate made a concerted effort to emphasize them. He conceded that whether or not the other Democrats tried to exploit the issues, the Republicans certainly would. Others agreed.
"I think Clinton will do very well in the Southern primaries," said Hastings Wyman, editor of the Southern Political Report, a newsletter. "I don't think the draft issue will hurt Clinton much in the primaries. I think when it will be an issue is November."

HEADLINE: Haitian Legislators and Aristide Agree on His Return

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Monday, Feb. 24

 BODY:
Haiti's exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and leaders of the country's Parliament signed an agreement just before midnight Sunday paving the way for a restoration to democratic government and his return as President.
For the agreement to take effect, it must be ratified by the Haitian Parliament. The accord sets no timetable for ratification or his return. No members of the military were present at the talks, casting doubt about whether the agreement would be carried out. 
 The sudden breakthrough in a five-month political impasse was achieved in part because of Father Aristide's willingness to make crucial concessions on the conciliatory treatment of the military, which overthrew him on Sept. 30.
The agreement, reached after three days of negotiations here at the headquarters of the Organization of American States, accepts Mr. Aristide's choice of Prime Minister, Rene Theodore, and specifies that the two high offices will operate separately under the Haitian Constitution.
 
Assurances to Foes
 This condition is apparently intended to assuage fears of those who thought that Father Aristide, a Roman Catholic priest who gained popularity among the poor, had shown a tendency to accumulate too much government power for himself in a deeply divided society.
The economic embargo imposed on Haiti by the organization and it member states is to be lifted upon ratification of the agreement.
The agreement specifically rules out intervention by foreign forces, which all Haitians oppose. The threat of an international police or peacekeeping force, which regional nations had begun to suggest as a last resort to break the crisis, may have played a role in bringing the Haitians to the table.
The agreement does not mention the fate of the army chief, Gen. Raoul Cedras. But officials at the organization said that it was understood that Father Aristide had conceded that the general could remain in place for the time being. Until this weekend, Father Aristide had demanded the removal and arrest or banishment of General Cedras.
 
General Amnesty
 The agreement goes further to reassure the military by recognizing the need for a general amnesty. There are known to be fears in the military that Father Aristide's populist Lavalas political movement may turn lynch mobs on troops if and when he is restored to the presidency. Under the agreement, however, the army and the police are to be separated, and both institutions reorganized and professionalized.
Military threats to civilian political leaders has not yet ended. Diplomats and American officials here note that Mr. Theodore, who was the focus of two attacks in recent weeks, had to be escorted to the airport by American and Canadian diplomats in Port-au-Prince for his flight to Washington last week. The envoys also had to persuade officials at the airport to let Mr. Theodore, who is the leader of the Communist Party in Haiti and who is viewed a moderate, board the plane.
The agreement, the groundwork for which was negotiated by an O.A.S. team led by a former Colombian Foreign Minister, Augusto Ramirez Ocampo, was signed by Father Aristide, the president of the Haitian Senate, Dejean Belizaire, and the leader of the Chamber of Deputies, Alexandre Medard. Also signing were Mr. Ramirez Ocampo and memebers of his negotiating mission and Joao Clemente Baena Soares, Secretary General of the Organization of American States.
Although the agreement between Father Aristide and leaders of the Parliament came as a major and unexpected advance in the organization's efforts to restore his presidency, many potential stumbling blocks could still delay or prevent his return to power.
Even though Father Aristide had been persuaded to drop repeated vows to see General Cedras punished, it is far from clear whether the Haitian Army is ready to acquiesce in any political settlement.
The ambivalence toward the negotiations of the army, and the provisional government it supports, was underscored in recent days by repeated and angry disavowels of the talks.
For Father Aristide to return, moreover, General Cedras would have to rein in unruly, hard-line segments of the army that have sown terror and created public disturbances every time political efforts to restore the elected government seemed to be advancing.

HEADLINE: United Way Awaits Inquiry On Its President's Practices

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
The United Way of America, the nation's largest charity network, is conducting an internal investigation after its president was accused of lavish spending and free-wheeling management practices.
The accusations have caused a few of the network's larger members to delay a decision on paying dues until the inquiry is completed on April 2. 
 In his 21-year tenure, the president, William Aramony, has been widely credited with creatively building a coast-to-coast network of 2,100 independent United Ways that collectively raised $3.1 billion in its last campaign. The autonomous local units help support 42,000 health and social service agencies.
But this month reports in several publications raised questions about Mr. Aramony's travel habits, salary, possible cronyism in hiring and relations with five spin-off companies he helped create.
 
Vote of Confidence
 In anticipation of the critical reports, Mr. Aramony asked outside investigators to review his work, and based on that preliminary inquiry, a 14-member executive committee of his organization's board gave him a unanimous vote of confidence earlier this month.
A more wide-ranging review is now under way by a Washington law firm, Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson & Hand, Mr. Aramony said in an interview Saturday.
He said he welcomed this inquiry and that it would deal more fully with the spinoff companies that were started to help the local members buy goods or services at lower, bulk rates. One company is now headed by his son, Robert Aramony, but he said he had no influence in the selection of his on for the position.
From its headquarters in Alexandria, Va., United Way of America offers training to staff members of local United Ways, provides fund-raising literature, films and kits, and most importantly, has marshaled the support of business leaders to lead local drives.
 
An Outstretched Hand
 United Way has made the logo of an outstretched hand a nationally recognized symbol of charitable giving and has raised millions of dollars through workers' payroll donations and corporate and individual gifts.
The national organization, which has a $28.4 million budget, is supported mainly by voluntary dues from 1,400 member organizations.
Mr. Aramony, 64 years old, receives $463,000 in salary and benefits like health insurance, which makes him the highest-paid executive in the charity field. .
The organization's Executive Committee voted to increase his salary this year but he refused the raise because of the poor economic conditions, Mr. Aramony said during the interview at the offices of United Way of New York City, 99 Park Avenue.
Mr. Aramony said he first became aware of accusations against him about six months ago, when unsigned letters were sent to the 37-member board raising questions about his salary, travel habits and management practices.
In December, reporters for Regardies Magazine, The Washington Post and Jack Anderson, the columnist, also began inquiries about his activities, and have since published articles. United Way sent copies of some articles to its members along with memos that, in effect, aimed to respond to them and probably also to blunt any adverse reaction.
Among the questions raised by the articles was Mr. Aramony's appointment of Thomas J. Merlo as United Way's chief financial officer.
Although Mr. Aramony said he had known Mr. Merlo since 1958 when both were associated with United Way in Miami, he was unaware until reporters began inquiring that Mr. Merlo had personal financial difficulties and had been sued in Florida for unpaid loans. After he learned of the financial troubles, Mr. Aramony said, he told Mr. Merlo he was putting him on paid administrative leave and he would be replaced.
The current investigation is focusing on companies created by United Way. Robert Aramony helped run two of the spin-off companies and now heads a third, Sales Service/America, which sells telephone equipment and mail-order merchandise with the United Way logo.
Partnership Umbrella, another of the spin-off companies, bought and furnished a $430,000 apartment in the Bristol Hotel in Manhattan that is used by the older Mr. Aramony. He described it as a two-room combined office-residence that he uses instead of a hotel, thereby saving money, and said it was used also by company members.
Mr. Aramony said that he traveled often and sometimes in luxury, but he said: "I hate traveling, but I'm on the road 192 days of the year. I've been on the Concorde twice, maybe three times, when my schedule required speed."
Many of the local United Way fund-raising campaigns have ended or are winding down, and Mr. Aramony said he expected the totals to be higher than last year. But a few leaders of local United Ways said they feared the negative reports about Mr. Aramony could dampen future giving, and they underscored that the use of their contributions is decided locally by boards of volunteers, and their operations are independent.
 
Dues Are Delayed
 "We've had a few calls but no tempest brewing," said David A. Paradine, president of United Way in Portland, Ore., which has decided to delay until April a decision on whether to pay national dues. The United Way of King County, Wash., which includes Seattle, also said it would delay paying 1992 dues until its board had examined the issues in early March.
United Way of New York City, one of the largest contributors, is to pay $550,000, said Ralph Dickerson Jr., president. "As a dues payer we want to hear and weigh carefully the results of the investigation," he said. "We are hearing some things for the first time, we are surprised and we want all the facts on the table before we make our decision about future participation."
United Way of Chicago/Crusade of Mercy, which has the largest single campaign and expects increased contributions of $111 million, has not considered withholding dues but expressed its concern to United Way of America's Board, said Martin Nickelbine, a spokesman.
The law firm that is conducting the current inquiry refused to comment on it. But the 14-member Executive Committee was confident it had a substantially complete picture from the inquiries started in December, Dr. LaSalle D. Leffall Jr., committee chairman and professor of surgery at Howard University College of Medicine.
It was on that basis the committee members held a conference call on Feb. 3 and unanimously expressed confidence in Mr. Aramony, he said. The committee and the full 37-member Board of United Way, which is headed by John F. Akers, chairman of I.B.M., are made up of leaders from business, education, minority and civic organizations.
"Some things we knew could have been done better if the system of accounting was better," said Dr. Lefall. "But we also considered Bill Aramony has given 21 years of his life and excellent service and lives and breaths United Way. When our auditors examined the books, we found we actually owed him $1,300."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: South Dakota;
Democrats, in Midwestern Debate, Aggressively Court the Farm Vote

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SIOUX FALLS, S.D., Feb. 23

 BODY:
In a free-wheeling, often chaotic debate that was marked by personal barbs, six Democratic candidates for President virtually tripped over one another tonight trying to assure South Dakotans that they were most sympathetic to the needs of rural America.
While the primary election on Tuesday is viewed as a showdown between two farm state Senators, Tom Harkin of Iowa and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, neither wasted any time in attacking his rivals as insensitive to family farmers. The other Democrats insisted that they understood the importance of agriculture to the nation's economy. 
 At the outset of the televised debate, Mr. Kerrey assailed Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas for having an adviser, Robert Shapiro of the Progressive Policy Institute, who has "made some provocative and negative statements about agriculture."
Mr. Clinton denied that Mr. Shapiro had advised him on such matters, and said he was surprised that Mr. Kerrey would make it an issue in radio advertising here. "It's amazing to me that Senator Kerrey would attack me on the ads," Mr. Clinton said, "since we served on the Agriculture Committee of the National Governors Association together."
Not willing to concede the farm vote to his rivals from the heartland, Mr. Clinton declared: "Senators Harkin and Kerrey know that I've been a farm state Governor for 11 years."
Sponsored by the South Dakota Democratic Party, the 90-minute event was billed as a forum that would offer the candidates no chance for rebuttal. But the audience at the Howard Johnson Hotel here, and the viewers on South Dakota's public television stations and the national C-Span cable television network, were treated to the liveliest of the five national debates held so far.
Mr. Harkin, for one, called on former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, who was the top vote-getter in the New Hampshire primary and was a leader in today's caucuses in Maine, to renounce his proposal for a 5-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax.
But Mr. Tsongas challenged Mr. Harkin for interrupting him, saying, "We talk about personal decency; let's practice it." He also said he did not know much about agriculture, but said that did not mean he did not understand rural issues.
"I acknowledge that Bob Kerrey and Tom Harkin know a lot more about agriculture than I do," Mr. Tsongas said. "But I know how to listen, how to learn. I don't compete with you, Bob."
Mr. Kerrey shot back, accusing Mr. Tsongas of knowing more about agriculture than he lets on, and of not being a friend of the heartland. "It's not like you're coming into the state and hearing it all right now," Mr. Kerrey said. Saying, "I'm not trying to be personal," Mr. Kerrey went on to accuse Mr. Tsongas of having a poor record on farm issues in the Senate.
The attacks were punctuated by laughter. At one point, the moderator, Ken Bode, an analyst for Cable News Network and graduate of the University of South Dakota, repeated what he said was a line from Mr. Kerrey that Mr. Tsongas thought "a combine is used to mix a martini."
"Great line, but I did not say that," Mr. Kerrey said.
With comic timing, Mr. Tsongas asked later, "Answer me this: What is a martini?"
Coming off a strong showing today in Maine, former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California said the United States should not spend any more money on foreign aid until farmers and small businesses were better taken care of. He devoted most of his time to repeating his themes of overhauling a corrupt political system.
But he did not escape the attacks of Larry Agran, the former Mayor of Irvine, Calif., who is usually excluded from debates of the major candidates but was invited the state party to this event. He accused his fellow Californian of hypocrisy in deriding special-interest donations.
"When I hear Jerry Brown, the grand champion of raising special-interest money in the 70's and 80's," Mr. Agran said angrily, "I'm up to here with it." Turning to Mr. Brown, his voice rising, Mr. Agran said, "You have raised tens of millions of dollars in California and elsewhere."
At the end of the debate, Mr. Agran mimicked Mr. Brown by holding up a sign with his "800" number for contributions. "I want to make Jerry Brown feel more comfortable," he said of Mr. Brown, who often irritates his rivals by giving out his own "800" number at debates.
The candidates also debated American Indian affairs, the environment and health care, but spent far more time than they have in previous encounters outlining the differences among themselves.
Each of the Democrats took a shot at Mr. Tsongas, who, they complained, has not been held responsible for the consequences of his positions.
Mr. Clinton, who accused Mr. Tsongas on Saturday of engaging in "pious rhetoric" on the campaign trail, lashed out.
"It is frustrating for me to be told the only morally appropriate way to wean America off cheap foreign oil is a nickel-a-gallon gasoline tax," Mr. Clinton said. "Your incomes went down and your taxes went up in the 80's and Senator Tsongas wants to feed you more of the same in the 90's. And it's wrong."
 
The Men to Beat
 But some of the candidates seemed at a loss in competing with Mr. Harkin and Mr. Kerrey, both of whom must do well in order to continue credible campaigns for the Democratic nomination.
Mr. Clinton as much as acknowledged in his closing statement that he does not expected to win in the South Dakota contest. "I wish my state bordered South Dakota, but it doesn't," he said.
And Mr. Tsongas boasted that his wife, Niki, and children "have South Dakotan blood in their veins." Mr. Tsongas' father-in-law is from South Dakota.
Mr. Kerrey's campaign is widely viewed as the best organized in South Dakota, and a poll published Sunday by The Argus Leader, the state's largest newspaper, found that he was ahead of the pack. The newspaper also endorsed Mr. Kerrey.

HEADLINE: Modest Goals for an Energy Bill

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
With the elimination of major provisions aimed at oil conservation and production, the energy bill passed by the Senate last week focuses mostly on greater efficiency and competition in the electric utility industry, though experts expect its impact to be modest.
The National Energy Strategy, outlined by President Bush during the Persian Gulf war, originally focused heavily on oil issues. But by the time the bill cleared the Senate, both main oil provisions -- to allow drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and to require cars to use less gasoline -- were stripped because they threatened to sink the whole package. 
 The House version being drawn up takes a similar tack. The measures together, though they may bring modest cuts in electricity use and some reduction in consumers' utility bills, draw little enthusiasm from energy experts, who said the bills would only reinforce a movement that was already under way in many states.
 
'Between a Yawn and a Groan'
 "The right reaction is somewhere between a yawn and a groan," Peter Bradford, the chairman of the New York Public Service Commission and a former member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said of the Senate bill.
He and others said the Senate measure had missed many opportunities for electric efficiency improvements, especially in the Federal Government itself, and that the goals of the package were extremely modest, falling short of those of some states.
Ralph Cavanagh, an energy expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a not-for-profit organization specializing in environmental and health issues, said that under California's current energy plan, three-quarters of all new demand for electricity over the next 20 years would be met with efficiency improvements, even though the population of California was expected to grow at twice the national average.
California's idea was that those energy savings would be cheaper than new energy sources, Mr. Cavanagh said, but "no such commitment underlies the national effort."
Representative Philip R. Sharp, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce subcommittee that put together the bulk of the House package, said in an interview before the Senate passed its bill that with the Senate's dropping of the Arctic drilling and car-mileage issues, the central parts of the energy package would be two provisions that primarily concern electricity generators.
The provisions are in both the House and Senate versions, but differ in their details. The Senate version also includes simplified rules for licensing of new nuclear plants, but the House version does not. Such a provision is expected to face strong opposition in the House.
 
Interstate Utilities
 One provision of the House and Senate measures would repeal parts of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 that make it difficult for utilities to operate in more than one state. A repeal would allow investor-owned utilities to build power plants almost anywhere in the country and sell the power to other utilities in the area.
Currently, only non-utility companies can own such free-standing power plants, and advocates of the repeal said that allowing utilities into the business would stimulate competition and lower costs. Not all utilities agreed that an increase in competition would lower costs, however, and not everyone agreed that such a change would make much difference in cost in this period of relatively slow growth in electricity demand.
A second big provision would open access to the electric transmission system to independent electricity generators and others. The system is now largely controlled in patchwork fashion, depending on who owns the power lines in a particular location. This, too, has deeply divided the electricity industry.
Mr. Sharp, an Indiana Democrat, pointed out that his bill would also encourage public utility commissions to institute rules that put efficiency investments on par with investments in new generators. A utility that needed another 10 megawatts of power, for example, would be encouraged to try to reduce demand by helping its customers use energy more efficiently rather than simply build a small generating station. The technique is known as least-cost energy planning or integrated resources planning.
The idea, critics said, was sound but hardly original. John C. Fox, manager of energy efficiency services at the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, said 41 states had adopted the idea or had "processes under way currently that will lead to its adoption."
But some states might be encouraged to go a step farther, redesigning utility rates so that an electric company that had succeeded in selling fewer kilowatt-hours of power was rewarded with higher revenues. Mr. Bradford of the New York commission said that seven states now had such rates.
The House version also mandates efficiency standards for appliances, lights and motors, which environmentalists called a good start.
 
No Pressure on Oil Policy
 With oil prices currently depressed, there was little impetus for significant changes in oil policy to be included in the energy bill.
Oil prices have fallen to about what they were before Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. On an inflation-adjusted basis, they are near their lowest levels since World War II.
"It continues, from a consumer's point of view, to be a pretty good bargain," said Daniel Yergin, the energy historian and consultant.
One significant oil-related provision remains: the bill the Senate approved still calls for the Federal Government to buy cars that run on something besides gasoline, like natural gas, methanol or electricity. But even with that provision, Washington seems unlikely to be the main force in the evolution of the car; that role, say experts, probably lies with California, which has set progressively stricter air pollution rules that will require alternative fuels.
Another oil provision survived only in the House energy bill. A fee of a penny a gallon would be imposed on oil refiners and importers to pay for faster filling of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, in effect making refiners and importers pay for oil stored in Government-owned underground caverns. The extra cost, however, will probably be passed on to consumers.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS
When Styles Clash: Time Warner's Rupture -- A special report;
A Divorce in the Executive Suite

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
They were corporate America's odd couple. On the one hand, there was the steely, guarded N. J. Nicholas Jr., the epitome of the button-down culture of Henry Luce's Time Inc. A man legendary for his severity, it was said he would turn in his mother if she exaggerated on her expense account.
On the other, there was the suave, garrulous Steven J. Ross, the embodiment of the freewheeling and prodigal style of Warner Communications Inc., the company he built over three decades from a funeral-parlor-cum-rent-a-car business into a global entertainment company. 
 And in the wings was Mr. Nicholas's archrival, Gerald M. Levin, who had been sidelined years ago by Mr. Nicholas's rising career, but who had no intention of playing Mr. Nicholas's No. 2 at Time Warner Inc., the newly formed media conglomerate.
Still, the 1990 merger of Time and Warner had made Mr. Ross and Mr. Nicholas co-chief executives. Mr. Nicholas was there by Mr. Ross's agreement, having been hand-picked by J. Richard Munro, the former Time Inc. chairman who had been mentor to Mr. Levin and Mr. Nicholas.
Then, three months ago, Time Warner disclosed that Mr. Ross, who is 64 years old, was ill with prostate cancer. With Mr. Ross's death suddenly viewed as a stark possibility, it was clear both that his relationship with Mr. Nicholas was floundering and that the company would find it difficult ever to integrate fully under Mr. Nicholas. "He wanted to be sure that the right person was in place, and that person was Jerry," a family friend said.
Working by telephone from his homes in New York and East Hampton, L.I., Mr. Ross, who is undergoing chemotherapy, set in motion a plan to remove Mr. Nicholas, according to a top lieutenant, and install Mr. Levin. Last weekend, Mr. Levin visited Mr. Munro at his home in Connecticut and said he could not continue and was contemplating leaving, a Time Warner executive said.
Mr. Munro, still a Time Warner director, appears to have been sufficiently disenchanted with Mr. Nicholas's management that he reversed his own decision, made several years ago, to annoint Mr. Nicholas. He agreed to support Mr. Levin's promotion. Mr. Munro could not be reached over the weekend. A spokesman for Time Warner said neither Mr. Levin nor Mr. Ross would discuss the move.
A week ago, some Time Warner board members received telephone calls and were told to plan on a special board meeting last Thursday. Then, a day before the board meeting, Mr. Nicholas got a call at his vacation condominium in Vail, Colo., from a director who told him what was about to happen. "He did not know why, he did not have a clue and he felt he had no time to fight it," one longtime associate said.
Mr. Nicholas's wife, who answered the telephone, said he would not comment and she also turned away a reporter who went to Vail to try to interview Mr. Nicholas.
Before the board formally convened, it interrogated Mr. Levin about the company's sinking morale, Then the directors voted -- some by telephone -- to accept Mr. Nicholas's resignation and to name Mr. Levin president, co-chief executive and heir apparent to the chairman. While the change looked abrupt to outsiders, a look back on the two years that the companies have been together -- and their very different styles -- highlights the festering conflicts that led to a clash of personalities and Mr. Nicholas's departure.
 
A Basic Difference
Corporate Cultures Refused to Merge
 "I was caught off guard by the timing, but you might say this was predictable," said Oded Aboodi, Mr. Ross's chief financial aide. "Nick and Steve had different instincts and things were constantly slowed because of that. Steve is more comfortable now, more able to express himself. He likes Jerry and feels that one difficult issue is behind us."
But instead of working together, insiders say, Mr. Ross and Mr. Nicholas grew to mistrust each other to the point of rupturing their relationship. This in turn blocked an effective merging of the companies. Rather than being gradually blended, the separate personalities of Time and Warner were, if anything, reinforced.
"I even feel apprehensive about going over to the Time-Life Building," Mr. Ross, who is based in the former Warner building, said in his last interview before beginning intensive chemotherapy in December.
With Mr. Ross severely ill, and the succession question thus acutely posed, the differences between the executives could no longer be papered over. That is why Mr. Levin, a Time executive who was a major architect of the merger and the man closest to bridging the Time and Warner cultures, was promoted to resolve the impasse, executives said.
As last year progressed, insiders say, it became clear that the Ross-Nicholas setup was not working. "We had HBO and publishing reporting to Nick, movies and music reporting to Steve, and cable to both of them," one board member said. "It was a recipe for not making one company."
 
A Solution
One Executive Bridges the Gap
 The solution adopted last May was to promote Mr. Levin from vice chairman to chief operating officer and have all the businesses report to him. Mr. Levin thus placed himself in the strategic position of being the first executive with a true overview of all the businesses.
He was helped in this promotion by the fact that he had grown steadily closer to the Warner side. In his typically analytical way, Mr. Levin describes this process as one of crossing an emotional line, something that happened gradually but was crystallized for him in a compensation committee meeting some time after the merger.
Some Time people were arguing that they should be treated more generously than Warner executives, who had made a lot in the merger, because Time actually bought Warner at a premium. Mr. Levin suddenly found himself emotionally pointing out that this was history. What mattered was that Time Warner was now one company.
There is no evidence that Mr. Nicholas ever crossed a similar emotional line from the Time side or formed ties with Mr. Ross's entourage that were similar, say, to Mr. Levin's close friendship with Mr. Aboodi.
In the knowledge that his executives at the movie and record companies had still not accepted Mr. Nicholas's destined role as sole chief executive, Mr. Ross increasingly turned to Mr. Levin. "Levin was Ross's weapon against Mr. Nicholas," said Martin S. Davis, the chairman and chief executive of Paramount Communications Corporation, which tried to buy Time Inc. for $200 a share in 1989.
Increasingly, Mr. Levin appeared to act as a buffer within the troika. Mr. Ross became more and more demanding as he was being excoriated for his compensation, which continues to be criticized as overly generous. But Mr. Nicholas was scarcely a responsive shoulder to cry on.
 
Resentments
Cut in Time Jobs Brings Bitterness
 Relations worsened over the company's initially botched stock rights offering last year, whose coercive formula was angrily rejected by shareholders. Company executives said Mr. Nicholas had argued against raising money in this way.
Relations were further undermined when the magazine division decided to cut 605 journalistic jobs -- a decision that provoked indignant comparisons of Mr. Ross's salary and those of the people being laid off. "That killed me," Mr. Ross said a few months ago. "It was the decision of a division, and it's something I've had to do very few times in my life."
Mr. Nicholas, however, took a harsher view. "Employees were bitching and moaning about their jobs and I fully understand that, but it does not relate to Time Warner, Steve Ross's compensation or the stock price," he said in an interview late last year. "We're living through something of a holocaust in employment in journalism and that's it."
Where Mr. Nicholas, who attended the Harvard Business School, tended to approach problems at Time Warner in a meticulously structured way, Mr. Ross, who had no formal business schooling, tended to trust his instincts. Where Mr. Nicholas made points succinctly, talking as if he was reading a memo, Mr. Ross meandered, sometimes maddeningly.
"Ross often comes at things from left field, and that would drive Nick crazy," said a Time Warner board member.
Moreover, Mr. Ross had, over the years, made lavishness a trademark of his business style; he was not about to change to accommodate the more understated Mr. Nicholas.
Mr. Ross defended the much-criticized corporate largesse. He said Time Warner's houses in Aspen and Acapulco and its seven corporate planes were well worth the expense.
Sylvester Stallone, for example, once went down to the Warner villa in Acapulco on the Warner plane and was slipped a script with the message, "If you don't wanna read, just throw it in the trash can," Mr. Ross recounted recently. Mr. Stallone read it. He then made the movie "Cobra" for Warner, which grossed $48 million.
"Nobody understands that sort of thing," Mr. Ross exclaimed. "Nobody."
Among those who had difficulty understanding was Mr. Nicholas.
Moreover, it seems clear that neither Warner's personality-driven movie nor record executives, ever accepted Mr. Nicholas. Indeed, those divisions -- which between them accounted for more than half of Time Warner's $11.5 billion 1991 revenue and generated close to $1 billion in operating profit -- seem to have felt threatened by him.
"At the movie studio, Levin is preferred to Nicholas," Wayne Duband, a Warner vice president, said before last week's announcement.
Thus, over the last two years, Warner and Time divisions kept their former respective loyalties. "Has it meshed as I would have liked?" Mr. Ross asked. "No. Ten million things have hit us." Mr. Nicholas, meanwhile, was fastidious in insisting that Home Box Office and the magazine group, both former Time businesses, report to him. In the end, with cancer threatening Mr. Ross, something had to give.
 
The Last Deal
Complications Plague Merger
 Mr. Levin was ready to make his move. A wry man who once studied theology, he says his favorite novel is Albert Camus's existential classic "The Stranger." An exact contemporary of Mr. Nicholas, his manner is less coolly businesslike and his turn of mind intensely, almost metaphysically, analytical.
Like Mr. Nicholas, he made his way in Time's newer businesses, galvanizing the company's Home Box Office Inc. pay-cable subisidiary into a significant money-spinner during the 1970's. This achievement, which gave Time a vital say in media that were growing faster than its traditional magazine activities, placed him in the running to succeed Mr. Munro as Time's chief executive.
"Levin and Nicholas were my proteges," Mr. Munro, who is now chairman of the executive committee of Time Warner, recalled recently. "Levin is the brighest individual I've ever met, but I thought Nick had more skills as a chief executive, perhaps a stiffer spine, and that is why I picked him. It was not by any means an easy call."
This 1986 decision, which installed Mr. Nicholas as president of Time Inc. and heir to the top job, effectively pushed Mr. Levin into the wilderness. He was even removed from Time's board in 1987.
Thus, when in recent weeks tensions mounted in the boardroom at Time Warner, Mr. Levin had ample reason to feel little compunction in forcing the issue.
 
Mr. Levin's Big Idea
 Left five years ago with the empty-sounding role of "chief strategist," it was Mr. Levin who came up with the notion of a "transforming transaction" to shake Time out of what he saw as a corporate complacency and place it in the vanguard of the fast-growing cable, movie and video businesses. In this way, talks with Warner Communications began.
But the discussions were ill starred from the outset. The original idea of merely putting together the two companies' cable and filmed-entertainment subsidiaries proved too complicated to structure.
Then a plan for a debt-free merger of the entire companies was foiled when Mr. Davis of Paramount bid $200 a share for Time in June 1989. To avoid a shareholders' vote on the Paramount offer, Time's board chose instead to buy Warner for $14 billion, incurring $11 billion of debt in the process.
"Davis lobbed a grenade into our midst," said Mr. Munro, the former Time Inc. chief executive. "And that complicated the hell out of everything. I will go to my grave with $200 a share on my tombstone."
The complications were made worse because, as Felix G. Rohatyn, the senior partner at Lazard Freres put it, "the world changed on Time Warner."
The merger was the last big deal of the 1980's. Debt became anathema. Media stock prices plunged. Publishing went into recession. Executive compensation -- which soared to great heights at the new company largely because Mr. Ross had an enormously lucrative 1987 Warner contract that had to be matched -- came under increasingly critical scrutiny.
All this made a lot of people bitter. Michael J. Fuchs, the chairman of Time Warner's Home Box Office, noted that the difference between the $200-a-share offer and the Time Warner stock price -- now $99 a share -- added up to "an awful lot of anger among Time shareholders and on Wall Street."
The sight of top Time Warner management collecting millions of dollars in compensation and bonuses as a result of the deal further soured things. The fact that Mr. Ross got $196 million for his Warner options and other equity interests tended to make him the target of much of this ire. Used to adulation from his days at Warner, this seemed to hurt him psychologically. "These constant attacks caused him enormous anguish," said Arthur Liman, the prominent New York lawyer.
Thus as Mr. Ross, Mr. Nicholas and their vice chairman, Mr. Levin, took up their plush adjoining offices on the 29th floor of the former Warner building in July 1990, there was a steadily growing strain on them. Mr. Levin, for one, talks of having been physically depressed by the Time Warner share price.
 
The Last Days
A Miscalculation Proves to Be Fatal
 Mr. Nicholas tended to deal with day-to-day operations. This arrangement suited their respective temperaments. Mr. Ross calls himself a dreamer and a strategist, above all; Mr. Nicholas is a very effective manager. In theory, the arrangement might have been complementary.
But Mr. Nicholas apparently did little to ease the mutual suspicions between the Time and Warner sides. "He kept insisting the Time business must report to him," one official said. Sometimes, the situation may have played to Mr. Nicholas's advantage.
Some analysts have suggested that Mr. Nicholas rejected the very notion of looking for partners -- a search which finally led last year to a deal with C. Itoh & Company and the Toshiba Corporation, both of Japan -- and that this was a large source of tension.
But tension between the executives seems to have come from elsewhere: Mr. Nicholas's tenacious defense of his old Time turf; his comparative slowness in moving toward decisions; differences over the increasingly bitter issue of executive compensation; arguments over the stock rights offering last year, and ultimately, a sense in Mr. Ross's close circle of allies that Mr. Nicholas was acting as if the company was already his.
That was a fatal miscalculation on Mr. Nicholas's part. Mr. Ross's influence with the board remained strong. Half the board members were Mr. Ross's allies. And with Mr. Munro, Mr. Nicholas's biggest backer turning against him, the scene was now set for Mr. Nicholas's ousting.
It must have come as a brutal surprise. Just three months ago, Mr. Nicholas felt relaxed enough about the future to muse on who might succeed him as chief executive when his contract expired on July 24, 1999.
"I don't know if my successor would be Jerry Levin," he said in an interview. "I give the question some thought. But I'm only 52, and I don't expect to be hit by a yellow taxi tomorrow."

Chart: "At Time Warner, Three Very Different Managers"
 
 Steven J. Ross, age 64
An intuitive, gut-driven executive who says his favorite occupation is dreaming, by which he means imagining futuristic ways to bring more media to more people. Mr. Ross is a good dealmaker and possesses a great gift for numbers. He chooses talented people to lead businesses and lets them run -- with generally good but occasionally disastrous results. "If you're not a risk-taker," he says, "you should get the hell out of business." He has been ill with prostate cancer, has been undergoing chemotherapy and has been working for the past few months from his homes in New York and East Hampton, L.I.
 
Gerald M. Levin, age 52
A quirky, slightly offbeat, low-key former Time Inc. executive with a very penetrating mind. The only intellectual of the three, he finds Albert Camus's "The Stranger," with its existential angst, to be his favorite novel. Mr. Levin has a gift for cutting through dross and putting things clearly. After his career was sidelined several years ago, and he was removed from the board, he made a steady comeback and was able to forge alliances with new Warner colleagues. He is a passionate believer in cable television, which he helped put on the map. He is said to have a better feel for people than Mr. Nicholas.
 
Nicholas J. Nicholas, age 52
A methodical Harvard-trained manager, who played a vital role in the rapid growth of Time Inc.'s Home Box Office. Mr. Nicholas's strength lies in finance and startegy. His friends say he has a warmth that he reveals to few, but he sometimes gives the impression of a man on automatic pilot. His cost-conscious eye grated on Mr. Rosse's freewheeling ways. He can be meticulous. For example, when commenting a few months ago on his relationship with Mr. Ross, he said: "Yes, it's an unusual arrangement. One reason is the people happen to respect and like each other. No, that's two reasons. They respect each other and they like each other." (pg. D1)

HEADLINE: The House's Tactician of Taxation

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 23

 BODY:
Dan Rostenkowski will be leading the fight for the Democrats' middle-class tax cut in the House this week, but that does not mean he expects it to become law.
Or even that he necessarily thinks it should be. 
 After all, he consistently said for weeks that the economy would probably be helped more by being left alone and that his bill, and President Bush's, too, are responses to political, not economic, needs.
That argument fits the persona the head of the Ways and Means Committee enjoys most, that of the committee chairman who exceeds Washington's expectations, works for a clean tax code and usually seems above partisanship.
His friendship with Mr. Bush, which dates from their service together on Ways and Means two decades ago, produces "Dear Danny" letters and brings occassional golf dates. And he complains that these days, "We never quit politicking in the House of Representatives."
But don't feel sorry about Mr. Rostenkowski's being forced, as he puts it, by circumstances and other Democratic leaders to fight a party fight. He protests too much.
He may not have used his partisan skills much in recent years, but this product of the Chicago organization (Mayor Richard J. Daley decided he would be a Congressman in 1958, and he was) knows the moves instinctively, both in working this tax bill and in dealing with an unexpected and irritating primary challenge back home.
In Chicago, Mr. Rostenkowski is scoring political points with a tale of an arrogant Federal Government that wants to move a Social Security center from one neighborhood in his district to another, even though both neighborhoods oppose the change.
And he is using his prominence on the tax bill -- "the high visibility of theater that takes place in here" -- to campaign with celebrity status and as an acceptable excuse when he must miss an event.
It was his idea to have Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, introduce Mr. Bush's entire tax program with the intention of putting it before the House to show that Republicans would not vote for it. The measure contains some provisions no one in Congress likes, like taxing annuities, and others that even Mr. Bush does not want considered now because of their costs, like a $500 increase in the personal exemption for children.
Mr. Rostenkowski then intended to show that Democrats would support his alternative measure, which he said would define "the difference between the Democrats and the Republicans."
"We're going to see to it that middle-income Americans have a better tax break," he said.
 
Threat of a Veto
 But he was hardly surprised on Friday when President Bush threatened to veto the bill, whose two years of tax credits of up to $400 a couple would be paid for through permanent higher rates for upper-income taxpayers. The day before, Mr. Rostenkowski said that the usual process of first insisting that no compromise was possible and later making a deal was unlikely to be followed this year.
"I think the President has been emphatic enough about raising marginal tax rates that he's not going to sign anything," Mr. Rostenkowski said in an interview on Thursday.
Concerning the bill's appeal, Mr. Rostenkowski discusses that exclusively in terms political rather than substantive. He frequently repeats that the economists his committee heard in December advised inaction, but says: "The one time I agree with the economists, I'm forced to do something other than sit on my fanny and do nothing. The political climate insists that we have something."
He moved this bill through his committee faster than usual, with his customary invitation to Democratic colleagues to change it if they wished and his customary show of muscle to defeat their changes.
The most innovative challenge Mr. Rostenkowski faced was the idea of taking the $46 billion his two-year middle-class tax credit would cost and replacing it with permanent credits for children, at about $180 a year. Two of his proteges on the Ways and Means committee, Representatives Marty Russo of Illinois and Thomas J. Downey of Long Island, tried that idea out. The chairman assembled the votes to beat them soundly.
But when it came to making sure that Democrats would be, if not enthusiastic, at least mollified, Mr. Rostenkowski was ready to give way to the caucus on other points. First, he agreed to add Mr. Bush's accelerated-depreciation provision and another clause to help small businesses buy new equipment and to limit the corporate tax cut to two years. Then, after saying sharply that he would not change anything else, he agreed to drop the corporate cut altogether.
There is one difference between this bill and others Mr. Rostenkowski handled recently, and it may be a measure of how seriously the tax bill should be taken as a potential statute as opposed to the political statement the Representative says he was told to make by leaders like Speaker of the House Thomas S. Foley and Mr. Gephardt.
This bill pays no attention to the 1990 budget act's requirement that any losses in revenue be paid for, year by year, by increases in revenue somewhere else. In theory, the Democrats' bill would raise revenues, taking in $14 billion more in six years through tax increases than it would lose in tax cuts, but that does not meet budget-act requirements that it be revenue neutral.
All the defense that Mr. Rostenkowski offers is that Mr. Bush's bills do not balance either, except with slick accounting.
But the budget act problem is not going to cost the measure any Democratic votes to speak of this week, and Mr. Rostenkowski, like the party leaders who urged him to provide a platform of fairness in a tax bill, is confident the bill will pass.
In his office in the Rayburn House Office Building, distinguished by a quizzical stuffed toy snow leopard, a gift from a wildlife organization, the Ways and Means chairman talked about the bill and its politics animatedly for half an hour.
Mr. Rostenkowski kept returning to the question of what was the point of it all if Mr. Bush was simply going to veto the growth package, either in this form or after a House-Senate conference.
Mr. Rostenkowski suggested that those who wanted to do nothing, who "stood in the shadows" as he might have preferred, could then say that the right policy objective had been reached. On the way, they could urge both sides, "get all the mileage you can out of your taking care of the middle class, working on fairness, getting growth packages, putting incentives in." But in the end, leave the tax code unchanged.
That comes later. This week, the chairman and the leaders must pass the bill.
"The worst thing that happens to us is we wind up not passing a bill," Mr. Rostenkowski said. "Then Bush has got free range in his arsenal of criticism. Then he can just throw it at us, and we have no defense: 'They can't get together; they are bickering; they won't see what's in the best interests of the country.' The fact of the matter is I really don't want a bill if I can avoid doing it. But the political climate insists we have something."

HEADLINE: Machine Tool Orders Fell In January

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Orders for American-made machine tools fell 36.7 percent in January from the previous month, the industry's trade group said in a report to be released today.
The trade organization, the Association for Manufacturing Technology, said orders totaled $217.2 million last month, compared with $342.9 million in December. But orders were 8.7 percent higher in January than in January a year ago. Orders worth $199.8 million were placed in January 1991, when the Persian Gulf war began. 
 The president of the group, Albert Moore, said he was worried that buyers were delaying purchases of machine tools to see whether President Bush and Congress could agree on incentives for investment as part of an economic growth package.
 
Concerns About Policy
 Mr. Moore said the industry was pleased that the President and Congress were discussing ways to offer investment incentives, "but we are concerned that buyers are delaying making a decision until the specifics are known." He added, "The country needs a decision on this issue without delay."
Purchases of machine tools, which are used to cut and form metal parts in a huge number of manufactured goods ranging from cookware and refrigerators to aircraft, are considered an important indication of the health of the manufacturing sector.
January shipments of machine tools were even more lackluster than orders, skidding 43.4 percent, to $159.6 million, from $282 million in December. Shipments were down 12.5 percent from the $182.5 million of shipments sent in January 1991.
Machine tool makers rely on the auto industry for 30 to 40 percent of their business, and they were hurt last year by cutbacks in production by the big American auto makers.
 
Exports Off as Well
 And while exports of machine tools had been a bright point amid the gloom, slowing economies around the world have hurt this sector of the business as well. The trade group said that January export orders plunged 77.5 percent to $13.1 million from $58.1 million in December, and were off 60 percent from $32.8 million in January 1991.
Export shipments in January were also down, falling 48.9 percent to $24.2 million from $47.4 million in December, and off 14.5 percent from $28.3 million a year ago.
The January backlog of orders was about $1.49 billion, up from $1.44 billion in December. The backlog totaled $1.49 billion in January a year ago.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
Tsongas Economic Plan Suggests Few Sacrifices

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 23

 BODY:
Paul E. Tsongas, who won the Democratic primary in New Hampshire with a campaign that emphasized personal sacrifice to revive the economy, is actually quite vague about the ingredients of the bitter medicine he would prescribe.
As he campaigned across New Hampshire, Mr. Tsongas, a former senator from Massachusetts, managed to distinguish himself from the other candidates of both parties, who promised tax cuts for families or popular new public works projects, or both, and who stressed mainly painless solutions to the economic problems in the state and the nation. 
 "I'm not running to be Santa Claus," he said in his standard speech. And he often remarked, "We need to put long-term good ahead of short-term gratification."
But scrutiny of his speeches and position papers discloses few specific proposals that would cause ordinary voters to bite the bullet. For example, while he calls the large Federal budget deficit "one of our most difficult and pressing problems," he says he has no plans for an overall tax increase or reduction in Social Security spending, steps that many economists believe are prerequisites for deficit reduction.
 
Rise in Gasoline Tax
 Asked in a telephone interview Friday to list the sacrifices he would require of middle-income Americans to strengthen the economy, Mr. Tsongas named only one: a 50-cents-a-gallon increase in the Federal gasoline tax, which he would impose in stages over 10 years.
Mainly, Mr. Tsongas said, when he talked about belt-tightening he was referring to his opposition to a tax cut for the middle class, like the one backed by President Bush, Democrats in Congress and two of his competitors for the Presidential nomination, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska.
He said he favored a "flexible freeze," the same words Mr. Bush used four years ago to explain how he would cut spending. As used by Mr. Bush and Mr. Tsongas, the term means that if spending is increased for some programs, it must be reduced for others so the deficit does not rise. "Do I have to reject a good idea and a necessary idea just because someone else used it?" Mr. Tsongas asked.
Under Mr. Bush, the annual deficit has risen to a record high of about $400 billion.
Like Mr. Bush in 1988, Mr. Tsongas names several areas where he intends to spend more money, including the Head Start program for preschoolers, merit pay for teachers, unemployment insurance and job training. He points to few places other than the military where he thinks cuts are in order. The only one he named in the interview was what he called the "populated space station," the word "manned" apparently being politically incorrect.
 
Hints at One Cut
 But unlike Mr. Bush, Mr. Tsongas does not rule out a tax increase or a cut in Social Security benefits. He said he does not intend to carry out either step, but he said a reduction in Social Security payments to wealthy pensioners might be necessary "in three or four years if I don't get a handle on the deficit."
Mr. Tsongas would also use most of the money remaining from cuts in the military budget for deficit reduction rather than for tax cuts or new programs, as would most of his competitors.
Mr. Tsongas's economic philosophy fits no particular school. It is neither Keynesian nor supply side, not liberal or conservative, not completely pro-business or pro-labor.
His main theme is that the United States is losing ground in the world economy. "The cold war is over and the Japanese won," he says at nearly every stop. The solution, he says, is for the American Government to be friendly to business, not hostile the way he says many of his fellow Democrats are.
"You can't have employment and despise employers," he said in his victory speech in Manchester Tuesday night. And then he appended the phrase that he has made his slogan: "No goose, no golden egg."
But he is friendlier to some businesses than he is to others, and the ones he favors most are in manufacturing. In his pamphlet "A Call to Economic Arms," which is the manifesto of his campaign, Mr. Tsongas wrote that the decline of America's manufacturing base was "our collective Kryptonite." He added:
"An ever less competitive manufacturing base inevitably means cataclysmic erosion of our standard of living. If we are reduced to just flipping hamburgers and exploiting our raw materials, we will have an economy, but it will be a diminished economy of decline and defeat."
Many other politicians and economists hold a similar view. But they tend to be the ones like Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader, and Jeff Faux, the economist who heads the Economic Policy Institute, who also favor trade restrictions to give American manufacturers a leg up.
Mr. Tsongas, more than any other Democratic Presidential candidate, espouses free trade and vigorously opposes protectionist measures.
His principal step to help manufacturers would be a cut in the capital gains tax for stocks and bonds but not for real estate. The rate would diminish the longer an investment was held, and an even lower rate would be available for venture capital invested in start-up companies. He would offset the cost and diminish the windfall for the wealthy by raising the top income tax rate to 34 percent or 35 percent from 31 percent.
 
Measures for Business
 He also advocates these other measures mainly to help manufacturers: an investment tax credit, a new Government office to coordinate technology, a civilian version of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to generate cutting-edge research, waivers of antitrust laws in many instances so businesses can work together on joint projects and an agency patterned after the Agriculture Extension Service to provide companies around the country access to the latest technology and management strategies.
Mainstream Democratic economists are of two minds about Mr. Tsongas's emphasis on manufacturing.
They agree with the principle that the Government should encourage creation of high value-added jobs, those in which the value of the product depends mostly on the labor and not on the materials. Computer programming, for example, fits the category; computer assembly does not. As a rule, high value-added jobs are also high-paying jobs.
But many economists dispute the idea that manufacturing jobs and high value-added jobs are necessarily one and the same. Charles L. Schultze, who was budget director in the Johnson Administration and chairman of President Jimmy Carter's Council of Economic Advisers, said he admired Mr. Tsongas in most respects but thought that such a strong emphasis on manufacturing would lead the Government to stress low-skilled jobs in failing industries. It is better, he said, to emphasize services like telecommunications and retailing where the United States already excels.
On the other hand, Benjamin M. Friedman, a prominent Harvard economist, said he had come around to the view that Mr. Tsongas might be right. Almost the only high-wage jobs for people without college educations are in manufacturing, he said, and it is important for the country to limit as much as possible the growing disparity in income between those with college degrees and those without them.
While Mr. Tsongas characterizes himself as a pro-business Democrat, he takes many stands that are at odds with business interests. For instance, he favors strong Government health, safety and environmental regulations, and he speaks out often against high executive salaries and poor business management practices.
Mr. Tsongas almost never talks in his campaign appearances about poverty or homelessness, and they are not addressed in his campaign pamphlet. Asked why, he said it was impossible in 83 pages to deal with every issue. He said he had visited a homeless shelter recently and was told by people there that what they really wanted was jobs. With an improved economy, he said, those jobs could become available.
In New Hampshire, Mr. Tsongas's philosophy seemed to sell best with the most affluent voters. A primary day poll showed that among voters with family incomes of more than $75,000 he led Governor Clinton by 45 percent to 28 percent, but among those from households with incomes between $15,000 and $30,000, Mr. Clinton led Mr. Tsongas by 28 percent to 26 percent.

HEADLINE: Massachusetts College Offers Free Classes to Unemployed

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NORTH ADAMS, Mass.

 BODY:
Chet Gallup's story begins like many others these days: For 30 years he was an electrical engineer for a General Electric plant in Pittsfield, until the day he was laid off, April 19, 1990.
But instead of polishing his resume and making the rounds of employment agencies, Mr. Gallup has been driving 80 minutes round trip two evenings a week to discuss life according to Plato and health among today's elderly. 
 The classes may not help him land a new job right away, he admits, but they do fulfill credits he needs to earn a teaching certificate. Better yet, the classes are free.
Mr. Gallup, 58 years old, is one of 70 unemployed workers with at least a high school diploma who took empty seats in evening classes this semester at North Adams State College. He showed up after officials there offered to do their part to help ease the area's high unemployment rate, which was 9 percent in December while the national average was 6.8 percent.
 
'Very Nurturing Places'
 The college said that any unemployed person in western Massachusetts could take any of its night classes at no charge as long as there were empty seats, with a maximum of four classes per person. The charge for one class is usually $270.
"Colleges are very nurturing places," said Thomas D. Aceto, president of this small liberal arts school in the Berkshires. "If something changes in their lives as a result of their participation, then we will have felt we've succeeded, even if it's just given them some confidence."
Two unemployed people with graduate business degrees, a dental assistant, a bartender and a number of teachers and other school workers are among those who have signed up for the free classes.
North Adams State Colleges is able to offer free evening classes because those scheduled after 4 P.M. do not receive state funds, which means the offer did not require approval of the Legislature, said Paul G. Marks, chancellor of higher education for the state's nine public colleges.
 
Offer by College Hailed
 Around town, the college's offer was hailed as a much-needed positive sign in the northwestern part of the state, which has yet to recover from three decades of decline in manufacturing jobs.
"It's very easy to come here and find the negatives," said Thom Swift, president of the Northern Berkshire Chamber of Commerce. "You have to live here awhile to appreciate the positives."
The college made a similar offer in 1984, but only 10 people responded. Its officials believe the changes in the economy led to the greater response.
"I think things have really changed," Mr. Aceto said. "I think people realize it isn't a case of waiting to go back to your old job, because your old job isn't going to be there."
This recession, which has been deeply felt in both white- and blue-collar ranks, is also testing the notion that a college degree can improve a person's standing in life, he said. The unemployed are not willing to dip into their savings for college, Mr. Aceto said, adding: "They see all these people out of work with college degrees and say, 'This isn't the ticket anymore.' "
Another man laid off by General Electric, who is taking two free classes toward a master's in business, said, "If you don't have any income, the cost of a credit per hour is pretty expensive."
Other students said they supported the newcomers, to a point. "I don't think it's fair, since we have to pay," said Jill Haynes, 18. "But if it's going to help these people get a job and to help themselves, then it's fine."
Mr. Gallup, the former electrical engineer, said that even if he was able to get a job only as a teacher's aide, the effort would prove worthwhile. Being laid off has, in fact, allowed him to pursue a dream of teaching. "It's a scary opportunity," said Mr. Gallup, "but an opportunity."

HEADLINE: Environmentalists Fear Favors to Builders in Trenton's Pinelands Plan

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
A 10-year policy agenda for governing the million-acre preserve drawn up by the New Jersey Pinelands Commission includes enough nods toward the concerns of builders, farmers and quarry operators to worry some environmentalists that profits may win out over preservation in the state's premiere nature reserve.
It is the first full-scale review of the Pinelands' plan since the rules to limit development and regulate industry inside the preserve were adopted in 1981. Prominent among the public comments on the new agenda were complaints from builders that too few buildings were allowed per acre, from sand and gravel operators that the allowable size and depth of their quarry holes were too limited, and from farmers that wetlands regulations were too severe. 
 The five-point agenda, reached Saturday afternoon after two days of deliberation, seems to take these arguments into account by offering a review of Pinelands regulations to see whether changes are needed to "maintain the viability" of forestry, agriculture and sand and gravel operations, which are lumped together as "resource extraction."
The new policy guidelines also undertake to "evaluate the economic impact" of Pinelands regulations on businesses and localities, a phrasing that conservation advocates read to mean a sensitivity to complaints that development restrictions depress employment and municipal revenues.
 
'Lot of Defensive Work'
 "My first reaction is that we are going to have a lot of defensive work to do," said Don Kirchoffer, a staff member of the Pinelands Preservation Alliance, the principal conservation group involved with the Pinelands. "The things that we proposed to the Commission are not among their top issues."
The Alliance had presented numerous suggestions to the board involving water quality, waste disposal and a call for more scientific evaluation on the condition of the Pinelands. But among its chief concerns was the amount of timber cutting being permitted in even the most tightly managed of the Pinelands' several management zones, the 300,000-acre Preservation Area, where man-made intrusions are most tightly controlled.
Besides deciding to examine economic impacts of regulations, the commission also decided to simplify permit applications, re-examine the way the rules reward developers who build in growth zones on the edge of the Pinelands and review policies on solid-waste disposal in the preserve.
The commission can see the pressure to dig, build, cut and quarry within the Pinelands boundaries in other ways than in the pleas from industry leaders. The number of violations of Pinelands rules has been rising sharply, from 53 recorded in 1956 to 162 in 1990, the last year for which complete figures have been published.
 
Fewer Violations Settled
 As the number of broken rules has increased, so has the difficulty of resolving them: 81 percent of the 1986 violations have been resolved, while just 36 percent of the violations in 1990 have been settled.
The Pinelands Commission has asked the state for more power to enforce its rules, but a measure that would give it injunctive power against violators was lost in the frenzy over tax repeal during the last session of the Legislature. Richard J. Sullivan, a banker from Hamilton Square who is chairman of the commission, said he expected the law to pass in the current session.
In an interview during the meeting, Mr. Sullivan said no interest should regard the agenda as a blueprint, but as a focus for discussion.
"The five areas that we propose are designed to be sufficiently broad to address a range of issues," he said. "We're not trying to get down to the level where we say, 'This distance has to be three and a half feet instead of three.' We think the present plan works quite well, but we think we can do it better."
 
Critics Say 'Closed Shop'
 In deciding to simplify and clarify the often time-consuming business of getting permits to make changes in homes or businesses inside the Pinelands, the commission may be responding to several complaints, published in a volume of public comment, that the current system discouraged outside participation.
The New Jersey Builders Association accused the commission of operating like a "closed shop," impervious to suggestion. An anonymous critic was more blunt. "You are viewed as a supercilious bureaucracy which applies standards in knee-jerk fashion, even when they do not make sense," the critic wrote. "I think compliance with your goals would be more easily achieved if you weren't so highhanded about it."
The New Jersey Pinelands is a state and Federal preserve of inland forests, rivers, cedar swamps and other wetlands. The Pinelands Commission manages 927,000 acres, but when federally protected coastal lands are included, the total protected region, called the Pinelands National Reserve, covers 1.1 million acres.
Less than a third of the state-managed land, or 297,000 acres, is state-owned, however. Balancing the interests of the owners of the rest of the land inside the Pinelands occupies most of the commission's and its staff's time. Simply put, the Pinelands management plan designates areas inside the preserve by the level of protection, from little development and commercial use to so-called Regional Growth Areas, where housing and development are encouraged.
 
Selling Development Rights
 Owners of land in the most protected areas can sell development bonuses to builders in growth areas, which are concentrated in the townships of Medford, Evesham and Hamilton. The bonuses allow builders to put more houses on a piece of land in a growth area than would normally be allowed. They are intended to help compensate landowners in protected areas for the loss of their own development rights.
Such esoterica of land managment may become familiar concepts to the rest of New Jersey this summer, when the new state plan is published. Like a Pinelands system written on a statewide scale, the state plan is expected to classify the whole state into four or five land-use categories, from farmland to high-density urban development areas.
Once the plan is in place, if present thinking holds, the state will then use its power to regulate roads, sewers, utilities and the like to steer development into urban and suburban districts, and away from open space.

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
Where Government Sits: Leaders and Geography

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
ONE problem with moving the "nerve center" of New York City government to Brooklyn Borough Hall, as Mayor David N. Dinkins is doing today, is that the largely symbolic shift raises an embarrassing question: Where has the nerve center been until now?
Obviously, the center part was never in doubt. What government at all levels often lacks is nerve. 
 That general lack of bravado does not diminish Mr. Dinkins's gesture to disaffected New Yorkers, which he announced in January during his State of the City speech. Peter J. Johnson Jr., a mayoral adviser who conceived the strategy of bringing Mr. Dinkins closer to his constituents, acknowledged that just delivering the speech someplace other than City Hall might have smacked of gimmickry but argued that bivouacking in another borough for a week could be another story. (A predecessor, Fiorello H. La Guardia, regularly summered outside Manhattan and conducted city business on a bluff.)
Merely moving the government, though, is not what advocates of "Reinventing Government" (Addison-Wesley), as the book by consultants David Osborne and Ted Gaebler is called, have in mind. Their goal is to move the public and its representatives to acknowledge the limits of government and to redefine its role. What distinguishes their vision is that it is largely nonpartisan and nonideological. They believe in government but say its value is diminished when it strives to be all things to all voters.
"It is not surprising that Mayor Dinkins and Governor Cuomo find it hard to come to grips with economic reality," said Stephen Berger, former executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, because doing so, he said, would violate two political tenets: that no problem is regarded as outside city government's purview and that the government is less committed to delivering services to citizens than to "dispensing benefits to its service providers."
Mr. Berger elaborates in a provocative article, "Reconstructing New York," in The City Journal, published by the Manhattan Institute, a research group that unabashedly opposes bloated government. He describes Medicaid as a perverse form of city financial aid to the state since the city pays one-fourth of the cost of programs mandated by Albany. He asks whether municipal employees need both collective-bargaining rights and Civil Service guarantees. And he maintains that New Yorkers care more about how services are delivered than by whom.
"New York's elected leaders automatically equate public service with free, or at least massively subsidized, service," Mr. Berger writes. "But a government that would rather let its bridges rot than impose tolls on them, would rather cripple the Staten Island ferry than raise fares, would rather gut New York Technical College than raise tuition for CUNY graduate students, is not demonstrating its commitment to social justice -- only its stupidity."
The government's failure to extract specific productivity improvements from sanitation workers before granting them raises and City Hall's historic reluctance to alter the property-tax formula that subsidizes middle-class homeowners represent other political judgments that may fall into the same category.
If the book by Mr. Osborne and Mr. Gaebler is being embraced by customers of municipal services as a bible of entrepreneurial government, its premises are shared by some converts within the bureaucracy, too.
The book never mentions Mr. Dinkins by name but cites the city's progress in community policing and in sanitation vehicle repair. Also cited are Connecticut's voucher program for child care, Newark's competition to provide public services and New Jersey's policies to prevent homelessness.
If a revised edition is published, Mr. Dinkins's frustrated director of operations, Harvey Robins, deserves at least a footnote for his tireless efforts to make government more efficient. So does the Mayor's Commission on Homelessness, headed by Andrew M. Cuomo, whose report embodies a number of inventive approaches, couched in the jargon of policy reform ("results rather than process should be rewarded," it suggests).
"We will not solve our problems by spending more or spending less, by creating new public bureaucracies or by 'privatizing' existing bureaucracies," warns Mr. Osborne, who is to participate in a forum on Wednesday run by Andrew J. Stein, the New York City Council President, who is managing to privatize the issue of reinventing the government that most other city officials are too busy running or moving.
Mr. Stein said on Friday that he had not yet finished reading the book but shared much of its philosophy, except for Mr. Osborne's preference for strict limits on campaign contributions and spending as one way to endow elected officials with the political independence required for reform.
"Nothing is more important than leadership," Mr. Osborne writes, which means that where the seat of government is situated is less important than where its head is.

HEADLINE: Slump Hits Japanese Electronics

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
With consumer electronics sales in a slump and technological shifts complicating the computer chip industry, several of Japan's electronics giants are predicting sharply lower profits.
The Sony Corporation, which has come to symbolize Japan's ascendance in consumer electronics, said recently that its Japanese operation would suffer its first yearly operating loss ever. 
 The problems largely stem from a weakening of the Japanese economy and economic slumps in Europe and in the United States, where Sony, for example, derives more than a quarter of its sales. Other companies in Japan, ranging from the auto maker Nissan Motor to Nippon Steel, are also feeling the pinch.
 
Special Impact on Electronics
 But some analysts say several deep-seated problems could plague the Japanese electronics companies for years.
Among the problems are the slowing sales of some consumer electronics products, like VCR's and compact disk players, and the lack of new hit products to take their place.
In addition, computer users are now favoring smaller machines like personal computers, posing a threat to Japanese companies that have specialized in larger machines. And the Japanese specialty of producing computer memory chips, which once seemed a brilliant path to dominance in semiconductors, is requiring ever more expensive factories, making profits harder to earn.
 
Long-Term 'Structural Problems'
 "They'll come out of the economic cycle, of course, but they'll still have the structural problems," said Darrel E. Whitten, director of Japanese research for Prudential Securities in Tokyo. "The growth rates they've had in the 80's are not going to be repeatable in the foreseeable future."
With trade tensions between Japan and the United States near a fever pitch, Americans might find an opportunity for gloating in the troubles of the companies that essentially drove United States manufacturers out of televisions and memory chips. But problems in Japan can also hurt Americans.
Toshiba America recently announced layoffs in Southern California, where it makes laptop computers. Hitachi is planning to close a California factory involved in making projection television sets.
Japanese companies still see growth in the electronics business once the slump ends, and say they have lived through downturns before. They suffered a double blow in the mid-1980's, when the electronics industry slowed and the yen was sharply strengthened, making Japanese exports more expensive. But by and large, the companies adjusted and resumed their growth.
"Over the long term, we are not going to change our strategy," said Masaki Mikura, a spokesman in Tokyo for the Toshiba Corporation, which on Thursday sharply revised its earnings forecast for the fiscal year that ends in March. The company now expects worldwide net income to plummet 67 percent, compared with a previous forecast of a 26 percent decline.
A number of factors are contributing to the problems of the electronics companies. The Japanese economy began to weaken in the last two years after a speculative bubble burst and real estate and stock prices dropped. Now the pain is spreading to the manufacturing sector much faster than had been anticipated. In response, makers of chips, computers and automobiles are cutting back their planned capital spending for next year, which in turn will hurt makers of large machinery.
 
Weaknesses in Three Areas
 Some officials and analysts say the Japanese economy will weaken more before it recovers. In announcing its latest earnings, Sony said its business environment "is expected to become more severe" in part because prospects for economic recovery in Japan were "unclear."
For the electronics companies in particular, there have been weaknesses in three areas -- computers, semiconductors and consumer electronics. Usually, executives say, strength in one of these businesses had offset weakness in another. This time, "all are bad," said Manabu Kuwae, an official at Hitachi America in Tarrytown, N.Y.
In semiconductors, Japanese companies have focused heavily on the biggest-selling chip, the dynamic random access memory. They have invested huge amounts in factories to make the latest generation of memory chip, which can hold four million bits of information. But demand has been slow to materialize, making it hard to pay for those factories.
"The price is going down and sales have not grown as we expected," said Yuri Momomoto, a spokeswoman for Fujitsu Ltd. in Tokyo. Largely because of the semiconductor problems, Fujitsu now expects net income for the parent company to decline nearly 60 percent in the current fiscal year.
Demand can pick up, of course. But experts say that each new generation of chips requires a more expensive factory, making it more difficult to make a profit in the memory chip business. Meanwhile, Japanese chip producers have not advanced that rapidly into more profitable areas like microprocessors, the central operating device of computers.
And Japanese companies, which have dominated the memory chip market, are seeing new competition. Samsung, a South Korean company, has emerged from obscurity to become one of the two largest memory-chip producers in the world and is the first to start selling the next-generation 16-million-bit chip.
Japanese companies might also end up on the wrong side of the technology trends in computers.
Joichi Aoi, the president of Toshiba, has been known to say, "Unless Mr. Akers laughs, we can't laugh either." The statement refers to John F. Akers, the chairman of the International Business Machines Corporation, and is meant to suggest that Toshiba sees its fate tied to the computer industry.
But it also reflects the high esteem in which I.B.M. has traditionally been held in Japan. For decades, Japanese computer companies, particularly Fujitsu and Hitachi, have been pursuing I.B.M.'s business of selling large mainframe computers.
 
Trend Toward Downsizing
 But now, I.B.M. is suffering from a shift away from mainframes to smaller machines, like personal computers and work stations, which have lower profit margins. In Japan, this trend toward downsizing has been slower to happen. But when it does, it will put more pressure on Japanese computer companies, said Mr. Whitten, the Prudential analyst.
Similarly in supercomputers, Fujitsu, Hitachi and NEC have been avidly pursuing Cray Research Inc. by building machines with a single or a few very powerful processors. But just as the Japanese companies seem to be gaining on Cray, the whole supercomputer business appears on the brink of shifting toward machines based on thousands of less powerful processors.
The Japanese companies do make smaller computers but have not been able to repeat in personal computers or engineering work stations the success they had in televisions or automobiles.
 
No Hits in Consumer Products
 In consumer electronics, a big problem is a lack of new hit products. Through the late 1970's and 80's, growth was fueled by a succession of gadgets -- the video cassette recorder, the Walkman, the compact disk player and, more recently, the camcorder.
Now there is no clear growth leader in sight. High-definition television, once seen as the great hope, now looks as if it will not develop until late in the decade. Digital audio recording, either on tape or recordable compact disk, could catch on, but the market growth could be slowed by the presence of competing formats.
Still, something is likely to emerge eventually. The combination of computers and consumer electronics is opening new possibilities, like devices that allow consumers to control video images by computer.
 
Longer-Term Prospects
 Japanese companies will play a leading role in these areas, although American companies, by dint of their expertise in computers, might be able to jump back into consumer electronics. Apple Computer Inc., for instance, is working with several Japanese companies to develop video computers and "personal digital assistants," which are pocket-size gadgets that store and transmit information.
And Japanese companies have been diversifying, as is most evident in Sony's purchase of an American record company and movie studio in the last few years.
Rodney Harada, an analyst who follows Japanese consumer electronics companies for Merrill Lynch, said the companies had deep pockets and would outlive the slump. "Long term, I'm very positive on these companies," he added.

HEADLINE: Behind Foreclosed Doors;
Troubled Family Strives to Stay Together

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO

DATELINE: HUNTINGTON STATION, L.I., Feb. 21

 BODY:
Since Theodore Stemberg's death in 1979, the lives of his three emotionally disabled children have gone mostly untended, and, like the trees in the overgrown garden behind their house, now weave inextricably one into the other.
The home Mr. Stemberg built to shelter Rita, 64 years old, Teddy, 59, and Karen, 38, has been seized by Suffolk County for back taxes. Potential buyers wander over the property and through its doors now, terrifying the Stembergs with the prospect that for the first time in their lives, they may be separated. 
 "They're in their own little world behind those doors," said Jimmy Madden, owner of Madden's Auto Body Shop in Hicksville, where Teddy Stemberg has worked cleaning cars since the late 1950's. "If you take any one of them out of there, they would be lost."
Should the home be auctioned and the family forced out, it would cost taxpayers roughly $50,000 a year to shelter the Stembergs -- almost two and a half times the $21,000 they owe in taxes, 12 times what they now pay the county in rent. And likely as not, they would end up living in another foreclosed house, transformed into a county shelter for the homeless.
The tale of the Stembergs' descent from the security their parents tried to assure to desperation involves the failure of Suffolk County agencies to notice the reclusive siblings until 1986, after they had fallen so far behind in their taxes that losing their home became all but certain. It raises questions about a foreclosure process that, once begun, seems almost impossible to halt, despite the best intentions of public officials. It also raises the question of how far helpless adults must fall before the sound echoes through the corridors of welfare agencies.
Had the Social Services Department stepped in sooner, or the Suffolk County Real Estate Department been more flexible later, the money the county provides the Stembergs to enable them to care for themselves could have gone for property taxes of about $4,000 a year to avoid foreclosure. Instead, the home now belongs to the county and the Stembergs pay the county that amount for "reasonable use and occupancy" and live under the threat of homelessness.
 
'Paying More Money'
 "It's not productive for government to be throwing people out on the streets, splitting up a family and then paying more money to put them in shelters," said James F. Gaughran, a Democratic county legislator from Huntington. "The government shouldn't be participating in this recession by making the homeless problem worse than it is."
Each fall for the last two years, Mr. Gaughran has called county officials and managed to rescue the house from the auction block. A lawyer, he once convened a super-meeting about the Stembergs, inviting representatives of public and private agencies and friends of the family, and came away with a dizzying picture of government agencies working at cross purposes.
Margaret O'Regan, deputy commissioner of Suffolk's Social Services Department, said her agency tried unsuccessfully to get the Real Estate Department to reinstate the right to redeem the Stembergs' tax lien, which had expired in December 1986. "We thought maybe the neighbors could get together to pay it off," she said.
Ms. O'Regan said the department feared that separating the siblings could be devastating. "They're emotionally very closely connected," she said. She said the agency did not step in before 1986 because nobody had sought help. "We don't have any ability to go out and find out who's in trouble, unless we have some basis for making an inquiry into somebody's private life," she said.
 
A Promise to a Mother
 At the meeting arranged by Mr. Gaughran, Jimmy Madden offered to pay the back taxes, but the Real Estate Department said it was too late for that.
Mr. Madden and his brother Mickey were driven to help in part by their feelings for Teddy Stemberg, who has been a faithful employee, and in part by a promise their father made to the Stembergs' mother, Muriel, he said. Before she died of cancer in 1973, she asked Mr. Madden's father to take care of Teddy. "That was her last request, and we've been trying to honor it ever since," Mr. Madden said.
Roy Dragotta, acting director of the County Real Estate Department, said the department did not have much leeway to reinstate the right of redemption under state law.
Doing so "would open the floodgates to a lot of problems," he said, adding that his department had "bent over backwards to do the right thing" by postponing the auction each year.
"We don't want to displace anybody," he said. "At the same time we have an obligation to follow the law and put the property back on the tax rolls."
When the property was first put up for auction in 1990, the minimum price was $65,000. Similar houses for sale on the block now, but in better repair, are priced between $120,000 to $180,000.
With the election of a new County Executive, Robert J. Gaffney, who has pledged to speed up the return of properties to the tax rolls, friends of the Stembergs have been told the house may have won its last reprieve.
 
On Her Knees for a Job
 Neighbors have been unusually helpful, seeing beyond the eyesore to the people struggling inside. Some apologize for not being able to buy the property for the Stembergs.
"I would not want to uproot these people," explained Rochelle Maucher, an advertising copywriter and next-door neighbor. "I would rather have them there, harmless, good people, than a multiple-family dwelling of transients."
Mrs. Maucher knows only Karen Stemberg, the youngest and most lucid sister, who strains to hold the family together.
Karen Stemberg daily checks the windows of the fast-food restaurants near her home for work. Last December, she said, she was hired by the assistant manager of one, and then later turned down by the top manager. She is a proud, independent woman, but is thinking of returning to ask again for the job.
"Maybe that lady will reconsider," she said. "I'll get down on my knees."
 
A Day at a Time
 Once the county put the property up for auction, it ordered repairs to the house, paid for by the Real Estate Department. Still, the house has many problems. The roof leaks, spreading black stains. When it rained here last week, Karen Stemberg lay unable to sleep, listening to the water drip in yet another new corner. "It was going kerplunk, kerplunk. If I was a nervous person, I would have been screaming," she said.
Together, the siblings just make it through life's daily demands. Rita Stemberg, who believes she narrowly escapes assassination each time she walks to the corner, seldom ventures outside, but cooks for the family. Karen goes to the grocery each day, since there is no electricity to run the refrigerator. Teddy works part time and pays for the groceries. They pool their earnings and stipends to pay the rent and expenses.
Inside the house, darkness and disarray obscure the knotty pine paneling and scalloped cornices, along with other touches their father, a carpenter, built into the house. "He was a lovely man, very gifted with his hands," Rita recalled.
As she spoke, a family of squirrels darted across the eaves, the sudden rumble of their stampede through the ceiling filling the kitchen. The sisters shouted at them to go away, as Rita struck the ceiling with a broomstick.
Because there is no electricity in most of the rooms, the family uses candles and flashlights to see at night, but mostly, they turn in early.
Rita Stemberg hears her private demons then, strangers outside whispering about burning down the house. And Karen Stemberg wonders how long and how else the three of them can hang on.

HEADLINE: V.A. Raising Mortgage Rate

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 23

 BODY:
Higher interest rates on home mortgages from the Department of Veterans Affairs take effect Monday.
The department raised the rate to 8.5 percent from 8 percent on Friday because of what it said were recent increases in interest rates in the credit markets. 
 V.A. rates on loans for home improvements and manufactured homes, like mobile homes, will also rise by half of a percentage point, the department said.
V.A. loan guarantees help veterans buy homes with little or no down payment. The V.A. rate is considered a reliable gauge of the home mortgage market.

HEADLINE: Brooklyn Businesses Are Aiding Academy

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN

 BODY:
While arts organizations throughout the country struggle to find ways to replace revenues lost in government cutbacks, a group of corporations in Brooklyn will announce today the establishment of a fund to contribute a total of $1.5 million over three years to the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
The announcement of the Metrotech Downtown Fund is to be made by Robert B. Catell, the president of Brooklyn Union Gas, at a lunch attended by Brooklyn community leaders and Mayor David N. Dinkins on the first day of his temporary moving of City Hall to Brooklyn. 
 All the corporations in the group are located in Metrotech, a campus-like office center on a 16-acre site adjoining Polytechnic University that is one of the largest such projects in New York. Four office buildings in the complex are now complete, a fifth is in an advanced state of construction and two or three more buildings are planned.
 
Specialness of the Support
 "What is new and different about the fund, and what may set a precedent in arts fund-raising," said Karen Brooks Hopkins, executive vice president of the academy, "is that it combines sponsorship such as you can get on TV, direct philanthropy like extending complimentary tickets to needy children and families in the community, and employee benefits like discount tickets, shuttle bus service, restaurant packages and on-site performances."
"Many types of business support for the arts provide one or another of these incentives, but not necessarily all three together," she continued.
Speaking in an interview over the weekend, Mr. Catell said that his company had joined the consortium because the academy "is good for the quality of life in Brooklyn."
"For us," he continued, "it's a matter of enlightened self-interest to help provide the amenities that will attract businesses and people to this community. The payoff of community development is more customers."
 
Reasons for Involvement
 Asked if he had any regrets about losing the spotlight his company enjoyed when individually sponsoring events at the Brooklyn Academy in previous years, Mr. Catell said he had none. "Our corporate philosophy has been to have business collaborate on efforts like this," he said. "We try to be a catalyst."
Bruce Ratner, president of the Forest City Ratner Company, which developed the project and is also a tenant, said: "Just as Manhattan has been a magnet for the arts, and that led to its economic development, so goes the economic development of Brooklyn."
Sponsors of the Metrotech Downtown Fund also include Chase Manhattan Bank, the Consolidated Edison Company, Morgan Stanley & Company, the New York Telephone Company and the Securities Industries Automation Corporation.

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
Is Seattle Major League? Film at 11

BYLINE: By Claire Smith

 BODY:
It is major league baseball's owners who must decide whether or not to approve Nintendo's $100 million-plus offer to purchase the Seattle Mariners. But it is Seattle that really must make the ultimate decision: whether it has the wherewithal and the will to save the franchise for the Pacific Northwest.
Guaranteed, the first is the more intriguing drama for Americans. Should baseball let Japanese interests, or any other non-North American interests, for that matter, buy a part of the American pastime? It is an emotional question being played out against a larger, more volatile issue as baseball remains an unwitting and unwilling player in the current United States-Japan trade imbroglio. 
 But just because baseball is still digging out from that fallout and ruing the timing of what started out as a simple franchise transfer, it does not mean it has lost sight of the other dilemma: Can and will Seattle prove once and for all that it can support a major league franchise?
It won't make any sense to throw good money after bad -- whether it's dollars or yen -- if the root problems that have helped doom the current Seattle ownership are not fixed, not just for this season, but for the next 3, 5, 10 or 20 seasons.
That community is trying mightily to insure that the problems can be fixed for the long term because of other, more immediate threats from the East. As Washington Gov. Booth Gardner recently said: "The only foreign investor I'm concerned about is Tampa Bay."
Proving Seattle's worth will be difficult; the Mariners are situated in one of the game's smallest markets, with one of the game's smallest sources of revenue. Two months away from a new season, the Mariners remain the only major league team without a local television deal.
So, even in light of Seattle's best intentions, baseball owners cannot be faulted if they remain skeptical. They cannot be faulted if they remind observers that not one, but two Seattle franchises have ended up on the rocks, that first the owners of the Pilots and now the Mariners arrived at the same conclusion: There is no financial windfall for them in the city.
The major league owners cannot want the next owners of the Mariners, whether American, Japanese or whatever, sitting in Seattle a few years lamenting -- in much the way the team's current owner, Jeff Smulyan, is -- that their economic survival now may hinge on either getting out of the game or getting the Mariners out of Seattle.
Washington State knows those sentiments and knows that it has a finite amount of time to provide the evidence that a team can make it in Seattle. For even though Fay Vincent, the commissioner of baseball, has guaranteed that the Mariners will play in Seattle in 1992, no promises have been made beyond that, something Vincent reiterated last Wednesday when asked if he believed the team would stay indefinitely.
"I'd rather speak in terms of what our objective is, and our objective is to keep the Seattle team in Seattle," Vincent said. "But we need help from the community, support from the business community. That is very important because the community ultimately decides whether baseball goes or whether baseball stays."
That was precisely the message that Vincent carried to Capitol Hill last week, when he met with Washington State's congressional delegation. They talked about the $100 million offer by Nintendo, but also about economic realities. The same realities that communities from Cleveland to Montreal have heard from Vincent as he states and restates the three requirements to justify a team's relocation: lack of community support, inability to turn the situation around financially or lack of a major league caliber stadium.
So Vincent and Steve Greenberg, the deputy commissioner, talked about what is needed from the Seattle business community, about the efforts of Herman Sarkowsky, a former owner of the National Football League's Seattle Seahawks and a co-founder of the National Basketball Association's Portland Trail Blazers, to have the community increase the Mariners' advertising, television and ticket revenue by a total of $13 million a year for the next three years.
Sarkowsky and Seattle officials forwarded details of such a plan to major league baseball the first week of February. But Vincent said Wednesday that "we told the members of Congress that we felt the $13 million commitment is not as firm as we would like."
So, the ball is definitely back in the hands of those business people and civic leaders. They have to prove they can win at this major league game, either with or without the financial infusion from Nintendo. Even the politicians acknowledge that.
"They want to keep the team in Seattle. We know that," Brock Adams, a Democrat and the state's senior United States Senator, said of Vincent and Greenberg. "That's where they start from. Then, whether an offer can be structured that will keep it there, that's the question."

HEADLINE: The Human Peace Dividend

 BODY:
Large cuts in the defense budget threaten to dump hundreds of thousands of demobilized veterans on a soft job market, raising fears of social and economic distress. But creative ideas now circulating in Washington could turn that potential problem into a rewarding opportunity.
Defense Department officials recently predicted the discharge of one million military and civilian personnel by 1996. Yet the United States has produced only 20,000 new jobs in the last three years. Even a recovering economy may find it hard to absorb the human military surplus. 
 Adam Walinsky, a New York attorney, therefore proposed recently in a Times Op-Ed article that Washington keep the military men and women on Federal payrolls but assign them to meet urgent needs of American cities.
With only minimal additional training, he pointed out, many could effectively augment police departments struggling to control violent neighborhoods. Those with medical corps training could put their skills to work in beleaguered city hospital emergency rooms.
Noncommissioned officers and training specialists could bring discipline as well as teaching skills to chaotic city high schools. And former military instructors have the math and science expertise necessary for a competitive work force. The large proportion of blacks and Hispanics now in the ranks constitutes an invaluable pool of role models.
Senator Sam Nunn also sees the potential. He believes those with the most to offer may now be approaching the end of 20-year military careers. He suggests an early retirement program that would offer partial pension payments after 15 years of service, with an increase earned for post-military employment in education, health care, law enforcement and other "critical" work. Washington would also provide retraining for such employment.
In a recent speech, Senator Nunn pointed out that defense downsizing results directly from victory in the cold war. "These people are not losing their jobs because they failed -- they are losing their jobs because they won. The nation owes all of them . . . more than just a simple 'thank you' for a job well done."
Now more than ever the nation needs their help at home. However Washington works out the details, it dare not squander so useful a resource.

BLACKBURNE RESIGNS FROM M.T.A. BOARD
Laura D. Blackburne, who resigned under fire as chairwoman of New York City's Housing Authority on Saturday, has also quit as a member of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board, where her spending habits had also come under criticism. Ms. Blackburne's lawyer declined to give her client's reasons for leaving the 17-member board she has served since 1985. Her proposed successor has been waiting in the wings for over a year. B3.
 
SCANDALS THAT HIT MAYOR'S SORE POINTS
Any mayor might have been duped by the financial behavior that culminated in a guilty plea by David N. Dinkins's campaign finance chairman two weeks ago and in the resignation under fire of his Housing Authority chairwoman over the weekend. But the scandals transcend the inevitable human failings that torment every administration because they revive two issues from which Mr. Dinkins seems unable to escape: lapses in personal finances and questions of race. News analysis, B3.
 
YES, HE'S BROOKLYN'S MAYOR, TOO
Mayor Dinkins is set to move into his transplanted office at in Brooklyn Borough Hall, in a week-long attempt to get closer to a borough that sometimes feels far from the city's halls of power in Manhattan. It was probably inevitable that the move has presented his aides with some logistical problems -- along with skepticism from the people he hopes to meet. B3.

With the Dinkins administration moving the "nerve center" of city government to Brooklyn this week, the question arises: Where has the nerve center been up to now? Metro Matters, B2.
 
TWO HOUSE PARTIES END IN GUNFIRE
The host at a Brooklyn party turned away a group of teen-age boys after frisking them for guns. The boys retaliated by firing through the door, wounding two girls at the Canarsie apartment. And in Flatbush, a 15-year-old boy was killed and another grazed when gunfire erupted outside a birthday party as 100 young people spilled out on the streets to go home. B2.
 
CARDINAL DENOUNCES RACISM IN CHURCH
Speaking on the last full weekend of Black History Month, John Cardinal O'Connor delivered a homily that amounted to a chastisement of all white Roman Catholics, including himself. He told an almost entirely white congregation at St. Patrick's Cathedral that he was disappointed to see empty pews "on the one Sunday I'd like to have the greatest attendance," and then delivered a bitter message about racism among churchgoers, black and white.

GOVERNING THE PINELANDS
A 10-year policy agenda for governing the million-acre preserve drawn up by the New Jersey Pinelands Commission includes enough nods toward the concerns of builders, farmers and quarry operators to worry some environmentalists that profits may win out over preservation in the state's premiere nature reserve. It is the first full-scale review of the Pinelands' plan since rules to limit development and regulate industry in the preserve were adopted in 1981. B5.
 
D'AMATO SEEKS TO PAY LEGAL BILLS
Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato plans to begin a fund-raising drive to pay off more than $400,000 in legal bills for his defense in the Senate on charges of ethical misconduct. He said he cannot afford the bill himself, and cannot spare his regular campaign money because he faces a tough fight for re-election. "I can't afford to personally pay it, so I have to depend on the generosity of others," he said. The Senator has already sold more than 200 tickets to a $1,000-a-plate fund-raiser tonight in New York City. B5.

There were no tiny commuter cars at the 18th Annual Spring Train Meet in Old Greenwich (51 mintutes by express from Grand Central, 59 on the local).

G.M. Picks 12 Plants to Be Shut As It Reports a Record U.S. Loss

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 24

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation announced today the first stage of its plan to close 21 plants over several years, identifying 12 plants to be closed in the United States and Canada within three years, affecting 16,300 workers. It also detailed a sweeping reorganization of its troubled North American operations.
The company, the world's largest auto maker, had announced in December that it would begin to overhaul its operations to restore its profitability. Its reorganization plan represents an attempt to unscramble a previous restructuring in the 1980's, which had sought to increase efficiency and reduce costs, with mixed success. 
 G.M. also said today that it posted a $4.45 billion loss for 1991 -- the largest loss for any American company ever. The loss reflected a one-time $2.8 billion charge against its income to cover the expense of the plant closings. The company, the nation's largest manufacturer, is trying to adjust to its declining share of the United States car market, a corporate structure too big for its sales and a miasma of costly labor contracts and supplier agreements.
Robert C. Stempel, G.M.'s chairman, cited current events worldwide and the unusually deep automotive slump in the United States as important reasons for G.M.'s woes. "The rate of change during the past year was unprecedented," he said. "And no one was immune to the extraordinary events which affected our lives and the way in which we do business."
Mr. Stempel's speech was broadcast live over closed-circuit television to most of G.M.'s 780,000 workers worldwide, many of whom feared for their jobs. More than 3,400 workers at G.M.'s North Tarrytown, N.Y., assembly plant, which makes mini-vans, and more than 4,000 workers at the Willow Run assembly plant in Ypsilanti Township, Mich., near Ann Arbor, learned that they would be among those looking for work by 1995.
But 3,800 workers at an assembly plant in Arlington, Tex., near Fort Worth, sighed with relief when Mr. Stempel said their jobs were safe.
Among the bigger closings will be an engine-assembly plant in Flint, Mich. It employs 4,036 workers who make eight-cylinder engines.
The closings in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana underscore the disproportionate impact the auto industry has on the economy and social fabric of the Midwest. And one of the G.M. closings highlights a trend that has been particularly irksome for the United Automobile Workers union: diesel engine production will be transferred from a plant in Moraine, Ohio, which will be closed, to Toluca, Mexico. The move will eliminate the jobs of 549 union members.
Mr. Stempel, noting that union workers under the current contract are paid whether they work or not through the fall of 1993, declined to say specifically why Willow Run was chosen for closing and Arlington was saved. Both plants make full-sized rear-wheel-drive cars like the Chevrolet Caprice.
"The timing of our actions and the income-security provisions provided for employees will lessen the immediate impact on families and communities," Mr. Stempel said. In answer to a question, he said he had notified President Bush in advance of G.M.'s actions.
By 1995, when the current wave of consolidations is complete, G.M. is likely to employ 71,000 white-collar and about 250,000 union workers, or roughly half the number employed in 1985, Mr. Stempel said. Mr. Stempel did not specify how many white-collar jobs would be affected by the actions announced today; of the 74,000 people that G.M. expects to lay off as it closes all 21 plants, about 20,000 will be white-collar workers.
G.M. said it would try to eliminate jobs through retirements and attrition, but it did not rule out dismissals.
 
Spreading the Pain
 G.M. is taking some important symbolic steps to show that it is trying to spread the pain to executives. For example, the auto maker confirmed today that it had trimmed a special executive pension that pays Roger B. Smith, its former chairman, more than $1.1 million a year.
The revised pension plan, which also affects 100 G.M. executives who have retired since 1990, would mean an annual payment to Mr. Smith of slightly less than $1 million. G.M. said it would save $14 million annually from the revisions.
Not all G.M. hourly workers affected by the latest shutdown announcements will lose their jobs. Some may move to other plants as part of consolidated operations, others will be able to "bump" less senior workers from their jobs under union seniority rules.
 
Earlier Reorganization
 G.M.'s cutbacks have clearly been shaped by recent worldwide economic events, including President Bush's trip to Japan in early January. The automotive industry's efforts to reduce Japanese competition through Mr. Bush's intervention has yielded no more than token results. "We're not getting help from the Government and we're not getting restrictions" on imports, Mr. Stempel said.
With more cuts to come, Mr. Stempel's program promises to continue a climate of anticipation and suspense among G.M.'s white-collar and union workers. Since December, when he first disclosed that G.M. would be closing plants and shedding jobs, employees have been waiting for more specifics.
But other questions were raised as he identified a new management for North American auto-making that essentially replaces the structure announced in 1984 by Mr. Smith. The earlier restructuring, which created three "supergroups," was designed to reshape G.M. so it could take on all comers by the 21st century. Clearly, G.M. has experienced deep pain and dislocation in recent years as it has struggled to stanch losses and market-share erosion and to live up to Mr. Smith's vision. Mr. Smith retired in 1990.
The new structure will be organized around "platform teams," Mr. Stempel said, focused on the manufacturing of similar-sized vehicles. One platform team, for example, will represent all small front-wheel-drive cars, like the Pontiac Sunbird, Chevrolet Corsica, Oldsmobile Achieva and others. The G.M. brand names -- Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Chevrolet, Buick, Cadillac, GMC Truck and Saturn -- will remain as sales and marketing divisions.
 
'List Is Endless'
 Supervising all the platform teams, which encompass engineering, manufacturing and component plants, will be a group of executives called the North American Operations Strategy Board. This group will comprise the manufacturing executives who once ran the supergroups. Staffs and engineering groups deemed redundant will be merged with one another. That is likely to mean the elimination of thousands of white-collar jobs.
Lloyd E. Reuss, G.M.'s president, will run the North American operations. "Lloyd's my man," Mr. Stempel told reporters. Mr. Reuss's job had been rumored to be in jeopardy in recent months, but Mr. Stempel has taken pains to emphasize that he supports the G.M. president.
Mr. Stempel said G.M., in deliberating whether to close the plants in Arlington, Tex., or Ypsilanti, Mich., took into account their overall efficiency, the flexibility of local union work rules, the number of defects in the cars and other cost factors. "The list is endless," he said. He denied accusations by the U.A.W. that G.M. was trying to "whipsaw" plants -- that is, to pit one against another, threatening to close factories that do not lower their costs enough. He also denied playing communities against one another in an attempt to receive tax breaks, although communities including Arlington, whose plant was saved, offered abatements.
G.M. workers at Arlington also voted recently for three-shift production, with output continuing nearly around the clock, which could raise the plant's efficiency when G.M. consolidates production of Caprices and Buick Roadmasters there. Workers at the Willow Run plant studied three-shift production but concluded that it was inefficient.
As expected, the union blasted G.M., as it has each time since 1986 when the auto maker announced layoffs and shutdowns. Owen Bieber, the U.A.W. president, portrayed G.M.'s action as "obedience to Wall Street priorities and Reagan-Bush trade and economic policies."
Mr. Bieber specifically accused Mr. Stempel of whipsawing. As proof, he accused G.M. of forcing a contract on workers at its Moraine truck assembly plant that included concessions on wages, health care, overtime and vacations. The Moraine workers belong to the International Union of Electrical workers, and their plant is one that is in danger of being closed in further consolidations.
In December, G.M. identified two engine plants in Lansing, Mich., that would close. The other plants announced today include a Saginaw, Mich., foundry with 600 workers, scheduled to close in 1994; a V-6 engine line in St. Catharines, Ontario, with 165 workers, to be closed in 1992, although other engines will continue in production, and two Detroit gear and axle plants with a total of 435 workers, one to close in 1992, the second in 1993.
In addition, the closings include a chassis plant in Dayton, Ohio, with 249 workers, to be shut in 1992; a G.M. horn plant in Anderson, Ind., 375 workers, to close in 1992; a casting plant in St. Catharines, Ontario, with 2,150 workers, to close in 1995, and a Lordstown, Ohio, die plant, with 279 workers, to close in 1992.
G.M. also said it was "pursing the sale of operations at the Danville, Ill., foundry" that makes brakes, exhaust manifolds and other parts, employing 1,449 workers.
Five assembly plants that build midsize cars will be reduced to four or fewer, G.M. said. One or more assembly plants among those in Doraville, Ga.; Fairfax, Kan.; Oklahoma City, and two in Oshawa, Ontario, will be shut.


GRAPHIC: The plant closings announced yesterday by General Motors. The shutdowns, which affect more than 16,000 workers, are part of General Motors plan to eliminate 74,000 jobs by 1995. In December, Robert C. Stempel, G.M.'s chairman, said 21 plants would be idled, including two plants in Lansing, Mich., that make V-6 engines. Seven additional plant closings will be announced by the first quarter of next year, a company spokesman said yesterday.

HEADLINE: U.S. DETAILS TERMS ISRAEL MUST MEET FOR DEAL ON LOANS

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 24

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d today laid out the Bush Administration's conditions for granting loan guarantees to Israel.
In his first public description of the terms, he said Washington would back $10 billion in loans over five years only if Israel agreed to freeze all construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. 
 He testified before the House Foreign Operations subcommittee today, on the same day that peace talks resumed here between Israelis and Arabs.
Mr. Baker said that if the Government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir felt that it could not accept a total freeze on settlement construction, the Administration was prepared to offer an option: a far smaller amount in American loan guarantees, for only a year at a time -- on the conditions that only those settlement units now under way are completed and that all new construction in the territories is frozen.
 
Stronger Link Than Before
 The Administration's approach marks the first time in American-Israeli relations that the United States has chosen to use economic aid as a tool to try to change Israeli political actions in the occupied territories.
Every American administration since the territory was captured in 1967 has opposed the construction of housing and settlements for Jews in the West Bank and Gaza as an obstacle to peace that might hamper chances for a territorial compromise with the Arabs. But none has attempted to link American assistance to such a curb.
Mr. Shamir was quoted by Israeli newspapers today as saying that he would not stop settlement building in the West Bank and Gaza "even for a day." He says settlements are necessary both for security reasons and to drive home Israel's philosophical and biblical claim to the territories.
 
Nonconfrontational Tone
 Secretary Baker, in laying out the Bush Administration's conditions, adopted a nonconfrontational tone, indicating that he was still negotiating the issue with Israel's Ambassador, Zalman Shoval, and wanted the deal to go through -- but on his terms.
Both sides would prefer the matter to be resolved in the coming weeks while Congress is considering the foreign aid bill.
With the exception of Representative Larry Smith, Democrat of Florida, who complained that Mr. Baker was being too harsh on Israel, the members of the committee in general reacted favorably to Mr. Baker's presentation.
Senior Administration officials are convinced that many Israelis and the vast majority of Americans, including many American Jews, support using aid to change the actions of the hard-line Shamir Government.
The Administration apparently wanted to make its position known now in order to galvanize support. Its approach is intended to cast Mr. Shamir -- and not the conditions -- as the obstacle to the guarantees.
"The choice is Israel's," said Mr. Baker. "She can determine whether she wants to take action which would permit the strong support of both the legislative and executive branches for these loan guarantees, or not."
 
Talks Resume, Bilaterally
 At the Mideast peace talks here, Palestinian negotiators and those from Lebanon, Syria and Jordan held separate sessions with their Israeli counterparts, picking up where they left off last month: arguing over interpretations of United Nations resolutions, over agendas, over recent clashes between Israeli soldiers and Arab guerrillas in Lebanon -- over everything but peace agreements.
Israeli officials said that they would not be presenting a plan for Palestinian self-rule in the occupied territories, as the Palestinians have, because there is no consensus in Mr. Shamir's Likud party for such a plan, so the Israeli negotiators have apparently been instructed simply to stall.
Both the Israeli and Arab delegates today seemed to be preoccupied with Mr. Baker's testimony. Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation, said: "We think it is important that Secretary Baker has clearly indicated the end and the halt to all settlement activities. I think it certainly adjusts this peace process to place it back on the right track."
The Israeli request for loan guarantees was first presented last fall, but the Administration insisted that discussion be postponed until now so that it would not complicate efforts to put together the peace talks, which began in Madrid in October.
Since the fall, there have been repeated reports that the Administration intended to impose some sort of freeze on settlement building as a condition of support, but Administration officials always declined to discuss their terms in public.
Support for the Administration on Capitol Hill appears to be wide, among both Democrats and Republicans, with the members of neither party very eager to vote for foreign aid in an election year. Both Representative David R. Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Operations Subcommittee, and Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, his Senate counterpart, have made clear that they want to see a halt to Israeli settlement activity as a condition for loan guarantees.
 
Jewish Groups' Lower Profile
 Given this political mood, Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker have apparently concluded that there is little political cost in this election year in taking a tough line with the Shamir Government. Jewish organizations that traditionally give strong support to Israel all back the request for loan guarantees in order to help Israel absorb the great number of Jewish emigrants from the former Soviet Union.
But in contrast with a year ago, they are seeking to avoid a confrontation with the President on this issue. This is in part because they are divided over the question of Israeli settlement practices -- with some supporting a freeze and others in favor of continued settlement.
In addition, the Jewish groups do not feel comfortable pressing aggressively for further aid to Israel in the current recession, when foreign aid in general has lost further popularity.
With Israeli general elections planned June 23, the Bush Administration evidently has no incentive to make the conditions for the loan guarantees easy; rather, it appears to be tightening the conditions.
 
Must Not Be Seen to 'Lean'
 As its nominee to oppose Mr. Shamir in the vote, the opposition Labor Party has chosen former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, a politician well regarded in Washington, in constrast with Mr. Shamir.
While Administration officials say they are doing all they can not to get embroiled in Israeli politics -- which they believe would only strengthen Mr. Shamir's hand -- the logic of their strategy is to put Mr. Shamir in a position of either accepting Washington's conditions or being held responsible by the Israeli public for not getting the guarantees.
Mr. Rabin has said that he is opposed to "political" settlements in the occupied territories, such as those placed in the midst of densely populated Arab areas, but he insists that Israel has a right to build settlements for security reasons.
Israel would use the guarantees to borrow money from private banks at lower interest rates.
Although Mr. Shamir has taken a hard-line public stance, both Israeli and American officials insist that the negotiations between Mr. Baker and Ambassador Shoval are continuing and that there is more leeway in the Israeli position than is evident.
Mr. Shoval, American officials said, suggested to Mr. Baker that Israel might be prepared to accept a deal that would allow it to complete those settlements already in progress and to limit new housing units to 1,000 a year.
But as the Secretary made clear in his Congressional testimony today, that was still unacceptable.
"We will support loan guarantees of up to $2 billion for five years if there is a halt or an end to settlement activity," he said.
If Israel chooses this alternative, Mr. Baker said, it acknowledges that the United States would deduct a dollar from the guarantees for each dollar being spent to complete the settlements under way as of Jan. 1. This would insure that no American money went into such building.
 
No Sauce for Gander
 Mr. Baker acknowledged that the Administration was imposing conditions on Israeli policy that it was not imposing its Arab allies, but he said this was justified since the Israeli request came on top of $3 billion a year in economic aid that the United States is already providing.
"Nobody else is asking us for $10 billion in additional assistance over and above the $3 billion to $4 billion that we give every year with no strings attached," he said, putting special emphasis on each dollar number.
That drew the ire of Mr. Smith, a strong supporter of Israel, who called the Secretary of State's remarks "extremely offensive," apparently because they suggested that Israel would be getting $10 billion in cash, rather than loan guarantees that, he said, would not cost the American taxpayer much, provided Israel repaid the loans on schedule.
When Mr. Baker refused to be drawn into an argument with Mr. Smith and said he was finished elaborating, the Congressman shot back: "I hope some day the American public is going to determine whether you finish the answers or not. Disgraceful!"

HEADLINE: Jury Foreman in 1987 Gotti Trial Is Indicted in Plot to Sell His Vote

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
The foreman of the anonymous jury that acquitted the reputed Mafia leader John Gotti in his 1987 Federal racketeering trial was indicted yesterday on charges that he conspired with the mob to sell his vote and influence the jury for $60,000.
The indictment held no new formal charges against Mr. Gotti, the flamboyant, 51-year-old reputed leader of the Gambino crime family, the largest underworld group in the nation. Mr. Gotti has been acquitted in repeated state and Federal cases in recent years and is now on trial in Brooklyn on murder, loan sharking, tax fraud and other Federal racketeering charges. 
 But the indictment painted a stark portrait of jury-tampering and behind-the-scenes machinations that prosecutors had complained about -- but not proved -- in three previous Gotti trials. Its allegations appeared to buttress the need for extraordinary security precautions a judge has taken in the latest case, which could send Mr. Gotti to prison for life.
The indictment by a Federal grand jury in Brooklyn charged that the juror, George H. Pape, told a friend with ties to the Gambino family that he would take a bribe to engineer an acquittal. It said that Mr. Gotti authorized the payment, and that his top lieutenant, Salvatore Gravano, gave $60,000 to the intermediary to be passed on to Mr. Pape, known then only as Juror No. 11.
 
Unclear if Money Was Paid
 It was unclear if Mr. Pape got the money. The intermediary, Bosko Radonjich, fled to Yugoslavia last year and is a fugitive, prosecutors said. The indictment charged Mr. Pape and Mr. Radonjich with conspiracy and obstruction of justice, but did not say Mr. Pape got the money or that the 1987 acquittal was fixed; at the time lawyers said the case against Mr. Gotti was weak.
The 53-year-old Mr. Pape, who was arrested by Federal agents at his home in East Norwich, L.I., on Sunday, pleaded not guilty yesterday at an arraignment before Judge I. Leo Glasser in Federal Court in Brooklyn, and was held without bail for a hearing on Thursday. His lawyer, Barbara Hartung, said he was married, had two children and had been unemployed except for odd jobs since 1987.
If convicted of both counts, Mr. Pape would face up to 10 years in prison and fines of $500,000. But prosecutors noted yesterday that a conviction of Mr. Pape would not invalidate Mr. Gotti's 1987 acquittal; they said that under the constitutional protections against double jeopardy, he could not be retried.
Beyond announcing yesterday's indictment, United States Attorney Andrew J. Maloney, who leads the prosecution in the current trial, had no comment. Judge Glasser, who is presiding, has ordered both sides to refrain from public remarks.
Mr. Gotti's lawyer, Albert J. Krieger, said only that he was surprised by the charges. "I didn't know about the indictment until it was first mentioned in court today," Mr. Krieger told The Associated Press after yesterday's proceedings, in which more tapes of Mr. Gotti and his associates, clandestinely recorded by Federal investigators, were played.
There were sharp differences in the way jurors were handled in the 1987 and present cases against Mr. Gotti. In the 1987 case, which took place in the same courthouse, Federal Judge Eugene H. Nickerson numbered the jurors, but did not restrict their movements or contacts.
In the current case, Judge Glasser has ordered the tightest secrecy and security measures in recent memory to guard against jury tampering. The jurors are referred to in court only by their numbers, and the court has promised to preserve their anonymity permanently.
 
Sequestered in a Hotel
 Also the jurors have been sequestered in a hotel for the duration of the trial, which began in January and is expected to last two more months. While they are allowed occasional visits with relatives, they see no one else unless accompanied by a Federal marshal.
The marshals escort them to and from court. They also monitor all mail and telephone calls to the jurors, and strictly regulate their radio and television to bar exposure to broadcasts touching on Mr. Gotti, organized crime or the trial.
Judge Glasser ordered the precautions after prosecutors furnished evidence that there might have been tampering at previous trials. "The Gambino family's history of interfering with the judicial process is extensive and replete with instances of a variety of tampering schemes," prosecutors said in court documents.
They cited a 1984 case in State Supreme Court in Queens, in which Mr. Gotti was accused of assaulting and robbing Romual Piecyk. At the trial, Mr. Piecyk refused to identify Mr. Gotti, who was acquitted. Prosecutors said the witness had been intimidated by Gotti emissaries.
Mr. Gotti was also acquitted in state court in Manhattan in 1990 of assault charges involving a carpenters' union official and, while the jury was sequestered, prosecutors contended that the underworld had intimidated witnesses.
While prosecutors refused to say so, it was widely believed that the charges in yesterday's indictment came from Mr. Gravano, Mr. Gotti's former top aide, who became a Government informer last fall and is expected to testify against Mr. Gotti.
The indictment said that during the 1987 trial, Mr. Pape, who had sworn as a prospective juror that he had never had any contact with anyone connected to organized crime, approached Mr. Radonjich, a friend of many years who was a close associate of Mr. Gravano, and said that "in exchange for money," he would "be willing to vote 'not guilty' in the Gotti case and persuade other jurors to vote 'not guilty.'

HEADLINE: New Housing Chief Plans Stricter Rules on Spending

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
The newly appointed chairwoman of New York City's Housing Authority, Sally Hernandez-Pinero, said yesterday that she planned to adopt strict new spending guidelines at the agency -- which has come under sharp criticism for lavish spending in the last week -- and to focus on improving the city's deteriorating housing projects.
"I am a fiscal conservative," Ms. Hernandez-Pinero said in an inteview yesterday. "These are the most austere times we have seen, and I plan to make sure that every agency dollar is spent wisely on public housing tenants and not bureaucrats." She said she would devise the new guidelines in the coming weeks. 
Ms. Hernandez-Pinero, who stepped down as Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, replaced Laura D. Blackburne, who resigned under pressure on Saturday, after questions were raised over about her spending practices.
Ms. Blackburne spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on office renovations and business trips, including $1,500 to charter a helicopter to a housing conference in Atlantic City and $16,000 to take city housing officials to Puerto Rico to give advice to the housing authority there.
In a symbolic first step, Ms. Hernandez-Pinero said that she had removed a pink leather office couch -- which has come to epitomize the lavish spending of her predecessor -- and that she planned to donate it to a center for the elderly in Brooklyn.
But Ms. Hernandez-Pinero did not openly criticize Ms. Blackburne, who is credited with winning tens of millions of dollars in Federal housing money for New York City and helping to rid city housing projects of drug dealers. Ms. Hernandez-Pinero said that she hoped to continue many of Ms. Blackburne's social service and housing development programs, but that repairing the physical condition of public housing was her top priority.
Ms. Hernandez-Pinero said she was concerned that the number of managers at the authority had increased sharply under Ms. Blackburne, at a time when other agencies have been scaling back, and that she would seek to shrink management.
Housing advocates and experts yesterday praised Ms. Hernandez-Pinero's appointment. "I can't think of anyone who would be better able to take this job," said Kathryn Wylde, president of the nonprofit New York City Housing Partnership.
Barry Feinstein, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 236, which represents municipal housing workers, said: "Sally is a tough, smart lady who knows a lot about housing. I think she will take a firm grip of this agency and move forward."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Incumbent;
Bush Sounds Patriotic Theme in Maryland

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BETHESDA, Md., Feb. 24

 BODY:
President Bush drove seven miles to a financially comfortable suburb of Washington today to open his Maryland re-election campaign, declaring that "the fight for the future has just begun and it will continue for four more years."
To a crowd of 2,500 people in a high school gymnasium, Mr. Bush offered what is becoming a stock campaign address. It is an upbeat melange of allusions to last year's military victory over Iraq, attacks on Democrats in Congress, calls for passage of his legislation to boost the economy and scornful comments on "professional pessimists" who fear America's claim on world leadership is ebbing. 
 Drawing on a vein of tub-thumping patriotism that spurs applause even from tepid crowds, the President urged his audience at Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School "to send a message to those doomsayers and those pessimists": that "we are the United States of America, and we can compete with anybody."
 
Attacks Isolationists
 Tonight, the line appeared to be directed at Mr. Bush's Republican rival, the conservative columnist Patrick J. Buchanan, who was reared in the Chevy Chase section of Northwest Washington, a stone's throw from where Mr. Bush spoke. Mr. Buchanan favors erecting trade barriers to shield American companies from foreign competition and has opposed Mr. Bush's more activist foreign policy.
Without naming Mr. Buchanan, Mr. Bush attacked those who would "lock the doors and pull down the blinds and hope the world goes away."
"America is not that kind of country," the President said. "Never before in this nation's history have we turned our back on a challenge and we are not going to start now by becoming an isolationist nation.
"Think back a year ago this very day," the first anniversary of the allied ground attack in the Persian Gulf, Mr. Bush said. "What did we hear of those professional pessimists? They spoke of defeat and humiliation. Well, they were wrong then, and they are wrong now."

HEADLINE: Dow Struggles to Advance 2.23, to 3,282.42

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stock prices were mixed yesterday, as trading eased with investors expressing concern over a weak bond market and rising interest rates. Still, blue chips drew some interest, nudging the Dow Jones industrial average to another high, 3,282.42, up 2.23 points.
The bellwether average of 30 industrials was the only index to reach a closing high yesterday -- its 12th record this year. 
 Paul J. Kronlokken, a technical analyst with Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood in Minneapolis, was surprised by the resiliency in the market as it came back late in the session. "However, the story was the broader market, which was not able to bounce back" from earlier lows, he added.
As interest rates tick higher, investors become increasingly concerned about the impact on corporate profits and look to the more attractive bond yields that would begin to compete with the equities for investors' money. Yesterday, the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond was up 2 basis points, or two-hundredths of a percentage point, to 7.96 percent.
"There's nothing wrong with locking your cash at 8 percent and being able to get a good night's sleep," Mr. Kronlokken said.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 181.3 million shares, down from 261.7 million on Friday.
The Big Board composite gained 0.16 point to finish at 227.62, as losing issues outpaced gainers by 1,013 to 726.
Investors' interest in blue-chip stocks also helped the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks to gain 0.81 point, 412.27, while the American Stock Exchange index dropped 1.05, to 411.80. In Nasdaq trading, the composite fell 4.82, to 624.93, while the Russell 2,000 dropped 1.51, to 208.89.
General Motors announced a 1991 fourth-quarter loss of $4.25 a share, a record for the industry, including a one-time charge of $2.8 billion relating to its previously announced plans to close 21 plants and cut 74,000 jobs by 1995. The announcement had little impact on the market because most analysts expected it. The stock fell 5/8, to 37 3/4.
Birinyi Associates, a Wall Street research firm, pointed to Merck, up 3 1/4, to 149 1/2, on expectations of a 3-for-1 stock split; Walt Disney, up 1 1/2, to 154 3/8; Texaco, up 1 3/8, to 58 3/4, and J. P. Morgan, up 1 1/4, to 59 3/4, as the big movers on the Dow.
In other market activity, Home Depot closed at 61 3/4, up 1/8, but not before rising 1 1/4 after the chain of building materials and home improvement stores reported fourth-quarter earnings of 31 cents a share, better than most Wall Street expectations of 26 cents to 28 cents a share.
Shares of Du Pont fell 1 1/8, to 47 1/8, after the publication of reports that one of its fungicides, Benlate, was responsible for contaminating farms in Florida. The fungicide, which was taken off the market a year ago, has cost the manufacturer more than $205 million in damage claims.
A breakthrough that would enable users of Macintosh personal computers to make commands by voice, without the use of a keyboard or mouse, sent Apple Computer stock up 1 1/8, to 66 1/8. Analysts said the event was significant in the race to develop computers that respond to voice commands, but a company spokesman said, "It's not ready for prime time yet."
Zenith Laboratories, a manufacturer of generic pharmaceuticals based in Northvale, N.J., jumped 3 5/8 yesterday, to 23 3/4, after a court in New Jersey ruled on Friday that its Cefadroxil drug did not infringe Bristol-Myers Squibb's patent for Duricef. Bristol-Myers rose 1/4, to 78 7/8.

HEADLINE: Sign on Capitalist Road: --> Recessionary Bumps

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DUBNICA, Czechoslovakia

 BODY:
Ever since the 1930's, towns like this one in the soft valleys of the White Carpathian mountains have housed Czechoslovakia's biggest arms forges, hidden deep from enemies in east and west. Now, two years after the collapse of Communism and the resulting wave of disarmament, the Slovak workers who once turned out many of the heavy weapons for Warsaw Pact armies are still awaiting their peace dividend.
"We once sent 75 percent of our production to the old Soviet Union,," said Ivan Juttner, personnel director at the huge Heavy Machinery Works. "Now it is about 8 percent. This is our reality, and it is having a tremendous effect on employment." 
 The problems at the factory, which employs 80 percent of the work force in this town of 25,000 people, are typical. As Americans experience dismay over military spending cuts that are costing jobs in the midst of a recession, the cutbacks here are threatening to undermine industrialization itself and push this town back into a pattern of farming, a bit of tourism and waves of emigration.
 
Bitterness Breeds Sarcasm
 The bitterness here over the arms industry is only reinforced when the news reaches the valley that the United States has shipped billions of dollars worth of arms to the Persian Gulf region, while the Government of President Vaclav Havel in distant Prague has ordered Dubnica's arms industry closed down.
"My compliments to America's arms industry," said Stanislav Hajas, an adviser to the management of the Heavy Machinery Works, adding that roughly 5,500 of 16,400 workers have been laid off since 1988. At Dubnica's steel mill, whose 98,000 tons of annual capacity once barely met the needs of assembly lines that turned out heavy armored personnel carriers, workers may soon go on four-day weeks as furnaces shut down.
Juraj Cervinka, the 52-year old mayor, said some people opened small businesses after 90 percent of Dubnica's stores were privatized. "Others are leaving, seeking work in Germany," he said, "and an arrangement with the Dutch enables 300 workers to go to Holland."
Until now, most of those laid off were women whose husbands remain the family breadwinners, he said. Consequently, the impact has not yet been severe on social services like nursery schools and vacation homes, where budgets have been cut by a quarter in two years.
 
Deja Vu
 Fifty miles to the northeast, at the big arms factories in Martin, management spurned the warnings of Prague policy makers and the objections of Washington and Israel and agreed last September to sell 250 big Soviet-designed T-72 tanks to Syria. In Dubnica, there is no feeling of censure for Martin's rebelliousness, but rather of regret that Dubnica's arms makers lack Middle East contacts from former communist days.
"When the order came to stop arms production, we had 2 billion crowns in inventory tied up," Mr. Hajas noted, adding that all the aid provided this year by cash-strapped Prague totaled only 1.2 billion crowns (about $40 million).
This is not Dubnica's first conversion. Under the Soviet Government of Nikita S. Khrushchev in the 1950's, assembly lines that were built under Stalin after World War II to make heavy artillery were converted to make construction equipment. But the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 reintroduced arms manufacturing, and brought a prosperity that was intended to wean Czechs and Slovaks from a yearning for freedom.
 
Problems of Scale
 Mr. Hajas says potential investors are often frightened away by Dubnica's sheer size. "To be frank, our factory is a colossus," he says, "It is fair to say that since the revolution, we've had 2,000 representatives of firms worldwide come through here. But when they see how huge the plants are, and hear that for the conversion of our former products about $500 million would be needed in a short time, nearly everyone has a short discussion and leaves."
One that did not is the Reda Corporation, an Oklahoma-based maker of petroleum pumps. In what at first sight appears to be an ideal triangular deal involving Western technology, skilled Slovak labor and customers in the oil fields of western Siberia, Reda has agreed to transfer technology to Dubnica to employ about 1,200 people making drilling pumps that will go to Russia in barter for crude oil.

HEADLINE: Further Cuts at GE Aircraft

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: EVENDALE, Ohio, Feb. 24

 BODY:
The General Electric Company said today that it would make further cuts in its aviation jet engine business to save $150 million a year and meet stiff market competition.
GE Aircraft Engines said it would cut 2,800 salaried and hourly jobs throughout its North American operations this year, with most of the reductions coming by the middle of the year. 
 The company said it also planned improved production and inventory management, organizational restructuring, tightened use of business travel expenses, decreased overtime spending and less use of outside personnel to perform work from clerical tasks to consulting.
General Electric said it was putting on hold plans for the start-up of an engine overhaul plant in Suffolk, Va. G.E. imposed a similar cost-cutting delay last year for an engine blades plant in Durham, N.C.
The newest round of cost-cutting is necessary because of reductions in Government military programs and the effect of a stalled economy on the commercial airline industry, G.E. said. It makes and sells engines for military and commercial jets.
The company cut 2,900 jobs last year in its American operations, mostly at its headquarters plant in Evendale, a suburb of Cincinnati. The division employs about 33,500 people around the country, including 17,000 in Evendale.

HEADLINE: The G.M. Cutbacks;
Michigan Workers See Politics in Closing

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 24

 BODY:
Workers at General Motors' Willow Run plant in Ypsilanti Township, Mich., today disputed the assertion by the company that its decision to shut their plant in 1993 was made solely on economic grounds.
Officials of Local 1776 of the United Automobile Workers, which represents workers at Willow Run, said their plant had several economic advantages over its sister plant in Arlington, Tex., which will remain open and will be refurbished to handle increased output of large rear-wheel-drive cars. 
 Because of its proximity to suppliers, the union officials said, Willow Run could produce each car for $400 less than in Texas.
 
 
Suspicions of Politics
 Officials of the Willow Run local asserted that an internal G.M. study had also found that upgrading Willow Run would be less expensive than making the required investments in Arlington. A G.M. spokesman said the company would not discuss its internal reports.
"Show me how they made the decision based on numbers, and you can't," said Jerry Clifton, shop chairman of Local 1776.
He said workers felt that President Bush had swayed G.M.'s decision in favor of Arlington because Texas was his home state. In return, Mr. Clifton says, G.M. stands to benefit from the President's effort to obtain speedy approval of a free-trade agreement with Mexico.
 G.M.'s chairman, Robert C. Stempel, insisted at a news conference today, when he announced the company's fourth-quarter and 1991 losses and its factory-closing plans, that the Willow Run closing was strictly a business judgment.
"The plant decisions were based on internal factors and the economic realities of the world automotive market," he said. "Political considerations were not part of our decision process."
City, county and state officials in Texas had scrambled in the weeks after Mr. Stempel's Dec. 18 announcement to prepare an assortment of tax abatements tied to a planned enterprise zone surrounding the Arlington plant. Gov. Ann Richards promised that Texas would buy more than 1,000 natural-gas-powered vehicles from G.M. if the Arlington plant remained open.
The survival struggle between Arlington and Willow Run -- and among politicians and union and company officials -- was the most closely followed example of how G.M.'s restructuring announcement stood to affect various communities.
 
 
Worker Concessions
 The tug-of-war was also seen as a test of whether the competing plants would be goaded into "whipsawing," or making competing concessions, to win G.M.'s favor. Workers in Arlington reportedly expressed willingness to work 10-hour shifts with no overtime pay, but national U.A.W. officials said that would undercut the national contract.
Union officials at Willow Run said that they had made no such offer, adding that extraordinary shift agreements would ultimately hurt productivity.
Workers on the morning shift at G.M.'s Arlington plant, near Fort Worth, erupted into cheers and applause when they learned that their plant, with 3,800 employees, would remain open.
"I'm glad the news is here and I'm glad the news is good," said Mike Seiler, chairman of U.A.W. Local 276. "We've got a good work force. But I hate to see anyone lose their job anywhere in this company."
 
Corvairs and X-Cars
 While the 36-year-old Willow Run plant has never before faced the threat of closing, it has seen its share of troubles.
The products it built through the years have included the Chevrolet Corvair, the rear-engine, air-cooled car attacked by Ralph Nader in his 1965 book "Unsafe at Any Speed." In 1979, it also started building the ill-fated series of so-called X-cars: front-wheel-drive compacts sold with nameplates that included the Chevrolet Citation, Buick Skylark and Oldsmobile Omega. The series was discontinued because of quality problems.
Willow Run has also seen many corporate reorganizations. The plant has been assigned to Chevrolet-Fisher Body, the General Motors Assembly division, the Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac Group and the Chevrolet-Pontiac-Canada Group. With each change, the plant had to adjust to new management philosophies.
In 1989, the plant started building the restyled Chevrolet Caprice. Its sales also flagged, in part because of its unusually rounded styling and lukewarm reviews.

HEADLINE: Ex-Soviet Nations May Join I.M.F. Soon

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 24

 BODY:
Russia and at least half a dozen other former Soviet republics will most likely join the International Monetary Fund at the group's spring meeting in Washington on April 27, executives at the fund and foreign officials said today.
The officials said the Group of Seven nations and the I.M.F.'s 156 members were still debating how large a share of the bank's capital the republics should supply. 
 These officials said that Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Moldova, plus the three Baltic states, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, would likely join the international lending organzation. But they said it might take longer for other republics to join because of delays in obtaining sufficient data on their economies.
"The feeling is it's a very high priority to get on with these applications," an American official said.
The officials said Russia and the other republics would probably take a stake of 4 percent to 4.5 percent of the I.M.F.'s current capital, which is slightly more than $120 billion. According to some officials, Russia alone would supply about 2.5 percent.
After the United States called for shrinking the I.M.F. board, the Group of Seven agreed to give Russia a seat and expand the board by one, to 23, Western officials said.
The republics are eager to join in order to increase their ties with the West and to qualify for I.M.F. assistance. The group's aid is usually conditioned upon a country's adopting strict economic reforms.
The I.M.F. board plans to finish paperwork for admitting Russia and several other republics by April 15. At that time, it hopes to send out a mail ballot to the members in the hope they will approve the admissions before April 27.
If the former Soviet republics take a 4.25 percent stake in the I.M.F., they will be asked to put up about $5.1 billion. They would have to put up a quarter of this in hard currency; the rest could be in their own currencies.
 
Where Money May Come From
 Because the republics are so short of hard currency, foreign officials said there was a good chance that the republics would get that money from grants or loans from wealthy nations.
Member countries can qualify for aid from the I.M.F. equal to three to four times their capital stake.
Some I.M.F. officials fear their efforts to aid the republics will be thrown off track by delays in increasing the fund's overall capital to $180 billion, from $120 billion. The main reason for that delay, they say, is that the United States, the largest shareholder, has not yet approved its $12 billion share of the increased capital.
An I.M.F. delegation returned today from a trip to Moscow, where it worked with Russian economics officials to develop a reform program that would be tied to I.M.F. aid.

HEADLINE: Shanghai vs. Mah-Jongg: What Odds?

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SHANGHAI

 BODY:
In the evening, after folks here have emptied their rice bowls and put down their chopsticks, the criminal instincts overwhelm the most unlikely people -- high-school students, white-haired old women, even longtime Communist Party members. As if by compulsion, someone locks the door and they prepare for an evening of law-breaking.
It is mah-jongg time. 
 The Communist Party has tackled tough assignments before, like the 1949 Revolution. But these days, the leadership of Shanghai, China's largest city, has set itself a truly daunting task: to eradicate mah-jongg, the game that is a national craze.
The crackdown conducted over the last few weeks has been about as effective as a campaign against office football pools would be in the United States.
 
Nothing Better to Do
 The campaign seems to illustrate two fundamental truths about Communist Party rule in China.
The first is that the party seems so remote these days that it has an unerring talent for annoying ordinary people without really meaning to. Probably more Chinese peasants care passionately about mah-jongg than about freedom of the press, and the result is that even those unconcerned about persecution of dissidents profess irritation at endless political study sessions, at requirements that they "volunteer" to buy Government bonds, and at denunciations of mah-jongg when there are no better entertainment options.
The second fundamental truth is that the party has lost much of its ability either to inspire or to terrorize, and so its edicts are frequently ignored.
"It's no use to try to regulate mah-jongg," said a young woman here. "Nobody pays attention to the campaign. The Government babbles, and the people play."
"The Government has no authority anymore," she said, pointing to a group of bicyclists careering across the street through traffic. "Look at those people -- that's illegal too. But the law doesn't matter."
 
Gambling Is the Target
 The authorities are trying to stamp out mah-jongg because play is usually accompanied by gambling. Most mah-jongg enthusiasts bet only small amounts, often the equivalent of just a few cents. But some people become hard-core gamblers and fritter away all their savings, occasionally even staking their wives on a game.
Consequently, many Chinese regard mah-jongg as a dangerous vice -- but an exceedingly fun one -- with much the same ambivalence that some Americans might feel for alcohol or blackjack or double helpings of chocolate cake.
The United States and other countries also control gambling, and sometimes even office pools, but Shanghai is one of the few places that tries to change social habits and ban small-scale betting in the privacy of the home. In Hong Kong, in contrast, mah-jongg is legal at social gatherings or in the abundant parlors that have licenses from the Government, which has sought to keep the game out of the hands of Chinese gangs.
The Taiwan authorities allow social mah-jongg betting in the home, while Macao offers all kinds of gambling, including casinos, and consequently attracts large-stakes gamblers from all over Asia.
One reason for the authorities' zeal in Shanghai may be that privacy is not a well-known concept in China. Even the Chinese expression for privacy is usually used in a pejorative sense to hint at selfishness or secretiveness. Still, even if they don't always value privacy, many ordinary Chinese treasure their small-stakes mah-jongg.
"There's no way you can succeed in banning mah-jongg," said a college-educated woman who supports the Government. "You might as well try to ban knives because they can sometimes be used to kill people."
Mah-jongg, which had its origins in the Song Dynasty more than 700 years ago, is played with 144 domino-like tiles with names like West Wind and Red Dragon. In the 1920's the game became popular in the United States and Britain, and Chinese who saw the movie "Driving Miss Daisy" were astonished to see a scene in the film in which Americans were playing mah-jongg.
Whether in America or China -- or in other countries like Japan and Korea where mah-jongg is popular -- the rules are essentially the same. Four people normally play at a time, each player keeping a "hand" of tiles and leaving the rest in the center of the table. The players take turns putting some down and taking up others, with the aim of building up a set of matching tiles. The rules are something like gin rummy, but played with tiles rather than cards.
 
Shanghai Gets Tough
 China banned mah-jongg during the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976, but there was a resurgence in the 1980's and now it is normally tolerated, even though it is frowned on. Mah-jongg sets are available in stores -- Beijing Department Store has 10 kinds on sale, at prices ranging from $5 to $156 -- but mah-jongg gambling dens are strictly banned and the game is normally forbidden in the workplace and in schools.
While in most of China the Government does not bother people who play in their homes, Shanghai for some reason has been particularly determined to uproot mah-jongg.
"Playing mah-jongg is an ugly social trend," Wenhui Bao, a Shanghai newspaper, declared several months ago. "People wallow in it so that it saps the energy and seriously affects production, work and studies. Gambling over mah-jongg causes crime and considerable social harm. We must absolutely eradicate this mah-jongg craze."
In the latest campaign against mah-jongg, which began around the turn of the year and was timed for the Chinese New Year celebrations, when people have time on their hands and are prone to gamble, the authorities created 5,000 "anti-gambling squads" to prowl the suburbs.
In addition, 270,000 rural Communist Party members in Shanghai were summoned to meetings to watch as 4,300 party members publicly gave self-criticisms and renounced mah-jongg.
One county head in the Shanghai suburbs called a mass meeting and started a bonfire of 400 mah-jongg sets. Shops in the outskirts were told to stop selling mah-jongg games, according to official newspaper reports. But in central Shanghai, stores continue to sell mah-jongg sets and the police have been restrained.
"If you're just playing at home with the old lady and the kids, then the cops will just give you a warning," said a middle-aged mah-jongg enthusiast.
"But if you've got some friends over, then they'll probably figure you're gambling and confiscate all the money in your pockets."
Shanghai residents said that while the police might enter a house if they heard the sound of tiles from the street, most police officers were too lazy to bother and would hurry on. But if a neighbor reported that mah-jongg was being played, the police would almost certainly raid a private house, they said.
Many mah-jongg players said that the real problem in Shanghai was that there was nothing else to do in leisure time that was fun and affordable.
"We need more ways of having fun," said Zhang Weiguo, a Shanghai journalist and dissident. "On TV we see these things from the West -- skiing, water slides, hang gliding and so on -- but the only thing that people here have to turn to is traditional old mah-jongg. So it's gotten to the point that out of 1.1 billion Chinese, maybe 900 million play. Only a melon-head doesn't play."
"The problem is the Communist Party management," Mr. Zhang said. "It's true that more people are playing mah-jongg and that this is hurting the economy and harming the society. But the reason people play is that they don't have alternatives."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Challenger;
In Georgia, Buchanan Plays Up His Role as a Republican Outsider

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ELLIJAY, Ga., Feb. 24

 BODY:
In his most extensive day of campaigning in Georgia since his strong showing last week in the New Hampshire primary, Patrick J. Buchanan said today that President Bush and the "Republican establishment" were seeking to shut him out of the race for the party's Presidential nomination.
Mr. Buchanan, the conservative commentator who received 37 percent of the vote in the New Hampshire Republican primary last Tuesday, complained that he was being kept off the ballot in several states by Mr. Bush's supporters and that he was being denied opportunities to speak to Republican gatherings like the Southern Republican Leadership Conference meeting last week in Charleston, S.C. 
 The candidate's comments came as he undertook an energetic day of campaigning in Georgia, a state he and his aides have called "crucial" to his chances of maintaining his challenge to Mr. Bush.
 
A Populist Theme
 Mr. Buchanan traveled to this town in northwest Georgia, to be interviewed by a local radio commentator, address students and parents at a Ellijay High School and wolf down barbeque at a roadside stop. He also attended a reception and spoke at a rally in Atlanta.
With his comments today, Mr. Buchanan appears to be shifting to a populist stance, playing up an image of an outsider fighting the Washington establishment. In doing so, he seems to be placing less emphasis on voter anger over tough economic times, an issue that may be less effective in a state like Georgia where unemployment is not the problem it is in New Hampshire.
In playing the role of an outsider, Mr. Buchanan also hopes to be able to tap into Democratic as well as Republican votes. In the Georgia primary, members of one party can cross over to vote in the other party's primary.
Mr. Buchanan and campaign officials say they are concerned that they might not have enough time before next Tuesday's primary for the message to sink in with enough voters. Mr. Buchanan has campaigned in Georgia for portions of two days.
Frank I. Luntz, who serves as Mr. Buchanan's poll taker, said his surveys show that many voters in Georgia are not aware of the results of the New Hampshire primary or of Mr. Buchanan's campaign, which has just started broadcasting radio and television commercials.

HEADLINE: Students as Leaders

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
"What's the catch?" 16-year-old Francis Clement asked when told that his Bronx high school, James Monroe in Hunts Point, had been chosen. Students at George Washington High School in Harlem asked, "Why us?" And disbelief blended with pride at Brooklyn's Automotive High School, where students complain that outsiders often stereotype them as grease monkeys.
Now, three weeks into the program, skepticism has faded over the unexpected windfall -- grants from the wealthy Surdna Foundation to create student-run foundations to improve neighborhood life. In its place, students are discovering an almost heady sense of power. 
 The Surdna grants of $7,500 a year for three years to each school dovetail with the frequently expressed goal of Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez to get students more involved in community service. If the experiment works, the Chancellor wants to extend it citywide -- assuming the money comes from philanthropies or corporations.
 
Ambitious Programs
 The three schools each initially enrolled about 25 students in the new Student Service and Philanthropy Project, but all students are invited to propose projects. Some want to clear vacant lots for playgrounds, while others discuss working with the elderly and patients with AIDS, or searching for ways to promote racial harmony. Students are expected to identify local problems, decide how to use their money for grants, develop a budget and run and monitor projects.
Recent racial incidents in Brooklyn made promoting harmony a priority for Austin Smith, 17, the president of the student government at Automotive High. He dreams of creating a community center in his Brooklyn neighborhood, Canarsie, to induce isolated ethnic minorities to get together at least for sports. "This might be too ambitious," he conceded, saying, "We'll have to be realistic about what we can accomplish."
Chancellor Fernandez is encouraging the students to let their imaginations soar. "At a time when too many adults in our city and country have thrown up their hands in despair over the problems of unemployment, homelessness, AIDS and the crumbling infrastructure," he said, "we need practical ways to show our young people that each of us can play a role in turning things around."
Surdna, one of the country's wealthiest family foundations with assets of $325 million, was created in 1917 by John E. Andrus, an investor in pharmaceuticals and real estate. Surdna -- the family name spelled backwards -- has always operated quietly in supporting traditional philanthropies. Two years ago, its director, Edward Skloot, decided to concentrate on environmental issues and community revitalization, and it now gives away $17 million yearly.
"At Surdna, we wanted to show we take kids seriously and don't regard them as grunt laborers but as active planners who can take on responsibilities for their own communities," said Mr. Skloot. The foundation is providing $292,000 for the undertaking.
In making their selections, organizers looked for those schools offering leadership training and where students demonstrated an interest in the community. At Monroe, students accompanied the elderly to shops and clinics. At Washington High, they cleared litter and made a garden.
Unlike the other two schools, most of Automotive High's students are not residents of the surrounding community, and must commute to their school in Greenpoint, a working-class Brooklyn neighborhood of small factories, modest houses and a largely Polish population. Steven Gilbert, the principal, acknowledged his students are often regarded by some residents and shopkeepers with distrust.
Mr. Gilbert said students have made overtures to the community in an effort to improve the school's image. They cleaned two nearby subway stations, swept the platforms and replaced graffiti with a mural.
Automotive students, meeting with their adviser, James Mulqueen, decided to focus on helping children.
"Kids need our help to keep away from drugs," said Danny Ortiz, a 17-year-old who commutes daily from Washington Heights.
Mr. Mulqueen and his students tried but failed two years ago to raise money for students to work in a nearby day-care center, the John Oradecz Center. Automotive's students occasionally help out at the center, but it lacked money for a formal training program. That could change now because of the windfall to Automotive High.
The center cares for more than 170 youngsters. "We're always looking for extra hands," said Diana Sito, who now directs the center. "We need help in the classrooms. We need help in the after-school program. And we could certainly use some help in the kitchen."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
Disconcerted, Kerrey Changes Course

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RAPID CITY, S.D., Feb. 24

 BODY:
As he struggles for survival, hoping that a victory in South Dakota will give him the lift he needs to remain in the Democratic race for President, Senator Bob Kerrey seems to have cast off some of his skepticism about conventional political behavior.
The candidate who entered the campaign late, acting on impulse, and who often seemed as much at war with himself as with any of his Democratic rivals, has shed some of his quizzical detachment from the contest. 
 The Nebraska Senator attacks the two leading contenders, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, with vigor. His standard speech has grown broader and better organized. Known for his off-the-cuff, self-deprecating wit, Mr. Kerrey is now careful to leaven his remarks on planning the post-cold-war era and the need for national health insurance with prepared jokes -- at someone else's expense. "George Bush's contact with working people," he told college students in Aberdeen, S.D., "is bumping into the hired help."
His advisers explain that in the last week of New Hampshire, once his prospects had dimmed, Mr. Kerrey was "liberated." He has said that after a "pretty clunky" debut he has found his stride. What Mr. Kerrey seems to have discovered is that common motivation for politicians: a dread of losing. "I have to fight my way back to the perception that I can compete," is how Mr. Kerrey describes his plight.
 
Charmed Political Existence
 Senator Kerrey, who lost part of a leg in Vietnam, has known extraordinary personal adversity in his life, but he has never in the course of a charmed political existence confronted as directly the prospect of public failure.
When Mr. Kerrey was a popular Governor of Nebraska, he surprised virtually everyone in his state by deciding not to seek a second term that was all but assured. He told a reporter, rather airily, that he wanted "more danger" in his life. Walking out on defeat, however, is an entirely different prospect.
At a child care center in Sioux Falls today, Mr. Kerrey, echoing the theme of one of his advertisements, attacked Governor Clinton for seeking economic advice from a Washington consultant whom Mr. Kerrey said was "negative" about farm subsidies. Mr. Clinton insisted in the debate Sunday night that the consultant helped him only on tax issues. Today, Mr. Kerrey said sharply, "Not only does it not have the ring of truth, it's not true at all."
In Colorado on Saturday, Mr. Kerrey described Mr. Tsongas as "a corporate lawyer and registered lobbyist in Washington." Mr. Tsongas's economic plans, he added, included "elements of the trickle-down economics that failed in the 1980's."
And like any seasoned politician, he denied in an interview today that there was ego attached to his competitive spurt. "I'm not in this to drive up my name identification," he said, "If I am President, this country will be different from the one of Paul Tsongas or Bill Clinton. I'd be the better President."
 
No 'Baptism by Fire'
 A supporter in Sioux Falls, Arnold Snortland, said he and others had wondered what was keeping Mr. Kerrey from catching fire. "I think he is finding himself," said Mr. Snortland, an insurance company executive. "That's been the big problem."
Mr. Kerrey, he said, has "had it pretty easy until now, from Governor to the Senate. He hasn't had a baptism by fire."
Mr. Kerrey has complained about reporters' depictions of him as "quirky" and "diffident." But Mr. Snortland said he was not bothered by psychological examinations of Mr. Kerrey. "I have advice from that great philospher, Mae West," he said. "It's better to be looked over than overlooked."'
Mr. Kerrey had said of New Hampshire, where he finished behind Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Clinton, that his efforts there had not been wasted because "I learned something about myself." He now says he wishes he had not said that. "I'm not on a mission of self-discovery," he said. "I am running because I am concerned about the future of the country."
 
A Crucial Contest
 Most analysts say the South Dakota contest is crucial for Senator Kerrey as well as for his rival, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, because their states both share borders with this state and, as the only Midwesterners in the race, they must prove they can show strength in their home region if they are to be taken seriously elsewhere.
Saying that he expected to win in South Dakota, Mr. Kerrey described his strategy for survival after Tuesday as "just stay in the boat." (One Kerrey adviser, Tad Devine, adopted the motto from a line in the Vietnam film "Apocalyse Now.") But with sparse national press coverage of the campaign here, and a depleted campaign treasury, the complications for Mr. Kerrey are mounting.
Still, he is seeking a second chance to be discovered, and that hope mainly rests on something's causing Mr. Clinton or Mr. Tsongas to stumble. "The best hope for Bob Kerrey is that voters take a look and say, 'These two guys aren't good enough,' " said William Carrick, a Kerrey adviser.
The competitive zeal that has infected Mr. Kerrey has not entirely transformed him. In the debate in Sioux Falls on Sunday, he was at turns good-humored and aggressive, but his performance lacked the fire he showed in previous debates. He was not as "electrifying," as he sarcastically said the day before that he needed to be.
Nor are all his Presidential-sounding comments on the global economy as direct and forceful as he intends. Talking about world trade in Sioux Falls, Mr. Kerrey discussed about the importance of making payments to the International Monetary Fund, which, he said, helped world prosperity. A reporter asked him to name a few countries that have been helped by the I.M.F. Mr. Kerrey was caught off guard. "Oh God, you've stumped the band," he said, with an embarrassed smile.
And in still other ways, he remains an unconventional politician. Flying from Sioux Falls to Aberdeen, surrounded by aides inspecting scheduling sheets and newspaper clippings, Mr. Kerry sat quietly by himself, reading the Thomas Hardy novel "Jude the Obscure." He insisted that neither the title nor the book's themes, about fate being determined by character, held any special meaning for his campaign. "I just like good writing," he said.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Week;
It's Time to Get Tough, Bush's Advisers Declare

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 24

 BODY:
For weeks, White House strategists put out bullying talk about "going negative" on Patrick J. Buchanan. After New Hampshire, the President's strategists concluded they had talked too hard and hit too softly. This week, they say, they really mean it.
They are ready to spend whatever they have to on commercials, including attack ads, and to accuse Mr. Buchanan of "cheating" and question his patriotism to show how tough they can be. 
 The first blast against the conservative commentator came from a fellow fire-eater, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the state singled out by the Bush team as their killing ground. Working on President Bush's behalf, Mr. Gingrich denounced Mr. Buchanan for running a campaign commercial accusing Mr. Bush of abandoning a promised tax break.
The advertisement was "dishonest" and "hit below the belt," said Mr. Gingrich, whose sudden affection for a President he has derided for three years as a sell-out on taxes is one sign of how topsy-turvy the Republican campaign has become.
Senator Phil Gramm of Texas has undertaken the task of portraying the tough-talking Mr. Buchanan as a wimp by reminding Southerners that the commentator opposed the war against Iraq. "Let him drop by Fort Benning and explain to the people there why when they were in the desert, he was opposing the President," Mr. Gramm said today.
And Charles Black, senior adviser to the Bush campaign, said that after holding its fire in New Hampshire, the campaign was almost certain to run commercials criticizing Mr. Buchanan in the South.
The motivation for this sudden toughness is simple: The stakes are high in the South. By March 10, eight Southern or border states will have held nominating primaries or caucuses, beginning with Georgia and Maryland next Tuesday, and the Bush campaign hopes to accomplish no less than eliminating Mr. Buchanan as a candidate.
Southern poll takers, political scientists and politicians say the ingredients are there for Mr. Bush to do that. The region has well-heeled and well-organized Republicans who have been a minority so long that they cling loyally to a Republican White House, and it has a better economy than the Northeast. And Mr. Bush has millions to spend on advertising.
"If the President does not do substantially better in the South than in New Hampshire, he better buy him a real house in Texas, because he's going to need it," said Claiborne Darden, a poll taker in Atlanta.
Mr. Bush's supporters, who frantically tried to play down the importance of New Hampshire, acknowledge that the next two weeks are a clear test of the President's ability to drag his campaign out of its current state of confusion, reassert control over his own party and prepare for the fall campaign against the Democratic nominee.
So, the Bush camp is angry. Are the other guys scared?
Even though his decision to pull his punches in New Hampshire clearly cost Mr. Bush votes, no one doubts his ability to get nasty. He did that in 1988 against Michael S. Dukakis.
But Mr. Dukakis did not fight back. This time, Mr. Bush is calling a proven street fighter outside.
Mr. Buchanan has shown no hesitation to attack Mr. Bush, and in the fall, Mr. Bush could be running against someone like Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who likes to remind everyone that he has already shown he can take a punch.
Mr. Buchanan's strategy in the South is clear. He has nowhere near as much money as Mr. Bush and has been concentrating on Georgia. Mr. Bush seems secure in South Carolina, thanks to the efforts of Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr., who delivered the state to him in 1988 and to Ronald Reagan in 1984, and Mr. Buchanan will have a difficult time getting enough money to compete in large states like Florida and Texas.
In his Southern campaigning, Mr. Buchanan will go on hitting hard on racial tensions, which he has been doing by accusing Mr. Bush of signing a bill that would create quotas in hiring. He will also remind Southern voters that Mr. Bush broke his 1988 "no new taxes pledge."
In Georgia, Mr. Buchanan is running a commercial that proved effective in New Hampshire. It accuses Mr. Bush of reneging on a promise to push for a $500 increase in the tax exemption for children. The proposal was included in Mr. Bush's economic plan, but not in a list of the seven most urgent measures that the President wants passed by March 20. Today, Mr. Bush wrote to Representative Robert H. Michel, the House minority leader, saying that the proposal was a "major part" of his policy that he wants passed this year.
But Merle Black, professor of political science at Emory University in Atlanta, criticized Mr. Bush, saying "The business with the $500 is classic stupid politics and stupid politics doesn't play well anywhere."
Mr. Black and others said Mr. Buchanan's task in the days ahead is to focus on the 40 percent of Georgia Republicans who, according to state polls, are not firmly committed to Mr. Bush. Also, he must pull in some conservative Democrats, a possibility since Georgia voters do not have to decide which primary they will vote in until they enter the polling place.
"These are the white swing voters, who could have voted for Reagan, could have voted for George Wallace, might even have voted for David Duke, but Buchanan's blown Duke out of the water by talking about quotas," Mr. Black said.

HEADLINE: The G.M. Cutbacks;
Auto Maker Posts Deficit Of $2.5 Billion

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 24

 BODY:
Closing the books on its worst year in history, the General Motors Corporation today reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $2.5 billion, a record quarterly loss for the company. The deficit reflected a one-time pretax charge to income of $2.8 billion to close 21 plants over the next several years.
Excluding all extraordinary charges, the auto maker's loss for the fourth quarter was $519.8 million, on revenues of $33.6 billion. That represents a significant improvement from the fourth quarter of 1990, when G.M. posted a $1.62 billion loss on revenues of $29.9 billion after war in the Persian Gulf shattered consumer confidence and dried up auto sales. 
 G.M.'s profits have improved since the fourth quarter of 1990, one-time charges aside, in part because of cost-cutting and strong performances by the company's subsidiaries.
G.M. was the last of the Big Three auto makers to report its fourth-quarter and 1991 earnings. The Chrysler Corporation showed a $97 million profit in the final quarter and a loss for the year of $795 million. The Ford Motor Company posted a fourth-quarter loss of $475.7 million and a yearly loss of $2.25 billion.
Robert C. Stempel, G.M.'s chairman, said he expected quarterly earnings to improve. "We are committed to substantially re-sizing G.M.'s North American operations in order to achieve full competitiveness as quickly as possible," he said.
 
Biggest Corporate Loss
 The fourth-quarter loss brought G.M.'s 1991 loss to $4.45 billion -- the biggest in American corporate history -- compared with $1.98 billion in 1990. Revenues fell to $123.05 billion, from $124.7 billion in 1990.
Mr. Stempel said that G.M.'s North American automotive operations were responsible for all the losses, though he did not break out a separate figure. Analysts estimated the North American losses at roughly $7.5 billion, excluding one-time charges.
"There are no major surprises here," said Harvey Heinbach, an automotive analyst with Merrill Lynch in New York.
G.M.'s stock fell 62.5 cents in trading today on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $37.75.
Auto sales remained at recessionary levels throughout most of the year, weighed down by weak consumer confidence. Costly customer rebates and other incentives also drained G.M. cash, averaging about $1,000 a car, according to many analysts. Mr. Stempel also cited costly labor expenses as a burden on its finances.
Sales of G.M. cars internationally earned $2.1 billion in 1991, helped by strong sales in Europe and Mexico.
G.M.'s three major subsidiary operations, Electronic Data Systems. GM Hughes and G.M.A.C., posted strong financial results.
 
Data Systems
 E.D.S., a computer services company based in Dallas, posted the best quarter in its history, with net income rising to $155.9 million, or 33 cents a share, from $133.4 million a year ago, or 28 cents a share. Revenues rose 24 percent, to $2.09 billion from $1.68 billion.
The company registered a rise in annual revenues of $7.1 billion for 1991 compared with $6.1 billion for 1990. Net income last year rose 10 percent, to $547.5 million, or $1.14 a share, from $496.9 million, or $1.04 a share, in 1990. A change resulting from a new accounting standard lowered net income from $563 million for the year.
Last year was also the first since G.M. acquired E.D.S. in 1984 that revenues from sources outside the auto maker exceeded revenues derived from business with the parent.
G.M.'s class E shares on the New York Stock Exchange closed at $56.75, unchanged.
 
GM Hughes
 GM Hughes, which includes Hughes Aircraft and Delco Electronics, also posted record revenues and earnings in the final quarter. It earned $224.6 million, or 64 cents a share, on revenues of $3.1 billion, compared with earnings of $158.4 million, or 49 cents a share, on revenues of $2.9 billion in 1990.
For the year, GM Hughes earned $435.5 million, or $1.39 a share, on revenues of $11.5 billion, down from earnings of $577.2 million, or $1.82 a share, on revenues of $11.7 billion in 1990.
The company attributed the declines to an 8 percent drop in General Motors' North American vehicle production and a decline in the worldwide aircraft flight simulator market.
G.M.'s class H stock rose $1.125, to $19.375.
 
G.M.A.C.
 Net earnings of the General Motors Acceptance Corporation for the fourth quarter were $102 million, down from $259 million for the period a year earlier, but net income for all of 1991 was $1.37 billion, a 15 percent increase over 1990 earnings of $1.19 billion.
The 1991 earnings, showing the results of G.M.A.C.'s financing, insurance and mortgage operations, reflect the addition of $332 million that resulted from a change in accounting standards. A special wholesale loss provision recorded in the fourth quarter also amounted to $171 million after taxes. Excluding these provisions, net income totaled $1.21 billion, the second-highest earnings in G.M.A.C. history.
The total cost of borrowed funds in the United States averaged 7.66 percent in 1991 compared with 8.57 percent in 1990.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Record in Congress;
In House and Senate, Tsongas Went His Own Way

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 24

 BODY:
As a member of Congress, Paul E. Tsongas described the Federal budget deficit as the nation's "No. 1 economic problem," criticized labor unions as an obstacle to increased industrial productivity and led efforts to help the guerrillas who were resisting the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.
He consistently sided with liberals when they sought to protect the environment and the civil rights of women and homosexuals. But he often sided with moderates and conservatives when they moved to curb the growth of Federal spending. 
 In other words, as a member of the House of Representatives from 1975 through 1978 and as a Senator from 1979 through 1984, Mr. Tsongas displayed the same unorthodox mix of ideas that he espouses as a Presidential candidate.
 
An Atari Democrat
 He described himself in those years as an Atari Democrat, a member of the young generation of politicians and economists who looked to high technology as a source of jobs and economic growth.
He was a decade ahead of most lawmakers in identifying Japan as both an economic threat and a model for cooperation between government and private industry. In the early 1980's, he introduced several bills that would have authorized the Government to subsidize certain new technologies.
At a time when many Democrats and labor leaders were lambasting President Ronald Reagan's fiscal policies as an assault on poor people, Mr. Tsongas complained instead that the Reagan Administration was not investing enough in science, research and technology.
Mr. Tsongas's voting record indicates that he was among the most liberal members of the House. As a Senator, he continued to vote with liberal Democrats. But in 1979 and 1980 he re-examined his political assumptions and began to suggest that to help create jobs the Government should adopt tax and economic policies to assist businesses.
As a Senator, Mr. Tsongas was more effective than most other freshman members. He played a major role in shaping two laws of lasting significance. One protects more than 100 million acres of pristine land in Alaska from commercial development. The other authorized a $3.5 billion aid package for the Chrysler Corporation.
 
Peace Corps Volunteeer
 Having served as a Peace Corps volunteer in Ethiopia and the West Indies in the 1960's, Mr. Tsongas often complained about the "foolishness" of American policy toward third-world nations. By spurning their pleas for economic aid, he said, the United States drove such nations toward Moscow.
Mr. Tsongas urged Presidents Jimmy Carter and Reagan to establish diplomatic relations with the Marxist Government of Angola. He supported legislation to cut off military aid to El Salvador and deplored that country's human rights record.
Through all this, Mr. Tsongas had a touch of whimsy rarely found in the Senate. Mocking politicians and oil executives who sought maximum oil production, he suggested breeding dinosaurs in the hope they would increase future supplies of fossil fuels.
As a Senator, Mr. Tsongas served on the committees on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, Foreign Relations and Energy and Natural Resources. In an interview, James A. McClure, a conservative Idaho Republican who was chairman of the Energy Committee from 1981 through 1986, said: "Paul Tsongas was intelligent, listened well and contributed to our discussions in a thoughtful way. There was no knee-jerk reaction from him that told you his mind was committed before he got into a subject."
What follows is a survey of Mr. Tsongas's record in Congress, as reflected in his remarks, votes and actions.
 
Energy
 Energy was the topic of Mr. Tsongas's first speech in the Senate, in 1979. He described the energy crisis of fuel shortages and high oil prices as "the greatest threat to America's future." Calling for a new definition of national security, he said: "Any rational strategic military planner would have to conclude that our major vulnerability today is not, as many would argue, a first strike by the Soviet Union on our I.C.B.M. installations, or a Warsaw Pact attack upon NATO, but rather our vulnerability to the crude oil supply" from the Persian Gulf.
Mr. Tsongas was a tireless advocate of energy conservation, which he called "the best weapon we have" against the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. He supported greater use of solar energy, windmills and synthetic fuels. He boasted that he voted for increases in the Federal excise tax on gasoline whenever they were proposed.
But unlike many liberals, Mr. Tsongas refrained from attacks on the oil companies, saying such criticism, while emotionally satisfying, did nothing to reduce the excessive consumption of oil. "If Mother Teresa were put at the head of Exxon, the energy crisis would not go away," he said in 1981.
 
The Environment
 Mr. Tsongas made his mark in the Senate as a champion of environmentalists in the fight to restrict development of Federal land in Alaska. The state "represents the greatest conservation challenge of the 20th century," he said.
Donald J. Barry, who worked on the bill as an Interior Department lawyer, said last week: "A lot of people like to claim credit for the Alaska Lands Act. Senator Tsongas is one of the few members of Congress who truly deserve it."
Mr. Tsongas was more willing than most liberals to accept nuclear power. "No nuclear power means one certain result: large-scale reliance on coal," he said in 1980.
 
Chrysler and the Economy
 Though initially skeptical about loan guarantees for Chrysler, Mr. Tsongas supported them after labor unions agreed to wage reductions. He helped develop what he described as a Federal bailout for the auto maker in 1979. He worked closely with a Republican, Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, and was sometimes criticized by the unions.
Howard G. Paster, chief lobbyist for the United Automobile Workers at the time, said last week: "Senator Tsongas initially demanded wage givebacks that were out of the question. In the end, he was clearly committed to saving Chrysler. But he could not be taken for granted by organized labor. The Chrysler loan guarantee showed his willingness to think unconventional thoughts and his impatience with the ritual dance of the legislative process."
Mr. Tsongas got high ratings from the A.F.L.-C.I.O. During his 10 years in Congress, his scores averaged 89 on a scale of 100. He presents himself now as aggressively pro-business. But his ratings from the Chamber of Commerce of the United States averaged only 23, also on a scale of 100.
As a member of the House in 1978, Mr. Tsongas voted against a proposal to lower the capital gains tax, but a few years later he said he had made a mistake because that bill "did more for the economy of my state than anything I did as a Congressman."
In 1982, Mr. Tsongas warned that Japan was outstripping the United States in world trade. If the United States is to compete with Japan, he said, "business and government must adopt a new cooperative spirit."
 
Civil Rights
 Mr. Tsongas repeatedly introduced bills to prohibit employers from discriminating against homosexual workers. "The use of an irrelevant factor, such as sexual orientation, in evaluating an applicant or employee is a blatant invasion of that person's privacy," he said.
He was also a leading supporter of a proposed constitutional amendment to guarantee equal rights for women.
In 1979, Mr. Tsongas said, "I personally support busing as a constitutionally acceptable remedy of last resort to achieve desegregation." But to strike a compromise with lawmakers opposed to busing, Mr. Tsongas supported restrictions on its use. He was an early supporter of legislation to strengthen the Voting Rights Act..
 
Foreign Affairs
 Mr. Tsongas supported President Carter's decision to protest the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 by embargoing shipments of grain and high technology products to Moscow.
In 1982, he introduced a resolution calling on the Reagan Administration to step up the supply of "material assistance," including weapons, to Afghan guerrillas trying to expel Soviet forces.
Through his years in Congress, Mr. Tsongas often highlighted human rights abuses, from East Timor in Indonesia to South Africa to El Salvador. As early as 1979 he was urging colleges to show their opposition to apartheid by selling their stock in companies doing business in South Africa.
Mr. Tsongas consistently supported military and economic aid for Israel. But in 1982, he criticized Israel for carrying its war in Lebanon all the way to Beirut. He voiced concern at "the magnitude of human suffering and physical destruction in Lebanon."
After a trip to Lebanon and Israel in that year, he said Prime Minister Menachem Begin's approach to the Palestinian question was "nothing more than a charade."

HEADLINE: Rutgers's Quote-a-Matic Keeps Professors Talking

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., Feb. 24

 BODY:
Obscene corporate salaries in the news? Prof. Charles Fay is a Rutgers University expert on the history of executive pay.
How about the legend of the New Jersey Devil around Halloween, or the shifting social rules of dating on Valentine's Day? Dr. Angus Kress Gillespie is the resident sage in the American Studies Department on campus. 
 And no sooner was Anita Hill behind the witness table at Clarence Thomas's Supreme Court confirmation hearing than the names of Rutgers academic experts on sexual harassment began chirping their way out of newsroom fax machines along the Atlantic Coast.
Using the advanced facsimile machine's ability to send the same message to dozens of other machines automatically, the Rutgers University News Service has developed a state-of-the-art, on-top-of-the-news supply of quotable experts ready to meet a reporter's most urgent need, an authority to quote, and to soothe a skeptical editor's doubts.
Since the service began on a regular basis in the summer of 1990 with an offer of interviews with experts on the law and politics of abortion, the six-member Rutgers News Service staff has worked in specialized areas like reporters on beats. They have culled the state's flagship campus here for experts on New Jerey's deer population during recent protests about hunting them and for a zoologist, an ornithologist and a biologist to discuss the onset of spring.
For the rare conjunction of Jupiter, Venus, Mars and the moon last June 14, there was Prof. Ted Williams, astronomer. For President Bush's trade talks in Japan, Norman J. Glickman, an economist at Rutgers; for Santa Claus and "the impact of mass communications on the spread of the legend," back to Professor Gillespie.
 
'Communications Revolution'
 All colleges and universities like to see their faculty members quoted as experts, and most send out annual lists of specialists in various areas. But Roz Hiebert, a spokeswoman for the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges, and herself a 20-year veteran of the University of Maryland's news service, said she knew of no other campus that could match Rutgers's efforts to tailor its list of sources to breaking news events.
"It's all part of the communications revolution," Ms. Hiebert said, "and although I'm sure that many other universities would like to be doing the same thing, at this point most have not been able to set up such a quick response system."
Ruth Scott, director of the Rutgers News Service, said her staff members thought up the plan. "For many years, the News Service responded to requests for interviews," she added, "but this was an attempt to get ahead of the requests, to anticipate what the media would need."
 
Response to Earthquake
 "The first time we faxed them was in 1989, right after the San Francisco earthquake," she went on. "We put out the name Dr. Young Chae, the chairman of the department of civil engineering, who was also a member of the University Council for Earthquake Research. And the response was very good."
Between August 1990 and the end of December 1991, the university sent out 239 news advisories, more than three a week, offering the expertise of 454 faculty members. The faxes produced 1,031 interviews with newspapers and radio and television stations on the university's roster of 71 newsrooms.
Douglas Frank, a Rutgers News Service staff member who runs the facsimile service, said most faculty members welcomed a chance to comment on news events in their fields, and some even provide home telephone numbers.
As a public institution, Ms. Scott remarked, Rutgers has something of a duty to advance its role as a shaper of, or at least commentator on, public events. The faxed advisories also help keep the university's name before the taxpayers who support it. But the service is not, Ms. Scott said in response to a question, intended to help Rutgers compete for attention with the world-renowned Ivy League university about 18 miles down U.S. Route 1 in Princeton.
"I think that Rutgers University is recognized in its own right," she said.
As it happens, Princeton does not usually solicit interviews with its faculty, said Justin Harmon, head of the university's news office. It relies instead on the mails to distribute releases that stress Princeton's extensive resarch efforts and uses faxes only occasionally.
But Mr. Harmon rose like any good publicist to a sly question about being one-upped by another campus:
"The answer to your question," he said, "is that our faculty are such heavy-hitters that their names are already in everybody's Rolodexes."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
New Post of Vice Chairman Is Filled by Dayton Hudson

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
The Dayton Hudson Corporation, which operates the Target, Mervyn's and Marshall Field's store chains among others, yesterday named Henry T. DeNero to the newly created position of vice chairman.
Mr. DeNero, who will join the Minneapolis-based retail company from McKinsey & Company Inc., the management consulting firm, will also serve as Dayton Hudson's chief financial officer, a position that has been vacant since September. 
 "Mr. DeNero brings a set of skills and experiences to this position that will enable him to make important contributions to the leadership of our corporation," said Kenneth A. Macke, the company's chairman and chief executive.
While Mr. DeNero, 45, has worked with retail clients during his tenure at McKinsey, he said he had been hired for his skills as a strategic and operational planner. He headed the consulting firm's Operating Company Strategy Practice for five years.
Mr. DeNero has been with McKinsey since 1973, most recently as a senior partner in its Los Angeles office. He will move to Minneapolis with his wife, Nancy, and 11-year-old son, John, while his daughter, Karen, 17, will head to Duke University.
Before joining McKinsey, Mr. DeNero was an officer in the Navy and worked with another consulting firm. He is a graduate of Amherst College and received a master's degree in business administration from Stanford University.
McKinsey has not done any work for Dayton Hudson.
Mr. DeNero said he would act as a member of the senior management, "deciding on and implementing and accomplishing strategies and operations to address the issues the company is facing."
He said it was too early for him to comment on what some of those issues were. The company has been hit by the weak economy in California, which accounts for more than 50 percent of sales at Mervyn's, a purveyor of moderately priced clothing.
Profit margins at the company's Target division, the discount store chain that has driven Dayton Hudson's business recently, are under pressure because prices in Target stores have been deliberately lowered to compete with Wal-Mart and K Mart.
The purchase of Marshall Field's, a department store company, for $1.1 billion in 1990 also added high-yield debt to the company's balance sheet.
During 1991, several key Dayton Hudson executives left the company. Target's president, Warren Feldberg, joined Marshall's as chief executive, while George Jones, executive vice preesident, left to become president and chief executive at Rose's Stores. Two senior vice presidents at Target also left last year.
"While Target has always been good at developing backup management, these losses come at a time when the company is embarking on a fast-track expansion plan," wrote Wayne Hood and Diana Pilotis, retail analysts at Prudential Securities, in a report on the company issued in January.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Mixed in Light Day And Gold Drops Worldwide

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mixed on world currency markets yesterday in extremely light, uneventful dealings.
Gold prices declined worldwide. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $349.80 a troy ounce, off $1.40 from Friday. The Republic National Bank said gold slid $1.45 an ounce to a late bid price of $349.75. 
 Analysts said currency trading was dull. "It appeared as if there was virtually no business taking place," said Richard Levine, a foreign exchange broker at Merrill Lynch Futures Inc.
The dollar advanced against the Japanese yen. Mr. Levine said the "only thing worth noting about the session was the absence of further intervention by the Bank of Japan."
Last week the Bank of Japan stepped in and sold dollars for yen in an attempt to prop up the Japanese currency.
But with the dollar piercing the 128.50-yen level without touching off central bank action, traders said it appeared the United States currency would soon move even higher against the yen.
Mr. Levine cited structural changes in the Japanese economy that point to a "growth recession" there as factors weighing on the yen. "All their economic numbers that were so wildly positive in the 1980's are coming into line" as Japan catches up with a global economic downturn, he said.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.61 yen, to a closing 129.26 yen. Later in London, it was quoted at 129.10 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 129.20 yen, up from 128.95 yen on Friday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.7473, from $1.7470 late Friday. In New York, it cost $1.7467 to buy one pound, more expensive than Friday's $1.7400.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.6528 German marks, down from 1.6590; 1.4935 Swiss francs, down from 1.5020; 5.6185 French francs, down from 5.6390; 1,240.00 Italian lire, down from 1.243.75, and 1.1892 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1868.
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $349.65 a troy ounce, from $351.85 late Friday. In Zurich, it fell to a closing bid of $349.80 an ounce from $351.75. In Hong Kong, gold fell $3.59 an ounce to close at $350.80.
Silver prices were mixed. On the Comex in New York, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $4.090 a troy ounce, down from $4.093 on Friday. But in London it rose to a late bid of $4.11 from $4.10.

Odd Economics Of Russian Cars

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

DATELINE: TOGLIATTI, Russia

 BODY:
ZHUGULIS and Ladas, Russian cars that look like Fiats, roll off the assembly line at the Vaz Auto Works every few minutes. Despite huge public demand for new cars, this steady, unhurried pace has not risen in years and does not seem likely to now. The workday remains two shifts, not three. And twice a day, the lights dim, the mile-long assembly line stops cold and thousands of workers take 45 minutes to eat.
But underachieving at the commonwealth's largest auto maker has its payoff. If a General Motors or a Ford were to increase car prices by 750 percent in a single day, as Vaz did on Jan. 2, they would undoubtedly suffer a severe drop in sales. Vaz cars are selling as well as ever -- the difference being that while American auto companies make more cars than Americans buy, the Russians don't begin to meet the demand within the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
 "Ten million people want new cars, and among these people, more than enough can afford to pay the higher prices," said Nikolai A. Glushkov, deputy general director of Vaz, which makes 700,000 of the 1.2 million cars manufactured annually in the old Soviet Union.
The upshot is that people fight to buy each new car. Never mind that Vaz models now cost from 140,000 to 220,000 rubles - roughly $1,400 to $2,200 - up from less than 20,000 rubles, or $200, on Jan. 1. A few even travel to the huge Vaz works in this Volga River city 700 miles east of Moscow in hopes of somehow snagging cars before they are shipped to customers who signed up for them years ago.
Still others go to Russia's new commodity exchanges, where Vaz now offers nearly 14,000 cars a year at whatever price the market will bear. Lately, a four-door compact has been auctioned for 700,000 rubles, or $7,000, an indication of what car prices would be if Vaz's management and the Russian Government had not agreed to limit the price increase to only 750 percent.
So why not let the price shoot up to 700,000 rubles, and then float down as buyers at that level make their purchases and disappear? Mr. Glushkov's firm answer is that Vaz has a social goal: to provide cars for the average Russian. Letting the price float freely would compromise that goal.
Why not, then, raise output so that the 10 million potential customers can buy vehicles without having to wait so long? Satisfying demand by increasing production, as would occur in a free market, would make buyers less willing to pay high prices. The rationale, as offered by Mr. Glushkov, a 42-year-old former physicist, and other executives, is revealing.
Using the computer system installed by Fiat, when the Italian company built Vaz for the Soviet Union in the late 1960's, they find that the current average car price of 150,000 rubles yields a profit of about 30,000 rubles a car, after subtracting the cost of materials, parts, labor and taxes. Higher production might threaten this profit by chipping away at the price. Even though they could produce many more cars and still not begin to satisfy demand, they fear that more production would somehow mean lower prices per car, forcing Vaz to cut costs, which would mean shrinking its labor force of more than 200,000 people. That, Vaz's managers are not yet ready to do.
"While we still have the opportunity, we choose the easier way," said Sergei V. Zhiltov, the chief financial officer. "We maintain profits by raising prices rather than reducing costs."
There is another obstacle to higher production: parts shortages. Since late summer, cars have come off the assembly line without a bumper or a front grille or some other part. Across a street from the main plant, a huge lot is nearly filled with several thousand snow-covered cars awaiting some missing item before they can be shipped.
Most of the shortages result from the political turmoil, an obstacle that Vaz's managers say they are solving by going around politicians. "We are establishing direct relations with the companies that supply us in Russia and in other republics, and no longer operating through ministries," Vladimir I. Tikhonov, a production chief, said.
But Mr. Glushkov acknowledges that even with enough supplies, and the reinvestment of profits in labor-saving robots, a step now being taken, there is still not much incentive to raise production. That prod would come only if Vaz and the smaller Russian car makers lost their monopoly, said Rair Simonyan, a Russian economist.
One way to dismantle the monopoly would be through more imports. Foreign cars can be legally imported, but their cost in dollars is prohibitive. The more likely next step would be foreign investment -- for a Fiat or a Honda to build an auto factory. But no foreign company has yet found the Russian market worth the huge investment. Even Fiat's plan to buy an ownership stake in Vaz has been put on hold.
So Vaz's managers have a free hand, for now. Until you get foreign competition or other competitive pressures, Mr. Simonyan said, "you won't get an increase in production here."

Welcome Glimpse Of Summer

BYLINE: By BERNADINE MORRIS

 BODY:
Hooray for summer!
After the fizz of spring fashions, summer clothes look positively wholesome. These are the styles that will be in the stores in May and June, when vacations and long weekends loom ahead, when attention is divided between surviving in the heat of the city and playing at the beach or in the country. 
 Designers' solutions are eminently simple. Two of them are offering clothes that are uncomplicated, easy and cool. Isaac Mizrahi concentrates on cotton. Donna Karan alternates between silk and linen.
Colors are quiet, not distracting. At Isaac Mizrahi, there are groups of beige, blue, red and black. Donna Karan likes yellow, white, navy and green.
In the all-American spirit of sportswear, pieces are interchangeable. A white linen tailored jacket by Ms. Karan is quite sober in itself -- or with matching linen pants. It develops a little snap when worn with a short wrap skirt embroidered in white soutache and combined with a cotton blouse knotted at the middle to show the midriff.
 
Short or Long
 Mr. Mizrahi is serious about offering "something for everybody."
Do you prefer short skirts? He has them -- albeit a smidgen longer than they were last summer.
Want to try out some long ones? He has them with plenty of fullness or cigarette slim.
"There's no way we can tell women who have just found out how mobile they can be in short skirts to switch to long ones," he said, reflecting the non-dictatorial understanding mood of designers at the moment. "But women who want a chance to try something new will have an opportunity."
So he has suits with familiar tiny skirts, and suits with skirts that cover the knees. Every designer has pants, narrow or wide, signaling further emphasis on trousers for the next season, the most important of the fashion year, fall and winter. The reasoning here is that women who don't have a big conviction about which hem length they prefer will turn to pants, a safe solution. Comfortable and convenient, too.
The Karan approach to warm-weather dressing includes loose, easy shapes, like a big shirt that descends almost to the floor, or a poncho embellished with gold hand-painted motifs to wear at home or at the beach. Both are presented over stretch pants.
 
Sundress for Day or Night

The shoulder-baring sundress that can also be dazzling at dinner is another possible component of summer wardrobes. In the spirit of diversity, this is offered in long and short versions, with either slender or full skirts.
The backbone of summer wardrobes is still the suit. To make it look fresh, Mr. Mizrahi offers it with full puffed sleeves or a cool scooped neck. The Karan innovation is a zipper down the back of a jacket with a diagonal fold across the front; other zippers are concealed in the side seam. The new closures are all in the interest of clarity and smoothness, Ms. Karan said. They also give the jacket the uncluttered look the designer considers so desirable.
"The perfect summer wardrobe is about simplification," she said. "It's about looking pulled together in an effortless, comfortable way."
The versatility of the suit is welcome at a time of recession. Not only can the jacket be worn with skirts or pants, it can also accompany dresses and, depending on its accessories, can move from office to dinner. For these reasons, designers see no waning of its popularity as a key wardrobe component.

HEADLINE: ON TENNIS;
Court Technology Goes On-Line

BYLINE: By Robin Finn

 BODY:
After a querulous semifinal outing recently in Chicago, where she later made history by securing her 158th career title, Martina Navratilova mused on the outbursts tennis professionals often direct at the linesmen who pass judgment on their shots. "Until you have robots instead of players, these arguments are going to happen," she said, and shrugged.
Actually, there's a more realistic technological innovation at hand, one that could cause linesmen to go the way of the white tennis ball, and it's already pitting tennis traditionalists against the computer-programmed perfectionists. 
 The alternate solution to player-
linesman piques is one in which robot surrogates don't hit the balls but do call the lines. The system made its debut in semi-secrecy last week at the U.S. Pro Indoor in Philadelphia.
There, unbeknownst to most players and linesmen because it was buried beneath the Supreme court surface, the Sensor Courts system was tested by the ATP Tour. It was the first time that the invention, which uses a digital pattern recognition system to track the bounce of a tennis ball, had been activated under tournament conditions.
The dubious charms of Nintendo-style tennis, where the computer won't make a peep in the umpire's ear unless the player's shot is out of bounds, has arrived at a projected cost of approximately $35,000 per court per event. According to the Sensor Courts brochure, it even has the unofficial blessing of the game's renowned expert on the foibles of linesmen, John McEnroe.
That doesn't mean it will be seen again soon. The technology may be ready, but as yet no other tournament has agreed to use it, the ATP's board of directors has not approved use of the system, and the women's tour has yet to even agree to test it. One of the system's developers estimates it is two years away from regular usage.
In Philadelphia, linesmen and chair umpires made the calls, but behind the scenes, a computer was doing the same job. According to the computer, which supposedly is 99.9 percent correct, its human counterparts were on the money with 92 to 93 percent of their calls, not bad for the naked eye.
According to one of the system's developers, Russ Kussack, as well as several umpires and the honorary tournament chairman, Marilyn Fernberger, Sensor Courts performed like a pro. Unlike an Israeli system that's applying the technique of Scud missile tracking to tennis but isn't ready for the courts, this Florida-based version is installation-compatible with any hard court. Unlike an Australian competitor that traces the lines of the court with an electromagnetic field and responds only to specially designed tennis balls, Sensor Courts uses normal balls.
"Just pop open a can and flip the switch," said Kussack. "Not one of the umpires has objected to it. They come down from the chair after a match and ask us how they did."
Kussack was allowed to chat his product up to the media, but players were forbidden by ATP Tour officials in Philadelphia to observe the system. The courtside monitoring of the line-calling device was carried out with such discretion that, said semifinalist Brad Gilbert, "I thought the person with the headphones in the front row was listening to tunes or something."
Gilbert was in favor of a switch to computerized courts, so long as it can be done consistently and economically. But Pete Sampras, apparently a classicist in tennis philosophy as well as form, said replacing linesmen represents too great a sacrifice.
"I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings," said Sampras, who did little more than raise his eyebrows over suspect calls in the course of winning the Philadelphia event, "but I think you'd be giving up a human part of the game for accuracy that isn't really so much better than what we've already got. I don't mind that every call isn't perfect. And I don't know what it would be like to watch John McEnroe on a court with no linespeople. You can't argue with a machine."
Too, you can't yet install any computerized system of this ilk on anything other than hard courts and Supreme. Clay and grass aren't conducive to being pinned down by computer technology. That means players might be asked to play the futuristic way one week, treading a network of computer signals, and the old-fashioned way the next, with linesmen hollering "fault" and "out." Gilbert said that makes for perhaps too great an adjustment.
Dana Loconto, an ATP Tour umpire, is no stranger to computer innovations. His hand-held computer scorecard, a creation that allows umpires to get rid of their pencils and erasers, will be de riguer on the tour after its formal introduction next month in Key Biscayne, Fla. Loconto liked Sensor Courts, but he envisioned an obvious drawback: with no linesmen to berate, players will vent their spleen on the umpire.
"It's accurate, but it ain't human," said Loconto, "and we've got to assess what it will do to the game as we've known it. And how expensive is it, and how will it affect the linespeople if they only work the grass and clay circuit -- will they be less sharp because they have less work?"
Kussack admitted that, "Maybe I'm optimistic," but added, "I would say the reality of eliminating linespeople is just two to three years away."
The next test of Sensor Courts, and its peers, will be whether the game of tennis is so broken that it takes a computer to fix it. Ninety-three percent accuracy is no glitch.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
$1 Million Men a Dime a Dozen

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Continuing to forge stunning new economic ground, major league baseball clubs will pay more than 40 percent of their players $1 million or more this year. Barring trades, the Yankees will have the greatest number of those players on any one team, 16.
With the salary-arbitration season completed and only lower-paid players left to be signed, 273 players are set to earn $1 million or more in 1992, a 21 percent increase over the 226 who were in that position at the close of salary arbitration a year ago. 
 Based on a total of 650 players on the 26 opening-day rosters (although a few of the millionaires will open on the disabled list), 42 percent will earn $1 million or more.
 
A $4 Million First
 This will be the first season that any player earns $4 million or more, and 22 are scheduled to soar to that plateau, including Danny Tartabull of the Yankees and Ruben Sierra of Texas at $5 million or more and Bobby Bonilla of the Mets beyond $6 million. The figures include salary and the pro-rated share of a signing bonus and any other guaranteed payment.
Except for third base, the Yankees could field a starting lineup of million-dollar players, complete with a five-man starting pitching rotation and a three-man relief corps. A year ago, the Yankees had 11 players at or over the $1 million level.
Gene Michael, the Yankees' general manager, chose not to dwell on the number of million-dollar players.
"That's coincidental," said the former shortstop, whose highest salary as a player was $62,000. "We're not No. 1 on the payroll. That's the way I look at it. We're in the upper third, but we're not No. 1."
By comparison, the Mets, with the year's highest-paid player, Bonilla at $6.1 million, have 11 million-dollar players but are in position to have the highest payroll at more than $44 million. They have a major-league-high seven players who will earn more than $3 million; the Yankees have only two such players.
Boston, Toronto and Los Angeles all have 15 players at $1 million or more; Oakland and Cincinnati have 14 apiece. In all, nine National League teams and eight American League teams are in double digits in the category.
 
Cleveland's Frugality
 Cleveland, whose winter activity seemed geared to emerging with the lowest major league payroll, is the only team with no millionaires. The Indians' highest-paid player is Felix Fermin at $950,000. The teams closest to the Indians in this regard are the Houston Astros and the Montreal Expos, each with four.
For the second consecutive year, the number of players with salaries between $1 million and $2 million decreased, dropping from 125 in 1990 to 102 last year to 95 this year. The higher levels, however, continued to escalate, reflecting the rapid rise that has club owners reeling.
The biggest leap in players who earn between $1 million and $2 million came in 1990, the total rising from 86 to 125. Last year, the most dramatic escalation occurred in the $2 million to $3 million group (27 to 93) and the $3 million to $4 million group (1 to 31).
This year, the $2 million to $3 million group rose modestly to 109, and the $3 million to $4 million group to 47, but the most significant change came from $4 million up, where 22 players suddenly soared. Thirteen of those 22 players are hitters, 9 pitchers. Last year, Darryl Strawberry of Los Angeles was the highest paid at $3.8 million. This year, 23 players have higher salaries.
The Mets have four players at $4 million or more (Bonilla, Dwight Gooden, David Cone, Eddie Murray), followed by the Pittsburgh Pirates with three (Barry Bonds, Doug Drabek, Andy Van Slyke). Two teams have two apiece: the Boston Red Sox (Frank Viola, Roger Clemens) and the Texas Rangers (Sierra, Nolan Ryan).

"1992 Salary Breakdown"
 This breakdown is based on the number of players who will be on opening-day rosters, 650. After opening day, the number will grow, depending on disabled-list activity.

 	 	$6 million or more	0.2%	$5 million-$6 million	0.3%	$4 million-$5 million	2.9%	$3 million-$4 million	7.2%	$2 million-$3 million	16.8%	$1 million-$2 million	14.6%	Under $1 million	58%	 The breakdown of the number of players earning $1 million or more 1987-92. Figures for this year and last are based on salaries at the end of the salary arbitration period; figures for the first four years are based on opening-day rosters (last year the total number dropped by three by opening day): % change equals how much greater than previous year.

HEADLINE: BOXING: NOTEBOOK;
Aging Bull II: First Foreman, Now Holmes

BYLINE: By PHIL BERGER

 BODY:
Evander Holyfield's promoter, Dan Duva, confirmed it yesterday. Holyfield, the undisputed heavyweight champion, has chosen to make his next title defense against 42-year-old Larry Holmes. All that's left to do is to complete the deal and that could happen before the week is out.
Holyfield's decision has forced Riddick Bowe and George Foreman to reconsider their future plans. Both fighters had been mentioned as possible foes for Holyfield but now must map out a new course. 
 After Holmes upset Ray Mercer on Feb. 7, promoter Bob Arum said he wanted to match Holmes against Foreman. But with Holmes now otherwise occupied, Arum, who promotes both Holmes and Foreman, says big George will follow up his April 11 match against Alex Stewart by fighting again in July.
"Against a good opponent," said Arum. "Maybe Ray Mercer or Tommy Morrison."
Bowe's manager, Rock Newman, said that his man would have a tuneup fight soon and then seek a more consequential bout, against, say, Michael Moorer, Razor Ruddock or the 43-year-old Foreman.
Holyfield's choice of Holmes is hard to justify. Although it was the correct business decision -- an easy fight for significant money -- it was the wrong boxing move.
Holyfield earned $8 million in winning the title from Buster Douglas. He earned $20 million defending it against Foreman, and more than $7 million defending it against Bert Cooper in November. So what if he is guaranteed around $19 million for fighting Holmes? The truth is Holyfield, at this point in his career, is recession-proof.
At a time when Mike Tyson is gone from center stage, the heavyweight champion ought to be more intent on showing what magnitude of fighter he is, through a challenging bout against someone like Bowe. A matchup like that would have certainly helped invigorate the boxing scene. This one won't.
 
Jackson Wants Attention
 For too long, Julian Jackson has been an afterthought for Tyson's promoter, Don King.
While King was expending his formidable energies on Tyson, Jackson -- as potent a puncher as there is in the middle divisions -- was becoming this decade's Azumah Nelson.
In the 1980's, Nelson, the current World Boxing Council super-featherweight champion, was a fighter whose conspicuous talent withered on the promotional vine because of King's fixation with heavyweights.
Now that Tyson appears to be headed to jail, the 31-year-old Jackson (43-1, 41 knockouts) has stepped forward to say it's his turn to get a shot at the big money.
Jackson was in New York recently as part of a public relations blitz ordered by Gov. Alexander A. Farrelly of the Virgin Islands. Farrelly directed the New York promotion company, Development Counsellors International, which promotes tourism in the Virgin Islands, to muster some recognition for Jackson, who is from St. Thomas.
"The result is that Julian's done more media through our firm in a week than he did in the five years previous," said Rob DeRocker of Development Counsellors. "I think the promoters have not put as much emphasis on Julian as he deserves."
For Jackson, the W.B.C. middleweight champion, that lack of attention has had its economic consequences. Although he has knocked out Terry Norris, Buster Drayton and Herol Graham, he has made scant wages as a world champion.
"My biggest purse was $150,000 for fighting Francisco De Jesus in 1989, when I was W.B.A. junior middleweight champion and for defending the middleweight title last year against Dennis Milton," said Jackson. "I'm not pleased with what is happening."
For Jackson, who is married and has six children, boxing has enabled him to overcome difficult beginnings. He was one of five children raised in a single-parent family.
"My mother, Rosa, was on welfare," said Jackson. "I had low self-esteem. Other kids would come to school with their father and get a hug. With me, there was a lack of a father. I felt as if I was not wanted. It put me in a shell. I kept to myself. At times, the other kids would tease me -- tell me I'm ugly, tell me I'm a dummy."
At 14, Jackson dropped into a boxing gym and was befriended by trainer Willie George.
"He opened up my eyes and my attitude toward myself," said Jackson. "We became best friends. Even in those times he treated me as though I was a champion. If he heard I'd climbed a fruit tree, he'd say, 'You shouldn't do that. You'll damage your hands. Those hands are precious.' He made me feel as if I was wanted."
 
Leon Spinks, Too? Leon Spinks, Too
 Leon Spinks's often-rumored comeback is, apparently, finally upon us. Ernie Terrell, a former heavyweight contender, is promoting Spinks versus Andre Crowder this Friday at the Engineers Local #150 Union Hall in Countryside, Ill. Spinks, the 38-year-old former heavyweight champion, hasn't fought since May 1988 when he was knocked out by a Canadian fighter, Tony Morrison, in one round. . . . The declining economy has hit Hector Camacho, the World Boxing Organization junior-welterweight champion. Camacho had agreed to defend his title against Oba Carr, but expected to get $1 million for the match. "That's what his contract called for in championship fights," said Jim Levien, Camacho's attorney. "But I guess the money was not out there." When Camacho turned down a $500,000 offer from his promoter, Dan Duva, the bout went to purse bids. A Detroit-based promoter, Bill Kozerski, had the winning bid of $500,000, which means that Camacho's share would be a "mere" $375,000 by purse-bid strictures: three-quarters to the champion, the rest to the challenger. So don't be surprised if the W.B.O. strips Camacho of his title for not facing Carr, who is the mandatory challenger.

HEADLINE: Fake Fixes for the Economy

 BODY:
America suffers from two economic problems at once: in the short term, recession, and in the long term, stagnation. President Bush and the House tax-writing committee propose to remedy both with tax cuts. The Senate Finance Committee will propose a bill to do the same this week. Each bill will promise to spur recovery -- and long-term growth. Each promise clanks with falsity.
The sponsors mix up the short- and long-term needs of the economy and thereby provide for neither. The bills provide no quick-hitting burst of tax cuts or spending hikes; they offer no permanent incentives for saving and investment. 
 This election-year fakery, on the part of both parties, is worse than false. It is fraudulent, masking a hodgepodge of tax breaks for special interests. All three bills deserve to die.
Short term, each plan promises to fight recession, primarily by cutting taxes of middle-class families. But each plan, claiming allegiance to the 1990 budget law, promises to keep a tight lid on the deficit in the immediate future. Deficits do matter -- but only if they mount up steadily over time and are used to pay for excessive consumption. One-shot tax cuts pose no such threat. They would raise consumption only temporarily, perhaps enough to help the economy claw out of recession, and thus should be bold. But these timid proposals flop lamely like dying fish.
The President's plan, and the expected Senate plan, err in more fundamental ways. Both would grant permanent tax relief for middle-class families. That would eliminate revenue even after the recession ends. Worse, the Senate version may actually exclude relief for families too poor to pay taxes. That would, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, exclude a quarter of the nation's children.
What these plans encourage is not growth but giveaways. For example, all three bills would shower rich subsidies on real estate investors. That might make sense if the economy needed more buildings. But the tax code already overly subsidizes real estate -- by granting virtually unlimited deduction for mortgage payments. Besides, what the economy needs to grow is more equipment and better-trained workers.
Similarly misguided are benighted subsidies for capital gains -- the profit that investors earn on the sale of stocks, bonds and other investments. The President would cut taxes on old investments that could not possibly spur future growth. The House version is a only a tad more responsible. It proposes indexing capital gains -- subtracting out gains due to inflation before applying the tax.
Indexing capital gains sounds right. But only if Congress also indexes interest payments and other kinds of income too. Piecemeal indexation could do more harm than good by driving investors to unproductive projects.
So much for fakery that cannot accomplish what is promised. What's even worse are gimmicks that will damage the economy. The President recommends new subsidies for retirement savings whose cost will mushroom over time. Senator Lloyd Bentsen is pushing similar ideas on the Senate Finance Committee. One day several years from now, Congress will have to pay for such giveaways -- either by increasing taxes sharply or gouging valued public investment.
Of the three proposals, the House bill is the least offensive. But what a grim choice that both parties and both branches offer America: fake, false or fraudulent.

HEADLINE: Life or Death for Russian Children

BYLINE: By Arthur Hartman; Arthur Hartman, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union from 1981 to 1988, is a member of the Russian Winter Campaign international committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
No aspect of the cataclysmic economic breakdown afflicting the former Soviet people cries out for help as poignantly as the probable fate of millions of children, should the West not give them emergency medical aid.
Americans can trust that U.S. medical professionals who administer vaccinations and medications are competent, that hospitals and clinics are sanitary, the needles sterile, the drugs safe. 
 Parents in the former Soviet Union do not have this assurance. The new commonwealth can produce only 15 to 20 percent of the medical supplies it needs, and it does not have enough hard currency to import them. In addition, a frighteningly large proportion of medical personnel are not well trained. Most hospitals are filthy, dark and cold. Equipment breaks down and cannot be replaced.
Aid is forthcoming, but the need is so great that more is required. America is joining other industrialized democracies in helping at governmental and private levels. Through the U.S. Provide Hope project, planes are taking supplies to the new commonwealth. Now, through the privately run Russian Winter Campaign, American governors are mobilizing to send at least one planeload each (about 100 tons per trip) of medicine and food in the next 60 to 90 days.
Beginning next week, Soviet and U.S. military cargo planes will transport some supplies, with the U.S. Government supporting the effort by covering fuel and transportation costs. When all is said and done, the private sector will probably end up delivering twice the amount of needed relief as the U.S. Government.
At stake is not just saving human lives, but strengthening democracy in the new commonwealth. The medical conditions, and the critical need they reflect, indicate a deeper political healing process that must take place.
Health care facilities are contributing to the spread of hepatitis B and H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. Because of shortages, medical workers are forced to re-use syringes and needles, and they lack sterilization equipment. Because of this, parents are choosing not to have their children immunized. Moreover, the World Health Organization recently tested the 40 vaccines produced in the commonwealth and found 27 of them to be "unfit for human or animal use." Vaccines are often stored past their effective dates and without refrigeration.
According to Murray Feshbach, professor of population studies at Georgetown University, 95 percent of a population must be vaccinated against a disease to prevent an epidemic. Soviet children, many already suffering from vitamin deficiency and the effects of environmental degradation, are vulnerable to the spread of infectious disease. We know that in 1989 one-quarter of Soviet children who should have been vaccinated against polio were not; one-fifth were not immunized against diphtheria, and one third did not get a whooping cough vaccination.
The incidence of infectious diseases in the former Soviet Union is already much higher than in the West. Some 120,000 new cases of tuberculosis have been reported annually in the Soviet Union. In 1990, 312 people were reported to have developed polio, a disease virtually wiped out in the U.S. Seven hundred cases of diphtheria were reported in Moscow alone in 1990, compared with one to three cases a year in the entire United States. A breakdown in sanitation may be responsible for more deaths related to paratyphoid, typhoid and hepatitis A.
The people of the former Soviet Union have inspired the world with their courage in struggling to create a stable democracy out of the ruin of Communism. These same people need our assistance now to help them keep their children alive and healthy.
To balk at providing assistance at a time of desperate need could doom the fragile democracy and the peaceful world order. The children of the former Soviet Union, to whom we can give the gift of life, and our own children, to whom we can give the gift of peace, deserve no less.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Mideast: Forgotten Realities

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
The other day I picked up the newspaper and read an article on Israel. I could not believe what I was reading.
The article, by Cynthia Ozick on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times, actually set forward some of the reasoning and historic logic behind the Israeli positions about settlements, the West Bank and peace talks. Right there in print was an article that you might even call pro-Israeli. 
 I do not mean to be sardonic. In the American press, TV and politics, sympathetic exposition of the Israeli viewpoint has become so rare that to come across it is a bit of a shock.
What's going on -- why is yesterday's ally today's villain?
One reason is the propaganda success of the intifada, virtually finished on the West Bank but still playing big in daily television reruns. Two: The great talent of the Shamir Government's political-public relations apparatus -- putting the country's worst face forward.
Third, Israel's policing policies on the West Bank may be historically mild for an occupying power but sit wrong in the stomach when carried out by a democracy expected to be decent even in danger.
But let's not fool ourselves. Those propaganda and human rights issues skirt the heart of the demonization of Israel in the United States -- whose Government meanwhile is lifting sanctions against high-tech sales to Communist China even as Beijing peddles missiles to the Mideast, and which embraces Syria for brutalizing Lebanon into submission.
The central reason is that President Bush has made it dramatically clear to Americans that he dislikes and distrusts the Israeli Government and that so should they. In an infamous press conference last September he appealed for the support of Americans against Israel and its American supporters.
That made a lot of other Americans mad at Israel and frightened some American Jews into silence. Flocks of politicians once enamored of Israel took off in flight.
American journalists long hateful toward Israel still celebrate in print. Those journalists who claimed friendship for Israel -- provided Jerusalem obeyed them -- passionately urge Washington to stick it hard to Israel with severe economic pressure, A.K.A. blackmail. With friends like that you don't need enemies, because you will be dead anyway.
And much coverage from the Mideast abandoned fairness standards -- not by overcovering the Arab case but by forgetting there was an Israeli case.
So here are a few brief reminders of reality:
Israel is a democracy. Democracies cannot go to war without public support. Dictatorships can, and do. That is the root of Middle Eastern wars.
Israel is the only country in the world that from the day of its birth was a constant military target -- and still is.
Israel did not seize the West Bank from Palestinians. Israelis took it from Jordan in 1967, after Jordan attacked Israel. Two decades earlier Jordan grabbed and occupied it, drove out Jews, tyrannized Arabs and then just annexed the whole place.
Israel has offered a Palestinian settlement for 14 years under the same step-by-step framework now the umbrella for the peace process -- 14 wasted years of intransigent Arab refusal.
Israelis -- Likud, Labor or coalition -- and Palestinians must deal with West Bank problems as part of the negotiations. To force Israel, as the U.S. is doing, to choose now between surrendering on settlements or surrendering on the hope of helping Russian immigrants will bring more blackmail later. No Israeli government can survive that -- nor can negotiations.
But, Palestinian agreement or not, there will be no reliable peace for Israelis as long as the Mideast is ruled almost solely by Israel-hating, Jew-hating dictatorships like Syria, Libya, Saudi Arabia, the Sudan, Iran and assorted other tyrannies.
Also: The greatest danger of Mideast war comes not from Israeli-Palestinian disputes but from conflict between Muslim nations -- the Iran-Iraq war, the Syrian conquest of Lebanon, Muslim terrorism against Muslim, and Iraq's adventure in the Persian Gulf.
Simple realities. Once, Americans and their Presidents knew and remembered them. I dimly recall a quotation somewhere about how the meaning of friendship is constancy. I will look it up, sometime.

HEADLINE: Third World Growth Poses Threat to Ozone

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As the new evidence of ozone layer damage reported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration shows, we have yet to experience the full impact of chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone-destroying emissions on the earth's atmosphere.
A ban on chlorofluorocarbons is a first step toward reducing even worse atmospheric damages. But with the world's population growing by 95 million a year, and 90 percent of this growth occurring in the world's poorest countries, future human demands threaten to outpace environmental regulations. 
 As "The Ozone Hole Over Mr. Bush's Head" (editorial, Feb. 5) notes, in 1990 the White House refused a request from the developing world for $20 million to finance conversions of CFC's to safer chemicals. Currently, developing nations produce 17 percent of all CFC's; by early next century, their CFC production will rise to 29 percent of the world's total. Meanwhile, India hopes to provide its citizens with 300 million refrigerators by early in the next century.
China plans to expand CFC production tenfold by the year 2000, since only one in three of China's 250 million households has a refrigerator. Although both countries are now willing to join in CFC reduction plans, economic demands and environmental planning present conflicts here and in the rest of the world's fastest growing and poorest countries.
In 1984 the Reagan Administration turned its back on international family planning efforts, stating that population growth was a "neutral phenomenon," later withdrawing financing from the United Nations Population Fund, the largest multilateral supporter of family planning programming. President Bush, once an advocate of family planning, has continued the population policies of his predecessor.
At this crucial juncture, it is vital that industrialized countries alter their own policies of consumption and support initiatives in the developing world for population growth reduction as well as efforts to preserve the environment.

HEADLINE: College Will Soon Be Only for the Few

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Unless our institutions of higher education significantly change the way they operate, the children of most families will be unable to attend college by the end of this century (front page, Feb. 3). Our studies at the Massachusetts Higher Education Assistance Corporation show that it could cost today's kindergartner more than $300,000 when he or she is ready to attend a top private university in 13 years.
Public universities will be cheaper but still expensive: about $75,000 for the student and four times that amount for the taxpayer. As expensive as it sounds, it doesn't come close to covering the true costs of higher educaiton. At many private universities, tuition and fees cover less than one-half the actual cost of education. Thus the real cost to educate today's kindergartner will exceed $600,000. 
 A robust economy during the next decade could keep higher education affordable. But few economists are optimistic, and there will be stiff competition for public funds. Unless colleges and universities change in fundamental ways, by the start of the next century some campuses will resemble today's abandoned manufacturing plants.
Colleges that survive will be those that figure out how to restructure the delivery of their curriculum and administrative services at far less cost without sacrificing quality.
They must begin with administrative costs, the fastest growing segment of higher education budgets, according to the Pew Charitable Trust and the Department of Education. Major factors are increased demands to provide more staff to raise funds, recruit and counsel students, and respond to additional state and Federal regulations. There needs to be a willingness for government, students, parents, faculty and staff to accept less from the institution and to do more for it.
While there will always be a need for the great research universities, more colleges will need to specialize, appeal to more targeted market segments and eliminate duplication by sharing expensive facilities and top faculty. We can't afford unnecessary competition which, in higher education, drives prices upward.
Technology could play a central role in successful restructuring. Despite large investments in technology and the educational benefits derived from these expenditures (particularly from computers), technology has not yet transformed the way -- and cost -- of how courses are taught.
Higher education will have to make hard choices. It will not be possible to satisfy every need or respond to every constituent. The colleges that ask -- and answer -- basic questions about how to educate more cost-effectively will be the colleges that survive.

HEADLINE: Cooling With Sound: An Effort to Save Ozone Shield

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

 BODY:
AS fears mount that global depletion of the atmospheric ozone layer may lead to catastrophic medical and economic consequences, scientists and engineers are hastening development of new refrigeration technologies that do not depend on ozone-destroying chemicals and may even be more efficient than conventional cooling machines.
One of these technologies abandons the complicated moving parts of conventional refrigerators and uses sound energy blasted into a kind of organ pipe to achieve cooling. Developers of sound-driven refrigerators at Los Alamos National Laboratory, N.M., and the Naval Postgraduate School at Monterey, Calif., say such thermoacoustic devices could chill nitrogen to its liquefaction temperature of minus 320 degrees Fahrenheit, or cool the air in a room or car by only a few degrees. One of these new refrigeration devices was tested aboard last month's space shuttle mission. 
 Another of the new refrigeration technologies, also under study at Los Alamos, subjects liquids, rather than the gases used in existing refrigerators, to cycles of compression and expansion to move heat away from the objects being cooled.
The principal disadvantage of substituting such novel systems for conventional gas compressors in refrigerators and air-conditioners is cost, scientists and engineers agree. The American economy is currently dependent on devices using conventional refrigeration equipment, which will be extremely expensive to replace.
E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, the largest American manufacturer of the chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) compounds that are responsible for ozone depletion, estimates that 5,000 American businesses valued at $28 billion and employing 700,000 workers produce goods or services dependent at least in part on CFC's. If these businesses were abruptly forced to scrap equipment designed to use CFC's, manufacturers say, the expense of investing in entirely new systems could cause staggering economic hardship.
Leaders in the refrigeration industry assert, moreover, that chemical substitutes for CFC's used in conventional refrigerators and air-conditioners will make these machines less efficient, bulkier and shorter-lived. The poorer efficiency of CFC substitutes will make it harder for refrigerator makers to comply with new Federal efficiency standards, they say.
At the same time, new alarms are sounded nearly every day about the danger of continued manufacture and use of CFC's and some substitutes as refrigerants, thermal insulators, solvents and aerosol propellants. Environmental groups argue that the earth's protective ozone shield risks catastrophic depletion, and that even President Bush's recent decision to ban CFC production in the United States by Dec. 31, 1995, falls far short of the needs of the situation.
Underscoring their concern, a report in the current issue of the journal Science confirmed that a 50 percent thinning of the ozone layer over Antarctica in 1990 had far-reaching biological effects. Dr. Raymond C. Smith and Dr. Barbara B. Prezelin of the University of California at Santa Barbara, and their colleagues at the university's San Diego and San Francisco campuses and other institutions, found a direct link between the amount of ultraviolet radiation leaking through the ozone shield and the decline of phytoplankton -- the microscopic organisms that constitute the base of Antarctica's food chain. Every aspect of phytoplankton life was depressed, and the reproduction rate fell as much as 12 percent during the maximum thinning of the ozone layer.
One of the main objections by environmental groups to some of the chemicals scheduled to replace CFC's -- HCFC's and HFC's -- is that they may themselves pose problems and dangers.
The chemical family called HCFC's, like CFC's, contains chlorine in a form that can destroy stratospheric ozone. But HCFC compounds are less stable than CFC's and tend to break down in the lower atmosphere before they can diffuse to high enough altitudes to destroy ozone. Members of a second chemical family, the HFC's, contain only hydrogen, fluorine and carbon atoms, with no chlorine, and are therefore presumed to be harmless to the ozone layer.
But many experts are concerned for other reasons.
"We are not at all confident that even as temporary replacements these chemicals are viable alternatives to CFC's," said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer of the Environmental Defense Fund. "Their chemistry in the atmosphere is not well understood, and it is essential to look farther down the road than these interim stop-gap measures."
Liz Cook of the Friends of the Earth, another environmental organization, said that "HCFC's should be regarded only as a last resort" and that HFC's, while not ozone destroyers, may contribute to global warming and create fire hazards. Research should be directed toward new refrigeration technologies, she said, since "refrigeration and air-conditioning are the main nuts to crack."
Last week the Washington-based Institute for Energy and Environmental Research issued a report charging that HCFC's are "three to five times more damaging than industry and government claim," and that HCFC-22, in particular, should be banned along with the CFC's.
Some experts have proposed returning to the refrigerant gases that were used during the 1930's before the invention of CFC's. These included sulfur dioxide, a toxic gas that liquefies under pressure; ammonia, a gas that irritates the lungs, and various hydrocarbon compounds that posed fire and explosion hazards if released. Many easily liquefied gases that might otherwise serve as refrigerants are undesirable because they cause rapid corrosion of metal parts and seals, destroying the compressors and valves essential to conventional refrigerators. The invention of CFC's was regarded as a breakthrough because they are nontoxic, nonflammable, noncorrosive and practically indestructible in normal use.
Most refrigeration engineers say no new chemicals can ever rival CFC's as refrigerants in conventional refrigerators. But other chemicals would work as well or better than CFC's in some of the new technologies under study.
 
Refrigerator Workings
 An ordinary refrigerator or air-conditioner moves heat from the inside of a freezer or bedroom using a gas that readily conducts heat and can be easily liquefied.
The cycle begins when an electrically driven pump compresses the "working gas," thereby heating it. The gas is passed through a system called a heat exchanger, in which heat is removed from the gas and dumped outside the refrigerator or house. Thus cooled, the pressurized gas condenses to a liquid. The pressure is then released so that the liquid can rapidly evaporate, a process that sharply cools it. The chilled liquid, passing through the coils of a freezer or chiller, draws heat from the latter, and the evaporated cool gas returns to the compressor to renew the cycle.
Machines that work on this principle, called Rankine-cycle refrigerators, contain many moving parts, are expensive to build, and typically use CFC's or chemically similar substitutes, which are often vented to the atmosphere when machines are scrapped.
By contrast, the principle of thermoacoustic refrigeration, pioneered at Los Alamos National Laboratory in the 1980's by John C. Wheatley, Thomas Hofler, Steven L. Garrett, Gregory W. Swift and Albert Migliori, is deceptively simple.
 
Sound Moves Heat
 The great beauty of a thermoacoustic refrigerator, Dr. Swift said, is that it has no moving parts, aside from the diaphragm of its loudspeaker, and can use environmentally benign working gases. Although the design of these devices is becoming increasingly complex and subtle, the underlying principle is simple: a loudspeaker at the end of a tube emits an extremely loud note that resonates inside the gas-filled tube to form what is called an acoustic "standing wave" in which individual molecules of gas are in rapid oscillating motion while the wave as a whole does not move at all. Organ pipes and other wind instruments set up similar standing-wave resonances.
The gas molecules move back and forth at the same frequency as that of the loudspeaker at the end of the pipe, and as they move they act as microscopic workers in a bucket brigade, carrying heat away from the thinner regions of the standing wave toward its thickest bulge, its antinode. If a metal plate is placed within this antinode, the plate absorbs heat from the gas molecules and can conduct it away from the refrigerator, leaving cooled gas in its place. The cool gas, in turn, can draw heat away from refrigerators or air-conditioners.
"The note played by the thermoacoustic loudspeaker, about in the mid-range of human hearing, is so loud that it would destroy living tissue exposed to it," Dr. Swift said. "But the sound is almost completely confined in the resonating tube. The noise you hear outside is less than the noise of an electric fan."
One thermoacoustic refrigerator, built under a Navy contract by Dr. Garrett and Dr. Hofler, both now at the Naval Postgraduate School, was tested aboard a space shuttle flight last month, where it reduced the temperature of an object under test by 212 degrees Fahrenheit. By modifying the design, said John Adeff, a member of the research group, the device could be made to move much more heat over a smaller temperature range, a requirement of household refrigerators and air conditioners.
Just such a project is already far advanced, Dr. Garrett said. "NASA ruined a $50 million biological experiment in space because of a faulty refrigeration system," he said. "That led to a contract for us. What we're now building for General Electric under a NASA contract is an acoustic space refrigerator that could chill beer as well as experiments. It's virtually a household refrigerator."
Scientists still must probe the basic physics underlying thermoacoustic refrigeration, and its widespread use in commercial appliances is unlikely until the next century. "But there's good reason to believe it will work successfully and without the environmental disadvantages of today's systems," Dr. Swift said. "With $20 million and a few years, we could make thermoacoustic refrigeration a commercial reality."
 
Testing With Liquids
 The Los Alamos group is currently working on an entirely different refrigeration system, in which liquids rather than gases are compressed under enormous pressure and used to pump heat away from the interior of refrigerators or rooms.
"We generally think of water and other liquids as incompressible," Dr. Swift said, "but as a matter of fact, many liquids can be compressed under high pressure, and can be even more efficient than compressed gases in moving heat from one place to another."
In one version of the system, which was invented in the 1920's by an American, John Malone, Dr. Swift uses liquid carbon dioxide, an environmentally benign substance, at a pressure of 2,000 pounds per square inch. A Malone refrigerator, Dr. Swift explained, works on much the same principle as conventional refrigerators, except that it must be much more robust to confine the enormous pressure of its working fluid. Compression heats the liquid carbon dioxide as it would a gas, the heat is moved away, and the pressure is released, causing the liquid to cool.
"A Malone-cycle refrigerator must be much heavier and bulkier than ordinary units, and would probably be most useful as a plant refrigerator or for chilling water used to cool entire buildings," he said.
"Whatever happens," Dr. Garrett said, "the ozone depletion crisis has finally forced people and funding agencies to take a fresh look at a fascinating and often overlooked field of physics -- one that may soon begin solving a lot of big environmental problems."

HEADLINE: Envoy Says U.S. Has Plenty of Successes in Japan

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 24

 BODY:
At a time when the United States' relations with Japan are growing more rancorous and fears are mounting that some sort of a crisis is in the offing, one American in Tokyo is urging that the situation not be seen as worse than it really is.
"When people talk about a rapid deterioration in our relationship, I don't know quite what to make of it," said Michael H. Armacost, the United States Ambassador to Japan. "I'm concerned about these perceptions. At the official level, I must say that our relationship with Japan is good." 
 Among the trends cited by the Ambassador is the fact that American exports to Japan are growing, that the trade deficit has declined from a high of $57 billion to $43 billion, and that Washington and Tokyo agree on a host of political and diplomatic issues confronting the world today.
"People don't even comment on it, it's become so routine," he said of Japanese-American cooperation. Citing Kodak, Microsoft, Merck and other American companies that have done well in Japan, he said American businessmen should not stay out of Japan for "fear that it's just too hard."
"It's important that success stories be known because there are plenty of them," he said.
 
A Tough Critic of Japan
 Mr. Armacost, of course, has a job requiring him to emphasize the positive, in part to defend his own record in one of the most sensitive diplomatic posts in the world. But the Ambassador is also a tough critic of Japanese policies and practices.
Arriving here three years ago, he established a new tone of blunt advice to the Japanese and pressure to open up markets to American businesses. In the Japanese press, he became known as "Mr. Gai-atsu" -- the word for "foreign pressure" -- and it was hardly ever used as a compliment. But he won widespread praise from American business executives who felt that his predecessor, Mike Mansfield, the former Senate majority leader, had been a pushover for the Japanese economic juggernaut.
In a wide-ranging interview, Mr. Armacost said today that he did not feel especially torn over having to press Japan to do more, while defending Tokyo to Americans who feel that it has not done much at all.
"The Japanese market is a lot more open than many foreign critics are willing to acknowledge," he said. "It's not as open as many Japanese like to claim. So there's work yet to be done."
After President Bush's calamity-filled visit to Japan in January, many critics felt it was not surprising that the positive message got drowned out. Mr. Bush's decision to bring along a group of automobile company executives, they said, guaranteed that their carping would get most of the publicity.
 
Gates Are More Open
 Asked if the White House had blundered in its handling of the trip, Mr. Armacost, a big athletic man who played tennis with Mr. Bush and Emperor Akihito on the day the President got sick, folded his hands and brooded in silence for several seconds.
Then with a smile, he said, "Well, I don't think you'd expect me to answer that question as you've phrased it."
He added that "the jury is still out" since the trip may lead to greater market openings in Japan and more awareness among American companies that they can compete here if they try. The gates are more open now, he said, in wood products, glass, machinery, telecommunications and other areas.
"In our trade negotiations with the Japanese, there are some who say that the agreements are just cosmetic and that they don't accomplish anything," he said. "Look, we've still got a deficit. That's evidence that there's still work to be done. But we don't do ourselves credit by overlooking the fact that there are additional opportunities as a result of past negotiations."
In the areas of criticism, Mr. Armacost said winning trade concessions from Japan had been "much too hard" and had taken its toll by spreading the impression of Japan as a closed market.
He also expressed "great disappointment" that Tokyo had done nothing to break the impasse in the international trade negotiations known as the Uruguay Round. Japan's refusal to lift its total ban on rice imports -- a gesture of defiance to protect its beleaguered rice farmers, who produce rice that is more than six times the world price -- is generally felt by trade analysts to have contributed to refusals by other countries to compromise.
 
Japan's Support Needed
 "It's up to Japan, a country benefiting as much as any from the free trade regime, to contribute a full measure of support to assure that we get a successful result in that negotiation," Mr. Armacost said.
"But too often, the effort here is to avoid the blame for failure rather than do the things necessary for success," he added. "A country that wants to benefit from free trade in areas where it's competitive should also apply the principle to those sectors where its inefficiencies are great."
He said it was up to Japan's "political leadership" to break through the stranglehold of special interests on rice and other matters. "Japan isn't unique in having strong domestic interests affecting big trade negotiations," he said. "In fact, it's quite typical."
Mr. Armacost said Japan should be especially praised for lining itself up behind so many American or American-backed policies. These include support for the reconstruction of Cambodia and for emerging democracies in Eastern Europe and Central America.
Japan has stepped up its payment for the basing of more than 60,000 American troops on Japanese soil and backed the United States drive to isolate North Korea until it renounces nuclear weapons. A bill to have Japanese troops take part in United Nations peacekeeping operations, he said, "one hopes will be passed at some point."

HEADLINE: Group Invests $5 Million To Hedge Bets in Lottery

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RICHMOND, Feb. 24

 BODY:
There is a dream common among regular lottery players: to wait until the jackpot reaches an astronomical sum and then to buy every possible number, guaranteeing a winner.
Sure, it would cost millions of dollars. But the payoff would be much richer. 
 In Virginia this month, one investment group came tantalizingly close to cornering the market on all possible combinations of six numbers from 1 to 44. State lottery officials say that the group bought tickets for 5 million of a possible 7 million combinations, at $1 each, in a lottery with a $27 million jackpot. Only a lack of time prevented the group from buying tickets for the remaining 2 million combinations.
 
$1.3 Million a Year
 While no one has come forward with the one winning ticket in the Feb. 15 lottery, several clues point to the investment group, an Australian syndicate, as the winner. If that is so, the numbers 8, 11, 13, 15, 19 and 20 will yield a prize of $1.3 million a year for 20 years to the group.
Banking officials here say the money for the bulk purchase of Feb. 15 lottery tickets came from Australia. An Australian regulatory official also said a syndicate there had notified its investors that it had won an overseas jackpot. The winner has six months to claim the prize.
Virginia officials are worried enough about a repeat performance that they met today to debate a proposal that would block bulk sales of lottery tickets.
The governing board of the Virginia lottery held a public hearing today and received some criticism. Hans Smetona, a 22-year-old pizza deliveryman here, said, "No one wants to be in line behind anyone who's there for three or four days."
After the hearing, the lottery board adopted a recommendation to Gov. L. Douglas Wilder that sales agents be required to take orders from people in line before filling orders from absentee buyers. As a reason for the recommendation, officials cited the example of a store that put an out-of-order sign on its lottery terminal as an employee printed hundreds of tickets for the investors in the Feb. 15 lottery.
Executives of two retail chains that sold tickets in the Feb. 15 lottery to bulk purchasers said representatives of the investment group had visited them in the fall to discuss the logistics of a large lottery purchase. A. C. Miller, president of the Miller Oil Company, which owns one retail chain that sold $600,000 in tickets, the Miller Mart convenience stores, identified one representative as Anithalee Alex Jr. of Teutopolis, Ill.
Mr. Alex's telephone number there is unlisted. Art L. Kinkelaar, the Sheriff of Effingham C ounty, which includes Teutopolis, said he had no information about Mr. Alex, but added that the day before the drawing he received an inquiry about Mr. Alex's background from Virginia officials.
The bulk sales of lottery tickets began after Feb. 12 when the Virginia jackpot appeared headed for a record level. The state lottery director said agency computers showed a huge increase in sales beginning the next morning.
The players had until 11:15 P.M. on Feb. 15, five minutes before the drawing, to buy tickets. The lottery director said at least one store was still selling tickets at a brisk pace, 2,400 an hour, at the last minute. Even so, the group seems to have been caught without slips for two million possible combinations.
 
1 Ticket in 5 Million
 "For someone to try to do this ticket-by-ticket is a very chancy proposition," said Michael E. Julian, chairman of Farm Fresh supermarkets, the second retailer, which got a $3 million order. "That's what lotto's all about."
The lucky ticket, which sold for $1 and is worth $27 million, was issued at a Farm Fresh that sold part of the huge batch bought from the chain.
"Watching them try to find the one winning ticket would be quite a sight," said Kenneth W. Thorson, the state lottery director.
In Virginia's six-number lottery, players pick six numbers from 1 to 44. The winning combination is determined by a machine.
Lottery officials speculate that the investors may have chosen Virginia for two reasons. The state had the biggest jackpot in the country that weekend. And the seven million entries required to cover all the combinations in a 44-number lottery is just half the number needed in a 49-number lottery, like Florida's. California has 51 numbers and New York has 54.
 
Improving the Odds
 William S. Bergman, executive director of the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries, said that 24 of the nation's 34 six-number lotteries have longer odds than those for Virginia's game.
In the Virginia game, there are 7,059,052 possible combinations of numbers. So someone who buys one ticket has odds of 1 in slightly more than 7 million. Having more tickets increases the odds of winning, so that 1 million tickets have odds of 1 in 7. Since each ticket costs $1 it would cost $7,059,052 to cover every combination. Anyone who did that would receive at least a share in the jackpot and many of the second, third and fourth place prizes, that together were worth more than $900,000 on Feb. 15.
The biggest danger to a huge lottery investor would be having to split the prize with other winners who had picked the same numbers. Mr. Thorson said some popular combinations have as many as 1,000 ticket holders.
Jackpots are paid out in 20 equal yearly installments. Winning the jackpot payment of $1.35 million a year for that period is equal to receiving a rate of return of about 16 percent on a $7 million investment. The second, third and fourth place prizes would increase that rate somewhat, as well as increasing the amount received in the first year.
 
Biggest Known Purchase
 Lottery experts and gaming administrators said that this was the largest-scale effort to buy tickets they knew of in the United States.
The previous record may have been held by a computer engineer who bought 80,000 tickets in October from a Jacksonville, Fla., bar called Smitty's Place. The bar owner said the man made a profit but did not win the $94 million jackpot. People in Jacksonville still call him "The Phantom."
In 1990, a retiree walked into a Sacramento, Calif., hardware store with a diaper bag stuffed with $20 bills. Employees spent all night printing out her 30,000 tickets for what was then a record state jackpot of $69 million.
"Since the notoriety of having the world's largest losing purchase, she hasn't come back much," said the store's assistant manager, James C. Cortell.
 
A Huge Undertaking
 In Virginia, trying to buy seven million lottery tickets would be a huge undertaking, even though outlets are allowed to be open 19 hours a day. Each game slip has room to select five combinations, so the first step would require filling out 1.4 million slips. Mr. Thorson, the state lottery director, said that he saw photocopies of several of the group's slips and that they appeared to have been filled out by hand.
The group used as many as eight chains of grocery and convenience stores, with a total of 125 outlets, in the Norfolk and Richmond areas, Mr. Thorson said. He said his agency notified state and Federal tax and law-enforcement officials about the unusual purchases. No apparant violations occurred, the officials said.
One chain, Farm Fresh, said it had sold 2.4 million tickets to a man who apparently managed the purchase for the group. The man went to the grocery chain's headquarters with cashier's checks for hundreds of thousands of dollars. The chain sent couriers to 40 stores to pick up the tickets. As identification, the messengers used the man's business card, with a code word added. The company's commission was $120,000, even though it returned $600,000 for tickets it did not have time to print.
Samuel W. Valenza Jr., the publisher of Lottery Player's Magazine in Cherry Hill, N.J., said Virginia officials should not have allowed retailers to help in the bulk purchases.
"It may not be against the rules, but it's not fair," Mr. Valenza said. "It's not the intent of the game to play against a player who has purchased all the tickets."
At its meeting today the governing board of the Virginia lottery discussed limiting block purchases. A lottery spokeswoman, Paula I. Otto, said the agency had received about six complaints from customers of stores involved in the block buying.
In the next 10 days the board plans to consider a proposal to limit a player to buying 100 lotto tickets when others are waiting in line. Another measure would limit a store to selling 50,000 tickets to a single customer for a drawing and a chain to selling 250,000 tickets. To enforce these measures if they are adopted, the board said it could turn off a store's terminals.
George W. Grayson, a Democrat who is a member of the House of Delegates, the state's legislature, said he might introduce a bill in the Legislature to require buyers of 10,000 or more tickets to identify themselves.
"These are hardly casual players and we want to make certain that tainted moneys aren't funneled into the Virginia lottery," said Dr. Grayson, who is a government professor at the College of William and Mary.
Mr. Bergman of the lottery association said that if restrictions were adopted, they would be the first in the country.
Lottery managers in several states said they had successfully discouraged players who asked about buying blocks of lottery tickets.
"It's not like we have a button on our computers that says, 'One of everything,' " said Betsy A. Bishop of the Vermont Lottery Commission.
A dozen lottery administrators said that buying masses of lottery tickers was a risky investment.
"A lottery's a good deal for a dollar," said Joanne B. McNabb of the California Lottery. "You can do something better with a million.
"All you have to do is share it with two people and it becomes a questionable investment," he said. "Share it with three and you've lost money."
An official familiar with the transaction said that Australians had wired $7 million to a Virginia bank, which then issued cashier's checks to buy the lottery tickets. An Australian regulatory official said today that a Melbourne-based syndicate had raised millions of dollars for investment in overseas lotteries. Timothy G. Phillipps of the Australian Securities Commission said that five days after the Virginia drawing, the syndicate sent its 2,500 investors this message: "Last weekend, one of our target lotteries did jackpot to our required level. We entered and won."
Mr. Phillipps said a prospectus for the goup had few details about expected returns beyond saying that a substantial cash return was expected and the investment would be in lotteries. "A lot them don't want to know a lot more than that," he said.

If the jackpot is big enough, it can make economic sense to buy one lottery ticket for every possible combination or numbers and be sure to win, as a group in Australia apparently tried to do in the Feb. 15 Virginia Lottery drawing, provided nobody else buys a winning ticket.

Rate of return: The first-prize payoff over 20 years is the equivalent of putting the same $7,059,052 in a more conventional investment that pays a guaranteed 16 percent return before taxes for 20 years, a rate available only from speculative investment with fairly high risk.
 
The Risk
If more than one first prize winning ticket is sold, the prize is shared. So the maximum payoff depends on no ordinary player buying a winning ticket. Since Virginia began its lottery in January 1990, 120 of the 170 drawings have yielded no first-prize winner. Of the 50 jackpots won, 10 have been shared, oncluding 3 of the 16 jackpots wom that were worth over $10 million.
* Based on the actual number of second- and third-prize winning tickets sold. If the Australia group had bought all the tickets its planned to buy, the prize per ticket would have been slightly higher or lower. (Source: Virginia State Lottery) (pg. A18)

HEADLINE: Japan Seen Passing U.S. In Research By Industry

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
JAPAN has equaled or surpassed the United States as the world's top patron of industrial research and development, according to a growing number of science analysts. If so, Japan has a powerful weapon in the trade wars of the 1990's and beyond as it uses research discoveries to launch a new wave of innovative goods and services.
The analysts take issue with the Federal Government's Japan-watchers, who calculate that the United States still leads in research spending by business, while acknowledging that America's edge in this area is eroding. 
 An increasing number of private analysts, as well as Japanese economists and American officials, say these Federal estimates are wrong. Japan, they say, has in fact expanded its industrial research so rapidly in the past decade that it now rivals the United States, and perhaps has already pulled ahead.
The dispute comes even as the Japanese have seized the leadership role in related fields. Japan, with half the population of America and an economy two-thirds the size, is already known to invest more in new factories and equipment. In 1990, it spent $586 billion on capital investment, compared with the $524 billion spent by the United States. And experts agree that certain of Japan's high-technology industries, including semiconductor fabrication, heavily outspend American rivals in advanced research as well.
What is emerging now is the radical idea that Japan as a whole, for the first time, is challenging America's traditional role as world leader in the overall support of industrial research. That role is seen as vital since private industry is increasingly the source of the innovations so important in the international race for commercial advantage.
Even experts who doubt Japan's superiority agree it is pouring vast amounts of money into industrial research and say it will eventually overtake the United States if the pace of investment is sustained.
A leader of the school that says Japan has already attained superiority is Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, who recently told his Congressional colleagues that Japan had quietly scaled the summit of industrial research and development. "It is close to certain that the Japanese are, or will soon be, outspending us on civilian R.& D., especially in industry," Mr. Bingaman said.
In an interview, Bruce R. Scott, a professor at the Harvard Business School, agreed and said the way the Federal Government's compares international industrial research spending did not give a clear picture of foreign spending.
Significantly, a Federal panel has adopted that view. The Competitiveness Policy Council, recently created by Congress, is a governmental advisory body whose 12 members are appointed by the White House and Congress. Mr. Scott of Harvard is a member, and the council's chairman is C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Washington-based Institute for International Economics.
The council is circulating a draft report that says Japan has surged ahead of America in business spending on research. The report is to be made public next Monday.
Federal officials in charge of comparing research among nations insist that the United States is still far ahead of Japan. But they concede that their methods, which center on adjusting exchange rates between the dollar and the yen, need an overhaul.
John E. Jankowski Jr., a senior financial analyst at the National Science Foundation, a Federal agency that supports research and monitors spending on scientific research, said the agency's current method was nowhere "near the ideal of what we'd like" but defended it as the best available. Its overhaul, he said, would require a major effort that was unlikely to happen soon in a period of tight budgets.
The issue of who leads the world in industrial research has taken on new significance in recent years because such research has quietly become a prime engine of discovery and innovation.
For decades, in America and elsewhere, it was governments that financed the lion's share of scientific research and development, putting money into universities, defense industries and state laboratories. In the United States, the government did so with a vengeance during the cold war and pioneered a host of innovations, including rockets, jet engines, computer chips, communication satellites and photovoltaic cells.
By 1980, however, American industry had grown so large and had become so dedicated to its own pursuit of scientific advancement that for the first time it surpassed the Federal Government as the nation's top patron of science research. It has maintained that position ever since.
In 1989, for instance, the most recent year for which foundation figures are available, American industry spent $71.77 billion on research and development, compared with the $68.72 billion from all other sources in the United States, including the Federal Government. As a result of this and other factors, American industry has become a hotbed of innovation.
 
Swinging Wildly
 The trend of spending more on industrial research is global. Yet measuring exactly how much nations spend is extremely difficult, experts agree. A crucial problem is exchange rates, which can swing wildly and are often seen as poor indicators of a currency's real value.
As a result, economists have developed conversion tables that try to equalize price levels among countries. These are known as Purchasing Power Parities, or P.P.P's. Their aim is to make the clout of differing currencies roughly equal in terms of goods that are traded internationally. For instance, American P.P.P.'s for 1989 show a dollar on average being worth 204 yen. That is much stronger than the dollar's actual market value that year of 138 yen. What that means is that a Japanese camera was cheaper for an American buyer and more expensive for a Japanese buyer than is suggested solely by market exchange rates.
The National Science Foundation routinely uses the parity technique, rather than exchange rates, to compare research among nations. It thus finds Japanese industrial research to be relatively paltry. The foundation says Japanese industry spent 8.54 trillion yen on research in 1989, which by the parity technique is equal to $41.90 billion, or a little more than half the comparable American sum. But if calculated at market exchange rates, the figure jumps to $61.83 billion.
The Japanese see their investment as even greater. The July 1991 issue of The Japan Economic Survey, published in Washington by the Japan Economic Institute, cited a Japanese Government study that said Japanese business in 1989 spent 9.60 trillion yen on research. Using a market exchange rate of 135 yen to the dollar, the survey said that figure equaled $71.10 billion dollars, or roughly what American business spent that year.
The fields where Japan's industrial research investment is expanding rapidly include publishing, printing, petroleum, plastics, fabricated metal products, machinery, communications, textiles, chemicals and transportation. Areas where it is down include agriculture and mining.
Senator Bingaman of New Mexico, who heads the technology and national security subcommittee of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, saw the Japan Economic Survey article, became worried that the science foundation's estimates were faulty and ever since has tried, with minor success, to stir debate on the subject. So far the only published review has been in New Technology Week, a trade publication based in Washington that explored the topic in its Jan. 13 issue.
New Technology Week noted that no matter which side in the debate is proved correct, the overall trend is clear. "The R.& D. growth rate in Japan has been consistently over 10 percent for the past three years," it said. "Meanwhile, the growth rate of industrial R.& D. in the United States has been virtually stagnant."
Some experts say the problem is overstated. They note that the United States Government supports a vast amount of research, unlike Japan, and that this Federal research greatly aids American industry. For instance, the billions of dollars spent annually on scientific research by the National Institutes of Health is clearly a boon to the pharmaceutical industry.
The results from much of this Federal research, unlike business research, are published in scientific journals and are available to the Japanese as well.
Some experts say the status of American industrial research may be far worse than the debate over exchange rates so far suggests. Mr. Scott of the Harvard Business School said current methods of comparison are likely to vastly understate Japanese prowess since they focus on consumption rather than production, which in Japan is often remarkably efficient.
Using the parity technique to analyze research spending, he said, is crazy. "That's a way to measure Japanese incomes and say what they can purchase," he said. "If you adjust instead for the productive power of the manufacturing sector, you get an exchange rate closer to 100" yen to the dollar.
That figure, if applied to Japan's 1989 investment in industrial research, as measured by the National Science Foundation, leads to a dollar equivalent of $85.4 billion. And that, of course, is far ahead of American industry's $71.77 billion investment that same year.
While not endorsing the accuracy of such calculations, Mr. Jankowski of the foundation said that any overhaul of America's system for gauging the financial strength of foreign industrial research would have to take such productivity issues into account.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
Kerrey Is South Dakota Victor; Keeps Presidential Hopes Alive

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SIOUX FALLS, S.D., Feb. 25

 BODY:
Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska kept his Presidential campaign alive today with a substantial victory in the South Dakota Democratic primary, an outcome that imperils the candidacy of Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa.
President Bush was not opposed on the Republican slate after Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator, lost a court bid to have his name added to the ballot. But in what may have been a message of dissatisfaction with the incumbent, about a third the Republican primary voters chose a slate of uncommitted delegates. 
 With nearly 100 percent of the vote counted, at 11:15 P.M. Eastern time, Mr. Kerrey had 40 percent of the vote to 25 percent for Senator Harkin, 19 percent for Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, 10 percent for former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts and 4 percent for former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California.
On the Republican side, Mr. Bush had 69 percent of the vote.
The primary here had loomed as a showdown between Senators Kerrey and Harkin, both of whom are from neighboring states. After weak showings in New Hampshire a week ago, both were hoping that a victory in South Dakota would lift their standing among the five Democratic contenders and help them raise badly needed money as the campaign turns to the South and the West in the next two weeks.
But the contest took on added importance and visibility as the other major candidates sought to prove that they could attract voters in the first contested race outside New England. Though they did not campaign here nearly as much as their Midwest competitors, Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Clinton made stops here in recent days, and all four blanketed the state with television commercials extolling their sensitivity to farm issues. The candidates also participated in a televised debate on Sunday.
At a rally at the Holiday Inn here tonight, Mr. Kerrey told his cheering supporters, "We've struck gold in the Black Hills of South Dakota."
"There's no question that we've gotten a solid victory in South Dakota," he said, "and tonight we're going to begin a rush for gold."
"I told the people of South Dakota this was an opportunity to send a message to the people of this country that this campaign is by no means over."
Mr. Harkin campaigned in South Dakota this morning, but anticipating a loss he flew on to Maryland. He said he would press on to the next round of primaries on March 3 in Maryland, Colorado and Georgia.
Mr. Harkin sought to play down his second-place finish. "The message out of South Dakota tonight is that the Democratic Presidential primary is more wide open than ever," Mr. Harkin said in a statement. "There's no front-runner.
"I am pleased with a strong second-place showing, and I congratulate my friend Senator Kerrey on his victory tonight. But even as he celebrates, I think he would agree with me that he is not the front-runner. Nor is Paul Tsongas. Nor Jerry Brown. Nor am I. Instead, this is just beginning."
But other Democrats said Mr. Clinton's third-place showing was respectable, considering that he is largely an outsider who campaigned in the state much less than did Mr. Kerrey or Mr. Harkin and had no large organization here.
 
A Fuzzy Race So Far
 But Steve Hildebrand, co-executive director of the South Dakota Democratic Party, said the results spelled trouble for Mr. Harkin, whose stuggle for contributions to keep his campaign going may be insurmountable.
"If he can't come home and do very well," Mr. Hildebrand said, "I don't see how he can play well in other states."
Although South Dakota, with its population of not quite 700,000 accounts for less than 1 percent, or 15, of the delegates to the Democratic National Convention, the contest here was significant because of the fuzziness of the national campaign so far.
Since the Democrats conceded the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 10 to that state's favorite son, Mr. Harkin, the race was the first true battle for votes in the heartland. Mr. Tsongas won the New Hampshire primary a week ago, getting 33 percent of the vote to 25 percent for Mr. Clinton. But in the Maine caucuses on Sunday, Mr. Tsongas finished in a virtual dead heat with Mr. Brown for the lead.
Most important for Mr. Kerrey, the voting here gave him the first opportunity to declare himself a winner. The Senator was widely viewed as the best organized contender here, and he also benefited from an endorsement on Sunday from The Argus Leader of Sioux Falls, the state's largest newspaper.
Tad Devine, Mr. Kerrey's campaign manager, said he did not expect the Senator to gain enough of a lift here for him to win in the South. But he said the strategy was for Mr. Kerrey to continue to collect delegates with the hope that Mr. Clinton or Mr. Tsongas would stumble, so the Senator could move on to take the lead in later primaries like New York, Pennsylvania or Illinois. Senator Kerrey picked up seven delegates today, while Senator Harkin gained five and Governor Clinton three.
 
Shift in the Debate
 Since joblessness is not nearly as severe in South Dakota as it is in the East, the campaigning marked a shift in the political dialogue, with candidates focusing on the concerns of farmers. In their commericals and in the debate on Sunday, the candidates often resorted to attacks on their rivals' records.
Mr. Kerrey also sought to win the backing of the large elderly population here by speaking at length about his his proposal for national health care.
Mr. Harkin concentrated on his support for family farms and portrayed himself as the candidate who best understood South Dakota. Mr. Clinton said that he, too, was sensitive to the needs of rural America. Mr. Tsongas pitched his economic recovery plan as important for farmers.
State officials described the turnout as particularly light today, especially on the Republican side, largely because there was no named opponent to Mr. Bush.
Karen Schreier, chairwoman of the South Dakota Democratic Party, said that even without a high turnout, the Republicans' high vote total for "uncommitted" was an embarrassment for Mr. Bush. "If any party needs to look for a new candidate, they should."
The South Dakota legislature moved the state's primary from June to February four years ago in hopes of drawing more attention. That switch did have the result of attracting a bigger field of candidates.
In 1988, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri won the Democratic primary comfortably ahead of Michael S. Dukakis, the eventual Democratic nominee. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas won on the Republican side, beating Mr. Bush, who finished third behind Pat Robertson.

HEADLINE: EMPLOYEE LAYOFFS IN NEW YORK AREA DISRUPT ECONOMIES

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
With companies from General Motors to United Technologies announcing plans to shrink their work forces, the New York City region faces the prospect of at least 40,000 employees losing their jobs during the next few years, primarily in manufacturing, transportation and government. And those are just the layoffs that have been publicly announced.
Coming on the heels of the more than 500,000 jobs lost in the region since employment peaked in February 1989, this latest round of announcements is certainly not good news. Even before this, the total exceeded the 350,000 jobs lost in the region from late 1973 through 1976, when the area was suffering its worst recession since the 1930's.
 
Heightened Concern
 But there is a new and, in many ways, more disruptive element to the latest round of layoff announcements. Companies are revealing that thousands of people will be laid off but are providing scant details as to when, where or who will be affected. That is creating heightened uncertainty, and causing even those whose jobs are not threatened to cut back their spending. 
 "If anything, announcements without specified targets and time frames could affect even more people's behavior than normal layoffs," said Nancy R. Lazar, an economist with International Strategy and Investment Group in New York.
It is difficult to say exactly how many jobs have been earmarked for termination. In general, only large companies laying off at least 500 employees or smaller companies laying off at least 33 percent of their work forces are required to report their plans to state departments of labor. And some companies announce layoff plans and then change their minds.
 
More Losses Expected
 Still, the announcements already made bring the tally to 35,000, and at least 5,000 more can be expected from companies that have said they will shrink their global work force but have not released details about the New York region.
Of course, when compared with the half-million jobs that have already been lost, that may sound like a pittance and leave the impression that job losses may be slowing. But the half million are actual job losses, whereas the 40,000 are just announced layoffs that are known to date. Economists say it is too early to conclude that the rate of job losses is finally slowing.
Connecticut is likely to be hardest hit. From last May through November, Edward J. Deak, an economics professor at Fairfield University, counted 13,307 jobs that had either been lost or were expected to be lost in coming months in his state. That was the highest number since he began monitoring job reductions four years ago. And it was before the state announced it would lay off 2,700 employees, before Electric Boat's announcement of as many as 4,000 layoffs and before United Technologies' decision to lay off 6,400 in the next four years.
In New Jersey, the tally kept by the Department of Labor suggests that more than 5,500 jobs will be lost during the next year or so. That does not include unspecified numbers of New Jersey workers who could lose their jobs as General Motors sheds 74,000 positions nationwide, or as A.T.&T. reduces its national work force by 14,000.
In New York City, announcements by banks, local and state governments and large companies suggest that 10,000 to 15,000 jobs are already likely to be lost this year.
On Long Island, layoffs are expected to exceed 9,000 because of reductions by Nassau County, school boards and some unspecified cuts by the Grumman Corporation, a large military contractor.
Even Wstchester County, which has been relatively immune from layoffs, will suffer. Monday's announcement that G.M. intends to close its plant in North Tarrytown, resulting in 3,500 layoffs by 1995, comes on top of I.B.M.'s planned reduction of 20,000 worldwide. At least some of those reductions are likely in Westchester, where 12,000 work for the company. However, since I.B.M. is offering early retirements rather than laying people off, the effects are likely to be gentler.
Although 40,000 layoffs may sound like a lot, in the context of a regional work force of eight million, it is not quite so daunting. Also, economists caution that job losses should not be considered in isolation: jobs are created as new companies are formed and those in existence expand.
Matthew P. Drennan, a professor of economics at Cornell University, is one who is not especially alarmed by the latest announcements. He sees nothing to cause him to revise his semiannual forecast, issued in January, of a net decline of 48,000 jobs in the region this year, compared with 258,000 lost in 1991.
 
Tracking Fallout From the Shock
 However, other economists worry that the recent announcements will intensify economic distress. Many say the layoffs will trigger job losses at other companies that supply those reducing in size. And the next round of layoffs will occur when it is already increasingly difficult for those out of work to find jobs.
Moreover, to the extent that these job losses are not spread evenly but are concentrated in pockets like Hartford or Groton, Conn., the psychological and economic fallout can be tremendous.
The layoff announcements did, for instance, cause Mr. Deak to change his forecast. Until recently, he thought there was a 50 percent chance that the state's job slide would end in the third quarter. He has since revised that to a less than 50 percent chance that it will end this year.
Economic forecasting has never been an exact science. But what makes this recession particularly difficult to fathom is the way that layoffs are taking place. In the "good old days," a company would announce layoffs and within days or weeks, the employees involved would be notified and then removed from their positions.
In today's age of reorganizations and downsizings, companies are just as likely to announce that they intend to shed 10 to 20 percent of their work force, but provide almost no details about when or where the cuts will take place.
"There's a sense of paralysis that it leaves with people, even those not directly affected," said Stephen Ristau, senior vice president of Family Services Association in Southern New London County, which works with employees at companies undergoing reorganizations.
Mr. Ristau said that the trauma of not knowing whether an employee is next in line to lose his or her job has increased job stress, drug and alcohol abuse and family violence. He said it has also created a sharp reduction in spending, which is likely to worsen the economic impact of the job losses. "Even those with relatively stable incomes are becoming more conservative in their spending habits," he said.
 
How Insecurity Hurts Economies
 Consider the reaction of Bob Goldberg, a 28-year-old systems programmer who works for Aetna Life and Casualty Company in Middletown, Conn. In the fall of 1990 the company announced that it would reduce its work force by 2,600, a target it has more or less achieved. Mr. Goldberg is still employed and has no reason to think that his job is in immediate jeopardy. But he is still driving his '85 Chevrolet, even though it has 115,000 miles on it and he would like a new car. This year he drove instead of flew to Florida for his annual vacation and stayed with friends instead of in a hotel.
"There's just no security any more, working for somebody else," he said.
Cheryl Garber, a probation officer for Nassau County, is also anxiously trying to conserve her savings. Last year she moved in with her parents in Jericho to save money for a down payment on a house. But when the county recently laid off 98 people in her department, she gave up hope of buying a house and is now just concentrating on saving money. Since the county's layoffs are based on seniority, eliminating those whose employment began after January 1984, and since Ms. Garber was hired in October 1983, she is convinced that she will not survive another round of cuts.
"I live in a state of constant anxiety," she said. "I don't sleep much and I certainly don't spend any more money than I have to." She said she no longer eats lunch with friends or drives to visit friends and relatives on weekends.
As people like Mr. Goldberg and Ms. Garber pull back, it is likely to depress local economies. The repercussions are already evident in southern Connecticut. When asked about the impact of the announcements, Robert Jones, the owner of a recreational vehicle dealership in East Lyme, Conn., said, "See for yourself," and waved his hand at a showroom empty of people. "I called one woman today who was supposed to be buying an R.V. and she said she wants to wait and see if her husband has a job," he said.
It is not an easy time to be a real-estate broker in Connecticut either. Nick Palmerone, a partner in the Hedden Real Estate Agency in Groton, said that business had finally started to improve after the first of the year, after mortgage rates fell to levels not seen for 20 years. "Things started to look up," he said. "Then, the day after the Seawolf announcement, I kept picking up the phone to see if it was working." Seawolf is the submarine program that the Bush Administration said it would eliminate.
City and state officials are also trying to brace themselves against the impact of these rolling layoffs. After United Technologies announced its intention to lay off workers, fears grew in Stratford that a number of those layoffs might be at the company's Sikorsky subsidiary, which makes helicopters. The town receives almost 12 percent of its property taxes from the company and its employees, as well as financial support for community activities and job training.
"The saying in town is, 'If Sikorsky sneezes the entire town catches pneumonia,' " said Joseph Stavola, the town's director of community and economic development, who has since retired.
 
The Worst Fear: The Best May Leave
 The worst fear of many local officials is that people will feel compelled to move out of the area. In the last two years, Connecticut has seen its population level off at 3.3 million, after growing by 20,000 a year from 1985 to 1989. Mr. Deak said he thought that 26,000 state residents would leave in each of the next two years. The danger is that those who leave will be those with job skills and the most promising employment opportunities, while those left behind will contribute the least to the tax base.
Another alternative, one that would be better for the region, would be if adversity were to unleash a burst of entrepreneurship. Mr. Goldberg, for instance, was inspired by the job insecurity he sensed at his company to try to set up a recruiting business on the side with a friend, Duane Dubuque, who works at the troubled Ames Department Stores and also feels his employment future is uncertain.
If enough people respond as Mr. Goldberg and Mr. Dubuque have, that could provide some vitality to the region. "There's a tradition of entrepreneurialism in this area," said Mr. Deak, the Fairfield University economist. "The question is whether enough people do it, and if enough of those people are successful."

HEADLINE: Migrants of Drug World: From Brooklyn to Buffalo

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR

 BODY:
They leave Brooklyn in the dead of night with little more than bus fare, a change of clothes and a reputation on the streets. Their destination is Buffalo. Their job is to sell drugs.
Bands of young New York City drug dealers, skilled in the use of guns and terrorist tactics to take over neighborhoods, are being recruited to hustle the streets of Buffalo and surrounding cities and towns, according to local and Federal law-enforcement officials. Lured by higher-level dealers' promises of a safer and more lucrative trade, these teen-agers have become the migrant workers of the drug world. 
 For years, drugs have been trafficked through New York City to smaller cites by drug kingpins looking to expand their market. But street sales have traditionally remained a local business. In Buffalo, the game has changed. Heightened violence and tougher laws surrounding the drug trade have pushed dealers to seek fronts for their operations.
In the case of Buffalo, not only are dealers looking for street workers who are younger and more sophisticated than in years past but they are also bringing the youths in from the outside, many of them from New York City. Unknown to local police and hard to prosecute because of their age, the teen-agers transport and distribute the drugs with little concern about the consequences.
 
An Expanding Operation
 "Buffalo has become a location in which people are trying to expand their drug trafficking or exports," said Richard S. Inscore, the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration's agent in charge of western New York. "And the vehicle they are using to expand their operations here are young males from New York City."
"We've had young dealers here before," said Buffalo's Police Chief, Angelo P. Alessandra. "But we've never had them imported from outside solely to occupy houses to sell drugs."
Though young New York City dealers are also being arrested in Rochester and Niagara Falls, their presence in Buffalo is unmistakable. In three years, this city of 328,000 people on the shores of Lake Erie has seen its modest, locally run marijuana and cocaine trade turn into a brutal crack and heroin business dominated by outsiders, the Buffalo police say. A large number come from Brooklyn, they say. Most are under age 19. Some are as young as 13 or 14.
"When we would interview these kids, we'd find they all knew each other," said a Buffalo police detective, Brian Miller, who has investigated hundreds of drug cases in the last four years. "Why did they come? In almost all situations, they seem to have been lured by big money and clothes."
 
Eluding Prosecution
 Those who lure them are generally higher-level dealers from Buffalo or New York City. And while Federal and local drug investigators give no precise figures, they say that at least a quarter of the roughly 1,200 known drug dealers and runners in Buffalo are thought to be from New York City.
By hiring young out-of-town workers, the high-level dealers -- based in New York City or Buffalo -- protect themselves from prosecution by instructing the youths to give the police false names and addresses when picked up. Some of the teen-agers say they know little about their bosses, other than street names, and less about the operations, law-enforcement officials say.
"The kids are just used by Fagans," says Kevin Dillon, the Erie County District Attorney.
 
'Business Is Business'
 But the traffickers also turn to New York City teen-agers because of their experience on the streets of New York.
"They know that we know what we are doing," said a 17-year-old from Brooklyn who made the trek of more than 400 miles to Buffalo last year to sell cocaine and crack, then returned home after two months to go back to school. "We know that business is business."
The youths say they are enticed by promises of a safer, softer market where drugs may sell for almost four times what they do in New York City.
"There's more opportunity in Buffalo," said the youth, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "You know back in the days when you went West to claim gold? Buffalo's like that."
In some cases, parents know their childrens' whereabouts and may be getting some money from the drug sales, say Brooklyn detectives. In others, they say, parents have reported their children missing, only to find them up in Buffalo.
When her 14-year-old son, Amin, disappeared from their Brooklyn neighborhood last summer, Dorothy Johnson turned frantically to the police.
"When I went up to the station, there were four or five other mothers up there from all over to report their sons missing," said Ms. Johnson, who took a picture of her son with her. "I had heard that some of the kids around here had gone up to Buffalo to sell drugs. But I didn't know what had happened to Amin."
Weeks later, the Brooklyn police called to say Amin had been arrested in Buffalo for possession of cocaine and marijuana. In November, a Buffalo judge sentenced him to 12 months in jail after the youth pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of trying to sell 31 bags of cocaine, Ms. Johnson said.
"Amin said he thought he could make a lot of money fast and could be his own boss," she said. "But those older guys brainwashed him. Then once he was arrested, you know, they were nowhere around."
 
'I Wasn't Surprised'
 Dennis S., a 41-year-old Brooklyn resident, said that last year his nephew, Jerome, had joined the migration to Buffalo as well.
"My mother called me and said, 'Your nephew is running drugs up in Buffalo -- please go get him,' " said the man, who spoke on condition that his last name not be used. "I wasn't surprised about the drugs because our family has been in drugs all our lives. But I was surprised he was up in Buffalo."
Jerome, 18 at the time, "had been recruited by a big-time dealer" from Coney Island, who knew of the youth's reputation as a tough street worker, accustomed to using guns to force drug users to pay. The high-ranking dealer had sent Jerome to Buffalo as a "lieutenant" to organize younger workers there, he said.
Many of the Brooklyn youths say that if they are going to traffic in drugs, it seems less dangerous to do it on the relatively quiet back streets of Buffalo than on the mean streets of Brooklyn neighborhoods like Bushwick, Flatbush or East New York.
"It's a real big difference between out here and Brooklyn," said Jamal Christie, a 17-year-old Brooklyn youth who said he no longer sells drugs but had gone to Buffalo three years ago because he thought it would have a safer, more lucrative drug trade.
"Out here, you can get arrested easier, but you have to watch out more for the police than you do for someone to shoot you," said Mr. Christie, interviewed last week in a Buffalo jail, where he was being held on robbery charges. "In New York, you have to watch for both."
 
'Some Madness Out There'
 Discipline within the ranks of the drug organizations is also more lenient in Buffalo than in New York City, Mr. Christie said.
"If you mess up here, they just send you home," he said, referring to the high-level drug dealers. "In New York, sometimes they will handcuff you to the stairs and make you sell until you pay them back. There's some madness out there."
Mr. Christie said the youths are recruited by older drug dealers, who provide bus or train fare and promise a steady salary. Often they hop the 11:45 P.M. bus out of the Port Authority terminal in mid-Manhattan, and once in Buffalo they are either picked up at the station or given addresses of drug houses, where they are to report. Some bring the drugs from New York; others get their supply when they arrive.
In a system that has become well documented by law-enforcement authorities, workers then sell cocaine and crack through holes in fortified drug houses, or "gatehouses," which are often rented from Buffalo residents for about $200 a day. For a weekly salary of $500 to $1,000, the sellers sleep on floors or couches of the houses. They sell on 10-hour shifts to anyone who comes to the door. They subsist on McDonald's hamburgers. In their spare time, they go shopping for jewelry or to the movies.
 
Drug Turf Wars
 But with the arrival of dealers from Los Angeles, Memphis and other New York boroughs, like the Bronx and Manhattan, have come turf wars. And with the turf wars, the police say, has come an increase in drug-related violence, making the once "safer" Buffalo a more hostile environment for the young sellers.
Though far from the murder rates of Washington or Detroit or even New York City, Buffalo logged 49 homicides last year, the highest number since 1980, when 61 people were murdered. So far this year, 14 people have been slain, half of them in drug-related violence, the police say. The number of drive-by shootings, which hit 64 last year, tripled from the year before.
Back in Bushwick in Brooklyn, a mural painted in memory of Mr. Christie's 14-year-old brother, Rahsan, stands on Linden Street as testament to such violence. Rahsan died last year after being shot outside a drug house in Buffalo, where he had gone to sell crack. Two teen-agers from Buffalo were charged with the shooting.
The killing stemmed, in part, from a turf dispute, Mr. Christie said.
 
Starting to Fight Back
 But Buffalo, a city that has otherwise had substantial economic growth and development, has begun to fight back.
At least two drug task forces have been formed over the last two years to try to stanch the flow of cocaine, heroin and crack into the greater Buffalo area. Since 1986, the number of drug-related arrests has jumped from 1,200 a year to more than 3,400.
This year, a band of local, state and Federal law-enforcement agencies has already served more than 80 search warrants on the crack houses, with dozens of arrests resulting. Agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Border Patrol and the United States Marshal's office have begun routine checks for traffickers at local bus and train stations. The houses controlled by New York sellers are among the main targets of the raids.
Some of the Brooklyn teen-agers say that with the heightened violence and pressure by the Buffalo police, the migration of young men has slowed.
Even so, the police say, there is no balm for Buffalo's streets.
"Even if the New York kids weren't here, the problem would be," said Lieut. Joseph Riega of the Buffalo police.
The New Yorkers "just took advantage of the situation here," he added. "We now have other major suppliers coming in from other places as well. So why do they come to Buffalo? They have to get rid of it somewhere."

HEADLINE: C.I.A. Chief Says North Koreans Are Hiding Nuclear Arms Projects

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25

 BODY:
Robert M. Gates, the Director of Central Intelligence, said today that North Korea is believed to be hiding parts of its nuclear weapons program despite pledges to join with South Korea in making the peninsula nuclear-free and to open up its installations to international inspection.
In testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Gates also predicted that the Government in Pyongyang could possess a nuclear weapon from within a few months to a few years.
 
'A Deception Plan'
 "We have some information that I can't go into here in this setting that suggests that they have a deception plan for hiding their nuclear capabilities," Mr. Gates said, without elaborating. At another point in his testimony, he said, "There are, in a certain understatement, grounds for questioning the North's sincerity, given that it has not yet even admitted the existence of, much less declared the plutonium production reactors and a reprocessing facility at the Yongbyon nuclear research center." 
 The complex near Yongbyon, 60 miles north of the capital of Pyongyang, includes more than 100 buildings, including two large nuclear reactors whose sole purpose appears to make plutonium and a reprocessing plant to recover the plutonium. The extensive and secretive nature of the North Korean nuclear weapons program is reminiscent of Iraq's program, the extent of which was only revealed by intrusive United Nations inspections after the Persian Gulf War.
Mr. Gates also raised the possibility that North Korea at some point might sell nuclear materials and related technologies abroad, because, he added, "they've been willing to sell anything that could earn hard currency."
The testimony, which is even harsher than Mr. Gates's assessment of North Korea's nuclear program before a Senate panel on Jan. 15, reflects a growing consensus in the Bush Administration that North Korea's pledge last December to reach agreement with South Korea banning bomb-making installations and to begin inspections was not serious and that the country remains intent on continuing its nuclear weapons program.
Mr. Gates also asserted that the North Koreans have not declared all of their nuclear installations under the treaty against the spread of nuclear weapons, which they signed in 1985, and that they have stalled in agreeing to inspection of their plants.
When asked directly how long it would take for Pyongyang to build an actual weapon, Mr. Gates replied, "We think a few months to as much as a couple of years." The revelation was the first time that a senior Administration official confirmed that the Communist Government in Pyongyang was so close to becoming a nuclear power.
 
Use of Intelligence Data
 Mr. Gates's testimony was the latest in a series of high-profile public appearances before Congress that have used bits of classified intelligence data to pepper his analysis of global security issues. His remarks about North Korea, for example, reflect recent intelligence reports gathered through a variety of means, including intensive aerial and satellite surveillance.
But Mr. Gates's expansiveness about North Korea contrasted dramatically with his cautious remarks on China's policies on the spread of nuclear weapons. His remarks on China appeared both to question recent intelligence reports that indicate Beijing has continued to sell and deliver missile technology to Syria, Iran and Pakistan in recent months, and to embrace the Bush Administration policy that gives China the benefit of the doubt.
Last Thursday, some lawmakers came away from a closed-door briefing by the Central Intelligence Agency concerned that China was continuing to sell missile and nuclear-related technology to these countries, United States officials said.
 
Lifting of Sanctions
 The next day, however, the Bush Administration lifted high technology sanctions against China after accepting China's promise to abide by the Missile Technology Control Regime, which bans the sale of missiles and missile technology. In addition, senior Bush Administration officials forcefully lobbied key senators to urge them to renew most-favored-nation status for China when the current certification expires in June. Responding to Chinese arms exports as well as concern over its human-rights and trade policies, the Senate voted today to impose conditions on renewal of Beijing's preferential trade status.
When asked whether he had information that China was violating either the treaty on the spread of nuclear weapons or the missile agreement, Mr. Gates replied, "We have no indication that I'm aware of that they are selling technologies now that would be a violation of the agreements they've signed up to."
An intelligence official explained that Mr. Gates was looking ahead to China's future conduct rather than discussing sales or shipments in the recent past. The official did not deny that China had been engaged in "suspicious activity" in the past, but said there had been no indication of such activity in recent days.
 
Dual-Use Technology
 The White House and State Department have played down the significance of the sales, saying that they do not necessarily violate the missile technology agreement. "Talking points" made available to The New York Times that have been used by Administration officials to defend the lifting of sanctions explain that recent reports of "missile-related deliveries or potential transfers by China to Iran, Syria and Pakistan" involve dual-use items that "could be applied to the manufacture" of missiles, "but also can be used for other purposes, civilian as well as military."
The issue is particularly divisive within the Administration, pitting experts on the spread of nuclear arms against the White House and State Department. The arms-control experts take a hard line on the transfer of all suspicious missile technology, recalling the example of Iraq, which bought vast quantities of advanced dual-use technology from the United States and many other countries for use in its various weapons programs. The White House and State Departments, on the other hand, have been eager to get China to sign on to the missile control agreement in the hopes of moderating its future behavior.
Mr. Gates's comments about North Korea, on the other hand, were part of an Administration effort to draw attention to its ongoing nuclear weapons program in the hope of putting pressure on the Government in Pyongyang to go forward with its initiative to ban nuclear weapons installations on the peninsula and begin inspections. The Administration will continue to work closely with South Korea and the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency, which inspects nuclear installations to curb the program, State Department officials said.
 
Steps Against North Korea
 These officials added that the Administration has not yet begun to consider what other steps it might take to prevent North Korea from building nuclear weapons, such as imposing economic sanctions, and played down reports that it might launch a limited air strike against the installations.
"There is still a debate in the Administration about how sincere the North Koreans are being and it is still not clear whether they are delaying," one State Department official said. "Sanctions are not being contemplated -- we're not at that stage yet. And people around here are not talking about military action."

HEADLINE: White House, Anxious Over Jobs, Weighs Sale of 72 F-15's to Saudis

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25

 BODY:
Anxious about keeping American defense workers employed in an election year, the Bush Administration is considering going ahead with a sale of 72 advanced F-15 fighter planes to Saudi Arabia.
The Saudi request is not new, but the Administration had shelved it in past years rather than risk a fight with members of Congress who view sales of advanced weaponry to Arab countries as a threat to the security of Israel. The Administration contends that Saudi Arabia needs the planes chiefly to bolster its defenses in light of a threat posed by Iraq. 
 Administration officials say opposition in Congress may be weakened this year by countervailing concerns about the recession and unemployment, possibly giving the White House an opportunity to proceed with the sale. Congress can block arms sales, and has done so in the past in some cases involving Saudi Arabia.
 
3 Years' Work at Plant
 Without the sale, production lines at the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds the aircraft, will begin closing, possibly as soon as this summer, say Pentagon officials who favor the sale. McDonnell Douglas officials said as many as 7,000 workers, most at a plant in St. Louis, could lose their jobs by 1994. By comparison, the Saudi deal, estimated to be worth $5 billion, could keep assembly lines open through 1997, a company official said today.
Senior State and Defense Department officials are to appear Wednesday before a closed hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to explain this year's classified list of all requests for military equipment from foreign countries.
Officials familiar with the document, which was sent to Congress last Friday, said it included a renewed request from the Saudi Government for 24 F-15H's, an aerial combat plane, and 48 F-15E's, an advanced ground-attack aircraft.
 
Sale Would Be a First
 The United States has never sold the F-15E abroad, but in the past three years has sold Riyadh 98 F-15C's and F-15D's, earlier versions of the F-15H and more defensive in design than the F-15E. Air Force and industry officials said that the Administration might consider selling Riyadh a less advanced version of the F-15E.
The Administration has not indicated whether it will submit the Saudi sale to Congress. Only about 20 percent of the requests on the list are submitted to Congress annually, a Defense Department official said.
State and Defense Department officials are divided over the timing of the proposed sale. The Air Force and some other Pentagon officials are pushing the sale to reward an ally in the Persian Gulf war. There are also concerns that if the United States refuses to sell F-15's to Riyadh, Britain will eagerly sell comparable Tornado attack aircraft.
Senior State Department and other Administration officials oppose any imminent sale, fearing it would damage the Middle East peace talks, which resumed in Washington this week. "On the whole, selling F-15's will not be a helpful thing in terms of peace process," said a senior Administration official.
The Administration is also walking a political tightrope by backing $10 billion in loan guarantees to Israel only if Israel agrees to freeze all construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Supporting the Saudi sale now, officials said, could lead to a backlash in favor of the Government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, and thereby undermine the Administration's strategy on the loan guarantees. Congress is currently considering the loan guarantees as part of its foreign-aid legislation.
Moreover, the Saudi sale would appear to run counter to pledges by the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France since the end of the Persian Gulf war to try to control conventional arms sales to the Middle East. In that time, however, Washington has announced $6 billion in arms sales to the region, according to the Arms Control Association.
 
Strong Abroad, Strong at Home?
 Senior Administration officials also differ on the degree to which policymakers should consider the long-term health of America's military industry when deciding foreign arms sales.
"It is not the United States Government's policy to sell arms in order to maintain our own defense industrial base," Richard A. Clarke, the Assistant Secretary of State for Politico-Military Affairs, said in a speech last December.
When asked about the issue at a breakfast meeting last week, Ronald F. Lehman 2d, director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, said: "The answer is, it is a factor, it has always been a factor and will probably always be a factor."
Israel's supporters in Congress are already gearing up for a fight. When reports of the sale first surfaced last November, 67 senators signed a letter to Mr. Bush, objecting to the proposal. "If the Administration proposes this sale, it will face a fierce and heated struggle on the Hill," said Representative Mel Levine, a California Democrat.
McDonnell Douglas and the American aerospace industry, however, are rallying their forces among factory workers and the Missouri congressional delegation, including House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt, whose St. Louis district includes the McDonnell Douglas assembly plant.
"The job factor may have some bearing to support a sale, but I think there're still going to be considerable questions," said Representative Lee H. Hamilton, Indiana Democrat and head of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe and the Middle East.

HEADLINE: Neighbors Testify Against Plans for Roosevelt Raceway

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, L.I., Feb. 25

 BODY:
If there's one thing Long Island doesn't need, it's another shopping center and movie-theater complex, neighbors of Roosevelt Raceway said at a public hearing today. The raceway is the largest piece of undeveloped commercial property in Nassau County.
"We already have 23 movie theaters in a three-mile radius," said Beverlee Szimanski, chairwoman of the Association of Stewart Avenue in South Westbury. "What do we need another one for?" 
 The owners of the 172-acre parcel, Evans & Hughes Realty, are proposing retail and office buildings, a hotel and conference center, a 10-screen theater and housing for the elderly.
At a zoning hearing before the Hempstead Board of Supervisors, the developers said the project would pump $855 million into the Island's economy during construction and produce $34.9 million in tax revenue.
The site is now zoned for industry. The developers are seeking to have it rezoned for a variety of commercial uses.
 
Mondello Leaning in Favor
 Joseph N. Mondello, the town's Presiding Supervisor, said he was leaning toward the project as a way to stimulate Nassau County's economy.
"We can't keep looking to Washington and Albany for ways to jump-start our local economy," he said. "We've got to take the initiative and do something for ourselves."
Building contractors and construction union leaders spoke in favor of the project, but civic association leaders said they were worried about the traffic that would be drawn to already overcrowded roads, as well as the strain on underground water supplies and air quality.
Several residents said they had little confidence in Evans & Hughes, which bought the raceway in 1984 from Madison Square Garden with $54 million in tax-exempt bonds sponsored by the Town of Hempstead Industrial Development Agency, pledging to keep the track open. Within four years, however, the company had closed the track, paid off the bonds and announced plans to develop the property.
An 18-month state investigation of the acquisition ended last month with no charges filed against the owners. The investigators said they found no criminal wrongdoing, but criticized Hempstead officials for failing to scrutinize the deal before and after approving the bond financing.
The mistrust was reflected today in comments by opponents. Shelley Lotenberg, co-president of the 1,000-member Salisbury residential area of Westbury, said the raceway developers had "shown a lack of sensitivity to the people in Nassau and a tremendous sensitivity to their wallets."
She asked that the proposed theater be eliminated and called for more open space and more landscaping.
 
Cautioning Against 'Quick Fix'
 Dorothy Episcopia, a spokeswoman for Garden City homeowners, cautioned against viewing the raceway development as a "quick fix" for the "interrelated economic, employment, housing and environmental problems facing Long Island."
"We cannot argue with the need for projects which will truly boost our sagging economy," she said. "At the same time, we must not repeat the mistakes made during the boom cycles of the past few decades."
She said that "little or no consideration had been given to the possible shift of tenants from already occupied office buildings and shoppers from established malls and business districts."
"If that occurs to a great extent, rather than fill a gap, the project could effectively aggravate the growing office and retail vacancy rate and propagate bankruptcies and foreclosures," she said.
Mr. Mondello said he would rather be optimistic and said that economic development would "help to fill those empty offices and shops."

May and Dillard Stores Post Gains for Quarter and Year

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Feb. 25

 BODY:
The May Department Stores Company reported higher earnings for the fourth quarter and year today, saying that its stores did well despite a tough economy. And Dillard Department Stores Inc., another leading retailer, also said that its earnings rose in the quarter and year.
Following are details of the companies' earnings results:
 
May
 
 The St. Louis-based May, the nation's seventh-largest retailer and one of the largest operators of department stores, said its net income rose by 5.5 percent, to $266 million, or $2.12 a share, for its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended on Feb. 1, from $252 million, or $2 a share, in the comparable period a year earlier.
Its revenues rose by 2.4 percent, to $3.36 billion from $3.28 billion.
"Our organization has performed well during what now has been two years of a difficult economy," said David C. Farrell, the chairman and chief executive.
For the year, May said its net earnings climbed by 3 percent, to $515 million, or $4.02 a share, from $500 million, or $3.88 a share, the prior year. The company's revenues edged up 5.4 percent, to $10.61 billion from $10.06 billion.
May said the company had posted its 17th straight year of record sales and earnings per share.
The retailer also continued its expansion plan during the year, opening 14 department stores and 328 Payless Shoesource stores. At the end of the latest fiscal year, May had 318 department stores and 3,295 Payless stores.
This year, May said, it expects to open 6 department stores and 270 new Payless outlets.
Wall Street greeted the report enthusiastically, driving May's shares up by $2.375 each to close at $58.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Dillard
 Dillard, based in Little Rock, Ark., said its fourth-quarter net rose by 1.1 percent, to $93.3 million from $92.3 million. That was equal to $2.50 a share, up from $2.49.
The retailer said its sales for the quarter, which also ended on Feb. 1, rose by 8.7 percent, to $1.32 billion from $1.22 billion.
For the year, Dillard earned $206.2 million, versus $182.8 million in the previous year. Its sales rose nearly 12 percent, to $4.04 billion from $3.61 billion.
Dillard said it had opened 10 new stores in the fiscal year and closed 5, leaving a total of 198 department stores nationwide.
Dillard's shares also rose on the Big Board today, by $2.125 each to close at $132.75.

HEADLINE: Bailout Agency Criticized On Its Auditing Procedures

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25

 BODY:
The savings and loan bailout program remains unable to keep track not only of the billions of dollars in loans, real estate and other assets seized from failed institutions but also of the cash it gets when the assets are sold, Government auditors have found.
The finding, in a report to be made public on Wednesday, directly counters the repeated assertions of the Resolution Trust Corporation, which runs the bailout program. That agency has reported significant progress in cleaning up its books, monitoring the assets it seizes and supervising the thousands of contractors that it has hired. 
 The report, by the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, raises new concerns that the agency has been overwhelmed in its two-and-a-half-year life by the enormous load of assets it inherited from hundreds of failed savings associations.
In one instance under investigation by Government auditors, the R.T.C. commissioned a $25 million project to look for nearly $7 billion that appeared to have vanished from its books. The agency lost track of the money after it was inundated with new assets from a wave of seizures ordered in the spring of 1990 by L. William Seidman, who was head of the trust corporation then.
But officials now say the $25 million accounting project, known as Operation Western Storm, violated contracting procedures, overpaid contractors and hired hundreds of auditors who sat idle for days with no supervision.
The authorities are still investigating whether the $7 billion in discrepancies involved fraud or was the result of incompetence and poor record-keeping. But senior officials at the trust corporation say the problems highlighted by Operation Western Storm may not be limited to the Denver office, where they occurred.
"R.T.C. still does not have adequate systems in place to support its critical mission of managing and selling assets," said the General Accounting Office report, which was prepared by Richard L. Fogel, an Assistant Comptroller General. "Major systems are plagued by fundamental problems."
In a statement submitted to the House Banking Committee in connection with testimony on the Administration's request for $55 billion more to continue the bailout, Albert V. Casey, the trust corporation's new president and chief executive, appeared to anticipate the report.
"The Resolution Trust Corporation's internal management investigation and its outside audit firm have found several instances where management and oversight failures have resulted in waste," the statement said. "Internal control problems existed in essentially all facets of the Western Storm Project."
 
Starting to Write a Bill
 Mr. Fogel will present his report at a House Banking Committee hearing on Wednesday, a day before a House subcommittee begins drafting a bill to provide more financing for the bailout. A copy of the report was provided to The New York Times by an aide to a lawmaker who has been critical of the rescue effort.
The report also gives credit to the trust corporation for making good progress in selling assets and closing savings associations. It is nonetheless expected to make it more difficult for the trust corporation to get more financing from Congress. The agency has said that it will need more money by mid-March and will run out on April 1.
"The G.A.O. report is clear evidence that the R.T.C. is doing a lousy job at preventing rip-offs and tracking assets," said Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, Democrat of Massachusetts. "They come in and say they're doing their job and they need more money. But they aren't doing their job."
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, as expected, asked Congress today for $55 billion to complete the bailout of the nation's savings and loan industry and reported that significant progress had been made in both seizing troubled institutions and selling their assets.
 
Cost Continues to Rise
 If the Bush Administration's request is granted, it will bring the costs of the rescue effort to $160 billion since 1989. That figure does not include those bailout deals that were struck under the Reagan Administration and interest payments to finance the trust corporation that could bring the total costs as high as $500 billion over the next 40 years.
The request, which falls within the Treasury's 1991 estimates of the bail out but is still many times the $50 billion total estimate in 1989 when the rescue began, is expected to be acted upon in the next few weeks by Congress. It represents the fourth time in almost a year and a half that the lawmakers have been asked to provide financing for the highly unpopular effort.
At a hearing today before the House Banking Committee, Mr. Brady and other officials who have been overseeing the bailout reported significant progress in seizing institutions and selling assets. Since August 1989, the Resolution Trust Corporation has seized more than 680 institutions with assets of more than $370 billion, and sold $240 billion of assets.
 
May Get Half Face Value
 The Government has already received about 95 cents on the dollar for those assets, and its remaining portfolio of commercial loans, raw land and other less desirable assets is expected to be much harder to dispose of and, according to Mr. Casey, might only fetch 50 cents on the dollar, adding significantly to the costs of the rescue effort.
A number of Republicans and Democrats at the hearing also advised the Administration and senior regulators to abandon a plan it is considering to rescue weak but solvent institutions through Government investments. While some regulators say the plan would be cheaper for the Government, it would also bail out the owners of the institutions, who unlike depositors, are not Federally insured.
"I have grave concerns about it," said Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who heads the Banking Committee.
Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa, said the Government should not involved in deciding which institutions to invest in.
"Propping up sick institutions may look politically appealing in the short term for Presidential politics, but in the long term it could too easily result in an increase in taxpayer liabilities and undercut a major pinion of conservative economic philosophy," he said.

UNEMPLOYMENT AND UNCERTAINTY
The New York region faces the prospect of at least 40,000 employees losing their jobs during the next few years. This comes on the heels of the more than 500,000 jobs lost in the region since employment peaked in February 1989. But there is a new and, in many ways, more disruptive element to the latest round of layoff announcements. As companies reveal that thousands of people will be laid off but provide scant details as to when, where or who will be affected, they are creating heightened uncertainty, and causing even those whose jobs are not directly threatened to cut their spending.

HEADLINE: Mao's 2 Telegrams on Korea

 BODY:
Following are the texts of two telegrams in which Mao Zedong discusses his plans for the Chinese invasion of Korea in 1950. The first was sent to Stalin on Oct. 2, 1950. The second was sent to Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, then in Moscow, on Oct. 13, 1950. The telegrams were translated by Thomas Christensen, an Olin fellow at the Center for International Affairs at Harvard.
 
FROM MAO TO STALIN 
 1. We have decided to send part of the armed forces into Korea, under the title of Volunteer Army, to do combat with the forces of America and its running dog Syngman Rhee and to assist our Korean comrades. We recognize this course as necessary. If we allow the United States to occupy all of Korea, Korean revolutionary power will suffer a fundamental defeat, and the American invaders will run more rampant, and have negative effects for the entire Far East.
2. We recognize that since we have decided to dispatch Chinese troops to do combat in Korea, first, they must be prepared to destroy and expel the armies of the United States and other countries; second, since Chinese troops will fight American troops in Korea (even though they will be using the title Volunteer Army), we must be prepared for the United States to declare and enter a state of war with China. We must be prepared that the United States may, at a minimum, use its Air Force to bomb many major cities and industrial centers in China, and use its Navy to assault the coastal region.
3. Of these two problems, the primary problem is whether or not the Chinese Army can or cannot destroy the American forces within Korea, and effectively resolve the Korean problem. So long as our forces can destroy the American forces in Korea, most importantly destroy the American Eighth Army (a veteran army with combat effectiveness), while the seriousness of the second problem (America's declaring war on China), will still exist, the situation will have already turned in favor of the revolutionary camp and China. If the American forces are defeated, the Korean problem is, in fact, finished. (It is possible that formally it may not be over; the U.S. may for a long time not recognize Korea's victory.) So, even if the Americans have already openly declared war on China, the scope of this war will probably not be great, and the duration will not be long.
We see the least advantageous situation as the Chinese Army being unable to destroy the American forces in large number, the two armies in mutual deadlock, and the United States having already entered an open state of war with China, leading to the destruction of the economic development plan we have already begun. Moreover, it would arouse dissatisfaction toward us among the national bourgeoisie and other segments of the people. They are very afraid of war.
4. Under the present situation, we have decided that on Oct. 15 we will begin dispatching the 12 armies that have been transferred in advance to South Manchuria. They will be stationed in appropriate districts of North Korea, not necessarily all the way to the 38th parallel. While they do combat with the enemy who dares to advance north of the 38th parallel -- in the first period fighting a defensive war to destroy small enemy detachments and gaining a clear understanding of the situation -- they will await the arrival of Soviet weapons and the equipping of our army and then coordinate with Korean comrades a counterattack, destroying the invading American army.
5. According to all of our intelligence materials, an American Army (two infantry divisions and a mechanized division) includes tank artillery and anti-aircraft artillery, containing a total of 1,500 artillery pieces of every type, from 7- to 24-centimeter caliber. One of our armies (three divisions) only has 36 pieces of that type of artillery. The enemy has control of the air, and the air force we have begun training will not be able to put 300 planes into the war until February 1951. Because of this, our forces are still unable to assure destruction of the American Army in one blow. And, since we have decided to fight with Americans, we should prepared that, at the point in a campaign when the American command assembles its forces on the battlefield to fight with ours, our troop strength should be four times that of the enemy (using four of our armies to counter one of the enemy's) and our firepower should be one and a half to two times that of the enemy (using 2,220-3,000 of every type of artillery piece from seven centimeters on up to counter 1,500 enemy artillery pieces of the same caliber). Thus they will assuredly, cleanly and thoroughly destroy the one Army of the enemy.
6. Besides the 12 divisions mentioned above, we are also in the process of transferring 24 divisions from south of the Yangtze River and from the Shangan district to take up positions in the Longhai, Jinpu, Beining lines, in order to form the second and third wave of military forces to assist Korea. We estimate that in the spring and summer of next year they will progressively be employed according to the circumstances at the time.
 
FROM MAO TO ZHOU ENLAI
1. The result of a discussion on the part of comrades in the Politburo is that we unanimously believe that having our troops enter Korea is more advantageous. In the first period we can focus on attacking the puppet forces. Our troops countering them is certain. We can open up a base in Korea in the large mountain region north of the Wonson-Pyongyang line, and can inspire the Korean people. In the first period, as long as we can destroy some divisions of the puppet army, the Korean situation can take a turn to our advantage.
2. The adoption of the active policy above will be extremely advantageous for China, Korea, and the world. If we do not send troops, allowing the enemy to press to the Yalu border and the arrogance of reactionaries at home and abroad to grow, this will be disadvantageous to all sides. Above all it will be most disadvantageous to Manchuria; all of the South Manchurian electricity will be threatened.
In summation, we think we should enter the war, we must enter the war. Entering the war will have great benefits, and the harm inflicted by not entering the war would be great.

HEADLINE: 7 Nations to Broaden Battle Against Drugs

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN ANTONIO, Feb. 25

 BODY:
Two years after President Bush traveled to South America to devise a plan to combat cocaine traffickers on their own turf, he is to meet Latin American leaders here to try to strengthen and broaden the effort, which critics say has borne little fruit.
The visit here, on Wednesday and Thursday, will feature five hours of talks with the presidents of Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Mexico and Ecuador and a delegation from Venezuela, between Mr. Bush's campaign appearances in California and Texas. 
 Although details have been kept sketchy, the Administration apparently plans to continue to stress police and military action and does not intend to add to the $2.2 billion in law enforcement and economic aid that has been designated for Peru, Bolivia and Colombia, or to the lesser amounts for the other countries.
The Latin countries, particularly impoverished Peru and Bolivia, the two main producers of the coca that yields cocaine, are expected to press Mr. Bush for trade benefits and large amounts of aid to persuade hundreds of thousands of coca farmers to switch to other crops.
The Latin leaders welcome an opportunity to meet with the President. But some aides say that holding the talks in the midst of a Presidential campaign suggests that little of real concern to them will be accomplished.
"I think the main objective for Mr. Bush here is going to be domestic," said a South American diplomat.
General pledges of cooperation were agreed upon at Mr. Bush's first such meeting in February 1990 in Cartagena, Colombia, with the presidents of Peru, Colombia and Bolivia. The expanded group is expected to draw up specific goals and timetables for reducing drug production, trafficking and consumption, said Bob Martinez, the director of the White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy, and some Latin American diplomats.
The leaders are also expected to establish a hemispheric council that would include at least the seven countries represented here and would meet several times a year.
 
Marking Some Successes
 In analyzing the battle against drugs in Latin America, the Bush Administration claims some modest success. But drug experts and critics in Congress say that, over all, the picture has grown bleaker as drug trafficking has expanded throughout the region.
Not only is cocaine flowing into the United States as freely as ever, they say, but the traffickers have opened up brisk markets in Europe and are begining to find customers in Japan and other Asian countries. Furthermore, Colombia's traffickers are now producing heroin and exporting it to the United States.
"By every objective standard, the President's Andean strategy has failed," said Representative Charles E. Schumer, the Brooklyn Democrat who heads the House Subcommittee on Crime and Criminal Justice, which oversees the Drug Enforcement Administration.
As evidence of progress, Mr. Martinez cited increased seizures of cocaine by several countries in 1991 and the crippling of one of the main trafficking organizations in Colombia.
The Administration has been trumpeting a sharp drop in casual drug use. But any sense of exhuberance has been tempered by an increase in cocaine and heroin consumption in the slums and by an unrelenting rise in murders and robberies connected with drugs.
Though drug experts say any goals and time tables established at the summit may prove meaningless, both the Bush Administration and the Latin American leaders see them as potential levers for applying political pressure.
"It's a way to increase accountability," said one South American official.
The South Americans say that an agreement on clear goals will be evidence that the United States accepts the argument that its consumption has been an important factor in the growth of the drug industries. Likewise, the Bush Administration believes that a public pledge from its neighbors will make it more difficult for them to let the issue slide.

HEADLINE: Domestic Vehicle Sales Rose 4% in Mid-February

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 25

 BODY:
Sales of cars and light trucks built in North America rose 4 percent in mid-February, the auto makers reported today. Analysts said the figures provided additional evidence that the sluggish auto industry was slowly gaining strength.
"We're seeing a semblance of recovery," said Jack V. Kirnan, a Kidder, Peabody analyst in New York. He said the foundation was in place for consistent improvement in sales, noting that more shoppers were visiting showrooms and more deals were being completed. 
 Mr. Kirnan added that car companies were selling fewer vehicles to fleets, suggesting better demand from retail customers. Tom Webb, chief economist of the National Automobile Dealers Association, added, "Real consumers are buying cars."
Although the uptick in sales flies in the face of today's report of a drop in the consumer confidence index for January, analysts said the sales figures better reflected the state of the economy. "It's more important to see what consumers are doing than what they are saying," said Harvey Heinbach, an automotive analyst with Merrill Lynch in New York.
He noted that the selling rate for the last 30 days was slightly higher than in January and in the fourth quarter of 1991. "The glimmer of improvement is continuing, but it's nothing dramatic," he said.
Cars considered to be domestically built include those assembled in Canada and Mexico, as well as those built in North American plants by Japanese companies.
Cars made in North America sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.2 million units, flat from a year earlier. The nation's domestic auto makers posted sales of 174,024 cars in the Feb. 11-20 period, an increase of 2.5 percent over the period in 1991. Light-truck sales rose by 6.6 percent, to 97,529 units. There were nine selling days in each period.
Many dealers who were optimistic last month about a quick recovery in auto sales were less cheerful after the latest sales period. "The pace is a little slower than at the end of January, but it's a heck of a lot better than December," said Fred Sredl, general manager of Ackerman Chevrolet in St. Louis. He added that while showroom traffic was strong, many consumers said they were just looking and planned to buy in the spring.
Mark Herrmann, who sells Buicks, GMC trucks and Subarus in Yonkers, said his business had been inconsistent of late. Showroom traffic is up, he said, but consumers make several trips to his dealership and price-shop elsewhere before they commit to buying.
Sales of the General Motors Corporation's North American-built cars rose 3.1 percent in mid-February, to 75,166 units. The company's light-truck sales declined 1.3 percent, to 34,267 units.
The best-performing G.M. units were Saturn and the Cadillac division, which posted a 62 percent sales gain in the period, largely because of the popularity of its deVille models and its redesigned Seville.
The Ford Motor Company posted an increase in car sales of two-tenths of a percent, to 50,881 vehicles. Sales of its trucks rose 10.9 percent, to 34,893 units.
The Chrysler Corporation sold 17,250 cars in mid-February, a 15.9 percent drop, according to estimates by Ward's Automotive Reports, an industry publication. Chrysler does not report 10-day sales figures. Ward's estimated that Chrysler's truck sales, which include mini-vans, pickup trucks and four-wheel-drive vehicles, rose 7.1 percent, to 22,750.
The Toyota Motor Corporation reported strong gains for its domestically built Corolla models and its redesigned Camry, which has won wide praise in the trade press. Sales of Toyota cars jumped 79.6 percent, to 10,516.
The Honda Motor Company said sales of its American-made cars rose 26.1 percent, to 12,407, and the Nissan Motor Company's car sales jumped 23.8 percent, to 3,239.

HEADLINE: ABOUT NEW YORK;
When the Bill Collector Is the School Principal

BYLINE: By Douglas Martin

 BODY:
SOME perceptions Patricia Brown has found nastily inescapable in recent months: The Lord sure didn't make it easy to be poor; when it rains it pours, and the road to paradise is not likely to be paved with unpaid bills.
"You have to keep smiling even though the tears are flowing," she said. 
 Mrs. Brown, a single mother of four who lives in Coney Island, Brooklyn, is suing a private school in Queens in the belief that it may save her 17-year-old son, Jahmal, from the traps that swallow too many promising young black men. "I don't want him to be another statistic," she declared.
A rather long story boils down to roughly this: Mrs. Brown lost her job as a word processor, and went on unemployment, then welfare. She fell behind on her tuition payments to the tune of $1,927 to the Greater New York Academy of Seventh-day Adventists, where Jahmal spent his sophomore and junior years.
The academy's principal refuses to release his transcript to the public school Jahmal now attends, Abraham Lincoln High in Coney Island, unless Mrs. Brown comes up with at least half of what she owes. In turn, the public school refuses to grant Jahmal full credit for his private school courses, absent an official record of what he took and how he did.
This means he may not graduate in June, and that he cannot apply to colleges -- including ones whose coaches have expressed interest in his football and basketball skills.
At such junctures, it is common for people to curse their fate, then accept it. "Most people just take what they're dealt," said Mark Catalano, a recent law school graduate who works for the firm of Rosenman & Colin. "Mrs. Brown is an exceptional person."
She began her campaign by going to a legal services organization, Advocates for Children. That group, in turn, referred her to South Brooklyn Legal Services, which specializes in legal services for the poor. Rosenman & Colin, a large Manhattan corporate law firm, does pro bono work for South Brooklyn.
"I'm trying to save my kid's life," she said.
So it has been for some time. Jahmal was a sophomore at a Bensonhurst high school when Yusuf K. Hawkins, a 16-year-old black was murdered in a street confrontation with young whites. Already taut racial tensions became uglier. There were fights, tire irons, baseball bats.
Mrs. Brown said her son became despondent, and complained he was being taught nothing. His grades dropped. He began to hate white people. Once a sharp dresser, he stopped wearing his good clothes to school. "It's not important, Ma," he would say.
An alarmed Mrs. Brown vowed the slide would not continue. She went to the Board of Education and demanded a transfer to another high school. She was told that was impossible at midyear, and given a list of private schools. Because the family had converted to Seventh-day Adventism, the Queens academy seemed attractive -- despite a more than two-hour commute each way.
The change worked. Jahmal attended night and summer classes to catch up on ground he had lost. "He started to regain his dignity and self-worth as a person," Mrs. Brown said. "And he realized there are people who care who are not black."
Things did not go as smoothly for her. The 1987 stock market crash spurred a continuing deterioration in such activities as word processing. In March 1990, three months after Jahmal had started at the academy, Mrs. Brown ended a temporary job and found herself unemployed. "I started to fall behind in my bills then," she said.
But the academy's principal let Jahmal continue and take his tests anyway. A financial agreement Mrs. Brown had signed allowed the academy to suspend her son from class attendance or refuse to permit his graduation, unless bills were paid up. The agreement said nothing about transcripts.
Then Mrs. Brown got a permanent job in June 1990, and caught up on her bills, something she swears she is eager to do again. But that ended in January 1991.
The academy's bills began to pile up, and the school's new principal, Del Metellus, demanded payment. "Get it anyway you want," Mrs. Brown remembers hearing. "Go to welfare if you have to."
Miss Metellus's position is that the academy has refused in the past to give transcripts to "a lot of other people" who did not pay their bills. She said another document signed by Mrs. Brown acknowledged the school's right to withhold transcripts.
"We didn't solicit their son's attendance," she said. "They chose to come here.'
A stalemate.
In order for Jahmal to return, arrears would have to have been paid in full by September. So Jahmal applied to Abraham Lincoln, a nearby public school. It needs a transcript.
State Supreme Court in Queens has become the battleground in a case that pits Jahmal's right to an education against the academy's right to be paid what the Browns have contracted to pay it. A hearing was supposed to have been held yesterday, but the judge chose to make a decision from written submissions.
A proud mother is still smiling through the tears.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Plummets

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25

 BODY:
Consumers' confidence in the economy plunged in February to the lowest level since 1974, when the nation was gripped by a severe recession, a business research group said today in its widely followed survey.
The Conference Board said its index for February dropped four points from January to a reading of 46.3, the lowest level since December 1974. 
 The sharp drop in consumer confidence surprised many economists, who expected confidence to remain weak, but not to dive. Some said the fall in consumer sentiment was a fluke in a slowly brightening picture, while many others said the drop indicated that consumer spending and the economy would remain weak for several more months.
 
Decline 'Disconcerting'
 "The continued decline in consumer confidence is disconcerting," said Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center. "The economy will not be convincingly in a recovery phase until there is a marked improvement in the consumer's spirits."
The report jolted the financial markets, and members of the Senate Banking Committee harangued Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, about not doing enough to lift the nation out of recession. In the stock market, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 24.59 points, to 3,257.83.
Visibly concerned over both the condition of the economy and voters' anger about it in an election year, senators of both parties used the hearing on monetary policy to argue and plead, like lawyers before a reluctant judge, that Mr. Greenspan's central bank should tilt in favor of further easing.
 
Comment Reflects Anger
 "I'm wanting to know when monetary policy is going to work," said Senator Jim Sasser, Democrat of Tennessee, reflecting the anger of the members, who are expected to vote in the next few days for the chairman's reconfirmation. "Why not bring the rates down further? Why play Russian roulette with the economy?"
Mr. Greenspan, however, asserting that monetary policy appeared to be working, said that in his view it would be wise to wait until early spring to determine whether further monetary easing was needed.
"The general view is that the economy will start to quicken sometime in the second quarter," he said, remaining patient and polite throughout the pummeling. "If that is the case, we will be coming out with a degree of momentum that will put us on the path for reasonably solid growth."
The Conference Board said its index of consumer confidence reflected a deepening pessimism about the outlook for the economy, with fears of rapidly rising unemployment and inflation.
"Consumers continue to have a bleak view of current economic conditions and are markedly more pessimistic than a month ago in their expectations for the immediate future," the Conference Board said in a statement.
Some economists, however, including David D. Hale, chief economist for Kemper Financial Companies, discounted the figure. Mr. Hale viewed the result as a fluke because retail sales and car sales were picking up. The drop, he said, might reflect recent rounds of layoffs, anxiety that not enough is being done in Washington to improve the economy and all the campaign rhetoric about how poorly the economy is doing.
 
Long-Term Prospects
 Mr. Greenspan said again today that another reason why consumer confidence remained so low was that people had great anxiety about the long-term prospects of the American economy. A drop in confidence is widely considered the reason why the recovery sputtered in the fall.
Economists and survey experts say that both the Conference Board consumer confidence measure and a monthly survey published by the University of Michigan are trustworthy, although the Conference Board report is traditionally more volatile than Michigan's. Economists said that preliminary information released earlier this month indicated that this month's Michigan survey would show consumer confidence flat compared with January.
The Conference Board index, based on a 1985-adjusted base of 100, is calculated from responses to questions sent to 5,000 representative households nationwide, covering topics that range from home-buying plans to job security.
The senators sought to give Mr. Greenspan a heavy dose of the worry and wrath that they and their constituents felt about the economic downturn as it entered its 20th month.
Indeed, the banking committee's chairman, Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, said that if the public at large were voting on Mr. Greenspan's nomination to a second term as chairman, it might very well reject him for acting too slowly.
 
Weeks, Not Months
 When the committee pressed the Fed chairman over how much longer the Fed would wait to determine if the economy is picking up, Mr. Greenspan said, "If this economy is beginning to move, we should be seeing signs of that within weeks, not months."
In his typically oracular manner, he added, "There is room for the Fed to move if we have to move further."
Some senators suggested that the slow recovery was not entirely the Fed's fault, that perhaps even Congress was in part to blame.
"I know it's always fashionable to beat up on the chairman of the Federal Reserve," said Senator Connie Mack, Republican of Florida. He treated the Fed chairman more gently than most of the other senators, but disagreed with Mr. Greenspan's statement last week and again today that the economy appeared to be improving.
Noting that he had just returned from numerous meetings with his constituents, he said: "The message is the economy isn't improving in Florida. It's getting worse."
With a deeply furrowed brow, Mr. Greenspan slumped back in his chair as the senators, often heaping on the campaign rhetoric, harangued him about automobile plant closings, developers who are repeatedly turned down for loans and laid-off airline workers who used to make $16 an hour and now earn $4.50 an hour on part-time jobs. As further ammunition for their assault on the Fed, the senators returned often to the Conference Board report.
Mr. Greenspan called the report "quite disturbing" although he said it might be more pessimistic than the Michigan report, due this Friday, since today's report pays so much attention to the job market, which often picks up more slowly than the rest of the economy.
"Talk about consumer confidence -- this is the only thing you hear," said Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York. "Unless we get that credit out there to the public, to those who need it and to those who are creditworthy, why then we're just going to continue to be mired in this recession."
Some economists were taken aback by the confidence measure. "We're not surprised that consumer confidence remains depressed, but everyone was surprised by how sharp the drop was," said Deborah Johnson, an economist with C.J. Lawrence Inc., "It's bad news for consumer spending. Consumers seem to be holding back."
Mr. Greenspan pointed to several positive signs in the economy, saying that households and companies were reducing their debt burdens, that banks were improving their balance sheets and that the money supply was growing strongly. Nonetheless, he repeated that the central bank was ready to reduce rates further if the signs of a pickup petered out.
Mr. Riegle, the committee chairman, saw today's report on consumer confidence as a warning to the President, Congress and the Fed. "People in the country are trying to tell us something," he said to Mr. Greenspan. "There is a definite economic sickness in the country. We have to have a more aggressive monetary strategy. I think you are too passive."

HEADLINE: Brooklyn Office Project Gets Long-Term Tenant

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

 BODY:
The Dinkins administration signed a 20-year-lease yesterday to move the Brooklyn District Attorney's office into a long-stalled commercial office and hotel complex in downtown Brooklyn, providing the linchpin that could lead the way to construction of the first hotel in the borough in half a century.
Mayor David N. Dinkins, in a ceremony in Brooklyn's Borough Hall, said the district attorney's office would become the "anchor tenant" in the 31-story commercial office tower, the Renaissance Plaza, that has been planned since 1984, but had foundered as several prospective tenants pulled out. The development is to include a Hilton Hotel. 
 Mr. Dinkins said the city's seed money would provide the developer, the Muss Development Company, based in Forest Hills, Queens, with the ability to obtain necessary financing for the project. Under the terms of the lease for 360,000 square feet of space, the rent paid by the city will begin at $19 a square foot or a total of $6.8 million a year, rising to $10.4 million in annual rent by the end of the lease. The district attorney's office is currently scattered among six sites in downtown Brooklyn.
Mr. Dinkins said the city's decision to commit to commercial office space would be an economic spur, providing jobs and tax revenue. "There's some who may criticize us for having done so, but it was important, as an anchor tenant was absolutely necessary," he said.
 
Sources of Financing
 Joshua Muss, head of the Muss Development Company, said once financing was in order, he hoped to begin groundbreaking this summer and he expected the hotel to be built in about 22 months. He declined to discuss potential sources of financing.
Lloyd Kaplan, a spokesman for the developer, said later that discussions were under way with a foreign bank for construction financing and with a pension fund interested in long-term financing. He refused to say whether the New York City or New York State pension funds were involved. But a city official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said there had been some discussions involving state pension funds.
The Renaissance Plaza project, along with the $1 billion Metrotech commercial and academic complex, were both conceived in the 1980's as cornerstones of a plan to revitalize downtown Brooklyn. The 24-story Renaissance Plaza commercial office building and seven-story hotel is planned for a 2.9-acre site opposite Metrotech and the State Supreme Court building.
The Brooklyn Borough President, Howard Golden, who had often bitterly criticized the administration of former Mayor Edward I. Koch for fostering large-scale commercial development only in Manhattan, fervently defended the use of city resources to bring a hotel to Brooklyn.
 
Scheduled for Tax Relief
 "It has been 50 years since the last hotel was built in this borough, a city of 2 1/2 million people which by most standards would be the fourth-largest in the United States," he said yesterday. "We once had 11 major hotels. Today we don't have one major hotel in Brooklyn." He said he had seen 50 major hotels built in Manhattan under the Koch administration "practically all subsidized in some form by the city."
"We expect, by the end of this century, 30,000 new jobs in this borough," he said. "Tell me that were not entitled to a first-class hotel, even if it has to be subsidized."
Renaissance Plaza is also scheduled to receive tax relief under the city's Industrial and Commercial Incentive Program, which was extended yesterday by the City Council through July. Borough officials said the complex would not have been affected even if the incentive program had been ended.
Mr. Dinkins's announcement of help for Brooklyn's downtown development came on the second day of his weeklong stay in Brooklyn, operating out of Borough Hall. The week of high-profile events -- including stops at shopping strips, a school, a police precinct station house and Brooklyn cultural institutions -- is aimed at tackling criticisms that the Mayor has been isolated from the concerns of boroughs other than Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Dow Falls 24.59; Economic Concerns Cited

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stock prices took a moderate spill yesterday, pulled down by lingering concerns about interest rates and gloomy data on consumer confidence. The Dow Jones industrial average was off 24.59 points, to 3,257.83.
Trading was choppy and made more pronounced by program traders, said Birinyi Associates, which tracked 10 programs on the day. 
 Total volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy, at 210.4 million shares, up from 181.3 million shares on Monday, as the Big Board composite index slipped 0.94 point, to 226.68. Losing issues surpassed gaining ones, 1,082 to 644.
Other market indexes were also lower, but their declines were not as sharp as the Dow's. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks was down by 1.82 points, to 410.45, while the American Stock Exchange composite index was off by 2.02 points, to 409.78. Trading on the Nasdaq pulled the composite index down by 3.53 points, to 621.40, while the Russell 2,000 index of small company stocks was off by 1.31, to 207.58.
Stocks traded mixed in early going after the opening, with blue chips weakening and secondary issues rebounding from the previous day's declines, but the weakness increased as the February Consumer Confidence Index, released early in the morning by the Conference Board, came in at 46.3 percent. The index was at its lowest since December 1974 and below the 51.2 percent that analysts had expected. It immediately raised questions about the economic recovery.
 
Greenspan's Testimony
 Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, meanwhile, gave testimony before the Senate. He said an economic recovery was expected, but that growth could falter. Both pieces of news were not well received by the stock market, particularly by those worried about the economy. But for interest-rate watchers, the news was heartening for the chance at more cuts.
Bernard Spilko, the senior vice president of the New York branch of Bank Julius Baer, saw the consumer confidence report as giving investors a second chance to think about the economy and whether stock prices were justified at these levels.
"At this point, interest rates will take center stage again, and if the Federal Reserve lowers rates, the market will continue to rally," Mr. Spilko said. "If it does not, we may see a consolidation to the 3,180 level on the Dow.
"What the market needs is for the Fed to come in, and adding reserves will no longer suffice," he added.
Bond prices reacted favorably by moving up sharply to the lower confidence index number, and the firming helped to limit the decline in stocks.
 
Marvel Up $1.50
 Elsewhere in the market, Marvel Entertainment, the comic book maker, said it expected its first-quarter earnings to be about $4.1 million, or 34 cents a share, more than double a year ago. Marvel said the results were being aided by a 40 percent rise in comic book publishing unit volume and price increases, among other factors. The stock rose by 1 1/2, to 51.
Stone Container, fell 2 1/2, to 27, and Union Camp fell 1 5/8, to 52, as Gary Palmero, an Oppenheimer analyst, lowered the companies' ratings and earnings estimates.
The News Corporation was down 1, to 25, on the resignation on Monday of Barry Diller as chairman of the company's Fox film and television unit. John S. Reidy, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham, cut his rating to "avoid" from "hold."
Traders said the company's earnings estimates were also reduced. Oppenheimer analysts said even though Mr. Diller's resignation was a negative for the company, it reiterated its "market performer" rating.

HEADLINE: Finally, Procrastinators Remember the Neediest

BYLINE: By J. PEDER ZANE

 BODY:
In college, they did not begin their papers until the night before they were due. They do their Christmas shopping on Dec. 24, they file their tax returns on April 15 and they have waited until the Feb. 29 deadline was a whisker away before sending their donation to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
"Every year I plan on sending my donation in early, and every year I never seem to get around to it until February," said a letter attached to an anonymous donation for $50. "Like you say, 'To delay may mean to forget,' and though I often delay, I never forget." 
 Another anonymous donor cited the tough economic times for his delay. "My donation is a little late this year, having just found work after six months of looking," said the note with a $36 contribution. "The thrill of spare time quickly becomes a panic as it continues and the debts mount. Thankfully I am sending this check."
Some people, like Darrell L. Sims of Springfield, Va., said they were just waiting on the sidelines. "I've been watching the campaign with great interest," he wrote with his $30 donation. "I trust you'll put this to good use -- to someone who really needs food."
 
Food, Shelter, Clothing
 Since it was founded in 1912 by Adolph S. Ochs, who was then publisher of The New York Times, the Neediest Cases Fund has raised money for New York's sick, poor and disabled. What began as the "Hundred Neediest Cases" has expanded to meet the needs of thousands of individuals.
As in the past, The New York Times is covering all of the campaign's overhead so that every dollar collected can be passed on directly to seven charities. The money finances many forms of relief including food for the hungry, homes for the homeless and clothing for those without. The seven charities also use the money to provide dental care to poor children, pregnancy prevention workshops for teen-agers, and homemakers that enable the disabled and elderly to remain in their homes.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
McDonnell's Taiwan Deal Faces Delay

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Feb. 25

 BODY:
Amid growing suspicions that Taiwan's effort to take a major stake in America's second-largest commercial aircraft maker may be unraveling, a senior executive of the McDonnell Douglas Corporation said today that it "might well turn out" that other Asian nations would infuse cash into the company and take a role in manufacturing its planes.
The executive, Robert H. Hood Jr., the president of the corporation's Douglas Aircraft Company subsidiary, said today that he was still optimistic that the Taiwan Aerospace Corporation, which was created by the Taiwan Government, would raise $2 billion required for a 40 percent stake in the commercial aircraft maker.
 
A Deadline Comes and Goes
 
 Originally the deal was supposed to be sealed by Jan. 31, but Mr. Hood said today that it might not be completed until "sometime before the end of the year," far longer than company officials had previously indicated.
For several months McDonnell Douglas, which is based in St. Louis, has said that it is talking to other nations about taking an additional 9 percent stake in the commercial aircraft side of the business, retaining 51 percent control itself.
But today Mr. Hood said those countries, which he did not name, might end up taking part of the shares originally intended for Taipei.
"We still do not know what the final deal will look like," Mr. Hood said.
The announcement of the deal in November prompted sharp criticism in Congress and among some of the company's unionized workers that it would ultimately export jobs to Taiwan and risk the loss of strategic American technology.
McDonnell Douglas executives have ardently defended the deal, saying that a wealthy foreign investor with low-cost manufacturing abilities is critical if Douglas is to survive against its two biggest competitors, the Boeing Company and Airbus Industrie.
In recent weeks, however, economics have emerged as a far bigger threat to the deal than politics. There have been widespread reports that a number of Taiwan companies that were expected to invest in the deal have expressed doubts about what they will get out of it in return. The Jan. 31 deadline to close the deal passed with both sides saying that they were still examining the other, and industry executives questioning whether the deal would go ahead.
Taiwan Aerospace, which was formed only five months ago and has never produced a product, says officially that its discussions with McDonnell Douglas are going well. The company was created as part of the Taipei Government's long efforts to nurture a civilian aerospace industry, and it is intended to be something of a national consortium, involving large and small Taiwan companies.
But in Taipei, there are growing fears that the Congressional objections will assure that no substantive technology will be passed to Taiwan. And in Long Beach, Calif., where Douglas is based, workers on the company's commercial jets have expressed fears that ultimately more and more production will be tranfered to Taiwan, putting them out of jobs.
Today Mr. Hood said the fears about the deal were unfounded and he defended the investment as the only reasonable course.
"If we didn't strike a deal with Taiwan, another company like Airbus would," he said. "And if we do not have the money to develop new and competitive aircraft, our market share will dwindle. That will mean fewer jobs."
Mr. Hood dismissed the contention that America would be giving away valuable commercial technology, suggesting that it reflected an underestimate of how widespread the skills required to build aircraft have become.
"The technology is global by nature," he said. "The Russians have it. The Germans have it. The Japanese have it. So what are we protecting?"

HEADLINE: Tax Incentive For Builders Is Extended

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
For the second time in two years, the New York City Council voted yesterday to extend a tax break for developers that both Council leaders and Mayor David N. Dinkins have said should be revamped.
With the administration's urging and blessing, the Council voted 44 to 6 to extend the industrial and commercial development incentive program, which expired on Dec. 31, through July. In the meantime, the State Legislature and the Council are to consider new bills that would channel the tax incentives into poorer neighborhoods and encourage more renovation than new construction in Manhattan. 
 "It's better to have some program on the books than no program," said Peg Breen, the spokeswoman for the Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone. "We were concerned that some outer borough projects might get hurt if this wasn't on the books."
 
700 Projects Since '84
 Established in 1984, the program allows developers in Manhattan to defer property taxes on new and renovated commercial buildings for three years and then pay partial taxes for the next four years and is available to anyone outside the choicest blocks on the East Side and in the Wall Street area. In Manhattan, the owners must begin paying back the deferred taxes after 10 years. Elsewhere, most owners are eligible for a full tax exemption for eight years and in some cases for 13 years.
In the last eight years, 700 projects including more than 20 huge developments, have reaped the benefits of the program. The Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza in the theater district and the Hotel Macklowe on West 45th Street, both in the Times Square, are among those covered in the program.
Critics have charged that the incentives are unnecessary because many of the developments, especially around Times Square and in the financial district, would have gone ahead anyway in the go-go atomosphere of the 1980's. Builders have maintained that with the city's high commercial property taxes, the program is crucial in convincing developers to start projects.
 
Recession Issues
 Mr. Dinkins ran in 1989 on the promise that the program would be changed under his stewardship to insure that more projects would be encouraged in the outer boroughs and north of 96th Street in Manhattan. But his administration's efforts to draft a new law with the Council have become bogged down over whether the Mayor would be allowed to change the boundaries of the eligible areas without the Council's approval. The current boundaries are the entire city except south of Fulton Street and east of the Avenue of the Americas from 34th Street to 59th Street.
The debate over the bill went to the heart of some of the most vexing policy issues brought on by the recession: Can the city afford to subsidize new development when there are too many spaces to fill? And can it afford not to when the construction industry is flagging and jobs are scarce?
The vote to extend the program comes at a time when development in Manhattan has been virtually paralyzed by the recesssion and there are no large building projects on the horizon. So the question of whether big developers in midtown and southern Manhattan will get a windfall from the Council's action is moot for the moment. But mayoral aides say there are at least 30 smaller projects in other parts of the city whose developers have inquired about the tax benefits since the program expired.
Mayoral aides said Mr. Dinkins supports extending the program because he does not want to hurt those developers in the next six months merely to penalize Manhattan developers who may get an unneeded helping hand.
"We can't let it expire because for the other boroughs it's vital," said Sally Hernandez-Pinero, the former Deputy Mayor for Finance.
Voting against the extension, Joan Griffin McCabe, a Brooklyn Democrat, said the program had not spurred new factories but rather office buildings for which there was no market. She called the program "nothing more than a handout to politically well-connected developers."
But Jerome X. O'Donovan, the Staten Island Democrat who heads the Economic Development Committee and supported the extension, said the program was crucial to "show businesses small and big that this city has incentives for them to stay and to come here."
"There are many small businesses in the pipeline" because of the program, he said. "If we didn't extend it, they would be out."
Because the program involves property taxes, it can be continued only if the State Legislature authorizes the local government to grant the tax incentives. Then the City Council could carry out the Legislature's bill, restrict it or decide not to act. The Council may not grant greater tax breaks then the state lawmakers outline.
Several Council members said that they had reservations about the program but were voting for the extension to save jobs and that they would vote against extending the program again if the State Legislature, the adminstration and the Council leaders do not agree on a new program by next fall.
The proposal that the Dinkins administration has put before the Legislature and the Council would continue to encourage building north of 96th Street and in the other boroughs.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Free-Market Economist To Head Cleveland Fed

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
A well-connected Milton Friedman disciple from California will become the new president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Cleveland on March 8.
The choice of Jerry L. Jordan, the chief economist at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles, to replace H. Lee Hoskins, who resigned in November to become the chief executive of Huntington Bancshares Inc. in Columbus, means that one high-profile advocate of hard money and a free-market approach to bank regulation will be replaced by another. 
 "The board liked very much that Lee developed a national reputation," said Karen Horn, the chairman and chief executive of Banc One Cleveland and a former president of the Cleveland Fed. "They were pleased to find someone with similar views who comes with a national reputation."
The Cleveland position is one of the most important among the 12 regional reserve banks. Cleveland's president votes every other year on the Federal Open Market Committee, the group that sets monetary policy. Mr. Jordan will cast his first such vote on March 31.
Mr. Jordan, who says the economy's weakness reflects regional recessions because of military cutbacks, has recently voiced concern about the rapid growth of bank reserves and money measures.
The biggest threat to the modest recovery he says is under way is too much stimulus from Washington, which could ignite inflation fears and drive up long-term interest rates even further. Mortgage rates, he has noted frequently, are already one percentage point higher than in January.
Still, those who know Mr. Jordan do not expect him to make zero inflation quite the crusade Mr. Hoskins did.
"I would surely expect Jerry to be an inflation fighter," Ms. Horn said. "But I would expect to hear less about zero inflation and more about a noninflationary environment as a means to the end of economic growth."
Mr. Jordan's training and experience seem tailor-made for his new job. A Ph.D. from the University of California at Los Angeles, where he was a student of the eminent monetarist Karl Brunner, Mr. Jordan helped make St. Louis a beachhead for the then-radical notion that money growth determined inflation and strongly influenced economic growth.
"Jerry was intellectually the person who put this bank on the map," said Anatole Balbach, the director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank in St. Louis. "He was the one who instituted the so-called St. Louis model."
Allan Meltzer, a monetarist at Carnegie Mellon University and a former member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said, "Jerry is one of the most knowledgeable and sensible economists I know."

HEADLINE: Vehicle's Design Doomed Van Plant

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 25

 BODY:
Viewed in hindsight, the General Motors Corporation's assembly plant in North Tarrytown, N.Y., was probably doomed the moment the company decided in 1987 to manufacture its plastic-bodied mini-vans there.
Although mini-vans were an America original in the 1980's, G.M.'s adaptation, with its wide stance and sloping, futuristic nose, was far less popular than G.M. hoped. The auto maker expected to sell 150,000 to 200,000 mini-vans annually, which would have kept the North Tarrytown plant humming at capacity and might have assured that subsequent mini-van models would be built there. 
 Instead, sales of Chevrolet Lumina APV's, Pontiac Trans Sports and Oldsmobile Silhouettes have totaled only about 100,000 a year, about half of the plant's capacity. "The shape is too avant-garde for some people," said Mark R. Isaia, general sales manager for Brickell Pontiac Honda in Miami.
Meanwhile, two years of losses at G.M., totaling $6.5 billion, have forced the auto maker to cut excess production capacity and wring efficiencies from remaining factories. The new mini-van model, due to appear in 1995, will be built elsewhere at one of the assembly lines for G.M.'s midsize car models. The idea is that midsize cars and mini-vans have similar wheelbases, allowing the vans to be built alongside midsize cars like the Buick Century and Chevrolet Lumina.
Before the recession, G.M. and the rest of Detroit typically dedicated one assembly plant to a single car or truck model, meaning that it expected to sell about 200,000 units of that model in a good year. When demand for the model slackened, the plant simply slowed production and laid off workers. By current standards, G.M. executives agree privately, it was a sloppy, expensive way to do business.
 Japanese auto makers, by contrast, sharpened their manufacturing skills so that many assembly plants could produce several different models on one assembly line. If one model was not selling well, others compensated. Higher use of plant capacity led to an inherently better return on invested capital.
Robert C. Stempel, the chairman of G.M., has vowed to make maximum use of plant capacity by adding a third work shift to most United States assembly plants or by scheduling two 10-hour shifts a day, six days a week. Either way, the number of hours of production would rise sharply. Since G.M.'s capacity exceeds its sales, it is able to shut entire plants and still meet demand. Theoretically, utilization at the remaining plants will be very high, and each will be able to produce several different models.
Tarrytown lacks the machinery to build midsize cars, and G.M. already has more plant capacity for midsize cars than it needs. So G.M. has chosen to put mini-van production into an existing midsize car plant. The result: Tarrytown is not needed.
"When Tarrytown won, it lost," said Dan Luria, automotive analyst for the Industrial Technology Institute, a nonprofit research concern in Ann Arbor, Mich. "The workers did all the right things to get the mini-van, but G.M. was just too optimistic about how many it could sell."
 
 
Memories of Concessions
 Tarrytown's workers have special reason to feel bitter about G.M.'s decision. In 1987, after feisty debate, they voted for innovative and cooperative work rules to replace restrictive and costly union job practices, so that G.M. would consider the plant for the new mini-van. Local and state politicians pitched in with tax breaks, training money and even the elevation of railroad bridges in an effort to win production of the vans.
"It's been a very good work force and a very good local union," said Darwin E. Allen, a G.M. spokesman. He acknowledged that workers had been unusually receptive to managers' ideas about how to save time, space and money.
Still, G.M. has taken pains to declare its decision to close Tarrytown "final," despite vows by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and local politicians to fight for a reversal. Although Mr. Stempel wants all G.M. plants to find ways to raise output, he does not want to rile the United Automobile Workers union, which contends that he is "whipsawing" plants -- pitting them against one another to lower costs.
Today, Stephen P. Yokich, vice president of the U.A.W., warned G.M. executives that they were "playing with fire if they encourage plant-against-plant competition over work rules" to lower costs.
 
 
'Looks Like a Dustbuster'
 The main reason for G.M.'s weak mini-van sales -- why the company has been selling 100,000 annually instead of twice that number -- is the vehicle's controversial exterior styling. "It looks like a Dustbuster," said a G.M. manager who insisted on anonymity.
G.M.'s design staff decided to endow the vehicle with a radically futuristic look and bodies skinned in plastic. The sharp slope of the nose initially gives a driver a feeling of being seated in the center of the vehicle rather than in the front.
In any event, G.M.'s next mini-van model probably will not be such a big design risk. The plastic panels will probably be replaced by conventional steel panels so that G.M. can easily construct the vehicle with its midsize models. But by that time, Mr. Stempel promised on Monday, at least one of G.M.'s five midsize car-assembly plants will be shut down.

HEADLINE: Sides Warm Up for Tax Fight Today

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25

 BODY:
Republicans and Democrats warmed up for the angry floor debates that will begin on Wednesday over tax and growth legislation with several hours of wrangling over both the substance of competing bills and the procedures for considering them.
In a drawn-out rhubarb at the Rules Committee, Republicans charged the Democrats with misrepresenting President Bush's proposals and trying to keep them from coming to a vote. 
 Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon, Republican of upstate New York, called for a bipartisan approach and said Democrats were apparently trying to "prolong the recession and improve their chances of electing a President."
Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the third-ranking Democrat in the House, said the issue was as simple as "which side are you on?" -- the rich side or the middle-class side.
 
Taxing the Wealthy
 Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, said the Democrats' six-year bill of $79.1 billion in tax cuts and $93.5 billion in tax increases was designed to "make the tax code fairer by requiring the wealthy to pay their fair share."
Its main provision is two years of tax credits of up to $400 per family, paid for by increasing the maximum personal income tax rates from 31 to 35 percent and imposing a 10 percent surcharge on tax owed by taypayers with taxable income of $1 million or more.
Republicans argued that the Democratic bill would do little to help the nation out of the recession, and Representative Bob McEwen, Republican of Ohio, said Democrats should follow the pattern set in Czechoslovakia, Poland and developing countries and not tax capital gains at all.
An important feature of Mr. Bush's bill is a reduction in the maximum tax rate on capital gains from 28 to 15.4 percent. The Democratic bill would index capital gains against inflation, so that only the profit that exceeded inflation would be taxed.
 
Some Democrats Rebel
 That provision brought one of the sharpest attacks in today's meeting, as Representative David R. Obey, a liberal Democrat from Wisconsin, said that while it looked inexpensive in the first few years, it would cost $300 billion over 20 years.
He called it a "long-term tax cut for the very rich," adding, "I do not believe that is what the Democratic Party stands for."
Mr. Obey said he had no idea how many other Democrats would join him in opposition to the bill when it comes to a vote, probably on Thursday. The Democrats can lose 50 out of their 268 members and still pass the bill, and House leaders insisted today they had the votes in hand.
But before it comes to a vote, there is likely to be one dose after another of the snarling partisanship that alternated with appeals to end partisan bickering in today's commitee meeting.
Mr. Solomon, for example, said Representative Butler Derrick, a South Carolina Democrat, sounded like a Communist in saying the same thing over and over again. Mr. Derrick demanded an apology. Mr. Solomon said, "If you want it, you have it."
"Look at the deficit," said Representative James H. Quillen, Republican of Tennessee. "Look at what the Democrats have done to the nation. It's time to forget partisan politics."
Because of the uncertainty over the House schedule, the Senate Finance Committee today put off its plans to start voting on its version of the measure until next Tuesday.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up in U.S. Trading After Falling Earlier in Day

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A burst of buying sent the dollar higher in hectic domestic trading yesterday despite continued indications that the economy is still mired in recession.
The dollar fell overseas and also declined in early domestic trading following the release of a Conference Board report showing consumers' confidence in the economy plunged in February to the lowest level since 1974, when the nation was gripped by a severe recession. 
 Many traders were expecting the report to show an improvement in sentiment, but fears of rapidly rising unemployment kept consumers pessimistic.
The news sent the stock market lower and evoked a response from the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, who called the survey results disturbing.
But investors took advantage of the dip in the dollar to step in and buy the United States currency with an appetite that made the session "possibly the most exciting day in the market so far this year," said Marc Chandler, an analyst with the advisory firm IDEA.
He said dollar purchasers ran the gamut from mutual fund managers to corporations to speculators. "The sentiment remains awfully bullish, and it's partly feeding on itself," Mr. Chandler said.
The dollar's resiliency "mushroomed into a very, very strong dollar rally," said John McCarthy, chief dealer at ABN-AMRO Bank N.V.
He said the curreny's strength was built on several factors, including anticipation that better days lie ahead for the United States economy while concerns build over the economic strength of Germany and Japan.
"People are anticipating a divergence in the performance of the United States economy and the other economies as the year goes on," he said, which support the bullish sentiment surrounding the dollar.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 129.32 yen, up 0.06 yen from Monday. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 129.45 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 129.90 yen, up from 129.20 yen on Monday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.7560, from $1.7473 late Monday. In New York it cost $1.7380 to buy one pound, less expensive than Monday's $1.7467.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.6595 German marks, up from 1.6528; 1.5065 Swiss francs, up from 1.4935; 5.6410 French francs, up from 5.6185; 1,245.25 Canadian dollars, up from 1,240.00, and 1.1860 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1892.

HEADLINE: C.D. Rates Down Slightly

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields on bank money market accounts and short-term certificates of deposit continued to ease slightly in the week ended yesterday, according to The Bank Rate Monitor, which tracks bank rates.
"The easing is entirely in the short-term accounts," Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Monitor, said yesterday. "The five-year certificate of deposit yields have been cautiously nudging upward for the past five weeks. Investors should not expect a quick rebound in rates like those that followed the bottom of previous down cycles. Any upturn is bound to be slow and sluggish at best." 
 Among New York area commercial banks, the average money market account yield dropped 2 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 3.50 percent.
Among savings institutions, money market account rates averaged 4.04 percent, off 2 points from a week ago.
The steepest drop among money market accounts in banks in the New York area was at Emigrant Savings Bank, which lowered its rate on such accounts by 15 basis points.
American Savings Bank had the sharpest drop in three-month certificates, with a cut of 10 points, while Banco Popular cut its six-month certificate by 16 points.
The Bank Rate Monitor said the average yields at 20 large banks outside the New York area declined by relatively small amounts, down 2 points, to 3.60 percent for money market accounts, and down 2 points, to 3.85 percent, on six-month certificates.
By comparison, at the Treasury's weekly auction of three- and six-month bills on Monday, the average rate was 3.96 percent and 4.08 percent, respectively.


GRAPHIC: Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday, February 26, 1992. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yields are based on the method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimums may vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gold Prices Move Lower On Signs of Weak Economy

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Gold futures prices fell yesterday on new signs that the economy would remain in recession in the near term, analysts said.
Gold futures for April delivery fell 50 cents, to $350.60 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York after the Conference Board reported that its index of consumer confidence index fell to 46.3 in February from a revised 50.2 in January. The index uses 1985 as a benchmark of 100. 
 It was the gloomiest reading on the index since December 1974, when there was double-digit inflation and soaring unemployment.
Analysts said the index suggested that the economy could remain weak for some time. That encouraged traders to sell out their gold positions, they said. Precious metals prices typically fall on signs of low interest rates and low inflation.
Adding to the downward pressure on gold were remarks by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who told the Senate Banking Committee that the Fed is prepared to cut interest rates further if a recovery fails to take hold early this spring.
Gold traders also reacted to weakness in the stock market, where the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 24 points, to 3,257.83.
"The economy is not showing any signs of expanding," one trader said. "That is hurting the precious metals."
Silver also dropped on the signs of a listless economy, with the March contract down 2.5 cents, to $4.068 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange.
Wheat futures closed mostly lower on the Chicago Board of Trade as traders continued to liquidate positions taken during the market's recent run higher, traders said.
Only March wheat held steady at $4.0825 a bushel, supported by reports that the Commonwealth of Independent States, made up of parts of the old Soviet Union, had obtained financing to buy American wheat.
Deferred-delivery contracts for wheat fell as much as 5.5 cents a bushel on improved growing conditions for the emerging winter wheat crop in the Midwest, a portent of strong wheat supplies after harvest.
Weakness in the wheat futures spilled over to trading in corn, with the March contract falling 0.75 cent, to $2.6275 a bushel. March soybean futures settled 2.75 cents lower at $5.7725 a bushel.

A Look at the Haters and the Hated

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
"48 Hours on Hate Street," at 8 tonight on CBS, is a scrapbook of recent clashes around the country over race, homosexuality and charges of anti-Semitism. Although the patched-together hour does not provide much support for Dan Rather's opening statement that extremists are moving into the mainstream, it does point up what seems to be a resurgence of group tensions.
In Denver, Phil Jones interviews Shawn Slater, a 25-year-old graduate of the Culinary Institute of America who is a rising star in the supposedly cleaned-up Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. "I don't hate anybody," he says, but the benign image is somewhat smudged by a stomach tattoo, which he has difficulty explaining, that features Hitler, Mussolini, Charles Manson and a swastika. 
 He and a few stiff-armed followers are seen protesting a march last month honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The marchers reacted by throwing snowballs and stones at the white-powerists and then turning their anger against the police, thereby giving the Kluxers national publicity. One black leader says, "The Klan won."
In New York City, the Rev. Al Sharpton tells an interviewer that if hate is needed to fight what he deems to be racism, he will use hate, and there he is leading demonstrations through Bensonhurst in 1989, ostensibly to protest the killing of Yusuf Hawkins. The point here seems to be that racism breeds racism.
Free speech for unlikable people comes up at Ohio State University in a segment that focuses on one Bradley Smith, who contends that the Holocaust is a Zionist fiction. When the university's student newspaper printed the text of an advertisement with his views, along with articles criticizing it, Jewish students protested.
There is also a glimpse of a dispute in Portland, Ore., over a proposal to outlaw discrimination against homosexuals in housing and unemployment, and interviews with a Jewish real estate agent who was on the receiving end of insulting anonymous phone calls and with a black store clerk who was threatened at his job. Little effort is made to link these quite distinct incidents. Although the program is not strong on mind, its heart in the right place; it ends with lessons in tolerance at a Brooklyn school.
For a much more intriguing close-up of the radical right in America, tune in to the Discovery Channel at 9 P.M. on Sunday for "Blood in the Face." The 80-minute documentary, which was shown in theaters last year, focuses on members of the American Nazi Party, the Aryan Nation, the White Patriot Party and David Duke's National Association for the Advancement of White People, among others. There is no narration, so these self-anointed pure-white Americans have plenty of opportunity to expose themselves. Their conspiracy theories make Oliver Stone's seem anemic.
 
A Look at Mexico
"The Mexicans: Through Their Eyes," tonight's National Geographic offering at 8 on Channel 13 and at 9 on Channel 21, combines striking images with puffy phrases like travelogues of old.
After a brief account of the merger of pre-Columbian and Catholic cultures that began with the Spanish invasions of the 16th century, the program visits with the artist Rufino Tamayo, who died in June; a prominent ecologist; a fire-eater in Mexico City; a factory worker in Juarez, to which foreign-owned companies have been drawn by the cheap labor, and others.
What they have to say is not particularly revealing, but one's attention is held by rush-hour scenes on the Mexico City subway; masked wrestlers; Mayan ruins; a spectacular flight of countless monarch butterflies in their long annual migration; the ceremonies of the Day of the Dead, when believers visit cemeteries to commune with the spirits of the departed.
Unfortunately, William Livingston's photography is undermined by the script of his co-producer, Jeanne Rawlings. The narrator -- Edward James Olmos, voice hushed as though in church -- spreads cliches like incense. "This is a city of contrast," he actually says. At the scene of an accident (which seems to have been included because a camera happened to be there), he says, "Tragedy comes to all big cities." Tamayo's work is described as "universal, timeless." A rain forest is also called timeless, and magical, too. The ecologist is called "the conscience of Mexico."
Like the slogans of the Independence Day rally with which the hour ends, much of the narration is hollow cheerleading: "Theirs is a spirit that endures," breathes Mr. Olmos. And he concludes in an exhalation of vapors: "For what is Mexico will survive."
The serious matters touched on here, like overpopulation, endemic poverty, illegal border crossings to the United States and ever worsening pollution, are all besmogged by the resolute reverence. The mass rally with which the documentary ends is not likely to stir enthusiasm in anyone who knows much about Mexico's political history. This hour is condescending both to the subjects on that side of the border and to viewers on this side.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Republicans;
Marching Through Georgia, Guns Firing

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Feb. 25

 BODY:
The Republican primary battle between President Bush and Patrick J. Buchanan has rolled into Georgia with an angry tone. Each camp is trying to cast itself as the authentic heir to the Southern conservative tradition, and each is attacking the other in a rough politics of values.
In a dizzying succession of television interviews, Mr. Buchanan sat in an Atlanta hotel suite this week and hit almost every flashpoint in Southern politics. He railed against "blasphemous art" financed by the Federal government, fumed about "racial quotas" and hammered at a President who he said had "cut deals" with Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who is one of the enduring targets of the Southern right. 
 Meanwhile, the Bush campaign, after largely holding its fire in New Hampshire, was on the air today with a new television commercial featuring Gen. P. X. Kelley, the retired Marine Corps Commandant, who criticized Mr. Buchanan for opposing the war in the Persian Gulf. "It was a disappointment to all military people," the general says, "a disappointment to all Americans who supported the Gulf War, and I took it personally."
In a region noted for its tradition of military service, the commercial asks, "If he doesn't think America should lead the world, how can we trust him to lead America?" It ends with the line: "Pat Buchanan: wrong on Desert Storm, wrong for America."
Bill Thorne, executive director of the Bush campaign in Georgia, said: "We came out with a hard-hitting ad because we found most people didn't know he opposed the President on the Persian Gulf war. It's an educational effort."
Jerry Woodruff, director of communications for the Buchanan campaign, said in response to the new commercial: "I don't think Pat Buchanan is vulnerable on the Gulf War issue. After all, Saddam Hussein still has a job while a lot of Americans do not."
Asked by reporters about the Kelley commercial, Mr. Buchanan acknowledged that he initially had opposed United States involvement in the war. But he said that "from the very first shot" he had stood behind the American military and he argued that his initial reluctance for this country to become involved had been no different from positions taken by Gen. Colin L. Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the commander of allied forces in the gulf.
In short, both sides are running hard for next Tuesday's primary in Georgia, whose results could be an omen for the following week, when voters in eight Southern or border states go to the polls. After the embarrassment of Mr. Buchanan's 37 percent showing in New Hampshire, to Mr. Bush's 53 percent, the Bush campaign is taking a far more aggressive stance here.
Mr. Bush will encamp in Georgia this weekend, state campaign officials said, and Vice President Dan Quayle is scheduled to arrive on Wednesday. The Bush campaign has also mobilized an army of surrogates, including Representative Newt Gingrich, the Georgia conservative; Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, another stalwart of the right, and Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp.
Charles Black, a senior adviser to the Bush campaign, said of Mr. Buchanan, "We're going to respond to his charges, and highlight some of his more controversial views."
 
Playing Hardball
 Mr. Buchanan, addressing remarks to the Bush campaign as he was campaigning today in Tennessee and Mississippi, said: "If you want to come ahead and play hardball, come right ahead. We Buchanans are used to it."
He accused Mr. Bush and his surrogates of attacking him personally, going beyond the bounds of good political taste.
"The personal insult is the resort of an exhausted mind," he said in a speech to students at Vanderbilt University in Nashville.
The President's forces are trying to pull off a complicated task: to simultaneously defeat Mr. Buchanan, mollify the party's right and lay the groundwork for unifying the party for the general election. In a sign of that balancing act, Fred Cooper, the chairman of the Bush campaign in Georgia argues that good Republicans should not indulge in protest votes. "Our real enemy is the liberal Democrat who the President will be running against," he said.
In a sense, some Bush allies acknowlege, the Republican predicament recalls the task of past Democratic nominees in trying defeat the Rev. Jesse Jackson without antagonizing his core of support. "In some ways, he is sort of the Jesse Jackson of the right," said Mr. Gingrich of Mr. Buchanan in an interview. "But he has much less of a base in the real world."
So far, the Bush campaign is having the toughest attacks on Mr. Buchanan come from voices other than the President's. The other new television commercial begun by the Bush forces today is a positive message featuring the President himself. The advertisement talks about the "agenda to strengthen our economy" and ends: "President Bush: the future of America. In the hands of experience."
 
No Help from the Challenger
 Mr. Buchanan is not making it easy for Mr. Bush. At a rally in Atlanta Monday night, where he noted that two of his great-grandfathers "happened to be troublemakers and rabid secessionists," Mr. Buchanan told his cheering audience that, "There's only one candidate in this race who's a conservative and a traditionalist across the board, who believes in lower taxes, in less spending, in traditional values, in standing up for the right to life."
The commentator and former Presidential speech writer grouped Mr. Bush with former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the leading candidates for the Democratic Presidential nominations, describing them as "big government people, big spenders."
"They believe in quotas, they believe in Congressional pay raises, they believe in higher taxes," he said.
As his audience urged him on, Mr. Buchanan added, "And if I get elected I will go to Washington and from day one I will fight every one of them up there."
He also continued to emphasize his theme that it was time to "put America first," and redirect American resources to the homefront.
Mr. Gingrich said in an interview, "He's trying to find the Panama Canal: that visceral, emotional, powerful issue that galvanizes a constituency." The Georgia Republican predicts that Mr. Buchanan will get 25 to 30 percent of the vote here.
The Buchanan forces are clearly hoping to attract conservative Democrats, who can vote in either primary because of Georgia's election law. This remains one of the important variables here. In the meantime, the Bush-Buchanan struggle carries on, with a decidedly Southern inflection.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: White House;
Bush Goes West; Criticism of Message Follows

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 25

 BODY:
President Bush carried his re-election campaign west today, only to run into the same assertion voiced by some supporters elsewhere: that he lacked substance and conviction.
It was all the more stinging because it appeared to come from a most unlikely source, former President Ronald Reagan. And Mr. Bush's political advisers rushed to rebut it. 
 As Mr. Bush flew to California for two $1,000-a-plate fund-raising events with Republican loyalists, Mr. Reagan was reported in today's Washington Post to have expressed concern about the party's chances of retaining the White House this fall.
The Post article, by Mr. Reagan's unofficial biographer, Lou Cannon, reported that the former President had told unnamed associates that Mr. Bush was in political trouble nationally because "he doesn't seem to stand for anything."
 
A Call on the Reagans
 When asked about the report during his flight to California, Mr. Bush paused, then replied, "I don't believe that."
Asked whether Mr. Reagan would campaign for him in the state, Mr. Bush said that his former boss had "been very good about that" in the past but that it was too early to say. "He's quite supportive, as you know," Mr. Bush said. "He's endorsed me enthusiastically."
He paid a brief, private call on Mr. Reagan and his wife, Nancy, this afternoon at their home in the Bel-Air district.
Accurate or not, Mr. Reagan's purported statement reflects what some of Mr. Bush's own aides have been saying, and what his campaign staff has tried to address since last week's disappointing showing in the New Hampshire primary.
The President's political aides allow that Mr. Bush's basic campaign messages, about his plans for economic recovery and global leadership, have not appealed to voters as much as was hoped. The problem, they say, is that voters do not understand clearly enough what the President proposes to do in a second term.
Today, the President began a luncheon speech to San Francisco Republicans with the least varnished of entrees: "I want to lay it out straight," he said, "what Government can do, and what it can't; what I will do as President and where I'll need your help."
Mr. Bush faces especially daunting problems in California, the largest electoral prize in the fall election and a state whose recession has been unusually long and deep.
Ms. Clarke said today that the campaign in California would be difficult but that Mr. Bush's support of business and free trade would gain him votes in a state that is dependent on exports.
Mr. Bush cited as examples of his Western support today's two "enormously successful" fund-raising events, expected to add $2 million to the $14.3 million in his campaign coffers.
Mr. Bush appeared in San Francisco with the state's Republican hierarchy and dined in Los Angeles tonight with Hollywood celebrities.
In Los Angeles, Mr. Bush used a meeting with American and Mexican environmental officials to extol the benefits of his proposed North American free-trade agreement, which faces substantial opposition in Congress.
The pact would end trade barriers among Canada, the United States and Mexico over about 10 years. Critics assert that it would worsen pollution along the 1,900-mile border by increasing Mexico's industrial growth.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
Tsongas Picks Up Speed But Loses Some Control

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Feb. 23

 BODY:
Before his victory in New Hampshire, Paul E. Tsongas got by with a campaign staff that consisted mostly of old friends and a band of young volunteers who called themselves the "Tsongi."
Now, he has been discovered by political professionals as a potential meal ticket, and with scores of paid employees and volunteers joining the staff, Mr. Tsongas is being buffeted by the loss of control that goes with the move to prime time. 
 For example, the former Senator from Massachusetts learned from reporters on his plane headed for Sioux Falls, S.D., recently that he was going to be speaking in a stockyard, not to the State Legislature. Mr. Tsongas bolted up to the front and warned his staff that he wanted to be part of the discussion about any scheduling changes.
"In my head, I was preparing to make a speech to the Legislature," he said, a little stunned.
 
No Place for High Heels

Later, Brad MacKenzie, a member of the original staff who once put together by hand the few press kits the campaign needed, admitted that the stockyard event had not been a triumph. The candidate's wife, Niki, who was dressed up to meet the legislators, was left "standing in a pigpen in high heels," he said.
In the days since New Hampshire, there have been more money and more offers of help.
Nicholas A. Rizzo, the campaign finance director, said that until the New Hampshire primary, raising money for Mr. Tsongas had been "difficult at best" because his home base, Massachusetts, was in an economic depression and because Mr. Tsongas had been out of public office for eight years.
In all of 1991, the campaign raised $1.1 million. The day after the New Hampshire primary, it took in $350,000. Mr. Rizzo said the funds coming into the campaign after Mr. Tsongas won the primary increased by 400 percent.
"Money follows a winner," Mr. Rizzo said. But, he said, "We are still the underdog financially and politically to Bill Clinton."
 
Help Is Appreciated
 The financial help is appreciated by Christine Naylor, who puts together fund raisers for the campaign. "Before, I would go in to staff the events, get the person to hold the fund raiser, drag in donors, arrange for tickets, and place," she said. "Now I have help."
Ms. Naylor said she would like to bring in at least $500,000 a week from fund raisers now, money that would be used in primary states, particularly on television advertising. "I'm getting fund-raising calls now from people in Georgia, Texas, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana and North Carolina," said Ms. Naylor. "We're even getting feelers from people from other campaigns. They are not jumping ship, but they want their names in the loop."
Like many others on the Tsongas campaign, Ms. Naylor had either known or worked for Mr. Tsongas during his years in Congress.
 
Busy but Not Complaining
 "We've gotten a lot of calls, more than we can process," said Dennis Kanin, Mr. Tsongas's campaign manager and longtime friend. "It's an embarrassment of riches, but not something we're going to complain about."
In the week after New Hampshire, the staff has gone from 40 paid members to double that number.
"Now it is more departmentalized," said Dennis Newman, one of two national field directors. "Before, I knew everything. Now an event happens, and I hear about it second or third hand. Everything is moving."
The number of telephone calls to Mr. Tsongas's headquarters here in Boston surged with requests for the candidate's presence, copies of his economic booklet, press kits and offers of help from ordinary citizens and campaign veterans. Since the primary, the campaign headquarters has expanded onto another floor and now has a telephone cable line and two switchboards.
Mr. Tsongas's victory also gave his candidacy the kind of legitimacy that attracts political professionals.
Gerald J. Austin, who helped Senator Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota, in his long shot 1990 victory and was manager for the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Presidential campaign in 1988, recently joined the Tsongas campaign in an as-yet undefined role.
Ted Van Dyke, a longtime Democratic organizer who once dismissed Mr. Tsongas's candidacy, wrote a recent article for the Op-Ed page of The Washington Post praising him.
Mr. Kanin said Mr. Tsongas had also received calls from several high-profile state and national politicians who are flirting with the idea of working for Mr. Tsongas.
 
The Original Team
 But Mr. Kanin said, "Even if we got somebody else involved, we'd still keep our original team." That team includes Niki Tsongas; Mr. Kanin; Nicholas Rizzo, who handles fund raising; Michael Kail, a lawyer in Washington; Barry White, a managing partner in the law firm in which Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Kanin are partners; Edward Jesser, a White House aide in Jimmy Carter's Administration, and Peggy Connolly, former communications director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
Weekly logistical arrangements that once could have been mapped on a napkin now require meetings and daily schedule shifts.
"It was rare I made a call outside New Hampshire's 603 area code," said Ms. Connolly, the press secretary, showing a visitor a two-page, tightly spaced list of people across the country that she will soon be in in touch with.
Andrew Paven, who worked in the 1988 Presidential campaign of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, once doubled as both Mr. Tsongas's advance person and as the staff member traveling with the candidate to keep him up to the minute on arrangements.
Mr. Paven was fond of the enthusiastic but youthful New Hampshire volunteers who worked for Mr. Tsongas, but once the candidate began to get an entourage of reporters and attract large audiences, he turned to more experienced friends who had done advance work for other candidates.
One of them was James King, chief of staff of Senator John Kerry's Massachusetts office and a veteran of several Presidential campaigns. He was on loan to the Tsongas campaign for several days during the primary week to shepherd the press.
Mr. Paven said the change has affected the way he enters events. Instead of "crossing my fingers and walking through the door," Mr. Paven said, he now goes in with some confidence that things will run smoothly.
Still, the Tsongas campaign does not yet have a fully professional gloss. That was apparent at a fund-raising event here Saturday.
Mr. Tsongas told the $25-a-person audience of cheering supporters in Boston that in Baltimore he had been given what he thought would be the symbol of his campaign: an oar.
Mr. Tsongas waited for an aide to get it for him. "Where is the prop?" he said.
A staff aide called out that it could not be found.
"That's a former staff person," said Mr. Tsongas with his trademark deadpan expression.

"He may not speak with a Southern accent, but when it comes to his plans to rebuild our economy, he speaks our language," Mr. Boren said. (Michael Geissinger for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Flint Journal;
A City Where Hope Runs on Empty

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FLINT, Mich., Feb. 25

 BODY:
In its glory days, not so very long ago, when jobs seemed almost as plentiful as autumn leaves, this town proudly called itself "Vehicle City," because of all the cars and trucks its workers produced for the General Motors Corporation.
But the American Dream has been fading into bitter memory here for years now as job after job has been lost to layoffs and plant closings. Vehicle City is running out of gas. 
 So the announcement Monday that G.M. will close an engine plant here, eliminating 4,036 jobs by 1995, hit Flint hard -- but not as hard, perhaps, as it might have when the city and the nation were younger.
"Unfortunately, this is a town that has been bombarded within the last decade with this kind of bad news," said Ben Hamper, who worked on G.M. assembly lines for 12 years before writing "Rivethead," (Warner Books, 1991), a book about the plant. "It's sad, but Flint is sort of an old hand at this by now."
In a written statement to the engine plant employees, G.M. officials said closing the plant, which opened in 1954, was a difficult decision, "particularly because of the impact on the people involved."
But the letter said the plant's age, G.M.'s belief that more than half the work force would be of retirement age in 1995 and that many others would be reassigned to other plants played major roles in the decision.
That G.M. planned to close several plants and lay off thousands of workers had been well known since December. In particular, there was a fight to the death between a plant in Arlington, Tex., and one near Ypsilanti, Mich. Texas won.
But few here, from the Mayor to a repairman inside the doomed plant to a union official, said they had any idea until Monday that the V-8 engine plant in Flint would be among the casualties. Of the 12 plant closings announced for the United States and Canada, Flint will lose the most jobs.
"Everybody is still in a state of shock," Roger Cunningham, a machine repairman at the plant, said today. "We weren't warned at all."
Jim Davis, a 50-year-old machine operator in the plant's connecting-rod department, said: "G.M. has stuck it to Flint a lot the last few years. They are building cars nobody wants. They're the ones who tell us what to build. They didn't complain about how we worked back in the 60's and 70's when we were makikng them a lot of money."
Across the street from the yellow brick plant, Jim Stroud, an official with Local 659 of the United Automobile Workers, sat in his office before going into the factory.
"Willow Run had time to think about what was going to happen," Mr. Stroud said, referring to the doomed plant in Ypsilanti. "But here, it was boom, you're going to close. You always hear about plant closings, but it never sinks in until it's yours. It's like a death in the family."
For many here, GM was part of the family for generations. The company was born in Flint in 1908, and tens of thousands of young men and women marched straight from a graduation line to an assembly line in a G.M. plant. Many stayed until retirement and some even worked alongside their grandchildren.
"These aren't people who have had five or six jobs," said Joe Plummer, a 47-year-old toolmaker. "They've only worked one job all their lives, at G.M."
It wasn't as if Flint families were obligated to keep sending generation after generation to the plants. For many, the wages were good enough to send children to college. And soon these clans of blue-collar workers had a doctor or a lawyer in the family.
The last decade or so, however, has been hard on Flint and its mainstay employer. In 1982, G.M. employed about 65,740 workers at its Flint plants, according to Edwin Custer, the city's planning and housing Manager. In 1989, the work force was down to about 46,660. Flint's population in 1980 was 159,611, In 1990, it was 140,761.
Surprisingly, and despite instances of Americans' paying money at staged events to smash Japanese cars, several workers here said their fight was not with the Far East.
"I'm not mad at the Japanese," said Mr. Plummer. "I'm mad at our Government. They let the Japanese dump their mini-vans on our market."
A few miles away, in the heart of Flint's downtown, Diane Pendleton, a waitress and manager at the Verdict restaurant across the street from the Genesee County Courthouse, said the city grew to rely too heavily on the paychecks from the G.M. plants.
"Now, all of a sudden it's falling apart," she said. "The town has a downbeat attitude. We're all hoping for the best but expecting the worst."
She said almost every family in town has a relative or friend working in one of the plants, and almost every family in town has been hurt during the hard times.
"We help each other buy groceries, pay the rent, whatever," she said. "It's like the blind leading the blind. The poor helping the poor. But we've been through bad times before. I guess we'll survive."

HEADLINE: Killing Alarms Japanese-Americans

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 25

 BODY:
The stabbing death this week of a Japanese businessman who had reportedly been the target of anti-Japanese remarks and a death threat heightened fears today among Japanese-Americans of a spread of racial harassment.
News of the killing of the man, Yasuo Kato, a 49-year-old real estate consultant in the Ventura County town of Camarillo, spread quickly among Japanese-Americans here, adding to a sense of uneasiness that community leaders said had been caused by a recent spate of ugly incidents. 
 Mr. Kato was found dead in his garage on Monday, two weeks after a confrontation with two men who had threatened to kill him and made remarks about job losses because of the Japanese, said Commander Vince France of the county sheriff's department.
"In light of all the different racial-harassment incidents and Japan bashing, I think there is heightened anxiety with the news that this guy has been killed, regardless of what the actual motive was," said Jimmy Tokeshi, regional director of the Japanese-American Citizens League, a civil rights group.
 
Lightning Rods for Anger
 Prominent Asian-Americans say such incidents have been spreading as Japan has become the focus of America's economic difficulties and has intensified since the Dec. 7 commemoration of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.
Both in California and around the nation, leaders of Asian-American organizations said, anti-Asian bias appears to be taking a more concrete and intense form, from racial comments to vandalism and graffiti to hate mail to occasional rock throwing.
Increasingly, Mr. Tokeshi said, Asian-Americans are finding that "it's frightening to think what types of attitudes are out there."
Commander France said the motive for the killing of Mr. Kato, a Japanese citizen, was under investigation and that there were still no suspects. But he said his office had received a report last week from Mr. Kato's son, Toshiyuki Kato, about a death threat to his father.
 
Men on a Motorcycle
 Quoting from the police report, Commander France said two men arrived at Mr. Kato's home on a motorcycle on the evening of Feb. 9, and that one of them approached and knocked on his front door.
"The individual stepped inside the entryway and made a comment to the effect that he was an unemployed American worker and that he lost his job because of the Japanese and that he wanted money," Commander France said.
"Mr. Kato pushed the man out of the house, closed the door, and heard the man say that he knew where he lived and that he would come back and kill him."
Commander France said Mr. Kato was apparently killed between 10 P.M. night and 2 A.M. Monday after returning from a grocery store, and that a hunting knife was found beside the body on the floor of the garage.
 
More Premeditation?
 Reacting to the killing, Ron Wakabayashi, executive director of the Los Angeles City Human Relations Commission, said a disturbing element in recent anti-Asian incidents is that they appear to have been more premeditated than in the past.
Last November, he said, he visited a small prewar Japanese community center in nearby Norwalk where vandals had broken into the judo classrooms and painted racial epithets on the walls.
"I am of Japanese ancestry myself, and that was very chilling for me to see," he said. "I saw parents dropping off their children for classes and instructing them to stay inside and not to come out until they were picked up."
He said his organization was investigating a report of harassment of a largely Japanese-American group of Girl Scouts who were taunted as they tried to sell cookies outside a supermarket in affluent West Los Angeles.
"They were out there in their uniforms," Mr. Wakabayashi said. "The crueler people were calling them Japs. Other folks were saying, 'I only buy from Americans.' "
 
A Cross Is Burned
 Other recent incidents reported by Asian-American organizations include a cross-burning outside an Asian restaurant in the Los Angeles suburb of Lakewood last month; stones thrown through the windows of a Japanese home in the suburb of Bellflower last week, and a gasoline bomb thrown at a Japanese couple in the San Francisco area on Dec. 7.
Across the nation, said Dennis Hayashi, the national director of the Japanese-American Citizens League, "We have seen a marked increase not just in the number of incidents of reported harassment but substantively in the viciousness of the harassment. More and more, this Japan bashing and 'Buy American' movement is manifesting itself not just in simple name calling but in threats of physical violence."
Every day, he said, his office receives reports of verbal harassment and hate mail from Japanese-Americans and people of other Asian backgrounds.
"It's quite clear to me from going around the country that the level of apprehension is just increasing greatly, not just in the Japanese-American community but in general in the Asian community," he said.
On Feb. 17, Iwao Matsuda, the president of Chukyo University in Nagoya, Japan, was shot to death in his Boston hotel room in an apparent robbery. The police and government officials of both nations have sought to play down the possibility of a racial motivation. A briefcase containing university documents was later found to be missing from the Matsudas' room.
The police said no suspects had yet been identified in the killing. "Although it doesn't appear to be racially motivated, it is still under investigation and until we make an arrest, we can't fully determine the motive," said Vincent Loporchio, a spokesman for the Boston police.
In Los Angeles, Marcia Choo, the director of the Asian Pacific American Dispute Resolution Center, who is of Korean background, said the report of Mr. Kato's killing validated the concerns of the Asian community.
"We've been asked recently whether the Asian-American community is overly sensitive or paranoid, but I think these are clear cases where we have good reason to be afraid," she said.
"I think there has been in general this black cloud forming. You see it in the news media. You see it in the streets and in the comments and slurs that people yell at you."
She said the tone of the abuse was typified by hate mail she had received that contained "little cartoons of people with a devil's face and little horns and with 'yellow peril' written on it."

HEADLINE: New Los Angeles Leaders Rebuke the Doomsayers

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 25

 BODY:
In the last year, this sunny land of movies and aerospace giants has had an unwelcome visit from the prophets of doom and gloom. A deep, prolonged and painful recession, compounded by drastic cutbacks in military spending brought about by the end of the cold war, has badly shaken the optimism and sense of unlimited opportunity that has long been the mark of Southern California.
On Monday, nearly 100 local leaders gathered in a hotel ballroom on the glittery Sunset Strip of West Hollywood to try to shake the jitters, peer through the clouds of pessimism and find a "new vision" for Los Angeles. 
 It was an extraordinary gathering, most notably because there was no one from the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, the major unions or other traditional bastions of economic leadership. Participants included people like Frank Cruz, chairman of Gulf Atlantic Life Insurance Company, which has prospered on the region's large Hispanic population; Mike Medavoy, chairman of Tri-Star Pictures, and Jose Lozano, publisher of La Opinion, the largest Spanish-language newspaper in the United States. A third were Hispanic or non-white.
The conference, titled "The Next L.A. Economy," was sponsored by the New Vision for Southern California Council, a loose coalition of business groups and other organizations that sees itself as the center of a new economic base less dependent on large Pentagon-related industries like Hughes Aircraft and the Lockheed Corporation.
It was the brainchild of Joel Kotkin, co-author of "The Third Century -- America's Resurgence in the Asian Era" (Crown Publishers, 1988). A former New Yorker, Mr. Kotkin has been a leading booster of California as the center of a bright future in a world dominated by the Pacific economy.
"This is the beginning of the end of the thinking that this city is going down," Mr. Kotkin said during a break. "There are a lot of problems in Southern California. But if you look at it from a distance, there are enormous strengths." The region should take advantage, he said, of its proximity to Pacific and Latin American countries, its reservoir of small entrepreneurial companies and a vast pool of immigrant labor.
 
Looking Abroad
 Other speakers agreed. "The future does not lie with giant firms like Lockheed and General Motors, but smaller networks of specialized producers," said David B. Friedman, director of the Center for U.S.-Japan Relations at the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica. Such networks, he said, exist in Japan and prevent an industrial policy dominated by larger companies that are "relics of the past."
Stephen Levy, an economist with the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto, took issue with many other economists and pronounced the future bright.
"We've been here before," said Mr. Levy, referring to the slump that followed the Vietnam War, after which California boomed. While recovery will be more difficult in the 90's, he said, Southern California is well equipped to base a new economy on foreign trade and investment, on the application of new technology to goods and services, and on tourism and entertainment.
Kathleen Brown, the state treasurer who was the keynote speaker, said, "The sights and sounds of crisis should be viewed as opportunity." Ms. Brown, whose father, former Gov. Edmund G. Brown, presided over heavy public investment a generation ago, added, "When everything is fine, it's the worst time to get people to embrace change."

Your article "For the 90's, Lavish Amounts of Stinginess" [Jan. 15] on frugality highlighted the tension between the mainstream business community and those who call for a major reassessment of global resource use. I enjoyed it, but the organization I work with, Context Institute, was called a "new age think tank."
Our director, Robert Gilman, who represented us in your article, is a Ph.D. astrophysicist, trained at Princeton. He is the founding editor of our journal "In Context: A Quarterly of Humane Sustainable Culture," winner of the 1991 Alternative Press Award for "Best Coverage of Emerging Issues," and widely recognized as a leading forum in the investigation of sustainability and sustainable development. Naturally, we wince more than a little at being lumped with a movement usually characterized as fuzzy-headed at best. 
 Still, we were happy to see that your reporter did convey a sense that the "stinginess" sweeping the country is not solely driven by empty wallets nor lust for personal savings. It is, in part, an expression of people's desire to have global resources utilized more equitably.

HEADLINE: The President and the Sewer

 BODY:
When President Bush loaded his recent economic proposals with subsidies for real estate investors, did he have in mind the needs of ordinary citizens? Or was he thinking about the 60 wealthy real estate executives who contributed $6 million to support his 1988 campaign?
Mr. Bush may only have been seeking a way to promote economic recovery. But the fact that his motives are open to question underscores the urgency of plugging a major loophole in America's system of financing Presidential campaigns. In theory, general election campaigns are funded by public money raised through a voluntary checkoff on tax forms. In practice, there's plenty of room for huge, special-interest private donations. 
 The problem is summed up in two words: sewer money. Campaign operatives call it "soft money" and talk piously about the "party-building" activities it nominally finances. But semantics can't perfume the fact that, in 1988, big checks from fat-cat donors flowed through the parties to support the Presidential campaigns.
It's not too late to prevent this favor-seeking money from polluting this fall's Presidential campaign. But much will depend on Mr. Bush's willingness to plug the sewer.
Here's how the sewer worked in 1988. To qualify for $46.1 million in public money, George Bush and Michael Dukakis each promised to forgo private contributions and abide by the spending ceiling. But both brazenly evaded the Federal limits by dispatching emissaries to hustle huge contributions from wealthy donors, and then channeling the money with a wink to state parties to help pay for Presidential field operations. In all, Mr. Bush's "Team 100" fund-raising effort amassed 249 contributions of $100,000 or more.
This year the five major Democratic Presidential candidates, responding to questioning by Common Cause, have all pledged not to use this indirect financing if the Republicans also agree. Disappointingly, Mr. Bush and his G.O.P. challenger, Patrick Buchanan, have yet to make the same pledge.
Meanwhile Congress, which has hardly raced to clean up the Presidential sewer much less its own campaign finances, now has a chance to claim some honor. The Senate and the House have both passed broad campaign finance reform bills.
The Senate bill, sponsored by George Mitchell, the Senate majority leader, and Senator David Boren would end party sewer money abuses. If the House accepts the Senate's approach, and the sewer money provisions are made effective immediately, the issue could be on the President's desk in time to make a real difference in this election.
Would Mr. Bush risk looking like a captive of the wealthiest people in America by refusing to give up sewer money? The man who's tried to show his concern for average citizens by buying socks in a department store would be a lot more convincing if he agreed not to chase $100,000 donors for his campaign.

HEADLINE: Indians Turning to Tribal Colleges For Opportunity and Cultural Values

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FORT YATES, N.D.

 BODY:
For years Ted and Jenny Eagle moved through a rhythmless dance of dead-end jobs, empty pockets and, in desperate resignation, drunken staggers. The life of American Indians on the High Plains has proved little more promising for them than it was for their ancestors a century ago, when official policy held native tribes on vast and vacant reservations.
But the Eagles, who live on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation here with their four children in a two-bedroom mobile home on a field of junked cars, recently decided to aim for a better life. Last fall Mr. Eagle, who is 44 years old, and Mrs. Eagle, 36, enrolled in college. 
 They went to the only place they believed would believe in them: Standing Rock College, one of 24 colleges in the United States owned and operated by American Indians.
It is a decision a relatively small but growing number of Indians are making as they increasingly turn to their own institutions for answers, understanding and their own brand of traditional values.
 
'Sensitive to Their Culture'
 "I think tribal colleges do for native Americans what predominantly Hispanic institutions do for Latinos, what historically black colleges do for African-Americans," said Richard C. Richardson Jr., professor of educational leadership and policy studies at Arizona State University. "They provide an institution that is sensitive to their culture and focuses on the needs of the communities that they represent."
That sensitivity was the original motivation for tribal colleges, which were created because Indians living on reservations had few opportunities to obtain a postsecondary education near where they lived. And if they left their areas to get a higher education, many often dropped out because the mainstream colleges were generally unprepared or unwilling to deal with Indians' special needs.
Long after blacks, Jews, Roman Catholics and other ethnic and religious groups had established colleges to serve their special needs, American Indians founded a string of their own colleges.
The first tribal college, the Navajo Community College, was founded in 1968 on the Navajo Reservation in Tsaile, Ariz. Now there are 24 colleges on reservations and two more predominantly Indian colleges run by the Federal Government. But only 15 are fully accredited. All but three are two-year community colleges.
 
Most Graduates Have Jobs
 The average tribal college student is 30 years old, female and has children, according to the American Indian College Fund, a nonprofit group that began to raise money for Indian colleges in 1989. More than 80 percent of those who do graduate are employed, fund officials said.
The fund does not keep conclusive data on the number of students who drop out each year. But it notes that most of the dropouts eventually return. Last year at Standing Rock, 24 percent of the students dropped out; officials say this is generally typical of most tribal colleges.
Some educators said they were concerned that Indian colleges that emphasize tribal values and traditions may be not be adequately preparing their students for work and life in the larger society off the reservation.
In some tribal colleges, for example, competition among individual students gives way to a more Indian tradition of students working together to achieve. At one college an attempt is made to have male professors teach only male students because Indian tradition dictates that women teach women and men teach men, a tribal college official said.
But in the case of people like the Eagles, a tribal college offers unusual sensitivity to their circumstances, special assistance to help them attend and a reasonable expectation for success that can lead them to aim for higher goals than they had thought possible.
"When I came here I just wanted to get the basics so I could go to trade school," said Mr. Eagle, who left school at the age of 13 to break in horses for room and board. "When we signed up, our advisers talked about human services, and we kind of got interested in that."
Because of their advisers' confidence in them, the Eagles said, they decided to set a more ambitious goal: becoming counselors for addicted adolescents.
While sometimes makeshift, threadbare and meagerly staffed, the tribal colleges nonetheless represent a sharp departure in Indian education; historically, formal education has been imposed on tribes by outsiders, often with disastrous effects, tribal leaders and educators say.
"Since white society came here, we were told that we were inferior," said David L. Archambault, the former president of Standing Rock College. "We were told everything about us was not good -- our language, traditions, culture."
Tribal colleges, he said, strive to give American Indians a quality education while teaching them to preserve and enhance their understanding of a culture that has narrowly escaped extinction.
"We have integrated native American history and culture in noncultural courses," said Ron McNeal, the new president of Standing Rock. "We use Indian examples in science, chemistry and biology, showing how our traditions contributed."
 
Enrollment Statistics
 While precise numbers are sketchy, about 13,000 full- and part-time students attend the 24 tribal colleges -- those situated on or near Indian reservations -- and the two other Indian colleges operated by the Federal Government's Bureau of Indian Affairs, according to a survey of the colleges recently conducted by the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, a group representing all Indian colleges.
Altogether, about 103,000 Indians were enrolled in college in 1990, the United States Department of Education, compared with 10.6 million whites, 1.2 million blacks and 758,000 Hispanic students. The nation's Indian population is about two million, according to the 1990 census.
Typically small, tribal colleges have enrollments ranging from 80 to 1,800. And almost all the institutions are poorly financed. Most manage on modest annual assistance from the Federal Government -- about $3,000 for each Indian student -- plus private donations and tuition. But tuition is generally low, considering that most students come from areas steeped in multi-generational poverty, alcoholism and unemployment rates as high as 80 percent.
Most of the tribal colleges are situated in the High Plains. Nearly two-thirds are clustered in North and South Dakota and Montana, with names like Dull Knife Memorial Community College, Little Hoop Community College and Oglala Lakota College. Only three of the 26 are four-year institutions; one, Sinte Gleska University in Rosebud, S.D., also offers a master's degree in education.
 
Impressive Results
 By concentrating of Indian culture the colleges, already isolated geographically, may increase the Indian students' general isolation, said Dr. Richardson of the University of Arizona. But he and other education experts concede that close attention and sensitivity to Indian needs by tribal colleges have yielded some impressive results.
"We've been most impressed with their concern for individual students and their recognition of the range of problems some of their students face, and their efforts to deal with them in a very practical and immediate way," said Jon W. Fuller, president of the Consortium for the Advancement of Private Higher Education, a nonprofit group that supports small private coleges.
Discussing Indians who attend non-Indian universities, Mr. McNeal, the president of Standing Rock, said: "The problem is, when they go on to four-year institutions the success rate for the first year isn't nearly as good as that of the tribal colleges. There, they don't have the support system to allow students to achieve.
Mr. McNeal, who is 33 and wears his hair long, much the way his great-great-great-grandfather, Sitting Bull, wore his, said a tribal college's mission is clear: "First and foremost, give your students the tools necessary -- an education -- to live and define themselves. That means being native American living in a predominantly non-Indian society."
Varying from one tribal college to another, students are offered a wide range of courses, including standard college courses like English, mathematics and history. Many emphasize practical skills, especially those needed on reservations today. Topping the list are usually studies in land and resource management and human welfare and health services.
 
A Mobile Classroom
 On a recent morning, Standing Rock College was busy with the commotion of students and teachers making their way to class. Outside, a sign with hand-painted letters in the shape of giant feathers makes the college -- two modest, single-story buildings on a muddy clearing -- look more like a tourist trading post than an institution of higher education.
A recreational vehicle is parked outside. Equipped with portable computers, it is a mobile classroom that travels to the reservation's distant towns to offer college courses and high school equivalency classes.
Ted and Jenny Eagle are lucky. They live only five miles from the college, and drive here each day in their old Oldsmobile because there is no public transportation.
"I can't even get a clerical job because I don't have a one- or two-year certificate from a learning institution," said Mrs. Eagle, who wears her long hair parted neatly down the middle. "I looked at different avenues I could take and I had to make this decision for myself, my family and my children."
 
A Struggle for Survival
 Mr. Eagle said he and his family had struggled for years to survive, sometimes turning to public assistance. He has earned money doing construction work, driving trucks and school buses and buying, selling and trading old cars and their parts.
After a trucking accident 19 months ago left Mr. Eagle unable to do strenuous physical work, the couple decided to go back to school. When they graduate from Standing Rock, they plan to go to a four-year college off the reservation and earn bachelor's degrees.
The Eagles said they want to counsel young Indians on the reservation to avoid the mistakes they made with alcohol.
But it was a lack of a sufficient education, Mr. Eagle said, that stood as his greatest obstacle. "Some of the time it really got rough," he said. "It seemed like we tried almost everything."
Now, they said, they are trying education.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Dial Adds More By Taking Away

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
TO judge by stock market action, one might think Greyhound Financial is worth less than nothing.
That judgment is based on the stock move of the Dial Corporation, the parent of Greyhound Finanacial, since it announced last fall that it planned to spin off its financial operations to shareholders. When that spinoff takes place next week, it appears that Dial shares will trade for more without its finance operations than they used to fetch with them included. 
 But while Wall Street celebrates such reverse synergy, in which a conglomerate's parts are deemed to be worth much more than the whole, some attention is beginning to focus on the spun-off part, the GFC Financial Corporation, which will be the new holder of Greyhound Financial.
GFC appears to be a company that has weathered the strains of the 1980's and emerged with some strong franchises. With market interest rates down, GFC is paying less to borrow but not passing on all those savings to its own customers. If bad-debt problems can be kept in hand, that is a recipe for rising profits.
Just how GFC will trade when Dial shareholders get the new shares, on a ratio of one GFC share for each two Dial shares owned, is unclear. In many spinoffs, some holders immediately sell, often forcing the price of the spun-off company to unreasonably low levels. In this case, it seems clear that the index funds that hold Dial will be sellers, but GFC has mounted a road show to persuade brokers and institutional investors that others should hold on.
GFC's history is a checkered one. From Latin American loans to mortgage insurance in Texas and second mortgage loans in Britain, GFC made a series of missteps in the last 15 years, with the most humiliating being a fraud the company contended was engineered by a couple of important employees who took kickbacks. Dial said that cost it more than $100 million in bad loans to shipowners. It no longer finances ships.
But to hear John W. Teets, the Dial chairman, tell it, Dial lucked out. "It was good we had it, in retrospect," he said in a telephone interview of the fraud. "We limited growth. We tightened up the approval process. We did all those things, and we dodged the bullet in 1989-90."
The new GFC is being run by Samuel L. Eichenfield, who was brought in by Dial to run the domestic financial operations in 1987, after most of the problems came to the surface. Talk on Wall Street says that the new shares might trade for as little as $12 each, or as much as $20.
Dial, the old Greyhound Corporation, was trading for about $37 a share last October, before the announcement that the finance operations would be spun off. Yesterday it closed unchanged at $49.50 in New York Stock Exchange trading. Given the 2-for-1 ratio in the spinoff, that means the remaining Dial is valued at $39.50 or more.
Mr. Teets attributed that performance to the market's happiness at getting a stock that is closer to a pure play in consumer products. Dial's brands include Dial soap and Purex bleach, as well as Premier Cruise Lines. The Greyhound bus operations were previously sold, and the company plans to sell or spin off its bus manufacturing business within the next year. Analysts generally agree with that assessment, and it was the prospect of Dial trading at a higher price-earnings ratio that sent the share price up.
But while GFC is being spun off, it may yet prove attractive to some buyers. It does seem to have avoided the worst of the excesses of the late 1980's, choosing wisely in commercial real estate and staying out of leveraged buyouts. But it did become a big player in second mortgages in Britain just before interest rates rose sharply there, and that hurt. In Britain, nearly all first mortgages have interest rates that adjust immediately, and the result of rising rates was a big increase in defaults.
Greyhound stopped making second mortgage loans last spring, but by the end of September it said that 38 percent of its $101 million in existing loans were in default.
To make life even harder, GFC had used consumer deposits at its British bank, Greyhound Bank, as a major source of financing. But the collapse of the Bank of Commerce and Credit International last year scared many depositors away from smaller banks. In the first nine months of last year, the amount of deposits fell 79 percent, to $32 million.
But even with those costs, GFC was able to report profits of $30 million, or about $1.38 per new GFC share, for the most recent 12 months. And that does not include $1.3 million in profits from its Verex mortgage insurance subsidiary, which is being carried as a discontinued operation. That operation got into big problems in the mid-1980's and stopped writing new policies in 1988. But recently it has shown profits on its existing policies and the company is talking about getting back into the business.
The success of GFC, despite the problems, is credited to the fact it has not hit any road mines in such areas as commercial real estate, where it wisely specialized in buildings occupied by the borrowers, as opposed to speculative ventures, or the financing of recreational real estate, including time-share condominiums. Its eventual success, and the happiness of its shareholders, will reflect whether it avoids making any more big mistakes.

HEADLINE: A Good Excuse for a Round of Parties

BYLINE: By SHEILA RULE

 BODY:
Grammys can be spelled another way: P-A-R-T-I-E-S, with lots of exclamation marks and nothing in lower case.
All the major record companies, as well as the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, which presents the Grammy Awards, and the New York City committee serving as host for the ceremonies at Radio City Music Hall, put luxury on the agenda over the last few days to celebrate the music industry and its royalty. 
At a party at the new Ramada Renaissance Times Square Hotel at Seventh Avenue at 47th Street, guests watched the Grammys in an elegant third-floor room with a view south to the giant Sony screen in Times Square. From there, however, the giant screen looked more like a blurry box in the distance, and guests fared better watching the ceremony on television monitors around the room.
The party was given by the Mayor's Office of Partnership Programs and the New York City Host Committee as a way of thanking all of the volunteers, city workers, corporate sponsors and others who helped make Grammy week a success. Among the guests was Amanda Gurfein, who worked with the host committee as a student intern. She paid close attention when the female nominees in the best pop vocal category were announced.
"She should get the Grammy," said Ms. Gurfein, an 18-year-old student at New York University, when one nominee, Mariah Carey, appeared on the screen.
"So should she," she said when the camera turned to Amy Grant, another nominee.
"Oh, she's going to get it," was Ms. Gurfein's prediction when Bonnie Raitt's name was read.
When Ms. Raitt, who received five nominations this year, was announced as the winner, Ms. Gurfein said: "Oh, she's great. She's terrific."
 
Chasing the Recession Away
 While the lavishness of the parties might seem excessive in these recessionary times, Ronnie Davis, who produced an ice-dancing extravaganza last night at Rockefeller Center for the Warner and Elektra record companies, said the Grammy celebrations, which bring an estimated $40 million to New York City each year they are held here, were in fact a good way to fight the recession. His party employed more than 250 people, he said. Besides, he added, "the last two things people are willing to give up during a recession or depression are bread and circus."
Michael Greene, president of the recording academy, said that the industry had "slowed down a little" but that he expected gross revenues of about $8 billion this year, up from $7.5 billion last year. The recording industry, he said, has "one of the most positive balance-of-trade surpluses in this country."
"The entertainment industry in general tries to put on its best face at Oscar or Grammy time," Mr. Greene said. "Around these times, all of us are very interested in giving the nominees and the people who work all year the nicest environment to party in. We think people who toil in the music field all year deserve something like this."
 
 
Sophistication and Soul
 Last night, stretch limousines and yellow cabs transported gospel singers and metal heads, country singers and rap artists to an array of festivities at hotels, clubs and restaurants around town -- from Sylvia's soul-food restaurant in Harlem to the Plaza Hotel. Elegance, luxury and excess were everywhere.
On Monday night, the New York City Host Committee for the 1992 Grammy Awards gave a champagne-and-dessert party at a packed Tatou, a midtown restaurant and nightclub, where the attire ranged from elegant evening clothes to blue jeans. Some of the guests intently played a game of "Name That Nominee," trying to identify people in the crowd wearing the red ribbons and bronze-colored medallions given to nominees. One cluster of guests seemed hard pressed to figure out who any of the nominees were, but then again, recorded music isn't a visual medium.
At Rockefeller Center, Mr. Davis decorated the restaurants around the ice rink to evoke the four seasons, since New York has them and Los Angeles, this city's competition for the Grammy ceremonies, doesn't. Guests in the mood for spring could dine on roasted rack of spring lamb; those in a wintry mood could have smoked ham baked in caraway crust. While they ate, there was entertainment in the form of ice dancing to Grammy-nominated songs, choreographed by JoJo Starbuck, the former Olympian and longtime star of the Ice Capades. It was probably the first time anybody ever ice-danced, rather than slam-danced, to Metallica.
 
Revolving Door at the Plaza
 The Plaza Hotel's Grand Ballroom got a real workout. On Monday, Clive Davis, the president of Arista Records, entertained the industry elite there. Luther Vandross, Al B. Sure and Melba Moore were there. So were Donald Trump and Marla Maples, the fashion designer Donna Karan and the presidents of most major record companies. The entertainment culminated in an-all star performance of Wilson Pickett's "In the Midnight Hour," by Kenny G, Lisa Stansfield, Dionne Warwick, Gladys Knight and Candy Dulfer.
Last night, the Sony labels transformed the Plaza ballroom into what one publicity agent described as a "giant collage of reflection and light," featuring a large New York City skyline.
The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences took over two floors of the New York Hilton, decorating the ballroom with 12-foot-high floral arrangements from various parts of the world that were intended to celebrate "the beauty of the planet Earth" and the Grammys' international appeal. There were white lilacs from France, tulips from the Netherlands and white ginger from Costa Rica. Another floor was decorated as a cabaret, and the list of performers, from Kid Creole and the Coconuts to the Woody Herman Orchestra, offered variety.
Capitol-EMI and its associated record companies occupied the "21" Club, MCA Records took over the Four Seasons and RCA celebrated at Tatou. The Polygram labels celebrated in the clouds in the Rainbow Room.
Of course, there was no need for an invitation to a party or the Grammy ceremonies to enjoy the festivities. The three-hour telecast of the awards ceremony was broadcast to 86 countries. And if you happened to be in Times Square, all you had to do was look up.

HEADLINE: GAMBINOS TO QUIT TRUCKING BUSINESS IN A PLEA BARGAIN

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

 BODY:
Two sons of the late Carlo Gambino, the crime boss, and others allied with them agreed yesterday to quit the trucking business and pay a $12 million fine in exchange for being spared prison sentences.
Prosecutors said the plea bargain would break organized crime's half-century stranglehold on New York City's dwindling garment industry. Their efforts, which began with undercover state police officers posing as clothing manufacturers and truckers in a sting operation, represented the most ambitious effort ever to dislodge the underworld from control over one of the city's most important industries. 
 The unusual deal unexpectedly interrupted a monthlong trial of the sons, Thomas and Joseph Gambino, and two co-defendants in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. As part of the bargain, a special court representative would monitor the restructuring of the crime-ridden garment trucking industry that officials estimated poured hundreds of millions of dollars into mob coffers over the decades.
 
'One Fell Swoop'
 "Yes, we gave up jail," said Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan District Attorney, but he said the agreement accomplished a goal of prosecutors since Thomas E. Dewey and promised to save a "dying industry" that had lost two-thirds of its jobs over the last 30 years.
"This takes them out in one fell swoop," he said of organized-crime elements whose penetration of the garment industry goes back to Jazz Age gangsters like Legs Diamond, Arnold Rothstein and Louis Lepke.
He said the plea agreement would end a mob "tax" that added up to 7 percent to the price of finished garments. Battered by overseas competition and shifting markets, the industry has been threatened with extinction in New York, with employment in the garment center dropping from 260,000, to 80,000 since 1961.
The landmark agreement ended the corruption and extortion trial of Thomas Gambino, 62 years old, of Manhattan, and his brother, Joseph, 55, of Brooklyn, who pleaded guilty to lesser antitrust charges and were promised they would not be sentenced to prison as long as they adhered to the terms. Two co-defendants, John DiSalvo, 40, of Queens, and Michael Vuolo, 56, of Staten Island, also offered guilty pleas, as did four trucking companies under the Gambinos' control.
Carlo Gambino died of natural causes in 1976.
 
Fear of Imprisonment
 Two other defendants and six other trucking companies also pleaded guilty to a separate indictment that charged them with being part of an illegal Gambino and Lucchese crime-family cartel to control garment industry trucking.
The agreement, predicated in part by what prosecutors said was the Gambinos' "terrifying fear" of imprisonment, was hailed by law-enforcement officials as a significant victory over Mafia efforts to corrupt legitimate businesses.
But prosecutors conceded that in addition to leaving the Gambinos free men, it would leave them with a considerable portion of their estimated $70 million to $100 million fortune. Also, they acknowledged, while the agreement governed the activities of signatories, it could not prevent another mob company from moving into the vacuum, although they said the threat was remote for the forseeable future.
 
'A Terrific Settlement'
 "It's a terrific settlement," said Ronald Goldstock, Deputy Attorney General in charge of the Statewide Organized Crime Task Force. "Certainly the public is better off with the garment center taken from the hands of racketeers than a person sent to prison."
He said the agreement was in the mold of such previous administrative anti-racketeering initiatives as a Federal trustee's takeover of the mob-controlled Fulton fish market but with far greater promise of success. While the fish-market takeover has been hampered by a lack of resources, the special "master" to be named by the court to police the garment-center settlement will be armed with some of the $12 million fine to be paid by the Gambinos.
The agreement compels the Gambinos and all their relatives to get out of the trucking business in the garment industry within one year by liquidating all their delivery companies and by selling all of their 400 trucks.
"If they want to continue business in the garment industry," Mr. Morgenthau said yesterday, "the Gambinos will have to use wheelbarrows and wheel them for free."
The $12 million in fines and penalties in the agreement includes $3 million to be set aside for victims of the Gambinos' cartel. The special master would decide how to allocate the money among claimants. Undistributed money would go to the state like the rest of the fine to offset the costs of the investigation and prosecution.
In addition, said Michael Cherkasky, chief of the District Attorney's investigation division, the plea agreement opens the Gambinos to civil antitrust suits carrying triple damages.
The agreement also calls for other garment industry truck companies reputedly controlled by the Lucchese crime family to agree not to block competition in the future.
 
Other Guilty Pleas
 The others offering guilty pleas were David Stuart, 50, of Hollywood, Fla., an official of two trucking companies, and Raymond Buccafusco, 62, of Brooklyn, a supervisor for the Gambinos.
The Gambino-controlled companies were named as Consolidated Carriers, Clothing Carriers, Greenberg's Express and GRG Delivery.
Under the agreement, the signatories must by March 1993 sell their companies to individuals in no way connected to them and pay the $12 million in stages by September 1995. Violating the agreement would subject them to further fines and resentencing and possibly jail.
Mr. Morgenthau said the case was part of his office's attack on a series of organized-crime cartels that threatened the city's economic lifeblood. He had already brought racketeering cases, he said, against schemes targeting the Convention Center, the construction industry and the carpenters' and painters' unions. "We have more in process," he said without describing them further.
"If New York is going to survive, we can't afford this kind of stuff," he said.
The Gambinos and two of their co-defendants, Mr. DiSalvo and Mr. Buccafusco, smiled broadly as they left the courtroom in which they had been on trial for the last four weeks. They were followed out of court by Mr. Vuolo and Mr. Stuart.
Before accepting their respective pleas, Justice Thomas B. Galligan ordered each defendant to stand in court and read a prepared statement in which they admitted that they had agreed "not to compete with certain other truck companies" in obtaining what the prosecution described as a "stranglehold" on garment deliveries.
 
'Agreed Not to Compete'
 Thomas Gambino went first but his voice was so low that Justice Galligan ordered him to speak louder so everyone could hear.
"I agreed not to compete," Mr. Gambino said, causing Eliot Spitzer, an assistant district attorney, to catch his breath.
Mr. Morgenthau said the agreement was far more significant than if they had been convicted of the top count of corruption and sentenced to from 8 1/3 to 25 years in prison.
Their guilty plea was to a felony charge that could have carried from 1 1/3 to 4 years in prison.
Mr. Morgenthau said the agreement marked the first time that "broad industrywide, civil-style penalties enforceable by resentencing to state prison have been used in a criminal case."
Prosecutors said New York City garment makers were forced to take deliveries from either a Gambino- or Lucchese-controlled truck company. If they used another trucking concern, they were forced to pay twice.
Although the two Gambinos are the sons of one of the most powerful of all reputed mob bosses, they were said to have forsaken any claim to succeed their father in return for being allowed to control trucking in the garment industry.
Over the years, prosecutors said their choice appeared well founded. While other leaders of organized crime have been imprisoned or killed, Thomas and Joseph Gambino have never been to prison and have been described by the New Jersey Commission of Investigation as part of a new breed of mobsters who give the appearance of being honest businessmen "common among second-generation members of the Cosa Nostra."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Maryland;
Washington's Suburbs Offer Tsongas a Chance to Win Again

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROCKVILLE, Md., Feb. 26

 BODY:
The dozens of upscale subdivisions, shopping centers, government complexes and office parks that carpet once-bucolic Montgomery County, northwest of Washington, are the main reason former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts stands a good chance of winning this state's Democratic Presidential primary next Tuesday.
Mr. Tsongas, who needs a victory in Maryland to demonstrate that his electoral appeal extends beyond New England, appeals most strongly to well-educated, well-to-do voters, according to polls of participants in earlier primaries. And this is the best-paid, best-schooled county in the nation. 
 Speaking at a rally on Tuesday night in Bethesda after gaining the endorsement of Gov. William Donald Schaefer, Mr. Tsongas, who featured his pro-business stance in generally conservative New Hampshire, shifted the emphasis to the left for a more liberal suburban audience. He proclaimed his support for gay rights and called himself an economic-growth liberal.
 
Economy Is Chief Issue
 Maryland, which has grown rapidly in the last decade, has not suffered as much from the recession as other states. Unemployment stood at 6.8 percent last December, the same as the national rate. But the defense and high technology industries, important to this county and the state, have been contracting rapidly, and construction is also in a protracted slump. The economy is the chief issue.
Only Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas appears to stand much chance of beating Mr. Tsongas here.
Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa has won the backing of some unions, but his weak showings in earlier tests have handicapped him here. Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, winner of this week's South Dakota primary, is concentrating on Colorado next week, as is former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, who won a surprise victory in the Maryland primary in 1976.
But Mr. Clinton and his strategists seem unable to make up their minds whether to risk a head-on confrontation with Mr. Tsongas. After making elaborate plans here and involving scores of elected officials in his campaign, the Arkansas Governor decided the day after his loss in New Hampshire to scale back the campaign days allotted to Maryland from six to one, and to slash the money budgeted for television advertising, several of his backers in the State Legislature. His supporters protested the move.
 
An Important Endorsement
 Then Mr. Clinton decided to do more. He swept into the state last Saturday, picked up the endorsement of Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke of Baltimore and promised he would be back. He pledged "not just a deal, but a solemn agreement to create new opportunity" for workers in Maryland and in the nation.
Television ads have been broadcast, but Mr. Clinton has not returned to the state. His aides are starting to lower expectations, suggesting that the real test on Tuesday will be in Georgia, where Mr. Clinton is strongest.
"This kind of straddle won't work," said Nathan Landow, the party chairman in Maryland. "They've made a substantial effort here, and if Clinton loses he can't claim that he's passed in this state. There's a great opportunity here for him, but Tsongas has picked up support rapidly in the last week."
Mr. Landow calls the Maryland balloting "the first free-standing primary," because none of the candidates comes from this state or from the region. As such, he said, "this is a place where someone can demonstrate his electability, which is what the Democrats want."
 
Tsongas Leads in Survey
 Brad Coker, who heads Mason-Dixon Opinion Research, a polling firm in Columbia, Md., agreed that Mr. Clinton could win Maryland and possibly deal a decisive blow here to Mr. Tsongas, who has said he must win this state.
"If he came in here, invested time and money, targeted and turned out the black vote, my numbers indicate that he has a good chance of winning," Mr. Coker said of Mr. Clinton. "But I'm talking about two, three days of hard work. If he doesn't do it he'll lose, and probably lose decisively."
In a survey of 464 people whom Mason-Dixon considered likely to vote Democratic, the poll found Mr. Tsongas with the support of 33 percent, Mr. Clinton with 26 percent, and no one else in double figures. Almost a quarter of the respondents, 24 percent, said they remained undecided.
The gap between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Tsongas in the poll was within the margin of sampling error, which was plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. But all the momentum was with Mr. Tsongas; in a poll taken by Mason-Dixon before the New Hampshire primary he trailed Mr. Clinton, 24 percent to 10 percent.
 
A Premium on Experience
 On the Republican side, Mr. Coker reported, his polls show President Bush far ahead of his challenger, Patrick J. Buchanan, who grew up in Chevy Chase, a Washington neighborhood just across the state line from Maryland. Politicians here theorize that Mr. Buchanan is doing poorly partly because he has chosen to focus on Georgia and partly because voters here, many of whom work in Washington, put a greater premium than most on broad governmental experience as a qualification in a candidate seeking the Presidency.
Mr. Clinton is running strongly among blacks, who constitute one-fourth of the state's population, helped perhaps by the endorsement of Mr. Schmoke, who is black. A heated race in a new, majority black Congressional district in largely black Prince Georges County, also in the Washington suburbs, should help spur black turnout.
In addition, Mr. Clinton appeals to conservative rural Democrats in the long panhandle of western Maryland and on the Eastern Shore.
Jay Rouse, Mr. Clinton's local manager, who compares his candidate to Robert F. Kennedy, asserted that he had built "a strong, well-rounded campaign organization" that would "propel Bill Clinton forward even if he can't get back to Maryland because he's in such demand in all parts of the country."
But John Willis, the author of a history of Presidential primaries in Maryland, warned against selling the Tsongas organization short, noting that it had turned out a large crowd on short notice the day after the New Hampshire primary.
Mr. Tsongas has backing in the big Greek-American community in Baltimore and among other ethnic groups in the city. But the fight will be won or lost in the Washington suburbs, which now cast more votes than Baltimore and Baltimore County combined.
"The question is who can grow in this state in the last week," Mr. Willis said. "I think it's difficult for Clinton. He didn't counter his negatives -- the charges on the draft and on infidelity -- as intensely here as in New Hampshire. He wasn't on television constantly knocking them down, and they've hurt in Maryland."
All the Democratic candidates except Mr. Kerrey plan to take part in a debate Sunday night at the University of Maryland in College Park.

HEADLINE: Detroit Leaning on Japan, in Both Senses

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAGOYA, Japan

 BODY:
When Lee A. Iacocca, the outspoken chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, demands that America take a stand against Japanese car imports surely he must not be talking about car No. 11AMRXML2D19W-C06, which rolled off the line here the other day.
The car was produced by teams of Japanese workers all wearing neat uniforms with "Mitsubishi Motors" emblazoned on the back. But the sporty. bright red model is a Dodge Stealth, made by Mitsubishi, and sold in America starting at about $17,000. And the only thing that makes it seem American is the word "Dodge" etched in the front bumper. Mr. Iacocca made no mention of Mitsubishi's Nagoya plant when he visited Japan with President Bush in January, and these days people at the plant say as little as possible about Mr. Iacocca.
 
Confused Feelings
 "We feel a little funny about him," Kozo Naruse, the deputy general manager, conceded the other day, shaking his head. "Here he is talking about keeping Japanese cars out of America, and every day we come to work and make very good Chryslers." 
 As a "buy American" movement in the United States provokes continuing confusion about what constitutes the more American car -- is it better to buy a Honda made in Ohio, or a Ford mini-van also produced in Ohio in a joint venture with Nissan? -- there is little question about the national origin of the 164,352 vehicles produced in Japan last year and sold as Chryslers, Dodges and Chevrolets. They are thoroughly Japanese.
But the fact that they keep pouring off the production lines headed for American dealerships says a lot about the Big Three's continuing dependence on Japanese manufacturing at a time when, for example, the General Motors Corporation is announcing plant closings and the layoffs of thousands of workers.
Moreover, many analysts point out, the Japanese production raises questions about how an obvious opportunity to break into the Japanese auto market has been largely squandered by Chrysler, which owns nearly 11 percent of the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation and G.M., which owns a stake in Isuzu Motors. Among the Big Three, only the Ford Motor Company uses its Japanese partner, Mazda Motor, to make cars for sale to Japanese consumers rather than for export to America.
Without question, the cars Japanese makers produce for the Big Three account for a significant part of the American market. Last year Japanese cars accounted for a bit more than 30 percent of the American market, up from 27.8 percent the year before. But if you include autos made for G.M. and Chrysler here, and at Japanese or joint-venture "transplants" in America, the true Japanese market share exceeded 36 percent. In one way, the figure is even higher: by some estimates the Japanese share of retail auto sales in America -- excluding Detroit's sales to the car rental fleets -- is close to 50 percent.
What makes the Mitsubishi-Chrysler arrangement particularly noteworthy, though, is that by Chrysler's own description it has been an overwhelming success. "The Stealth is one of our hottest cars, even in a depressed market," said Luis Franco, who heads Chrysler International's liaison office here.
"Obviously, we are very happy with Mitsubishi as a supplier and partner," he added. (Mitsubishi also provides competition to Chrysler in the United States, offering a nearly identical car to the Stealth, the Mitsubishi 3000 GT, at American Mitsubishi dealers.)
Still, Mitsubishi's executives openly cringe at Mr. Iacocca's oratory, and in a subtle way they have begun to fight back. In recent weeks, Mitsubishi's top American officer, Richard D. Recchia, formerly of Chrysler, has done what other Japanese auto makers have been loath to try: he has taken Mr. Iacocca head on. The conflict between the two has stepped up since Mr. Iacocca, returning from Tokyo, declared that America was being transformed into an exploited colony, exporting raw materials to Japan, and buying back expensive manufactured goods.
 
Attracting Attention
 When Mr. Recchia told the National Automobile Dealers Association recently that anti-Japanese feeling in Detroit has "reached down to tap latent racial prejudice," his comments were prominently reported here. So was his contention that legislation to limit Japan's American market presence proposed by Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, and Senator Donald W. Riegle, Democrat of Michigan, would cost thousands of American jobs and "perpetuate fundamental problems in the U.S. economy."
"I can't help but believe that the emotional response we see today is in some way attributable to coments from politicians and U.S. executives following that trip," he said to the dealers who met for their annual convention in Dallas.
A senior Japanese executive of Mitsubishi said of Mr. Recchia: "He is saying aloud what we can't say. It means a lot more coming from an American than from one of us." But others are not so sure. "It never helps to argue back," one senior executive at Toyota said recently.
For Chrysler, the Nagoya plant may be a place to learn some important manufacturing lessons. Though the plant itself is among Mitsubishi Motors' oldest, it has been tooled to place many different models on the same production line, an idea that General Motors and others in Detroit want to copy. Mitsubishi intersperses production of Chrysler's Stealth with Mitsubishi's own new luxury car, the $25,000 Diamante.
More important, the robots that do much of the assembly work reconfigure themselves automatically to put the steering wheel on the left side of one car, the right side of the next. A chart on the wall shows that even now, with the plant operating well below capacity, productivity gains are impressive. In the last year, the number of worker-hours required to produce a car has decreased by 15 percent. And many of the workers are not typical Japanese auto assemblers: 300 of the plant's 2,600 workers are Brazilians of Japanese ancestry, brought here to reduce the severe shortage of workers willing to do the dirty, noisy job of making cars.
 
One Sensitive Issue
 One problem the plant's workers are hesitant to talk about is the internationally sensitive issue of auto parts. A walk through the plant suggested that an overwhelming number of components going into the Dodge Stealth are not American. Mitsubishi officials say, however, that they do buy catalytic converters, wheels, glass, carpeting and air bags from the United States.
Chrysler also supplies the plant by shipping transmissions to Nagoya for pickup trucks. With little prompting, though, quality-control managers here volunteer that there are frequent quality problems with the shipments. In some batches, 1 percent of the transmissions are defective.
"When we go back to the United States and raise the issue," one engineer said, "the message comes back that they think 1 percent defect ratios are normal. Here, 1 percent is a big, big problem."
The solution? Mitsubishi installs the Chrysler transmissions only in the trucks it ships back to Chrysler; Japanese models get a Japanese transmission. Officially, the company says that the arrangement makes sense because it would be difficult to get a Chrysler transmission serviced in Japan.
Indeed, Chrysler's presence in Japan is minuscule. Last year it sold roughly 1,000 cars here, the worst sales record of any of the Big Three, and even far behind Honda of America, which shipped thousands of its American-made Accords to Japanese showrooms.
 
A List of Obstacles
 Mr. Iacocca, during his trip with President Bush, argued that the numbers were so low because of the tremendous cost of meeting Japanese technical specifications, passing Japanese car inspections, and shipping cars from America to Japan. On the surface, it would seem as if the Nagoyaplant would offer an easy solution: The plant is already tooled to produce cars for the Japanese market, even with the steering wheel on the right side. But in Nagoya you cannot buy a Nagoya-made Chrysler.
Mr. Franco said that Mitsubishi and Chrysler had periodically discussed such an arrangement, but neither side had taken the conversation very far. "You have to remember, we have only been selling here since 1987," he said. "It is still pretty early." Moreover, he said, it would make little sense to put a Stealth and its Mitsubishi equivalent sold in Japan, the GTO, in the same showroom. "That would have nothing going for it," he said.
Ford, of course, has taken that course, selling cars produced for it by Mazda at dealerships called Autorama, partly owned by Ford. It sells about 70,000 units a year. But Chrysler and General Motors, in an argument that often seems a bit circular, say it makes no sense to invest in new dealerships until they first sell some more cars here.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Colombia Reduce Army's Role in Drug Battle

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN ANTONIO, Feb. 26

 BODY:
In a shift in strategy in the drug war, the United States and Colombia have agreed that Colombia's army will no longer play a major role in pursuing traffickers, officials of both countries said today.
On the opening day of a seven-nation, anti-drug summit meeting, it was not clear whether it was the United States or Colombia that first requested the policy change, which redirects $75 million in United States assistance from Colombia's army to its police. 
 But over the last three years the United States sharply increased military aid to Colombia and Bolivia, the source of much of the world's cocaine, and pressed the countries, along with neighboring Peru, to expand the army role in the drug war.
Officials from Bolivia said today they were also moving to withdraw their army from the drug war.
 
A Question of Trust
 In the past the South American countries explained their reluctance to involve their armies more fully in the drug war by saying they feared that armies strengthened with anti-drug money might threaten civilian governments. Human rights groups have criticized such aid to the armies because of their histories of abuse.
In a statement today, the United States Embassy in Bogota said Washington had decided to stop financing the army because the money was being used to fight guerrillas rather than drug traffickers.
But Colombian officals here said that about a month ago, they asked Washington to stop financing the army and instead to give the $75 million to the anti-narcotics police. An Administration official here said most of the money would, indeed, go to the police.
 
Police Working Harder
 "I don't know who initiated these talks," the Administration official said, "but both sides agreed the program needed to be adjusted. The fact is, the money is not going to the army because the army wasn't working on drugs. The police were, and their tempo has increased dramatically."
President Bush arrived here this afternoon for a banquet this evening with the presidents of Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, Educador and Mexico and a delegation from Venezuela. He is scheduled to have six hours of meetings with the South American leaders on Thursday. He met briefly and separately with four of the presidents today.
A White House official said the seven countries, at the insistence of Peru, had agreed to abandon a plan to set specific goals for reducing drug production, cultivation and consumption.
One proposal had called for a 50 percent reduction in coca production by 2000. But, the official said, President Alberto Fujimori of Peru had argued that a cut of that magnitude could not be achieved without serious disruption to an already weak economy. Striking a combative tone, Mr. Fujimori said it was necessary "to make profound changes" in the anti-drug campaign. "Why do we have to continue with a strategy that has failed," he asked.
Gustavo Fernandez, chief of staff of the cabinet of President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia, said in an interview here that his country was requesting that $70 million the United States had designated for the army for 1992-93 be used instead to help the country's hundreds of thousands of coca farmers move into legitimate crops.
The Administration official said the United States was "willing to entertain adjustments in various aid accounts," in Bolivia. But he added that "alternative development alone" was not effective.
A White House official said it was likely the United States would agree to set up police training centers on combatting drug trafficking and money laundering, and that a seven-nation delegation seeking money for them would travel to Europe and Asia, which face growing imports of cocaine.
The United States has portrayed the meeting here as further evidence of cooperation by Latin American countries with Washington. But Latin American officials and American drug experts say the South American countries have developed increasingly independent positions in the drug war.
Drug experts point out that Colombia has refused to extradite traffickers, and that both Colombia and Bolivia have accepted plea bargains from leading traffickers under which surrender is followed by lenient sentences.
Bruce M. Bagley, a specialist on drug trafficking and Latin America at the University of Miami, noted that Washington had opposed plea bargaining with the traffickers but that the plea bargains had greatly reduced violence in Colombia.
"But the overriding reality is that more drugs are coming in," he said. "To improve the situation, we're going to have to move away from the supply side and military tactics to a stronger focus on demand in this country."

HEADLINE: A-Plant Shut Down, Ending Industry's Test Case

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
A reactor that the electric industry intended to be the test case for proving that nuclear power plants could operate safely for up to 60 years will instead be permanently shut immediately, its owners decided yesterday.
The 32-year-old reactor, Yankee Rowe, in Rowe, Mass., had been shut temporarily since September for safety tests. The 10 New England utilities that own the plant voted yesterday to retire the plant to avoid the high cost of determining whether it is safe to run.
Demand for power has been declining in New England as a result of the recession, and cheap electricity is available from other sources because of the reduced demand. 
 Nevertheless, the decision to shut the plant, which represented only about 1 percent of New England's generating capacity, is a blow to the nuclear power industry. Companies that build and operate reactors had high hopes for Yankee Rowe's future.
 
Choice for Test Case
 The plant, near the New York and Vermont borders, was the nation's oldest operating power reactor. While quite small by modern standards, it had accumulated a record of reliability far above average, and was selected by the industry in 1988 as a test case for extending the standard 40-year operating license granted by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. At the time, the owners dismissed questions about the safety of the aged metal containment vessel, saying that any problems could be easily fixed.
Now, in a victory for critics of nuclear power, the utilities are acknowledging that it will be much more expensive than they had thought just to find out how extensive the problems are.
The fact that the nuclear power industry had chosen the plant as a good example of a reactor that deserves to keep running makes the decision to close it a significant one.
"It has implications because of what the industry did," said Mark Mills, an electricity consultant in Washington. "They set themselves up as a bellwether. Then they hung themselves."
One reason for Rowe's troubles was a statement by the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Ivan Selin, shortly after he took office in July 1991, that determining its safety was his agency's most pressing issue. '
The Department of Energy had been assisting Rowe and another plant, Monticello, owned by Northern States Power Company, in seeking a license renewal from the commission. They represent the two different types of reactors in use in this country, each prone to different problems with aging.
At the department, the Assistant Secretary for nuclear energy, William H. Young, said an effort to relicense the Monticello plant would "provide the needed basis for other utilities to determine whether to pursue the renewal option."
License extension is an important part of the industry's survival plan because no one has ordered a plant since the 1970's, or is likely to in the next few years, and only a handful will enter service in this decade.
Rowe's demise leaves 110 licensed plants, according to the commission.
With Yankee Rowe's retirement, the oldest plant is now Big Rock Point, operated by the Consumers Power Company, in Charlevoix, Mich. That 30-year-old plant is also said by experts to have particularly high costs, in part because of its small size.
While many utilities still hope to run their plants longer than 40 years, no one has approached that goal, and the retirement of Yankee Rowe, a plant that has run smoothly for decades, casts doubt on how many will.
Yankee Rowe's owners include Northeast Utilities, the New England Electric System and Boston Edison.
Their decision is a victory for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit group based in Washington and Cambridge, Mass. Last year, the group complained to the commission that there was evidence that pressure vessel was becoming brittle, but that the commission had not required a thorough evaluation. The commission's staff said the plant was safe, but chairman ordered further work, which set in motion a chain of events leading to the plant's voluntary shutdown last September.
Rowe's ailment is brittleness of the 8-inch-thick steel in the 30-foot-high pot that holds the nuclear fuel, as a result of years of bombardment by neutrons, the subatomic particles that sustain a nuclear chain reaction. The brittleness itself would not cause an accident, engineers say, but if a pipe broke somewhere else in the primary cooling system, the emergency core cooling system would automatically come on, and it would force thousands of gallons of water at near room temperature into a pot heated to 500 degrees. Under pressure, the fear is, the brittle metal could crack. American nuclear plants are not designed to withstand pressure vessel failure.
Other old plants are also brittle to various degrees. The problem at Rowe is uncertainty about how brittle the metal is, and precisely when the brittleness is a hazard.
 
Dispute on Company's Motives
 In a statement yesterday, Andrew C. Kadak, president and chief executive of Yankee Atomic Electric Company, which owns Rowe, said: "The decision to close the plant was not based on technical or safety issues. It was based on the cost of restarting the plant and the availability of lower cost power."
But Robert Pollard, a safety engineer for the scientists' group, said, "They're being somewhat dishonest in saying that 'this is not a safety decision but an economic decision.' It's an economic decision forced upon them by a safety issue."
The company had spent $10 million in the last two years for long-term improvements and to prepare to test the reactor vessel. Mr. Kadak said yesterday that the testing, which plant officials thought last summer would cost $5 million, was now put at "$23 million and growing."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Republicans;
We Won, Really, Unopposed Bush Camp Says

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN ANTONIO, Feb. 26

 BODY:
President Bush, his White House aides and his re-election strategists are all agreed: the President's showing in Tuesday's South Dakota primary, in which he captured 69 percent of the vote on a ballot that included no opposition, was a triumph.
"It was a good victory," Mr. Bush told reporters as he arrived here for a seven-nation summit meeting about drugs. "Sixty-nine percent. Good victory." 
 "Great victory," said his spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater. "Seventy percent. We're three for three. We're on a roll."
The comments were echoed with even greater emphasis by Mr. Bush's campaign office in Washington, where a spokeswoman said that she "would keep on saying it until you guys get it right."
Mr. Bush's re-election camp has insisted ever since the President's disappointing showing in the New Hampshire primary that the press is portraying his campaign victories too negatively. Mr. Bush got 53 percent of the vote in New Hampshire while his challenger, Patrick J. Buchanan, won 37 percent.
Today's comments seemed to reflect a decision to plunge ahead to what all agree is Mr. Bush's inevitable nomination, and to ignore any comparatively minor setbacks along the way.
"We'll win all the primaries," Mr. Fitzwater said. "We're going to win the election. The dance with the press is just the way the game is played."
By conventional measures, South Dakotans gave Mr. Bush an embarrassingly tepid show of support. Thirty-one percent of Republican voters rejected candidates who were running on Mr. Bush's slate of delegates to the Republican National Convention in August, voting for uncommitted candidates instead.
On the other hand, South Dakotans have been unkind to incumbent Presidents in recent years. In 1976, President Gerald R. Ford lost to Ronald Reagan, 51 percent to 44 percent, and President Jimmy Carter was edged out by Senator Edward M. Kennedy in 1980, 49 percent to 45 percent.
The last incumbent President to run unopposed, Richard M. Nixon, got all the delegates when he was on the primary ballot in 1972. South Dakota did not hold a primary in 1984, when President Reagan ran without opposition.
 
'Media Mischief'
 Mr. Fitzwater briefly conceded today that the sagging economy has made voters angrier at incumbents than usual these days. But he rejected suggestions that South Dakotans were dissatisfied with Mr. Bush or his policies.
"Media mischief," he said.
And Mr. Bush's campaign spokeswoman in Washington, Victoria Clarke, noted that the President now has one-fifth of the delegates he needs to be renominated. "History aside," she said, "what's important is who wins, and we're winning."
In California, where Mr. Bush raised $2 million for his campaign on Tuesday, former President Reagan today issued a statement supporting the President.
The Washington Post quoted unidentifed associates of Mr. Reagan as saying that the former President had told them that Mr. Bush "doesn't seem to stand for anything," and is losing his base of political support as a result.
Mr. Reagan said today in a written statement that the quote was "incorrect," and added, "Anyone close to me knows that I would not say that and have never made any such statement."

HEADLINE: Bush May Back Renewed Elephant Hunting

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26

 BODY:
A week before the United States and 111 other nations are to meet in Japan to consider protections for endangered animals and plants, the Bush Administration said today that it was sympathetic to a proposal by South Africa and other African nations to relax protections and open international trading in elephant hides and meat.
John F. Turner, director of the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service, said the United States was awaiting the report of an international panel of scientists studying elephant populations in Africa before a final decision would be made about allowing what he called "limited" hunting of one of the world's most admired and endangered animals. 
 Mr. Turner, the head of the United States delegation to the international conference in Japan, said that killing adult elephants in the "healthy" elephant herds in southern Africa for their hides and meat would give the animals both an economic value and a larger political constituency for managing herds that are now competing with impoverished people for habitat, water, and other resources.
The Administration's view was attacked today by 30 Senators and wildlife groups as an embarrassing weakening of America's leadership in world conservation efforts.
They said the African elephant herd, which has declined from 2.5 million animals in 1970 to roughly 350,000, was going the way of the American bison unless a total ban on international trade in elephant parts, including ivory, was preserved.
In a letter to President Bush that was signed by 25 Democrats and five Republicans, Senators said any relaxation of restrictions on trading elephant parts would again make thousands of elephants targets of poachers seeking ivory instead of hides. "Ivory smuggling was rampant before the current ban and the reopening of 'limited' trade would serve to rekindle the widespread poaching and smuggling problems," the letter said.
Steven Goldstein, the spokesman for the Department of the Interior, said today that allowing hunting in southern Africa would not affect the Administration's ban on importing ivory into the United States. "The President and the Secretary strongly support the continuation of a ban on all ivory trade," Mr. Goldstein said.
The dispute over preserving African elephants is likely to be the most contentious that the 112 nations that are signatories to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species oif Wild Fauna and Flora will grapple with next week. The treaty sets protections for roughly 3,000 species of animals and 30,000 species of plants and the 11-day conference that begins on Tuesday in Kyoto, Japan, is the eighth since the treaty was signed in 1973.
Top officials of several Federal environmental agencies, who insisted on anonymity, said today that they did not understand why the Administration appeared to be ready to support a weakening of a ban on trading in elephant parts that President Bush personally helped to establish.
In June 1989, Mr. Bush responded to growing concern over the steady loss of African elephants by announcing a ban on ivory imports to the United States. At a meeting in October that year in Switzerland, the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species agreed to ban ivory trade by designating the African elephant as an Appendix I species, meaning all trade in any elephant parts was banned.
Last year, six southern African nations -- South Africa, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Zambia, Namibia and Malawi -- proposed relaxing the protections for elephants by changing the animal's designation to Appendix II, which would allow trade in elephant parts, including ivory. Zambia has since withdrawn from the proposal and environmentalists say Malawi may is reconsidering its position.
Environmental groups described the plan to relax the ban on trading in elephant hides as a "subterfuge."
"It's totally irresponsible," said Dr. William J. Clark, a field biologist for Friends of Animals, an environmental group based in Norwalk, Conn. "Elephants are endangered and they need every protection the world can give them."

HEADLINE: A New Momentum at Mellon

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH

 BODY:
Five years after a double slug of bad real estate and energy loans sent it reeling, the Mellon Bank Corporation has regained much of its strength. While problems remain, like the fallout from past real estate lending, the bank founded 123 years ago by the wealthy Mellon family has broken with its past as a corporate lender and managed to find profits elsewhere.
Under Frank V. Cahouet, the folksy banking veteran who is chairman, president and chief executive, Mellon has sharply reduced its inventory of bad loans and curtailed its corporate lending, where the headaches are big and the profits small. The strategy, which Mr. Cahouet began putting into effect almost as soon as he joined Mellon in 1987, calls for lending to small companies and consumers, where the growth and profits seem limitless.
 
Centerpiece of Recovery
 Most important, Mr. Cahouet (pronounced COW-et) has expanded Mellon's service businesses, like overseeing personal investments, managing cash for corporations and handling data-processing for smaller banks. While these businesses had been important to Mellon, under Mr. Cahouet they have become the centerpiece for the bank's recovery, contributing a rising share of revenues and the largest single portion -- an estimated 40 percent -- of Mellon's record 1991 profit. 
 The business shift has also caused a big swing in the mix of Mellon's $29.4 billion in assets. Consumer lending, which at the end of 1986 accounted for 19 percent of Mellon's total, is now 34 percent. Meanwhile, lending to blue-chip companies, which earned Mellon the sobriquet "the J. P. Morgan of the Alleghenies," has fallen slightly since 1986, to about 46 percent of assets from 50 percent.
"The momentum in Mellon's service business is tremendous," said Livia S. Asher, an analyst at Merrill Lynch.
Still, Mellon is not without troubles, nor its strategy without skeptics. With 31 percent of its real estate loans nonperforming, analysts say, Mellon may have to take additional write-downs against income to account for further declines in property values. Mellon's operating expenses have also been rising rapidly. And while profit margins remain rich in Mellon's service businesses, the margins are under pressure from price cutting.
Mellon also has an investor-relations problem. A 1988 decision to sell $1.4 billion in bad loans at a loss chafed investors. Investors were also piqued by Mellon's step that year to build its capital by selling stock to a European investor group, E. M. Warburg, Pincus & Company, which diluted existing shareholders' ownership and gave Warburg 16 percent of Mellon's common stock, making it Mellon's largest single shareholder.
"Mellon lost a lot of its core institutional shareholders after that transaction," said Kristina E. Andersson of Smith Barney.
 
Coming Off a Record Year
 For 1991, Mellon reported record earnings of $280 million, or $4.66 a share, up from $174 million, or $2.83 a share, in 1990. Return on assets, a widely cited measure of a bank's profitability, stood at an impressive 0.96 percent of assets -- eighth best among the top 25 banks as ranked by assets, and in line with the industry's 1 percent goal. And Mellon's 15.8 percent return on equity exceeded the industry's 15 percent goal.
Those profits earned Mellon's employees a paid day off this year in a thank-you gesture by Mr. Cahouet. Last year, by contrast, merit pay increases were deferred for all workers, and bonuses and vacations for top officers were slashed after a 1990 fourth-quarter loss of $99 million. In the last 10 years, Mellon has laid off more than 4,000 people.
"Arguably, Cahouet saved the company from a dire fate," said Thaddeus W. Paluszek," the Mellon analyst at Kidder, Peabody.
 
How Mellon Became 'Good'
 Mr. Cahouet's first big move, novel in 1988, was for Mellon to accept a few cents on the dollar on a bad loan to be rid of it, instead of waiting years to collect a little more. This "good bank/bad bank" strategy, as it is known in the industry, allowed Mellon, as the "good" bank, to keep its performing loans, and sweep away $1.4 billion in troubled loans by selling them to a "bad" bank called Grant Street National Bank.
The sale cut Mellon's nonperforming asset ratio to 5.03 percent at the end of 1988 from its 8.01 percent peak in 1987, when rumors persisted that Mellon was in danger of failing.
Since then, Mellon has been working with reasonable success to improve the quality of its remaining loans, with the nonperforming ratio at 4.78 percent at the end of 1991.
Leading the effort has been Richard H. Daniel, a Mellon vice chairman and longtime friend of Mr. Cahouet's from the days when the two were colleagues at Security Pacific Bank in California. In banking circles, Mr. Daniel, who goes by the name Dick, is regarded as one of the industry's best loan-collection men. Squat and bespectacled, with a fire-plug physique, Mr. Daniel has an urn on his desk to hold, he says, "the ashes of customers who don't pay."
 
Nonperforming Assets
 Mr. Daniel has kept Mellon's good loans in good shape. Excluding commercial real estate, Mellon's nonperforming asset ratio stood at a slim 1.3 percent last Dec. 31, one of the strongest ratios in the industry.
The problem, though, is that Mellon continues to have a large number of real estate loans. Under David Barnes, Mr. Cahouet's predecessor as chief executive, Mellon lent heavily to developers in Texas, Colorado and Louisiana, trying to take advantage of the oil boom in the early 80's.
While Mellon was able to sell some of these real estate loans to Grant Street, there was a limit to how much trouble investors would buy. The result: some $700 million, or 31 percent, of Mellon's approximately $2.3 billion in remaining real estate loans were nonperforming at the end of last year. The average for most banks of Mellon's size was 15 percent.
Mellon's troubled loan ratio "is still too high," Mr. Cahouet acknowledged in a recent interview in his office in Pittsburgh. "It's partly a matter of where we came from and partly a matter of the economy."
 
Consumers, Services, Computers
 So Mellon has been busy buying banks with significant retail and consumer business, like the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society, better known as PSFS, which Mellon acquired in 1990. Mellon is also expanding its number of credit-card customers.
More than anything, though, Mr. Cahouet has expanded Mellon's service businesses. Along with State Street Bank in Boston and the Northern Trust Company in Chicago, for instance, Mellon is one of the leading bookkeepers for thousands of corporate pension plans -- executing trades on behalf of the money managers who invest pension money, tracking the money managers' performance and keeping account records for pension plan participants. It is a business that analysts say produces giant profit margins -- anywhere from 35 percent to 50 percent before taxes -- and Mellon, with $120 billion in such assets under administration, is the nation's third-largest "master trustee."
Mellon has also become a leader in cash management, the business of investing companies' idle funds day to day. That business, too, is said by analysts to produce 35 to 50 percent pretax returns, and Mellon's operation is almost as large as that of First Chicago, the cash-management leader.
Mellon has also expanded its business of providing computer services to smaller banks: everything from processing credit-card transactions to running regional automatic-teller networks.
The advantage of this kind of business is that customers tend to be loyal because it is cumbersome to transfer large volumes of data to another processor. Another edge is that service businesses are difficult to enter, requiring hundreds of millions of dollars to buy the necessary computer equipment and tens of millions of dollars more to program the computers.
 
Squeezing Small Competitors
 William Gregor, the head of financial institutions consulting at the MAC Group, a Cambridge-based consultant, said that most of Mellon's service businesses "are not the sort of business that other people can come crashing into; it's just too expensive to start from scratch."
Such thinking has allowed service businesses to become more important than ever at Mellon. In 1985, they generated $365 million in revenues, or 27 percent of the banking company's total. By last year, service revenue had leaped to $742 million, or 41 percent of the total.
Mellon's management is convinced that as prices in the services area shrink, smaller players will be squeezed out of the business, leaving Mellon with an even bigger market share than it has at present. That would increase Mellon's profits further and help its stock price, which, in recognition of the strong returns from services, has outperformed most other bank stocks, and has climbed 86 percent from its 52-week low.
[On the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday, Mellon's common shares closed at $40.125, unchanged.]
But analysts say the run-up in the stock price is due almost entirely to buying by a handful of investors and that most investors are still wary, wondering whether Mellon's fat returns in services can continue and whether new troubles could emerge from the bank's real estate group.
George G. C. Parker, a Stanford University finance professor who studies banks, said: "The market remains skeptical. It's just not ready to believe that the returns Mellon has been reporting are sustainable."

HEADLINE: Marguerite Ross Barnett, 49, Dies; Was Head of Houston University

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
Marguerite Ross Barnett, who as president of the University of Houston was the first black woman to lead a major American university, died yesterday at Maui Memorial Hospital in Wailuku, Hawaii. She was 49 years old.
She had a blood disorder involving hypoglycemia and metastatic cancer, said Timothy Maloney, the hospital administrator. Dr. Barnett was on medical leave from the University of Houston, where she had been president since 1990. She was visiting Hawaii with her husband, Walter E. King, on a trip to where they had spent their honeymoon. 
 Before becoming president at Houston, Dr. Barnett had been an administrator at other major universities, including the City University of New York. She had a reputation as a successful fund-raiser and a pragmatic academic who urged that urban universities play a dominant role in spurring economic growth and solving social problems in the same way that land-grant colleges of a century ago did in developing America's agricultural economy.
 
Seeking Stronger Links
 "What will characterize the superb 21st century university," she said at her inaugural in 1990, "will be its ability to manifest and focus areas of unquestioned institutional excellence on the challenging issues of the day."
Her views were representative of a substantial shift in higher education as universities, once isolated from their locales, sought stronger connections to their surroundings. And in many ways, Dr. Barnett was seen as representing a new generation of educational leader. While she had access to politicians and business leaders, she also worked to reach out to the public schools where she worked.
As vice-chancellor for academic affairs at the City University of New York from 1983 to 1986, she was instrumental in establishing a program to help poor high school students make the transition to college and good jobs. She instituted a similar program at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, where she was chancellor from 1986 to 1990, and did the same in Houston.
Houston is a public university with 33,000 students that performs $45 million a year in scientific research. It has become especially well known for its work in superconductivity.
 
Recording Firsts
 In 1989, Dr. Barnett was considered a leading candidate to replace Chancellor Richard R. Green of the New York City schools after Dr. Green died. The position went to Joseph A. Fernandez.
When she was named the first black and the first woman to be president of the University of Houston, there were few other women in charge of colleges that were neither historically black nor all female, a situation that still exists. The only woman to lead a campus larger than the University of Houston is Donna Shalala, who is chancellor of the University of Wisconsin at Madison, which has 38,000 students.
But Dr. Barnett constantly tried to play down the racial distinction of her position. When interviewers persisted in asking her how it felt to be the first black woman to head the University of Houston, she would turn to her assistant, Wendy H. Adair, and ask "Well, how does it feel to be the first red-haired associate vice president of the university?" That usually ended the conversation.
During her brief tenure in Houston, Dr. Barnett became a leading spokeswoman for urban universities and university-driven economic development. She also played a key role in raising more than $150 million for her institution, including a donation of more than $50 million from an alumnus, John Moores, one of the largest gifts ever made to a publicly financed university.
Dr. Barnett was born in Charlottesville, Va., on May 21, 1942. She graduated from Antioch College in 1964 and received her master of science and doctoral degrees in political science from the University of Chicago. She taught at the University of Chicago and at Princeton, Howard and Columbia universities before turning to university administration.
She was a member of the boards of the Student Loan Association and the Educational Testing Service. Last July she was the only university representative named to the President's Commission on Environmental Quality, a group that will recommend ways to slow the destruction of the environment without restricting business excessively.
Dr. Barnett is survived by Mr. King; her daughter by a previous marriage, Amy Barnett, of New York City, and her mother, Mary Eubanks, of Houston.

HEADLINE: High-Level U.S. Trip to Hanoi

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26

 BODY:
The Bush Administration is preparing to send the highest-level official delegation to Vietnam since the end of the war, led by Assistant Secretary of State Richard H. Solomon, diplomats and Congressional aides say.
The State Department declined today to comment on the reports, but an announcement of the mission is expected this week. The Administration team, which is to leave on Saturday, is apparently planning to visit Laos and Cambodia as well as Vietnam. 
 There is speculation in Congress that the United States may be moving toward a new phase in relations with Hanoi. Under a "road map" presented to the Vietnamese a year ago, faster progress on solving cases of missing Americans would lead to a partial relaxation in an American embargo that has frozen Vietnam out of trade and blocked assistance from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
The Bush Administration, which eased travel restrictions for Americans at the end of last year, has said that the next step will be to allow American companies to set up offices and negotiate, but not sign, agreements with the Vietnamese. The oil, communications and consulting industries have been lobbying for openings, fearful that they will lose out to Japanese, Korean, Singaporean and other Asian competitors.
The final steps, not expected until after the 1992 Presidential election, would be a lifting of the embargo and the establishment of diplomatic relations.
Mr. Solomon met with the Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister, Le Mai, in New York in November, the first of what was described as a series of high-level meetings made possible by the peace accord on Cambodia reached in October with the help of Hanoi. In an interview after that meeting, Mr. Mai said he thought it might be possible to advance a stage this spring.
The visit of Mr. Solomon, head of the bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, follows the arrival in Hanoi this week of Brig. Gen. Thomas Needham, who heads a new United States military task force on the issue of the 2,267 Americans still unaccounted for in Indochina, including 1,656 in Vietnam.

HEADLINE: Canadian Troops to Pull Out of Europe by '94

BYLINE: By CLYDE FARNSWORTH

DATELINE: TORONTO, Feb. 26

 BODY:
Reflecting eased East-West tensions and Canada's severe budget constraints, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Government has announced that it will pull out all its combat forces from Europe by the end of 1994.
The decision, which was disclosed late Tuesday in the Government's newest budget, a fiscal blueprint for the coming 12 months, has stirred angry reactions from the Bush Administration and NATO headquarters, mirroring fears that it will increase Congressional pressures for faster American withdrawal and unravel the 43-year-old North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
 A State Department spokesman said Washington was "very disappointed" and would have "greatly preferred a continuing Canadian presence within the NATO force structure in Europe."
The NATO Secretary General, Manfred Worner, noted Ottawa's action "with considerable regret, given the political and military importance of the presence of Canadian forces in Europe," according to a statement issued from his office in Brussels.
With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States, which had as many as 350,000 troops in Europe during the most intense phases of the cold war, has now cut back its force levels to 220,000 and plans to reduce still further to 150,000 by 1995, a Pentagon spokesman said.
Canada has already announced significant force cutbacks. But a token level was still "psychologically very important," said Alex Morrison, executive director of the Canadian Institute of Strategic Studies, an Ottawa-based public policy research group.
He said that if troops are already in place, a decision to swell the ranks, should the need arise, boils down to whether or not to reinforce, while with zero forces, "a decision to send troops to Europe becomes one of a completely different political magnitude."
Mr. Morrison critized the move as "a withdrawal of Canada into itself" and said it would "reduce the importance of Canada's voice not only in NATO but in general European security matters."
Canada's Defense Ministry had already announced substantial cuts last September, the closing of two bases in Germany -- at Lahr and Baden-Sollingen, both in Germany's southwestern corner -- and the reduction of soldiers and fliers in Europe from 6,600 to 1,100 by the end of 1995.
In announcing total withdrawal in his budget speech, Canada's Finance Minister, Don Mazankowski, said that "since September 1991, the world has changed a great deal." He insisted that the "peace dividend" was possible "without lessening our commitment to NATO solidarity."
The move is part of $2.2 billion in cuts to Canadian military spending over the next five years. Canada now spends $12 billion a year on defense, less than 4 percent of the $307 billion President Bush proposes for the military in the current fiscal year.
American military spending is more than twice the entire Canadian budget. But Canada's accumulated debt is proportionately as large as the United States, and higher Canadian interest rates mean proportionately heavier annual interest charges.
While the Canadian withdrawal is expected to strengthen the voice of those in Congress who want drastic reductions of the $150 billion a year NATO military bill of the United States, it is also likely to influence attitudes in Europe.
Prof. Simon Serfaty, a specialist in Atlantic relations at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, said that for the Europeans "it will confirm the perception that all of the New World is going home, and it might increase European interest in developing an autonomous defense entity that would be distinct from NATO."
Since the mid-1980's, he noted, the Europeans have been talking of reviving an aborted initiative of the early 1950's that called for a European Defense Community to exist along side the European Community.
Still, many in Canada welcomed the Government decision and wanted the Government to go even further in trimming military outlays.

HEADLINE: Guru on Government Steps Into Political Feud

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
A reigning guru of government reorganization came within a stone's throw of New York's City Hall to noodle with some local practitioners yesterday, and stepped smack into the simmering political feud between his host, City Council President Andrew J. Stein, and Mayor David N. Dinkins.
David Osborne, co-author of "Reinventing Government" (Addison Wesley, 1992), spoke at a panel discussion that also seemed aimed at reinventing Mr. Stein, not previously noted for gravitas in such matters, as he prepares to challenge Mr. Dinkins for the mayoralty. 
 "New York City government today is simply not working," Mr. Stein told the panel, which met at the New York County Lawyers Association building on Vesey Street, just around the corner from City Hall, to discuss Mr. Osborne's ideas for unclogging government to make it more efficient, competitive and responsive to the needs of citizens, or "customers" as Mr. Osborne calls them.
Mr. Osborne's ideas for "steering rather than rowing," for "de-massifying" bureaucracies to make them more flexible and "incentivizing" employees by rewarding performance have gained currency both because of his new book and because he has advised a number of public officials, including Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas.
 
Farming Out Services
 But before Mr. Osborne's talk had ended, the Mayor's office issued a 28-page review tweaking Mr. Stein for admitting he touted the book before reading all of it, and purporting to show that the city was already undertaking some projects in keeping with the Osborne philosophy, including exploring the feasibility of farming out some services to the private sector.
"It just shows how unbelievably defensive they are," Mr. Stein said. "There's no there there."
If the administration sounded defensive, it may have been because Mr. Stein gathered a panel of notables to toss around Mr. Osborne's ideas, including the Governor's son, Andrew Cuomo, who is the head of Mr. Dinkins's own commission on the homeless, which just recommended increasing reliance on nonprofit groups to serve the homeless; John E. Zuccotti, a former first deputy mayor during the fiscal crisis of the 1970's; Barry Feinstein, president of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and Lawrence Kudlow, a former Reagan Administration budget aide and now chief economist of Bear, Stearns, the Wall Street investment concern.
 
Could Be Working Better
 Mr. Zuccotti said it was overblown to contend that government was not working, but he allowed that it was not working as well as it could, and warned that New York must re-evaluate its traditionally expansive commitment to provide services in light of its flattened economic base.
Mr. Kudlow said local government was a leviathan "that is strangling us."
Mr. Cuomo said that improving conditions "comes down to the leadership."
And Mr. Feinstein agreed heartily with the book's assertion that "management is a failure."
 
Paid for a Book Party
 Mr. Stein, the city's official ombudsman, who held a hearing last year on this topic, paid the $325 cost of renting the room (City Hall hearing rooms were busy) out of his office budget and paid for a book party at Mortimer's restaurant on the Upper East Side Tuesday night, using his campaign funds, which he has raised without abiding by the limits on contributions and spending in the city's voluntary public campaign finance program.
Mr. Osborne, a strong supporter of public campaign financing who describes himself as a liberal Democrat, said that he simply differed with Mr. Stein on that point, and that Mr. Stein had told him he needed unlimited money to spread his message of change in government.
"I will talk to anybody," Mr. Osborne said. "I'm spending three hours with Rudy Giuliani this afternoon."

HEADLINE: End of Plant Predictable, But Closing Still Hurts

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NORTH TARRYTOWN, N.Y., Feb. 26

 BODY:
Two days after General Motors shocked Westchester County with news that it would close its huge plant here in 1995, the fallout seems certain to be painful, but limited, across a suburban landscape where welding metal, stamping plastic and other manufacturing has long been a relic of the industrial past.
In this Hudson River village, 18 miles north of Manhattan, as elsewhere in New York State, a chorus of angry charges is being directed at General Motors, which received rich subsidies in the mid-1980's to keep the plant open. 
 It is now leaving a legacy of lost jobs, business failures and reduced tax revenues.
"They leave us holding the bag, and it's empty," Andrew P. O'Rourke, the Westchester County Executive, said at a news conference today.
 
More Campus, Less Flint
 But while the decision has come as a harsh blow during the worst recession in decades, experts say it also comes at the end of a long period of economic change that has made the towns around the plant far more reliant on lush corporate campuses and high-technology research.
"This is not Flint," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the New York Regional Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. In contrast to Flint, Mich., and most other areas where the American automobile industry operates, Westchester has for decades been without parts fabricators, machine shops and other small companies that serve as direct suppliers to the assembly line.
"The Westchester economy is in a better position to survive this blow than a lot of places would be," Mr. Ehrenhalt said.
Even some of the strongest advocates of business here say that shutting down the North Tarrytown plant has been inevitable for years and that the only question was when. The plant, which has been producing cars since 1900, ranks as General Motors' oldest and Westchester County's largest remaining manufacturer.
"It is a stand-alone operation, and the last great manufacturer in Westchester," said Sy Schulman, president of the Westchester County Association, a business group. "It represents the tail end of the American revolution."
 
Effects Beyond Plant Gate
 Almost 3,500 people now work at the plant, which produces mini-vans and which General Motors said it will close permanently in the summer of 1995. As in other communities where large factories have closed, the financial hardship is certain to flow beyond the plant gate.
"It's going to change everything," said Herbert Kammerman, owner of Lemac Drugs, a small pharmacy and children's clothing store here.
"There are a lot of mom-and-pop retail outlets that rely on the business of G.M. workers," he added. "This is going to drive some out."
Fully 20 percent of the budget of North Tarrytown is paid for by taxes from General Motors, and officials of the school district here said that more than 8 percent of what is spent on public education is paid by the automaker.
And the announcement by General Motors comes at a time when other industries in Westchester, as throughout the New York region, are struggling.
 
Long Manufacturing Decline
 Mr. Ehrenhalt said overall employment in the county had risen by 23 percent during the 1980's to 415,000, and plummeted 7 percent since 1990, falling by 29,000 jobs. Among manufacturers, he said the recession has only accelerated a long and steep decline in employment, which has fallen by more than 25 percent since 1980, to 53,000.
But while the experts hold out little hope for a renaissance of manufacturing, they say the main engines of future growth in Westchester, as in Fairfield County, Conn., Morris County, N.J., and other suburban enclaves around New York City, will be in the offices of corporate headquarters and research parks that moved in droves from Manhattan to the suburbs during the same two decades that manufacturing was in steep decline.
Within a 30-mile radius of North Tarrytown is the nation's second-highest concentration of headquarters for companies on the Fortune 500 list, after Manhattan.
 
Few Job Alternatives
 Companies that have headquarters in Westchester, but manufacture little or nothing here, include the I.B.M. Corporation, based in Armonk; Pepsico Inc., in Purchase, and General Foods U.S.A., in White Plains.
In the midst of such corporate giants, experts say alternatives for the thousands who will lose their jobs at the North Tarrytown plant will be limited. Unless other manufacturers can be attracted to Westchester, "This county will simply not be able to absorb these workers," said Renee Guy, the county's director of employment and training.
Only a small minority of the workers are likely to be offered jobs at other General Motors plants, the company said.
Officials say they were surprised and angered by General Motors' announcement because of the inducements the company had accepted to remain in North Tarrytown.
In 1985, faced with the prospect that the plant might close, New York State, Westchester County and the Village of North Tarrytown approved a 10-year package in which General Motors received reduced property taxes, state-financed job training and subsidized electric power. The Metro-North Railroad rebuilt bridges to allow easier transportation of automobiles from the plant.
At his news conference today, Mr. O'Rourke said the subsidies had cost the village, county and state $140 million. He proposed that any company receiving similar inducements in the future be required to pay them back if they leave Westchester County in anything less than 10 years. If they leave in less than 20 years, he suggested that they be required to reimburse taxpayers on a sliding scale.
One question only beginning to be addressed by General Motors and government is the fate of the plant and its 97 acres of riverfront property. William Regan, North Tarrytown's Administrator, said one option would be to subdivide the site for smaller companies, including those with more direct ties to the corporate and research offices nearby.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Voters;
Warnings for Winners In South Dakota Results

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SIOUX FALLS, S.D., Feb. 26

 BODY:
There was bad news all around after Tuesday's South Dakota Presidential primary, even for the winners.
While Democrats here handed Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska his first victory, with 40 percent of the vote, the main reason people said they voted for him was because he "knows my state." 
 President Bush, who received 69 percent of the Republican vote, could hardly be reassured, considering that 31 percent voted for an uncommitted slate. And many disgruntled with the President vowed to desert their party and vote for a Democrat in the fall.
A nagging minority of Democrats also voiced doubts about the character and honesty of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, and about the health of former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, issues that could haunt them as the race turns south.
 
Warnings From the People
 These warning signals came from a survey of voters leaving polling stations in South Dakota on Tuesday. While turnout was light in this sparsely-populated state of just under 700,000 -- only 58,608 Democrats and 44,664 Republicans actually went to the polls -- the findings underscore the political land mines faced by the Democratic field and an incumbent President.
Mr. Kerrey scored a victory over Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, who finished second and with whom he was vying for pre-eminence as the farm belt favorite. One-third of the Kerrey backers cited his regional ties, while 25 percent pointed to his ideas, and another 25 percent said that he "cares about people like me."
While he was the clear favorite of the state's dwindling farm population, Mr. Harkin came in second over all, a showing that could cripple his money-hungry campaign. Only 21 percent of Mr. Harkin's supporters mentioned the regional factor, while the largest proportion, one-third, credited him with caring about their issues.
And though Mr. Harkin is considered closest to labor, Mr. Kerrey did equally well among those with a union member in their household. Both men each got about a third of the union vote. Although both candidates are veterans, Mr. Kerrey had made much of his Vietnam War experience, and he won half of the veterans' vote.
 
Mixed Outcome for Clinton
 Mr. Clinton's third-place showing was repsectable for an outsider who had little presence here until the final days of the campaign. But he might have done better, perhaps overtaking Mr. Harkin, had voters not had misgivings about accusations of marital infidelities and disclosures that he tried to avoid the draft.
Asked if they were satisfied that Mr. Clinton had the "honesty and integrity to serve effectively as President," 32 percent said no and 61 percent said yes. Of the Democrats who voted for Mr. Tsongas, 49 percent said they had qualms about Mr. Clinton's integrity; 38 percent of the Kerrey and Harkin voters also were concerned.
Mr. Tsongas, the winner of the New Hampshire primary, received 10 percent of the vote here, a sign that his strength in New England may not resonate in other regions. Although Mr. Tsongas said he has been cured of cancer, some voters are worried.
Twenty-six percent of the Democratic voters said they were concerned that his health "will interfere with his ability to serve effectively as President." Nearly one-third of the Kerrey and Clinton supporters said they were concerned about Mr. Tsongas's health, as were 24 percent of the Harkin backers.
 
Health Care the Issue
 Karen Schreier, chairman of the South Dakota Democratic Party, said Mr. Kerrey won for more reasons than his local ties. "Kerrey campaigned here more than Harkin, and organization was a big part of it," she said.
As for health care, the polling by Voter Research and Surveys, an organization created by the four major television networks in 1990, found that more than any other issue, health care mattered most to Mr. Kerrey's supporters. Perhaps that was because the largest pool of Democratic voters, 43 percent, were over the age of 60.
Mr. Kerrey has made national health insurance the centerpiece of his campaign, and 35 percent of his supporters said the issue was critical to them, closely followed by 33 percent who cited the economy and jobs. Among Mr. Harkin's backers, the biggest concern, among 39 percent, was farm policy, while 47 percent of Mr. Clinton's and Mr. Tsongas's backers said the economy and jobs.
The vote against Mr. Bush was also largely a protest over the sour state of the economy. Fifty-four percent of those who rated the national economy as poor backed the uncommitted slate.
 
'Still a Danger Sign'
 While Mr. Bush retained the overwhelming loyalty of voters identifying themselves as Republicans, the uncommitted slate got its biggest vote, 60 percent, among independents.
Bob Burns, head of the political science department at South Dakota State University at Brookings, said the protest vote against Mr. Bush should not be underestimated: "When an incumbent President cannot hold 70 percent or more in a primary against an uncommitted slate, it says there's real discontent in the ranks."
Although they were answering the poll in the heat of casting a primary ballot, more than 4 of 10 of those who voted uncommitted said they would vote for Mr. Tsongas or Mr. Clinton if either was the Democratic nominee against Mr. Bush.
The findings also showed that men were less supportive of Mr. Bush than women -- a pattern that was apparent in the New Hampshire primary. By 14 percentage points women were more supportive than men of Mr. Bush.
Mr. Bush's conservative opponent, Patrick J. Buchanan, did not file in time to get his name on the ballot here. Today, Mr. Buchanan, a conservative columnist, said the President's performance showed he was "politically as weak as a kitten."
But Don Peterson, chairman of the South Dakota Republican Party, said many Bush supporters stayed home.

How the Survey Was Conducted
The Election Day exit poll was based on questionnaires completed by voters as they left voting stations throughout South Dakota on Tuesday.
The poll was conducted by Voter Research and Surveys, an organization created in 1990 by ABC News, CBS News, CNN and NBC News.
The results are based on 1,248 voters in the Democratic primary and 628 voters in the Republican primary in 38 randomly selected precincts around the state.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results from such polls should differ by no more than a few percentage points from what would have been obtained by seeking to interview all primary election voters in South Dakota on Tuesday. For Democrats, the difference should be no more than four percentage points in either direction; for Republicans, it should be no more than five percentage points.
Results based on smaller subgroups have a larger potential sampling error. In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of voter opinion on Election Day may introduce other sources of error into the poll. For example, refusal rates by voters leaving voting stations can be higher than those for other types of polls.

So it can be jarring to watch him run for the Democratic nomination for the Senate, attacking Alfonse M. D'Amato, the Republican Senator known for old-style pork-barrel politics. Mr. Abrams is proposing to out-D'Amato Mr. D'Amato.
Senator D'Amato "has cut and hurt and punished New York," Mr. Abrams told reporters he summoned in late January to the modest Nassau County home of Ken and Betty Koch -- "middle-class people," he said -- to shift his year-old campaign into high gear. Partly because of Mr. D'Amato, he said, New York receives fewer dollars back than it sends to Washington in taxes. "And Al D'Amato has the gall to say that he has delivered for New York," Mr. Abrams said. 
 Mr. Abrams is engaged in a close race for the nomination. He is opposed by four other Democrats: Geraldine A. Ferraro, Elizabeth Holtzman, Robert J. Mrazek and the Rev. Al Sharpton.
As he has contended in campaigns since he was 27 years old, Mr. Abrams said he would deliver. "It's time that New York had a senator who is more interested in putting money in your pocket than money in the pockets of his cousins and his cronies," he said. Six months ago the Senate Select Committee on Ethics rebuked Mr. D'Amato for his conduct, but declined to censure him. Mr. D'Amato has been called Senator Pothole for his service to constituents.
In interviews and before groups, Mr. Abrams repeatedly promised to bring in more Federal money and criticized Mr. D'Amato for not doing so. Mr. D'Amato, he said, "has tried to create the image that he has brought home the bacon for New York, but that's a sham, it's a lie, it's a fraud."
Then Mr. Abrams would turn around and tout himself as an idealistic, independent force. "My agenda has always been one of change, of progressive social values and political reform," he said. That Mr. Abrams is running as both a crusading independent and a committed pork-barreler, as both "the only candidate who has not served in Congress" and the candidate best qualified to win dollars playing "the big game in town," is one of several apparent contradictions in his campaign. Despite his changed circumstances, Mr. Abrams, at 54, appears to be running an updated version of every race he has run since he was a young man.
Mr. Abrams is a career politician running as an outsider.
He is an innovative official pushing proposals that seem warmed over from other campaigns.
To his opponents, these contradictions reek of opportunism. "Bob Abrams will say just about anything," Mr. D'Amato said through a spokeswoman, Zenia Mucha, who said that Mr. D'Amato would comment directly on Mr. Abrams only if he won the nomination.
 
A Dissonant Message?
 Advisers to Mr. Abrams's opponents say that his dissonant message has made him vulnerable. "There's not a big impression in people's minds of who Bob Abrams is," said Frank Wilkinson, a spokesman for Ms. Ferraro, the 1984 Democratic Vice Presidential candidate. Polls conducted by the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion in spring 1991 showed Mr. Abrams comfortably in front, but a survey by the institute a month ago put him and Ms. Ferraro in a virtual tie. He had the support of 27.4 percent of respondents, compared with 27.1 percent for her.
Ms. Holtzman, the New York City Comptroller, received 20.2 percent in the poll; Mr. Mrazek, a United States Representative from Long Island, got 3.1 percent, and Mr. Sharpton got 2.3 percent. Twenty percent of respondents were undecided.
To Mr. Abrams, the contradictions are more evidence of his independence. While they may seem stark, they begin to blur on closer examination. Mr. Abrams does seem to be something of all things to all Democrats: an inside player who has retained certain ideals and an advocate of abstract principles who believes in doing the gritty work of making government meet individual needs.
The son of a Bronx candy store owner, Mr. Abrams said that he "came up the hard way," working four jobs a day during college at Columbia. After graduating from New York University Law School, he won election as a state assemblyman in 1965, then as Bronx borough president in 1970. Both victories were upsets against an entrenched Democratic organization.
But what Mr. Abrams's Reform Democrat slate offered was not no machine, but a clean machine; not no pork, but more pork. "It's going to be up to me to persuade the Board of Estimate to make its proper and appropriate investment in Bronx County," he said during his run for borough president.
Mr. Abrams won the Attorney General's office in 1978. Since then, he has taken three elections easily, though at first blush he lacks the basic tools for survival in the blow-dried age. The balding Mr. Abrams, who wears glasses, is no backslapper.
Even in private Mr. Abrams rarely relaxes his theatrical voice and his formal, elaborate sentences. Asked over lunch about his wife, Diane, he pronounced her "a fabulous asset to me in rearing our family, and being a partner in my life and a partner in my career."
Despite his starched persona, Mr. Abrams invariably comes across as a nice guy. "Bob is the only high-ranking politician in the state who is well liked," said Mark Green, New York City's Consumer Affairs Commissioner and Mr. D'Amato's last opponent. "He's an utterly decent family man in a totally rapacious business."
Mr. Abrams attributes his political success to his ability to deliver. Wherever he travels in New York, Mr. Abrams said, people "tell me, 'Hey, Mr. Abrams, I got a check from you today!' " He has fought dozens of suits on behalf of New Yorkers, forcing insurers, brewers and others to mail them checks totaling more than $800 million, said his spokesman, Timothy Gilles.
 
Expanding Office's Mission
 Those checks represent dividends from Mr. Abrams's efforts to expand his office's capacity and mission. As the Department of Justice retreated under Ronald Reagan from antitrust and environmental prosecutions, aggressive state attorneys general, including Mr. Abrams and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, stepped into the breach. Mr. Abrams intensified his office's efforts against tax cheats and consumer frauds and tackled new areas, prosecuting polluters, such as the company that poisoned Love Canal.
"He really over the years has set a standard for state attorneys general around the country," said Mr. Lieberman, now a Democratic senator.
But Mr. Abrams's high-profile prosecutions have also spawned the most persistent criticism of him: that he picks his battles for their publicity value.
Mr. Abrams's supporters point out that even if the criticism were true, a desire for good press would hardly distinguish Mr. Abrams from other politicians. Two lobbyists for liberal causes, who insisted on anonymity, cited recent instances when Mr. Abrams agreed not to sponsor legislation he favored. They said that Republican legislators would fight any measure that might help Mr. Abrams beat Mr. D'Amato, and getting the bills passed meant more to Mr. Abrams than receiving credit.
 
'Hindsight' on Gulf War
 But critics say Mr. Abrams is not always so inner-directed, and a tendency to skirt tough confrontations has popped up during his campaign. When he declared his candidacy, Mr. Abrams was asked whether he would have voted to authorize war against Iraq. He dodged, saying he did not have as much information as sitting senators. The war won, Mr. Abrams said that with "hindsight" he supported the decision to fight it.
Like his opponents, Mr. Abrams has put forward few specifics for his campaign's central proposals, which include a universal health care system and a tax cut for the middle class. Mr. Abrams's freshest plank appears to be his claim that Mr. D'Amato has not served constituents well. The reason, he said, is that Mr. D'Amato voted for policies of President Bush and Ronald Reagan that resulted in less money for New Yorkers.
But economists are not convinced by the evidence he cites. "For 1990," Mr. Abrams said, offering his chief piece of data, "there was a $21 billion shortfall of what we as New Yorkers sent to the Federal Government and of what came back."
That number was plucked from a study by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. As the study noted, the chief reason for the Federal Government's deficit with New York is that New Yorkers are wealthier than most Americans and so pay more taxes.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Plan to Ease Rule on Buying Radio Stations

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26

 BODY:
In a move likely to raise hackles in Congress, a staff report by the Federal Communications Commission recommended that a single company be allowed to acquire as many radio stations in a city as it wanted until it had 25 percent of the audience.
In a highly fragmented market like New York City, for example, a company could own four of the largest stations, or many more smaller stations, without exceeding the 25 percent limit. 
 In small markets with fewer than eight radio stations, the proposal specifies that a company could acquire as many as half of the licenses.
Under current law, one owner is limited to an AM station and an FM station in a single market.
Under the proposal, if the company subsequently increased its audience share to more than 25 percent, it would not have to sell any stations.
The commission's staff report, prepared by Roy J. Stewart, chief of the commission's mass media bureau, also calls for raising the limit on the number of radio stations one owner can have to as many as 200 stations from the current 12 AM and 12 FM.
The commission's chairman, Alfred C. Sikes, supports the proposals, but it is uncertain whether he can persuade his fellow commissioners to go along. The proposals, particularly the one on multiple ownership in a single market, are certain to provoke anger on Capitol Hill and may well be amended by the commission itself.
In effect, the staff report sides with the bigger-is-better camp in the troubled radio industry, which argues that companies holding many stations have the best chance of remaining profitable and serving the public. The other camp believes that such an approach seriously jeopardizes diversity of ownership, forcing out smaller broadcasters, including family companies and those owned by members of minorities, that cannot compete with the broadcasting giants.
"Diversity isn't necessarily served by how many separately owned voices there are," Mr. Sikes said today. "Frequently, diversity is served by people who have the assets. To have rules that cause radio stations to go bankrupt isn't in the public interest."
Representative John D. Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees the F.C.C.'s budget, said, "There is the outside chance that these things could do some good, but there is an enormous opportunity here to create mischief and a major threat to diversity,"
 
Hearings Set in Senate
 The proposals are expected to come up for a commission vote on March 12, but are likely to be discussed before then. The Senate Commerce subcommittee with jurisdiction over the F.C.C. has scheduled a hearing for next week on the state of the radio industry.
Owners are currently limited to 12 television stations as well, and that ceiling would be retained under the proposal. Nor do the proposals seek any change in rules that bar newspapers from owning broadcast stations in the city where they publish or broadcasters from owning local newspapers. (That rule, adopted in 1975, left intact more than 100 existing ownership arrangements.)
The proposal is likely to be of greatest benefit to large broadcasters that are bumping into the current limits. Among these are CBS Inc., Group W-Westinghouse Broadcasting, Capital Cities/ABC and the Infinity Broadcasting Corporation. Each owns AM and FM stations in 10 top markets, including New York City, and is eager for the chance to pick up an additional station in some of those cities.
"We would love to have another station in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago," said Mel Karmazin, president and chief executive of Infinity. "A change in the ownership rules would be very favorable to us. It would certainly give us many opportunities."
Market share is generally measured in ratings compiled by the Arbitron Company in New York. The staff proposal did not specify how audience share would be measured.
To shore up support for the proposal, the F.C.C. released a report today that argues that the commercial radio industry is in deep financial trouble and would greatly benefit from greater concentration of ownership.
The radio industry has been battered in recent years as cable television and other new forms of mass media have competed for advertising. Adding to the industry's woes, the Government awarded hundreds of new AM and FM licenses during the 1980's and increased competition within the industry.
The report says that most radio stations are losing money and that hundreds of broadcasters unable either to turn a profit or sell their stations have simply shut down. The report said 287 stations around the country had closed, 153 in the last 12 months.
If financial data are adjusted for inflation, the report said, profits of the average AM station have plunged by 50 percent since 1988 and by 36 percent for the average FM station.
"The magnitude of potential economies from consolidation appear to be significant," the staff study said. "Consolidated radio operations will permit increased expenditures on informational programming, may allow some previously marginal stations to remain on the air and may provide for activation of unused channels."
But minority broadcasters and some media experts fear that the rules will end diversity and leave many cities with only a few radio voices.
"This doesn't help competition in any way, shape or form," said Andrew Jay Schwartsman, executive director of the Media Access Project, a public interest group.
"Lifting ownership restrictions in the 1980's was a disaster and brought in people who wanted to make money as speculators and not as broadcasters," he said. "The solution that Sikes is proposing to deregulation is more deregulation."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Northwest;
Caucuses in Idaho and Washington Offer New Challenges for the Democratic Field

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Feb. 26

 BODY:
With a chance to show that their campaigns are more than contests of regional loyalties, Democratic Presidential candidates are planning to arrive in the Pacific Northwest this weekend in advance of next Tuesday's caucuses in Washington and Idaho.
Washington, the second-most-populous state in the West, has 80 Democratic delegates up for grabs, and it presents a bit of a puzzle to candidates who have tailored their message toward economically depressed areas. It was one of only two states in the West -- Oregon was the other -- to vote Democratic in the last Presidential race. 
 Idaho, enjoying its best economic climate in decades, has 25 delegates and has long been a sort of black hole for Democrats. But while voters have overwhelmingly voted for Republican Presidential candidates, Democrats have made big gains in the last three years, and polls show that President Bush is extremely unpopular in Idaho.
The caucuses are binding for Democrats only; Republicans in the two states will choose their delegates in primaries in May.
As the first test of the Presidential campaign in the Far West, Tuesday's caucuses are likely to focus on such issues of regional interest as free trade and environmental quality, political leaders say.
"There are some very difficult issues that are near and dear to every Westerner, but none of the candidates are talking about them," said Gov. Cecil Andrus of Idaho, a popular Democrat who is in his fourth term. Governor Andrus said the chief issues were water rights, environmental concerns, range-land management and dumping of nuclear waste.
Idaho is particularly sensitive to being ignored by national politicians. "We are sick and tired of candidates who rise out of the East Coast of the United States and don't see anything in the West except Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles," Mr. Andrus said. The Governor said he is withholding an endorsement until he has a chance to sit down with each of the candidates.
Mr. Andrus has been a leader in an effort to restore dwindling salmon runs in his state. The sockeye salmon in Idaho and the spotted owl in Washington have become symbols of a larger struggle in the Northwest over quality of life versus economic stability. The Endangered Species Act, which mandates restrictions of industries that are causing fish and wildlife to decline in numbers, has driven a wedge between rural and urban communities here. The act is up for renewal this year.
 
Focus on Health Care
 Gov. Booth Gardner of Washington, a two-term Democrat, is trying to make the Presidential contest a litmus test on health care. He would seem to be a likely supporter of Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who has campaigned strongly on a plan to provide national health insurance for every American. But the Governor is a long and close friend of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas. Governor Gardner has not formally endorsed a candidate.
Paul E. Tsongas, the former Senator from Massachusetts, has visited Seattle many times in recent months but has limited his appearances to small gatherings of supporters. The other two Democrats are Edmund G. Brown Jr., former Governor of California, and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, neither of whom has a strong organization in Washington. Karen Marchioro, chairwoman of the Washington State Democratic Party, said her own small polls show that a tremendous number of Democrats remain undecided.
Health care is a concern among thousands of machinists at Boeing Company plants in the Seattle area. Although the workers have health insurance, Boeing has raised the possibility that the machinists will have to pay more of the burden every time they visit a doctor.
"This sort of talk has made a lot of our members very nervous," said Connie Young, a spokeswoman for the International Association of Machinists, which represents 37,000 Boeing workers.
Although Boeing recently announced a plan to lay off 6,500 workers in the next year, most of the jobs will be lost through attrition, company officials say. The recession has not hit Washington nearly as hard as it has hit most states.
 
Don't Bash Japan
 But trade, which drives the Northwest economy, is a big issue here. Washington, which has trade surplus with Japan, has generally not been receptive to calls for protectionism. The fear is that fewer Northwest products would be sold overseas if the United States were to curtail foreign imports. Japan-bashing will haunt some candidates, say this state's political leaders.
"Because of television, we know who's been saying what," Ms. Marchioro said, "so I don't think a candidate can say one thing in New Hampshire about trade and another thing here."
Ms. Marchioro, a veteran leader of Western Democrats, has been feuding with Mr. Brown since he campaigned on behalf of a proposal to limit officials' terms. The measure failed here in November.
After listening to Mr. Brown talk last December, Ms. Marchioro said, "He's nuts." When Mr. Brown confronted her a month later at a meeting in Chicago, complaining that she had called him "crazy," Ms. Marchioro said: "I did not say you were crazy, I said you were nuts."
With no published polls, it is hard to predict the outcome of Tuesday's caucuses. Governor Clinton is well organized, with a full staff and phone volunteers. In the past, the best-organized candidates have fared well on caucus night, when Democrats gather in homes and halls to debate the issues and vote for delegates pledged to certain candidates.

Tax-Exempt Yields Slide; Taxable Funds Are Steady

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields on tax-exempt funds continued to drop in the week ended Monday, while short-term taxable funds held virtually steady in the week ended Tuesday for the first time in many weeks, according to IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report.
"The yields on the short-term taxables appear to have bottomed finally," said Walter Frank, economist for Donoghue's. "They have felt the full impact of the decline that was triggered by the Federal Reserve's lowering of the discount rate in late December. It takes time for the initial decline in open market yields, such as Treasury bills and commercial paper, to work its way through money fund yields." 
 The seven-day compounded average yield for the tax-exempt funds was 2.66 percent, down from 2.73 the previous week; the seven-day simple yield dropped to 2.62, from 2.69.
In the same period, the 30-day compounded yield was 2.78 percent, off 2 basis points from last week, and the 30-day simple yield also dropped 2 basis points, to 2.74. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
The top Connecticut fund again was Fidelity Spartan Connecticut Municipal Money Market Portfolio, which reported a seven-day compounded yield of 3.13, down from 3.24 percent.
In New Jersey, the top fund once again was Fidelity Spartan N.J. Municipal Money Market Portfolio, with a yield that dropped to 3.24, from 3.32 percent.
In New York, the top fund again was Salomon Brothers N.Y. Municipal Money Market fund. It had a seven-day compounded yield of 3.49, compared with 3.64, percent the previous week.
Assets of the tax-exempt funds rose by $767 million, to a record of almost $99.6 billion.
Donoghue's said the average number of days to maturity of securities held in the tax-free portfolios moved down by two days, to 49.
Of the funds monitored by Donoghue's with assets larger than $100 million, the Strong Municipal Money Market Fund of Milwaukee, led the way once again with a seven-day compounded yield of 3.59, off 7 basis points from the previous week.
 
Taxable Funds
 The assets of the taxable funds, which had declined two weeks ago by $13.1 billion, to $496.6 billion, increased by $11.0 billion, to a total of $507.6 billion, last week. About $8.3 billion of the increase came from institutions, and Mr. Frank noted that the public accounted for a substantial part of the increase -- $2.7 billion.
Mr. Frank said the average days to maturity of holdings in the taxable funds declined to 57 days, from 58.
The average seven-day compounded taxable yield was 3.85, down a basis point, while the seven-day simple yield was unchanged at 3.78 percent.
The 30-day compounded yield declined to 3.91 percent, down 7 basis points, and the 30-day simple yield dropped 6 basis points, to 3.84.
The taxable fund with the highest seven-day compounded yield for the week was Fidelity Spartan Money Market fund, with a yield of 4.57 percent, off a basis point.
By comparison, the average bank money market account, a prime competitor of money funds, was at 3.72 percent, off 3 basis points, according to The Bank Rate Monitor's national index.

HEADLINE: Panel Proposes Tough Rules to Maintain Delaware River's Quality

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEST TRENTON, N.J., Feb. 26

 BODY:
Four states and the Federal Government proposed unusually tough rules today to preserve the high quality of the upper Delaware River.
The plan would prohibit new pollutants that would be legally permissible elsewhere but would damage the nearly pristine water of the northernmost 121 miles of the river, between Hancock, N.Y., on the southwestern edge of the Catskills and Delaware Water Gap, near Stroudsburg, Pa. 
 Officials said they believed that the proposal was the first of its kind in the country.
 
Over 13,000 Square Miles
 Under the Federal Clean Water Act, if social and economic needs are shown, high-quality rivers and lakes are allowed to deteriorate to levels that would protect fishing and swimming. The quality of the upper Delaware is rated 30 to 170 percent higher than the fishing-and-swimming standard.
The Delaware River Basin Commission issued the plan at its headquarters here after nearly five years of study, hearings and negotiations among its members. Congress created the commission, made up of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and the Federal Interior Department, in 1961 to regulate water quality and use, as well as flood control, in a 13,000-square-mile region along the river and Delaware Bay.
"There may be some states on specific rivers that have adopted water-quality standards this rigid," the executive director of the commission, Gerald M. Hansler, said. "But to my knowledge, this goes further than any other stream with the Delaware's mix of agriculture, new development, cities and park land."
The upper Delaware flows through two Federal parks maintained by the National Park Service, the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area and the Upper Delaware National Scenic and Recreation River. The clear waters attract hundreds of thousands of canoeists, anglers, swimmers and rafters annually.
The commission says river-based recreation pumps as much as $60 million into scores of riverfront and other communities in Sullivan and Orange Counties in New York and Monroe, Pike and Wayne Counties in Pennsylvania.
 
To Strike a Balance
 Development has been increasing in the region and is expected to continue into the next century. Because of such pressures, the commission is moving to protect the quality of the river, the primary magnet for tourists, hunters, hikers and new settlers.
Officials of the commission said the plan would balance development and conservation, adding that growth could continue in the rural counties and the the quality of the river could be maintained. The plan is intended to insure that there would be "no measurable change" in several categories of contaminants and biological benchmarks of the river's health.
The major elements in the plan include tougher standards on effluent from new or expanded sewage plants, measuring an increased number of water criteria in the upper Delaware and its 70 tributaries where they flow into Federal parks and controls on nonpoint pollution, primarily storm-water runoff from roads, parking lots, building sites and farms. Nonpoint sources account for 65 percent of the pollution in a river, the commission estimated.
If the proposal is adopted, developers along the upper Delaware would be required to submit to their plans to the commission.
 
Bacteria and Nutrient Limits
 Under the sewage rules allowable measures of fecal coliform bacteria would be cut, from 200 to 50 colonies per 100 milliliters of water. Limits would be imposed for the first time on nitrogen, phosphorus and ammonia-nitrogen, nutrients that spur plant growth and algae, in effluent discharged into the river or its tributaries. The commission could also review proposed waste-water discharges exceeding 10,000 gallons a day. Now just discharges of more than 50,000 gallons a day are examined.
The commission would also begin to measure, in the river and near the mouths of the tributaries, phosphorus, ammonia and nitrogen, as well as the microorganisms and insect larvae that trout, shad and other fish eat.
For a critical indicator of the health of the river, dissolved oxygen, which fish need to breathe, the plan sets a standard of 9 milligrams a liter of water. The Federal Clean Water Act requires at least 4 milligrams a liter. The limit for fecal coliform is 24 colonies per 100 milliliters of water, as opposed to 200 colonies under the Clean Water Act.
Under the plan's requirement that there be "no measurable change" in the water criteria, the acceptable levels of dissolved oxygen could range from 8.9 to 9.2 milligrams. The permissible amount of fecal coliform colonies could range from 21 to 28.
Environmentalists seemed a bit uneasy about the "no measurable change" rule. "We still aren't quite sure how big measurable is," said Mary Ellen Noble, director of the Watershed Association of the Delaware River, an environmental group that urged the drafting of the plan. "We need to be clearer on that."
Hearings on the plan are scheduled for May 5 in Matamoras, Pa., and May 6 in Narrowsburg, N.Y.

For the Few Who Visit, One Less Place to Stay

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn.

 BODY:
BAD news is no news in this beleaguered Connecticut city, which has teetered on the verge of bankruptcy, watched its university struggle to survive and seen two of its banks go under. So it was just another blow to Bridgeport's image and economy when its Days Hotel abruptly closed last week.
The eight-story hotel's sunny yellow-orange logo has been removed, the curtains are drawn in its 240 rooms and its restaurant, Otto's Lounge, is boarded shut. As security guards prowl the property, near Interstate 95, prospective guests are further deterred by a mysterious yellow ribbon saying "crime scene," blocking the parking lot entrance. 
 The closing, which left Connecticut's largest city with only one hotel, also makes it more difficult for Bridgeport's No. 1 booster to get the message out that her hometown is really a great place to visit.
"This is a mid-sized city with more attractions than any other in the country," said Lucie A. Farrel, executive director of the Bridgeport Convention and Visitors Commission. "The city has ongoing problems, and the hotel's closing certainly doesn't help, but people aren't aware of the urban treasures we are blessed with."
Saying that much of Bridgeport's image problem is a result of the relative prosperity of neighboring towns in Fairfield County, she added: "We're the brown-eyed child in a blue-eyed family."
"I've seen a lot of frustrations," Ms. Farrel acknowledged. "But I've never brought visitors here who haven't been impressed with what they found."
Among the 24 Bridgeport attractions that she enumerates are the P. T. Barnum Museum; a jai alai fronton; the Polka Dot Playhouse, a summer theater; the H.M.S. Rose ("the largest operational wooden sailing ship in the world"), and "the only zoo between New York and Boston."
Because state funds for promoting tourism are allocated to towns on the basis of hotel-tax revenue, the Days Hotel's closing means that support for Ms. Farrel's office is likely to drop precipitously from the current $125,000 a year. As Ms. Farrel points out, neighboring areas with "few or no real attractions get enormous amounts of money because they have hotels."
"Stamford, with two major visitor attractions, receives $1.5 million annually," she noted in a recent essay-cum-news release titled "A Remarkable Tale from Barnum Country, U.S.A." Hartford, she added, receives $1.3 million. Adding to her woes are proposals to cut state aid for tourism and to streamline Connecticut's tourism-promotion network from 19 to 7 offices. Under the plans, the Bridgeport, Norwalk and Stamford tourism districts would be consolidated into one called the "Fairfield Coast."
Ms. Farrel said she did not know whether her four-person office or one of the others would be eliminated. But the silver lining in the proposals, she said, would be that "with regional marketing, we would get access to more funds."
With or without additional public financing, the Bridgeport tourism industry faces a daunting battle.
Even with the Days Hotel's closing and a recent 50-percent rate cut to $49 a night, the Bridgeport Hilton's occupancy rate of just over 40 percent is likely to edge upward only slightly, said William McGarry, the hotel's general manager. The 229-room hotel needs an occupancy rate of about 65 percent to break even, he said.
"There will be no windfall for us," he said of the closing of the nearby Days Hotel. "We hope to get some of their loss. But their closing is not something to be happy about."
Asked who stays in his hotel or stayed in the Days Hotel, Mr. McGarry said that a sizable proportion of the guests are just "people driving through on I-95 between New York and Boston." He said that Bridgeport's principal tourist draw is the jai alai fronton, which has attracted gamblers and is being converted into a greyhound racing track.
The Days Hotel, which charged $39 a night, only filled about one-third of its rooms, Mr. McGarry said. It owes $680,000 in taxes to Bridgeport, which wants to foreclose on the property but has been blocked because the hotel's franchiser, Days Inns of America, filed for bankruptcy protection in September, said John Blank, a lawyer for the city.
Further complicating the story is the tangle of players involved with the hotel. The building is owned by Route 347 Realty, a company based in Port Jefferson, L.I., which bought it from Days Inns of America, and the hotel was managed by a company called Buckhead Inc., said Timothy Shea, a lawyer for Route 347.
In the hotel's desolate parking lot, two Owl Security guards who refused to be identified or to tell who retained their company, said: "We're only here to secure the business."
As for who closed the hotel, putting 31 employees out of work, Mr. Shea said it was not Route 347. Nor was it Days Inns, said a company spokeswoman.
Even Ms. Farrel said the closing was "a bit of a puzzlement to me." But ever the optimist, she added: "It's an extraordinarily appealing property."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
A Solid Rally Raises Prices Of Treasuries

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The Government securities market turned in its strongest performance in weeks yesterday, as prices of Treasury notes and bonds posted solid gains and interest rates fell.
Dealers said a highly successful auction of new five-year Treasury notes was the main catalyst for the rally. 
 The securities were sold at an average yield of 6.75 percent, up from the 6.28 percent average at the last five-year note sale on Jan. 23. At the higher yield levels, demand for the new notes was strong.
 
Termed Best Auction
 "It was the best auction we have had this year," one bond trader said.
The securities traded well after the results of the auction were announced, and by late yesterday the notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 6.66 percent.
The auction was the last in a stretch of note and bond sales that began early this month with the Treasury's quarterly refunding auctions.
Coping with the huge inflow of new Treasury issues has put downward pressure on prices, as dealers have been forced to offer securities at higher yields in order to drum up demand.
But for the next month supply should not be a problem, dealers said, because the Treasury is not expected to sell anything other than short-term bills until the next two-year and five-year note sales in late March.
In addition to the good auction results, market participants said an article in The Washington Post yesterday also helped prices.
The article said that a deadlock in Congress over a fiscal stimulus package seemed increasingly likely.
"The possibility that the tax package will fall apart is one the market will embrace very strongly," the trader said. "Fear of what might come out of Washington has been a big reason why rates have been backing up for the last six weeks or so."
 
Market Called Cheap
 Analysts at MMS International, an economic information and service company, noted in their daily market commentary that "without the threat of a potentially inflationary, deficit-ballooning fiscal plan to worry about, this market looks very cheap at current levels."
Traders said that demand was strong for all types of fixed-income securities. But analysts cautioned against reading too much into the market's performance.
"There has been a two-month downtrend, and we are clearly not out of the woods yet," said Dana Johnson, chief money market economist at the First National Bank of Chicago.
"But it strikes me that with the inflation outlook as good as it is, a long-term investor can still take a shot in owning bonds."
Bond prices posted the biggest advance in the secondary market for Treasury securities.
By late in the session, the 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 10125/32 , up more than 1 1/8 points, to yield 7.84 percent, compared with 7.94 percent late Tuesday.
Among Treasury note issues outstanding, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 101 1/4, up 7/8 point, to yield 7.31 percent. The 6 3/8 percent seven-year notes were offered at 9623/32 , up 17/32, to yield 6.98 percent. And the 5 3/8 percent two-year notes auctioned on Tuesday were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 5.34 percent.
 
Rates Move Lower
 Short-term Treasury bill rates moved sharply lower.
Three-month bills were offered late yesterday at a discount rate of 3.92 percent, down 10 basis points, or 10 one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by eight basis points, to a late offered rate of 4 percent. And one-year bill rates fell by 10 basis points, to a late offered rate of 4.15 percent.
Activity in the investment-grade corporate bond market was highlighted by a number of utility company financings.
Among the issuers was Duke Power, which sold a total of $275 million worth of first mortgage bonds at three maturities through an underwriting group led by Merrill Lynch & Company.
Thirty-year bonds offered as part of the package were priced to yield 8.66 percent. Twelve-year securities were priced to yield 8.082 percent and seven-year bonds were priced to yield 7.533 percent.
All parts of the issue are noncallable for life. The securities are rated AA-2 by Moody's Investors Service and AA- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
 
New York City Offer
 In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, the Metropolitan Transporation Authority in New York City offered $250.58 million worth of securities through underwriters led by Bear, Stearns & Company.
Serial bonds offered in the financing carry yields from 4.85 percent on securities maturing in 1996 to 6.45 percent on bonds maturing in 2007.
Term bonds with maturities of 2010, 2018 and 2022 were also sold with yields of 6.55 percent, 6.62 percent and 6.58 percent, respectively.
The issue is insured by the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company, and is rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
The big rally in the Treasury securities market helped prices of outstanding investment-grade corporate and tax-exempt bonds.
Corporate traders said that prices of most issues rose by 1/2 point to 3/4 point in very active trading.
Participants in the municipal bond market said that prices of most widely quoted issues rose by about 1/2 point.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Backed for Another Term

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26

 BODY:
Despite the complaints of many senators that the Federal Reserve had moved too slowly to end the recession, the Senate Banking Committee voted overwhelmingly today to confirm Alan Greenspan to a second four-year term as chairman of the central bank.
The vote was 20 to 1, with Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, casting the vote against. 
 "I have been continually asking the Fed to lower rates," Mr. D'Amato told reporters as senators entered the committee's hearing room to cast their votes. "They should have been lowered long ago. There has been a lot of unnecessary pain."
Mr. D'Amato said that while the Fed had cut interest rates, though less aggressively than he would have liked, the central bank had failed to end the tight credit situation in which banks have been reluctant to lend.
"The intended result, to make credit available, has not happened," Mr. D'Amato said. "That has been failure by the regulators and the Federal Reserve. This is my way of sending a message."
The full Senate still has to vote on reconfirming Mr. Greenspan, and committee officials said no date had yet been set for the vote.
Today's Senate Banking Committee vote was also to confirm the Fed chairman to his first full 14-year term on the Federal Reserve Board.
On Tuesday, Mr. Greenspan told the committee that the Fed's interest rate cuts were starting to work and that a recovery should begin in the second quarter.
The Banking Committee's chairman, Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, voted to confirm Mr. Greenspan. When the Fed chairman testified before the committee Tuesday, Mr. Riegle said regarding Mr. Greenspan's reconfirmation: "If there were a public referendum," the people "might well vote you out, deservedly or not, and the Fed out because they don't see the policies working. Our obligation is to have policies that work, not policies that might work or policies that, you know, given enough time and patience, have the chance of working."

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart Has Record Year; Neiman Marcus Profit Slips

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Defying the recessionary downturn that has plagued most other retailers, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the discount giant that is now the nation's largest retailer, yesterday posted record sales and profits for the 1991 fiscal year after ending the year with a quarterly earnings gain of 25 percent.
Profits for the year that ended Jan. 31 were up nearly 25 percent on a 35 percent sales gain. Much of the sales increase came as a natural result of the rapid growth of the chain, which added 207 stores in the year. But even considering only stores that had been open a year or more, Wal-Mart sales rose 10 percent for the year and 9 percent for the crucial fourth quarter. 
 At the other end of the retailing spectrum, the Neiman Marcus Group, the specialty retailer, posted slightly higher sales but lower profits for its second fiscal quarter, indicating a lackluster holiday season.
 
Wal-Mart
 For the fiscal year, Wal-Mart earned $1.61 billion, or $1.40 a share, compared with $1.29 billion, or $1.14 a share, in the 1990 fiscal year. Sales rose to $43.9 billion from $32.6 billion.
Profits for the year's final quarter, which included the holiday selling season, were $602.4 million, or 52 cents a share, compared with $481.8 million, or 42 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 30.8 percent, to $13.6 billion from $10.4 billion.
The strong results came as little surprise to industry analysts, because Wal-Mart's sales have increased an average of 32 percent a year since 1985.
"It's a company that continues to be on the go," said Walter Loeb of Loeb Associates. He predicted Wal-Mart would have "a very strong year in 1992."
He pointed out that Wal-Mart, which is based in Bentonville, Ark., was just beginning to move into the heavily populated New York metropolitan region with stores in New Jersey and Connecticut.
In addition, the retailer has turned its attention to the high-volume, low-margin grocery business with the introduction of Supercenter stores.
Wal-Mart "will gain share of market from other retailers," Mr. Loeb said. "That's, of course, very exciting for the company but very disturbing for the rest of the industry."
Wal-Mart stock rose $2.375 a share yesterday, to $53.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.
While the billionaire founder Sam Walton, 73 years old, is battling a form of bone cancer, Wal-Mart executives have no plans to slow the pace of growth. The company plans to open another 160 Wal-Mart stores, adding Idaho, Washington and Oregon to the 42 states where the chain already operates, a spokeswoman said.
 
Neiman Marcus
 At Neiman Marcus, earnings fell 20.8 percent, to $11.4 million, or 12 cents a share, in the quarter that ended Feb. 1, compared with $14.4 million, or 25 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose slightly, to $541.2 million from $539.4 million.
The company's president and chief executive officer, Robert Tarr, said that mail-order operations showed some strength, but he was cautious about prospects for a spring upturn.

HEADLINE: In the House, Taxes and Posturing

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26

 BODY:
The election campaign came to the floor of the House of Representatives today as both parties used their tax bills to argue about who cared most about the middle class and who wanted to stimulate economic growth.
Republicans argued for President Bush's short-term agenda, featuring a reduction of taxes on capital gains to 15.4 percent from 28, as a measure that would produce more jobs. "It will put Americans back to work and preserve the jobs of Americans already working," said Representative Bill Archer of Texas. 
 Democrats maintained that their bill, with a tax credit of up to $400 a year for working couples, was essential to make the tax code fairer and help the middle class. "Vote for the working men and women of this country," maintained Representative Butler Derrick of South Carolina.
 
Back and Forth
 Each side spent at least as much energy attacking the other proposal as defending its own.
Republicans said the tax increases in the Democratic bill would retard or prevent economic recovery.
"Democrats destroy jobs," said Representative Robert S. Walker, Republican of Pennsylvania. The second- ranking House Republican, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, said Democrats were hoping the recession could be prolonged so their candidates could prosper.
Democrats argued that the Republicans only wanted to help the rich and were foolish to think that cutting their taxes would lead them to create jobs.
"The President tells the middle class to wait for the trickle-down to start," said Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who heads the Ways and Means Committee. But, he said, "after a full decade of waiting, they're not even damp."
 
Senate Action Tuesday
 Today was the day for debate, largely political and only incidentally economic, and no important votes were scheduled to be held before Thursday. Mr. Bush's plan is sure to be defeated and the Democratic alternative is very likely to be adopted.
The Senate Finance Committee is scheduled to begin trying to write a bill of its own next Tuesday. Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Denmocrat who heads that committee, said today that he would seek to raise individual income taxes, though not as much as the House bill does, to pay for a tax credit for children.
Because President Bush has insisted he will veto any bill that includes an increase in tax rates, and the Democrats have made that a price for a change in capital gains taxes, there is doubt on Capitol Hill that any new tax provisions will become law this year.
But before the question of whether a bill will become law is joined, the House has to finish with the measure. Democrats expect to pass it, although they have to contend with attacks from their own ranks that their capital gains proposal goes too far in helping the rich, and by others who say both bills are political stunts.
"Either one is certain to make things worse in the long run," contended Representative Anthony C. Beilenson, Democrat of California. And Representative Jim Cooper, Democrat of Tennessee, commented, "Pollsters wrote these bills, not businessmen or economists."
 
A Gephardt Proposal
 The only vote taken today came on a political stunt, a version of President Bush's overall tax proposal introduced by the Democratic floor leader, Reprsentative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri.
The Gephardt bill omitted the spending cuts in areas like Medicare and tax increases on such difficult areas as annuities, which Mr. Bush had proposed to pay for changes like an increase in tax exemptions for children. He introduced it to show that hardly anyone would back the sum of Mr. Bush's proposals, and the House made his point today, voting the bill down 427 to 1.
The political point of the Democratic measure was underscored today when the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced that it was going to start running television ads advocating its middle class tax cut in states with Presidential primaries coming up in the next few weeks.
The ads show men in tuxedos, more or less passed out, while a voice proclaims: "In the 1980's, Republicans threw a big party. Only the rich were invited."

HEADLINE: Durable Goods Orders Rose by 1.5% in January

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26

 BODY:
Orders to factories for durable goods rose 1.5 percent in January, the Government said today. The report was seen as a fresh evidence that the once-stalled economic recovery may be starting to pick up.
Analysts also pointed to the recent increases in retail sales, including automobiles, and growing housing activity as other signs of an improving economy. 
 "We're now starting to see the resumption of the recovery, which may have started in the spring a year ago and stalled out in the fall," said Lynn Reaser, an economist with the First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles.
"We're seeing the first glimmers of a revival in January," said Stephen S. Roach, an economist with Morgan Stanley & Company in New York. "It's another tentative sign of an improved economic outlook in 1992."
 
'Robins on the Lawn'
 The Bush Administration also hailed the January increase as one of several indicators pointing to an economic rebound.
"I see robins on the lawn in the economy now," Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said in a speech to the National Association of Business Economists.
Mr. Brady cited increased purchases of tires and light bulbs as signs that spending was picking up.
"I went out last weekend and bought two new tires," he said, adding that many Americans likely would do the same because they had put off such purchases and now, "this country's tires are bald."
But many analysts caution that economic growth will be below average and will not result in any substantive improvement in employment for months.
Orders for durable goods -- usually expensive items like cars and computers expected to last more than three years -- totaled a seasonally adjusted $119.6 billion in January, according to the Commerce Department.
The chairman of the Federal Reserve board, Alan Greenspan, told Congress last week that the Fed had seen signs that orders continued to rise in early February.
They had plunged 5.1 percent in December after gains of six-tenths of 1 percent in November and 2.7 percent in October.
Ms. Reaser of First Interstate said the new gains in orders should "prompt a bit of a turnaround on the production front in the next several months." She added, "It's the kind of ammunition we need for a recovery in the spring."
 
Looking to Consumers
 But Mr. Roach of Morgan Stanley said he placed "a lot more credence" in automobile and other retail sales because they measure what consumers are doing rather than what they are saying. Consumer spending represents two-thirds of the nation's economic activity and is considered necessary to sustain any recovery.
The January orders advance was led by gains of 6.3 percent for industrial machinery and equipment and 1.2 percent for transportation equipment. Excluding the transportation sector, orders were up 1.6 percent.
Analysts were particularly impressed by a 4.3 percent gain in non-military capital goods orders excluding aircraft. With aircraft included, the gain was 9.1 percent.
"This indicates an emerging recovery in equipment investment," contended Gordon Richards, an economist with the National Association of Manufacturers.
Often-volatile military orders plummeted 21 percent. Excluding this category, which represents about 7 percent of the total, orders rose 3.6 percent.
Shipments of durable goods, a measure of current production, increased 1.1 percent. It was the ninth increase in the last 10 months. But unfilled orders slipped three-tenths of 1 percent, the fifth consecutive decline. These orders measure whether plants and manpower are able to keep up with demand.

Wells Fargo Debt Rating Cut

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 26

 BODY:
Moody's has downgraded nearly all the debt of Wells Fargo & Company, voicing concerns about the bank's commercial real estate loan portfolio.
The action by Moody's Investor Services Inc. on Tuesday came only weeks after San Francisco-based Wells Fargo added $700 million to its reserves for losses against bad loans. 
 It was also the latest in a series of downgrades for California's third-largest bank since the spring of 1990. Wells Fargo has a higher proportion of real estate and construction loans than many leading institutions and has been hit hard by the recession.
Moody's reduced its rating of Wells Fargo's long-term senior debt to Baa-1, a mediocre rating, from single A-2, an investment grade rating. Moody's highest bond rating is Aaa; the lowest is C. The agency also downgraded the bank's commercial paper, or short-term debt, to prime-2, the middle of three grades, from prime-1.
The action affects about $4 billion of the bank's $4.2 billion in debt and could make it more expensive for the bank to borrow.

Tambrands Official Promoted to President

BYLINE: By KIM FOLTZ

 BODY:
Tambrands Inc. announced yesterday that Charles J. Chapman had been promoted to president and chief operating officer of the company, which specializes in personal-care products like Tampax tampons.
Mr. Chapman, who was also elected to the board, will be responsible for Tambrands' worldwide operations. The company, based in White Plains, does business in 135 countries. Previously he had been executive vice president, in charge of Tambrands' business in North and South America. 
 "Charlie Chapman is a strong, hands-on operating executive," said Martin F. C. Emmett, chairman and chief executive. "He has proven his ability to increase profits in our established markets and to establish sound businesses in our developing markets."
Tambrands, the leading producer of feminine-hygiene products, holds 60 percent of the domestic market for tampons. Sales last year were $660.7 million, compared with $631.5 million in 1990. In recent years the company has sold two of its businesses -- the First Response brand of home pregnancy tests and Physicians' Formula, a hypo-allergenic makeup line -- in the company's efforts to concentrate on its core business. Aside from tampons, Tambrands also sells disposable diapers and other infant-care products in a limited number of markets.
Mr. Chapman, who is 53 years old, has extensive experience in consumer products. Before joining Tambrands in 1989 he spent most of his career as a marketing and general-management executive at Chesebrough-Pond's, and at RJR Nabisco, where he was president of Nabisco Brands North America.
He received a bachelor of arts degree in economics from Dartmouth College and an M.B.A. in marketing from the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration.
Mr. Chapman lives in Weston, Conn., with his wife, Kristin.

Dollar Declines in the U.S.; Gold Prices Mostly Lower

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar declined on profit taking in domestic trading yesterday after posting gains overseas.
Gold prices were mostly lower worldwide. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $349.60 an ounce, off 20 cents from Tuesday. The Republic National Bank said gold was unchanged at a late bid price of $349.50 an ounce. 
 The dollar advanced in foreign trading overnight, building on its impressive move upward in the previous session. But analysts said it had begun to falter slightly when the Malaysian central bank stepped in and sold dollars for German marks.
The move was considered speculative rather than an attempt to influence the direction of trading, said Randolph Donney, research director at Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J.
When activity shifted to domestic markets, the dollar was initially supported by a Commerce Department report showing orders to United States factories for durable goods rose 1.5 percent in January. The report represented a rebound from the biggest drop in more than a year just a month earlier.
But the dollar failed to sustain any advance, and traders quickly stepped in to take profits.
"There might be a slight change of sentiment that the dollar can't go higher, and traders might be looking to test the downside," said Bob Morrissey, a senior dealer at the Bank of Boston.
Trading was moderate.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 129.73 yen, up 0.41 yen from Tuesday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 129.70 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 129.20 yen, down from 129.90 yen on Tuesday..
In London, the British pound fell to $1.7460, from $1.7560 late Tuesday. In New York it cost $1.7550 to buy one pound, more expensive than Tuesday's $1.7380.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's rates, include: 1.6453 German marks, down from 1.6595; 1.4935 Swiss francs, down from 1.5065; 5.5920 French francs, down from 5.6410; 1,234.75 Italian lire, down from 1,245.25, and 1.1789 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1860.

HEADLINE: GlenFed Uncertain on Profit

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: GLENDALE, Calif., Feb. 26

 BODY:
GlenFed Inc. said today that it might fail to post a third-quarter profit and likely would not be able to meet Federal standards for financial soundness.
GlenFed, which lost $232 million last year, blamed the same factors battering many other California savings and loans for its problems: the recession and the lingering slump in the real estate market. 
 Despite help from accounting changes, the parent of the Glendale Federal Bank said in a statement that profitability for the quarter ending March 31 is "in question."
Further, the company said it was "unlikely" the bank would be able to meet the new, more stringent Federal requirements for capital reserve, which is the cash cushion against losses.
If GlenFed fails to meet the new standard, it could be required to submit a capital plan to regulators or consent to other regulatory action.
GlenFed, however, took advantage of newly approved accounting techniques, allowing it to meet Federal capital requirements as of the end of 1991. The new rules also allowed GlenFed to restate its second-quarter earnings from $20.5 million to $27.6 million.
GlenFed has 214 bank offices in California, Florida and Washington state. Its shares lost $1.875 each on the New York Stock Exchange today, closing at $7.125

HEADLINE: Newark Unveils Arts Center Design

BYLINE: By SHEILA RULE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, Feb. 26

 BODY:
The architectural design for the first phase of a proposed $200 million arts complex near Newark's central business district was made public today by the New Jersey Performing Arts Center.
The first building of the complex, an ambitious Lincoln Center-like arts plaza that is intended to stimulate growth in Newark's downtown area, includes a 2,700-seat multi-purpose theater, a 500-seat hall for repertory, concerts and lectures, two restaurants, banquet rooms and a gift shop. At the center of the complex will be a new public plaza called Theater Square. The comprehensive master plan for the arts complex, in preparation for more than a year, was designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and James Stewart Polshek & Partners. 
 The design represents the first major East Coast performance hall to be built in more than 30 years. Lawrence P. Goldman, president of the arts center, said at a press conference at the Newark Museum that the objective behind the project was to "take New Jersey and the City of Newark and stand them shoulder to shoulder with Kennedy Center in Washington and Lincoln Center in New York and say we are equal partners in this cultural mission on the East Coast."
Barton Myers, the Los Angeles architect appointed in 1990 to create the design, said that his mandate had been to create a facility that was an elegant and beautiful "beacon on the city." The design's focal point is a brightly lighted grand rotunda that dominates the intersection of Center Street and Park Place. Its terra cotta and glass facade will rise 85 feet above the street, with an extended canopy to protect theatergoers in bad weather. The architect describes the concept as a "small village of separate structures in keeping with the scale of the 18th- and 19th-century fabric of Newark."
The design is also intended to convey a feeling of festiveness and drama, with banners hanging from the facade and a warm glow of interior lights shining through expanses of glass. Stone and patterned brick were chosen to lend the building a sense of permanence amid the surrounding cityscape.
"We were looking for a building that was really about excitement, coming together, festivity in the performance arts, a building that expressed that," said Mr. Myers, as he showed slides of his design in the art museum's auditorium.
 
Two Deadlines
 For the first phase of development, which is scheduled for completion in 1995, $140 million will be needed. Half of that sum is for the multi-use hall; the other half is for site work, including the construction of the plaza and the refurbishing of an existing 1,100-space parking garage. The second phase of the plan, construction of the concert hall, is budgeted at $60 million and scheduled for completion in 1998.
Corporate and other donors have pledged $45 million so far. The Federal Government has committed $1.2 million for the planning and design of Theater Square, and the State of New Jersey has sold $21.5 million in bonds through the Economic Development Authority to pay for the acquisition of the 12-acre tract in downtown Newark between Military Park and Route 21 and adjacent to the Passaic River, and for work on the site. Gov. Jim Florio, who attended the press conference along with Newark's Mayor, Sharpe James, said he had proposed an additional state commitment of $40 million in his State of the State message last month. He focused on the arts center as a potential stimulus for growth in the state's largest city, which suffered major losses in employment and population over the last several decades but which is undergoing something of a revival.
"People know there are no easy answers for restoring economic opportunity to our state or nation," Governor Florio said. "It takes hard work and it takes something else equally important. It takes common sense and a common purpose. That's what this project is about."

HEADLINE: New British Magazine Denies That Youth Must Be Served

BYLINE: By SUZANNE CASSIDY

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 26

 BODY:
Its logo is a triangular British road sign that features two stooped elderly people, one with a cane. It promises to "out" people who lie about their age. It hopes to be very politically incorrect and has started by calling itself The Oldie.
The Oldie, a new biweekly magazine, wants to be a sort of Rolling Stone for the graying set. Mixing humor and rant with serious reportage, it wants to do battle with the cult of youth. To borrow a phrase from Huey Lewis and the News, a group few at the magazine would have heard about, The Oldie wants to make it hip to be square. 
 "I call it hip replacement -- putting hip into old," said Emma Soames, formerly the editor of Tatler, now deputy editor of The Oldie.
Being an oldie, explained the publication's founder and editor, Richard Ingrams, is less a question of age than of state of mind. In an interview at the appropriately creaky central London building where The Oldie has its offices, the 54-year-old Mr. Ingrams, who was the editor of the naughtily satirical Private Eye magazine for 23 years, cited Barbara Bush as a singularly "good oldie."
The First Lady, he said, accepts her age and the body shape that has come with it. President Bush, on the other hand, is not in Mr. Ingrams's view an oldie, but rather, "a ridiculous man, going jogging all the time and trying to keep fit, and falling down because he's trying to keep fit."
Britain's population is aging, but its oldies, said Mr. Ingrams, are under siege. Youth culture used to be confined to magazines like New Musical Express and The Face; now, he said, national newspapers and even the British Broadcasting Corporation seem "obsessed" with what Mr. Ingrams and others have mockingly termed "yoof."
The Independent, a newspaper, Mr. Ingrams said scornfully, devotes "two whole pages a week" to pop music. Even conservative newspapers like The Daily Telegraph, which once were "a haven from that sort of thing," have become preoccupied with "sex, rock music and health."
Youth culture, Mr. Ingrams asserted, is not even a genuine culture. He said that pop music, for instance, "has nothing to do with art; it's just a big racket." The Oldie, he said, will try to win young people away from their "materialistic and consumerist" preoccupations.
 
Reaction Was Serious
 His magazine will also reach out, he said, to the "culturally isolated" older person, who "feels like a bit of a stranger in the modern world." There are, he noted, "oldie magazines in America, like Longevity and Senility and Senior Citizen." But he asserted, "they're pretty depressing, because they're like George Bush: they're telling oldies they've got to keep young and have sex every day and this kind of thing."
Unsurprisingly, considering its source, The Oldie started out as a joke. To Mr. Ingrams's astonishment, however, people took him seriously when he began to talk about the need for a magazine that would challenge the dominance of youth culture.
The publisher Naim Attallah, who owns Quartet Books, put up more than $122,000. Stephen Glover, former editor of The Independent on Sunday, invested about $21,000, as did Alexander Chancellor, the editor of Independent Magazine, the author and journalist Patrick Marnham, the writer John McEwen, and Auberon Waugh, editor of The Literary Review. Mr. Ingrams invested about $35,000 of his own, and set The Oldie's circulation target at 50,000 copies. For readers in the United States, an annual subscription costs $95; for people over the age of 100, it is free.
Despite the fact that he was starting a magazine during an economic recession that had well-established publications on the ropes, Mr. Ingrams commissioned no market research. "This whole youth-culture thing has come about because the media is being directed by marketing men," he said. "You've got to do what you think is good and then if people buy it, they buy it; if they don't, you pack up. You can't go out into the street and try to find out what people want, because they don't know until they get it."
What people will get in The Oldie is what Mr. Ingrams calls "old blood": columnists such as Germaine Greer, who in her recent book about menopause argued that women should spurn the Joan Collins route to artificial youthfulness. Ms. Greer "will be writing quite a lot about her life in the country," Mr. Ingrams said.
"It will take in politics as well, but basically it will be about her garden," he added. "She has all these geese."
 
Willing Participants
 Another of his recruits is Dame Barbara Cartland, the prolific novelist. Mr. Ingrams heard her being interviewed on the radio and "thought she was very sensible."
"She was attacking feminists and saying that men needed looking after," he said, "which was the thing that appealed to me."
Mr. Waugh, a right-wing journalist and a crony of Mr. Ingrams's from Private Eye, will write a column called "Rage." In the first issue, he announced the founding, concurrent with that of the magazine, of the Oldies' Association, "designed to be something between a trade union and a pressure group for the over-50's." Among the association's probable demands will be deference from younger police officers, the raising of the voting age to 35, and an end to the "laying off of over-50-year-olds to make way for the new generation of unemployables."
In addition to celebrity columns, there will be a number of regular features. "Still With Us" will profile a person everyone thinks is dead, but isn't. "The Good Film Guide" will note films that, as Mr. Ingrams put it, "are safe for oldies to see." "It couldn't happen here" will detail oldie crazes in the United States and elsewhere. And "Youthspeak" will highlight completely unintelligible and pretentious quotes from young people.
Another regular feature, "Modern Life," will try to explain to oldies those aspects of contemporary culture -- like why some men wear ponytails -- that they find puzzling.
 
Dissenting Opinion
 Julie Burchill, a columnist for The Mail on Sunday and founder of The Modern Review, a quarterly devoted to pop culture, said she found the first issue of The Oldie "disgraceful." Mr. Ingrams and his cohorts, she said, "were once famous for being young and irreverent," but were now comporting themselves like "babbling, senile morons."
"I think a little more growing-older-gracefully would be in order," said Ms. Burchill. "They are carrying on like malcontented adolescents who don't feel at ease with the world."
At least one self-confessed oldie disagreed. Andrew Hutchinson, managing editor of The Daily Telegraph, said he was "rather impressed" with the first issue of The Oldie, finding it "witty and entertaining" if somewhat lacking in "solid meat." Said Mr. Hutchinson: "I wish it well."
If The Oldie does indeed do well, it may be in for some competition.
Elisabeth Calder, publishing director at Bloomsbury Publishing Ltd., and Carmen Callil, managing director of Chatto & Windus, say that they are considering the possibilities of a rival publication titled Crone.

HEADLINE: ON PRO HOCKEY;
Random Notes on Random Rangers

BYLINE: By Joe Lapointe

 BODY:
A month with the Rangers leaves so many impressions, some perhaps debatable, including these:
THE LEADER: Mark Messier throws fewer body checks than ever before. Despite impressive statistics, his ineffective shifts are more than rare. But even when he seems exhausted and overworked, he pulls game-winning plays out of his back pocket the way a magician pulls quarters from your ear. It is impossible to understate the confidence he generates throughout the roster. These players revere him the way the Bruins did Bobby Orr.
THE REPORTER: John Davidson's Olympic hiatus was good for CBS, good for him and good for hockey on the national level. But he was missed on the air of the MSG network and in the corridors near the locker rooms at Madison Square Garden. Aside from Tony Kubek, what other former athlete takes his reporting role so seriously and does it so well?
THE FIGHTER: People who oppose fighting in hockey should hear the Garden crowd cheer and chant "Domi! Domi! Domi!" before and after Tie Domi throws punches. Some people go to the circus to see the clowns; some go to hockey to see the goons. No, that doesn't make it right. But when Domi is on the ice, he has everyone's attention, from the bench to the back rows.
THE CUSTOMERS: Speaking of back rows: When the league's best team is averaging more than 1,000 unsold seats a game for the season, and when tickets are unsold at the door for a high-profile team like Chicago, it suggests that hockey seats, in this economy, are priced too high for this market. Teams in smaller markets, with worse records and less advertising, draw a better percentage of capacity.
THE GOALIE: Where would the Rangers be without goalie John Vanbiesbrouck, who has started the last 12 games while Mike Richter has been injured? Vanbiesbrouck shakes off trade rumors, the occasional soft goal and the odd bad game with a mental toughness that is extraordinary.
THE IMPORT: Like many European players in their first North American season, Sergei Nemchinov seems to be tiring from the grinding number of games. After scoring 23 goals and 17 assists in the team's first 53 games, he has had only one goal and no assists in the last 11. He remains a diligent worker, but it is Darren Turcotte, with 25 goals, who is emerging as the No. 2 center. Will Nemchinov move over to the "checking line" and Turcotte go alongside Mike Gartner? The Rangers' depth is only adequate at this position and don't be surprised to see a fresh face, perhaps Rob Zamuner, getting a longer look there in the next few weeks.
THE FACILITY: There are minor league buildings with better ice surfaces and better press boxes than Madison Square Garden, but there are few pro teams in any sport with a better public relations department than the Rangers. Still, no amount of news-media savvy and sophistication can put a positive spin on unsafe work conditions for the players and a substandard work environment for the press. Hockey knockers in the news media who say this great sport is a bush-league business need not look any further than the most famous rink in the biggest city.
THE PLAYOFFS: Despite their undeniable success this season, the Rangers are hardly guaranteed playoff success. They still don't match up well with the Washington Capitals, who have a 4-2 record against them this season after bouncing them from the first round in six games last spring. This time, the Rangers could last four rounds or leave in four games. Impossible? Look up last spring's records, which showed the Blackhawks first over all in the regular season and among the first to exit in the first round of the post-season.
THE TRADING DEADLINE: General Manager Neil Smith now admits it was a mistake last spring to acquire Joe Kocur at the trading deadline and put pressure on him to be the enforcer. It damaged the chemistry of the team, as a major slump followed. Will that experience inhibit Smith at this year's March 10 trade deadline?
THE FUTURE: The Rangers might not be the team that pries Eric Lindros from the Quebec Nordiques, but it won't be for lack of effort. Their interest is frequent and serious, backed with money and players. As a junior, Lindros displayed a bubble-gum card of Messier on his locker. They became friendly at the Canada Cup last September. Now that he is 19 years old and much maligned, Lindros needs someone such as Messier as a mentor. The Rangers will be among the finalists in the bidding.

Comeback Coming

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
To the question on the cover of U.S. News "How Weak Is Bush?" -- G.O.P. voters of South Dakota replied: weaker than any sitting Republican President since Hoover. With nobody else on the ballot, Mr. Bush was actively disdained by one-third of his own party's voters. That's not weakness; that's decrepitude.
Here's the comeback scenario: 
 1. The Unilateral Tax Cut. Mr. Bush proposed cutting the capital gains tax by half. Democrats have called this helping the rich at the expense of the poor; they see class war when what is really being waged is generational war: cutting taxes on property profits helps older people, who have more unrealized profits, versus younger people, who earn more but vote less.
When the Democrats pass a tax bill that reduces middle-class taxes a pittance and soaks the rich, Mr. Bush will veto it and campaign against raising anybody's taxes.
Then, on March 20, the "deadline" he gave Congress for a signable bill, he will zing in a smart bomb. He will reduce capital gains taxes the Presidential way -- by unilaterally adjusting the cost basis of computing profits.
The President has the power, by penstroke, to adjust for inflation the cost of a taxpayer's property. Done prospectively, it would be a nice incentive to invest in companies or buy property; done retroactively, indexation would slash taxes of longtime homeowners beyond the present $125,000 exemption, and would induce holders of stock to sell, re-invest and pay the reduced tax.
As Democrats confuse voters with tax jiggering that goes nowhere, Mr. Bush would say "no new taxes" and take credit for having cut capital gains taxes by himself. While Democrats prattle about the middle class, Republicans deliver results to the middle-aged.
As a result, no election-year tax bill will be enacted, which is fine: the recession will be ended by low interest rates and the huge deficit stimulus now in place. Thus will sheer demagoguery be the handmaiden of sound policy.
2. Bracketing the Democratic Convention. A President has this political weapon: the ability to use his schedule to dominate the news.
In early July, he will focus our attention on his use of foreign clout to create domestic jobs. Japan's Miyazawa will pay a state visit, concessions in hand. Then they go off together to the economic summit in Munich, where our major trading partners will want to help their friend George get re-elected.
Then comes the Democratic Convention in New York, with highlights- only coverage by the broadcast networks, bracketed the following week by an all-stops-out state visit by Boris Yeltsin to sign the historic S.D.I. Cooperation Agreement. (A follow-up with Ukraine's President Kravchuk would help shore up ethnic New Jersey if the visitor promises to forget Mr. Bush's infamous "Chicken Kiev" speech.)
Democratic Convention? What convention?
3. The Springtime Surprise. Iraq's Saddam Hussein is the bone in Mr. Bush's throat, gaining strength for a bloody comeback as a gulf power. Libya's Muammar el-Qaddafi is building mass-destruction facilities as he harbors his killer terrorists.
And the North Korean dictator Kim Il Sung, we are warned by our Director of Central Intelligence (who does not want to repeat the agency's mistake in Iraq), is only a few months away from producing a nuclear bomb. We cannot expose our 39,500 troops in South Korea to a nuclear strike; if plutonium production at Yongbyon is not stopped, either we take our troops out, or take out the new threat they face.
Does it strain credulity to suggest that at least one of these three dictators is going to get zapped? I think not. Certainly the ground is being prepared by the White House for decisive action to end threats of mass destruction. That non-political purpose is serious, but the political fallout cannot be overlooked.
How weak is Bush?
If he feels he must raise some taxes to mollify Congress; if he fritters away his power to control the summer calendar, and if his stern warnings to three dictators about threatening the peace turn out to be empty posturing -- then, and only then, would President Bush reveal himself too weak to deserve re-election.

HEADLINE: Do We Spend or Save To Get Out of This?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Layoffs Called No Big Threat to a Recovery" (front page, Feb. 9) suggests that the recession's real danger is not that 2.9 million jobs have been lost, causing enormous suffering in many parts of the country, but that the job losses are frightening working Americans. Economists you quote bemoan that Americans seem reluctant to emulate the Federal Government by reaching for their credit cards and going on a spending spree with money they do not have. 
 This seems ironic in light of the same day's "Attention America! Snap Out of It!" (Business section), which quotes a consensus among economists that our "economic ills" can be cured if Americans save more and make long-term investments. So, if we try to consume our way out of the recession, will we make our economy sicker?

HEADLINE: SKIING;
Slopes Now Offer Discounts Plus Fun in the Sun

BYLINE: By JANET NELSON

 BODY:
For many skiers, spring brings an automatic reaction: pack away the skis and move on to other activities. But experienced skiers know that spring is the time to get serious.
"The irony is, in spring, when skiing is the best, skiers stop skiing," said Marilyn Hertz, a Camelback, Pa., skier who leads groups on spring trips to the Rockies and Europe. "It's then that the days are longer and sunnier. You can ski without bulky clothing. You might also get a big snowfall for powder skiing."
 
The Price Is Right
 
 Another reason to ski in March and April is that the price of lift tickets goes down, sometimes way down. And often, these bargains last until the end of the season in mid-April.
For instance, skiers from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island can ski free at Sunday River, Me., from March 23 to 27. All that is needed is a driver's license to prove residency in one of those five states.
"We know there are areas that New Yorkers can get to faster," said Skip King, Sunday River's director of public relations, "but we want people in those regions to try our area."
Free skiing has been offered all season at Brodie Mountain, Mass., to anyone who is unemployed, and will continue until the area closes. The region has been hit by layoffs and so far about 200 people have taken advantage of the program.
 
Loyalty Is Rewarded
 "I think people will pay for their lift tickets when they are back to work," said Matt Kelly, the manager of the area. "Most people are basically honest, and this will develop their loyalty to Brodie."
Loyalty is also rewarded at Stratton Mountain, Vt., where frequent-skier cards, which are purchased for $25, reduce the normal price of a lift ticket -- $39 on weekends and holidays, $32 midweek -- by $10 each time you ski. In addition, those skiers who have used the ticket 10 times during the season can ski midweek for $15 a day. Beginning in April, the reduction for all frequent-skier card holders climbs to $15 a day.
 
Valuable Coupons
 Coupons on Mountain Dew soda bottles are worth 20 percent discounts on midweek tickets at 29 New York ski areas, including Belleayre, Gore Mountain, Holiday Mountain, Hunter Mountain, Ski Windham and Sterling Forest.
Using the American Express card to purchase $100 worth of lift tickets can bring skiers a $25 restaurant certificate at ski areas across the country. Among the areas in the East participating in this program are Gore Mountain, Whiteface, Catamount, Ski Windham, Hunter and Cortina Valley, N.Y.; Bromley, Smugglers' Notch, Stratton, Killington and Mount Snow, Vt.; Vernon Valley and Craigmeur, N.J., and Brodie, Butternut, Jiminy Peak and Otis Ridge, Mass.
In addition to the discounts described above, most ski areas in the Northeast will be celebrating their own ode to spring with special bargains on lift tickets and accommodations in the coming weeks. Areas usually continue to make snow, weather permitting, and groom trails, but in some cases not all trails will be open and not all lifts will operate.

HEADLINE: United Way Head Is Forced Out In a Furor Over His Lavish Style

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
The president of the United Way of America was forced out of his job today as leader of the nation's largest network of charities, caught up in a wave of anger over disclosures of high expense-account living and questionable management practices.
Although the executive committee of the organization's board said it had asked the president, William Aramony, to stay on until a replacement was found, it accepted his "thoughtful and sensitive offer to retire immediately." At least one board member told associates that Mr. Aramony would take a vacation or leave of absence within days, and was unlikely to return. 
 Many leaders of United Way affiliates had called for his resignation or announced that they would not pay future dues until the problems were rectified. A number of those leaders said after the resignation that they were still not satisfied and would continue to withhold dues until investigations were complete.
The carefully coordinated statements of a lawyer leading an investigation for the board and a leading board member included praise for the organization and thanks for Mr. Aramony's contributions. But they also expressed regret that the disclosures about his $463,000 salary-and-benefits package and his penchant for luxury travel might have led to a loss of trust among local affiliates or their donors who contribute $3.1 billion a year to United Way drives.
But the statements avoided specific admission of wrongdoing or mismanagement, although Berl Bernhard, the lawyer conducting an investigation into the allegations, conceded to the group's affiliates that there had been "sloppy recordkeeping" and "inattention to detail" in the management of the national headquarters.
The United Way, a network of 2,100 local chapters, obtains most of its contributions through workplace donations from employee checkoffs. Chapters in cities and counties pass much of the money on to local charities. About 1 cent of each dollar donated to 1,400 of the local chapters -- a total of $29 million -- goes to the United Way of America, which helps the affiliates with everything from advertising to training of charity workers from its headquarters in Alexandria, Va.
For two weeks, news reports, beginning in The Washington Post and Regardie's magazine of Washington, have focused on details of Mr. Aramony's salary and benefits and of spending, including two trips on the supersonic Concorde aircraft and his use of chauffeured cars. The reports infuriated local volunteers and charity workers, many of whom are in financial straits as a result of the recession.
 
Bitterness Comes Out
 The bitterness among the 2,100 local affiliates was evident in questions asked during an hour-long closed-circuit television conference this afternoon. "What I've not heard, honestly, is an apology," said Jay Smith, head of the United Way of Georgia and publisher of The Atlanta Journal and Constitution. "Do you think, Mr. Aramony, that we're owed one?"
Wincing slightly, Mr. Aramony raised his head, looked at the camera and said: "Well, Jay, you absolutely are. I do apologize for any problems my lack of sensitivity to perceptions has caused this movement."
In a letter to his board dated Wednesdasy, Mr. Aramony said: "I now intend to retire immediately from the United Way of America. I do this because media attention is overshadowing the importance of the work of the United Way."
It was not clear if the resignation, which apparently will allow Mr. Aramony to continue on salary for a time, would appease the local workers.
 
Questions Left Unanswered
 The sense that important questions remain unanswered was evident at a press conference after the resignation.
LaSalle D. Lefall Jr., a Howard University surgeon who heads the board's executive committee, said that the committee "has looked at every charge that has been raised and wants to be sure we can assure everyone that we are committed to doing what was right for the United Way movement."
Richard A. Flores, president of a United Way affiliate in Northern California, said he thought Mr. Aramony had done "the only thing he could do."
"It is simply not possible for me to rationalize to people down here the type of spending that was taking place," Mr. Flores added.
Mr. Bernhard, a partner in the Washington law firm of Verner Liipfert Bernhard McPherson and Hand, said a "preliminary investigation" undertaken late last year at Mr. Aramony's request when the first questions arose found "no misapporpriation, no embezzlement, no fraud, no finding of diversion by Mr. Aramony for his personal enrichment."
Among the other questions left open after the flurry of activity today were the following:
*How fast could the board's search committee, headed by Thomas F. Frist, the chairman and president of Hospital Corporation of America, find a replacement for Mr. Aramony? Mr. Aramony, 64 years old, was scheduled to retire in July 1993.
*Would Mr. Aramony be allowed to take his full retirement benefits? "We haven't looked at that," Mr. Bernhard said.
*Would the local affiliates seek a greater say in the management of the national office?
 
Board of the Elite
 A second investigation by Mr. Bernhard is scheudled for completion by April 2, when a report will be submitted to the board. Mr. Bernhard said the report's objectivity would not be compromised by the fact that a former member of the law firm had served as general counsel of the United Way of America.
None of the local volunteers interviewed expressed any anger at the governing board, which set Mr. Aramony's salary. Neither Mr. Leffall nor any other board member indicated that they believed his salary was excessive.
Others on the governing board, whose members serve as volunteers, include the chairman, John F. Akers, chairman of the International Business Machines Corporation, and such prominent executives as James D. Robinson 3d, chief executive of American Express Compnay; Edward A. Brennan, chief executive of Sears, Roebuck & Company, and W. R. Howell of J. C. Penney.
Several issues that had been a simmering source of discontent for months among some local affiliates and some of the more than 170 employees at headquarters were the hiring of Mr. Aramony's friends and acquaintances and the decision in the mid-1980s to create spinoffs -- both nonprofit and for-profit agencies -- to market goods and services to thousands of local charities. Among the sources of recent resentment were the purchase of an Upper East Side apartment in New York and a Florida apartment by United Way spinoffs.
One disclosure that may have brought special pain to Mr. Aramony was the revelation that the national headquarter's chief financial officer, Thomas J. Merlo, had legal and financial difficulties in Florida that had prompted Mr. Aramony to put him on leave with pay, pending negotiation of a severance agreement. The two men have been friends since both were United Way volunteers in Florida nearly three decades ago.
And Mr. Aramony's son, Robert, has been president of one of the profit-making spinoffs, Sales Service/America, a discount-purchasing company that marketed low-cost office equipment to charities.
Mr. Aramony conceded that Partnership Umbrella Inc. once consulting fee to his son.

QUAYLE CRITICIZES NEW YORK AS PROOF OF WELFARE'S ILLS

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
Vice President Dan Quayle traveled to New York yesterday and declared the city proof of the failure of the welfare state.
"The liberal vision of a happy, productive and content welfare state hasn't even worked on 22 square miles of the most valuable real estate in the world," he said in a speech to the Economic Club of New York. 
 Mr. Quayle said the city showed what happens when people put too much faith in the benevolence of government as a solution to social problems. "In man's economic life, the state may be an uneasy ally, but I don't think it's ever a friend," he said. [Excerpt, page A18.]
 
A List of Problems
 Addresssing the club members during a dinner at the New York Hilton at Rockefeller Center, Mr. Quayle recited a list of New York's problems, including high city and state taxes, a large number of people on the welfare rolls and a high drop-out rate for students enrolled in public schools.
Mr. Quayle delivered his comments in a state where he and President Bush do not have to worry about being outflanked on the right by Patrick J. Buchanan. Mr. Bush's opponent will not be on the New York ballot in the Republican primary.
Mr. Quayle's stinging words were greeted with support from his audience but anger from several city and state officials, who mainatin that the last two Republican administrations were responsible for the severe budget crunch.
Mr. Quayle's comments sounded like the campaign themes that he and President Bush would have used against Mario M. Cuomo if the New York Governor had run for President. Even as a noncandidate, Mr. Cuomo is extremely irritating to Bush Administration officials, and they love to assail him and his policies.
"Predictably, the Republicans feel more comfortable with negative attacks because the alternative would be to highlight their own record on which they are most vulnerable," said Anne W. Crowley, press secretary to Mr. Cuomo. "But they cannot talk about the problems of any city in the nation without acknowledging their own failures."
In response to a question at the dinner, Mr. Quayle said he would welcome an opportunity to run with President Bush against a Democratic ticket headed by Governor Cuomo.
"Mario's not running," Mr. Quayle said. "But if he does run, it would be a lot of fun." Mr. Quayle predicted that if Mr. Cuomo does run for President, "one of the first states to vote to re-elect President George Bush will be the State of New York."
 
Emphasizing Welfare Rolls
 Bush Administration officials say the President and Mr. Quayle intend to emphasize welfare as a political issue in this election year, on the assumption that voters from middle-income families will be hostile to generous welfare programs at a time of economic difficulties in the United States. In his State of the Union Message last month, Mr. Bush said: "Welfare was never meant to be a lifestyle; it was never meant to be a habit; it was never supposed to be passed from generation to generation like a legacy. It's time to replace the assumptions of the welfare state and help reform the welfare system."
In an impassioned speech at Harvard University two weeks ago, Mr. Cuomo urged the Bush Administration not to exploit welfare as a political issue. Overheated talk about public assistance "would appeal to and feed a sad, corrosive instinct for negativism and divisiveness," the Governor said.
 
Criticism From Officials
 Leland Jones, Mayor David N. Dinkins's press secretary, said: "I think it's regrettable that Mr. Quayle appears to want to out-Buchanan Buchanan. For if the Bush-Quayle vision worked, the Kurds would not have been driven out of their homeland, and the American economy would not have been driven into depression."
State and local officials have acknowledged many of the problems mentioned by the Vice President but say much of the blame belongs to the Reagan and Bush Administrations, which have cut Federal aid to cities at a time when a host of new urban problems were requiring them to provide a vast array of new services.
New York, the officials often note, suffers a huge balance of payment deficit with the Federal Government. An annual study conducted by the office of Senator Daniel P. Moynihan, the New York Democrat, last year found that the state in fiscal year 1990 suffered the fifth-largest deficit with the Federal Government in the country, sending Washington $21.2 billion more than it received. That was $1,178 per New Yorker. By contrast, New Mexicans enjoyed a surplus of $2,776 per capita, a total of $4.2 billion.
A spokesman for Mr. Moynihan, a national authority on welfare, said the Senator did not want to comment because he had not studied Mr. Quayle's speech. The Senator is to introduce a bill Friday aimed at reducing welfare dependency, which creates a cycle of poverty by sapping the initiative of welfare recipients to become productive members of society.
But the Vice President's comments were praised by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican, who is making "welfare cheats" and what he calls the state's exceedingly generous welfare provisions a centerpiece of his effort to win re-election.
"Unfortunately the Vice President is right and everyone knows it except Mario Cuomo," he said.
Mr. Quayle's comments came in a wide-ranging speech in which he hailed the end of the cold war, supported free trade, opposed protectionism, defended President Bush's economic recovery plan and denounced Democrats in Congress as supporters of high taxes.
Earlier today Mr. Quayle visited the office of America Works, a company that has placed 2,500 welfare recipients in jobs at banks, law firms, insurance companies and other businesses.
The Vice President praised America Works as a "fantastic example" of market-oriented solutions to the problems of unemployment and poverty. He said the Administration wanted to spend $20 million next year to support such job placement operations.
 
Public Money Helped
 Mr. Quayle did not mention that America Works got its start in New York with money and support from the State Department of Social Services. "The Cuomo Administration initiated America Works in New York City," said Peter Cove, founder of the company. "The Department of Social Services pays us to get people off welfare."
Lee A. Bowes, the chief operating officer of America Works, said the state saves money because it pays $5,000 to her company to help arrange a job for a welfare recipient, as against $15,000 for a year's worth of welfare benefits and related assistance.
America Works is the only private company the state of New York pays to help welfare recipients find jobs. It will place about 400 workers this year, a tiny proportion of the 170,000 welfare recipients who are required to participate in work or training programs.
The state pays the company $5,400 for each welfare recipient who holds the job for at least 90 days. City officials praise the company, but note that it is a relatively expensive program.
"They do get people jobs, which is no small feat," said Catherine Zall, deputy commissioner at the city's Human Resources Administration.
 
New Surges in Welfare
 After showing little growth for almost two decades, the nation's welfare rolls now surge to record levels each month, in part because of the recession. In October, more than 13 million Americans were receiving benefits under the main Fedeal-state welfare program.
In a meeting with journalists in New York City today, Mr. Quayle acknowledged that "we have a sluggish economy." Indeed, he said: "Jobs have been lost rather than created. We have not been as successful in creating jobs in the last few years as we had hoped."
Liberal economics may be popular in New York, "but it sure doesn't work here," Mr. Quayle said.
"In what should be a liberal paradise, what do we find instead?" Mr. Quayle asked. "Honest, ambitious, hard-working New Yorkers struggling to pay the highest local taxes in America, about $1,600 per person. A business tax three times greater than that paid by businesses in Chicago and Los Angeles. One in every eight people on the dole. Taxpayers investing $7,000 a year for each public school student, compared to $3,000 per student in private schools.
"When the taxpayers meekly protest these high taxes, the liberal deep-thinkers snap back that we lack 'compassion' for the working man. But the working man is usually the one most hurt by this kind of thinking."
Mr. Quayle said the liberal vision of a welfare state had failed, in New York and elsewhere, because it was based on false premises.
"You don't build economic strength by taxing economic stength," said Mr. Quayle, the scion of a wealthy family in Indiana. "If you tax wealth, you diminish wealth. If you diminish wealth, you diminish investment. The fewer the investments, the fewer jobs."
"What a tragedy it would be if America were to lead in the triumph of free-market capitalism" around the world, "only to lose faith in it ourselves," he said.

HEADLINE: HOUSE DEMOCRATS APPROVE TAX CUT FOR MIDDLE CLASS

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
House Democrats barely held together today to win the first battle of the election year over taxes, passing a middle-class tax cut that instantly became a political football for both parties.
No one present contended that the bill, adopted on a vote of 221 to 209, had much chance to become law in anything close to its present form. But its vitality as an issue was shown when President Bush immediately attacked the House for rejecting his growth program in favor of "tax and spend policies." He renewed his threat to veto the bill. 
 But the passage of the measure also kept alive the Democratic argument that their party was for the middle class and Mr. Bush was not. It also avoided the political debacle of failing to pass anything when the President had demanded action by March 20.
 
A Big Sales Job
 Mr. Bush opposes the measure because it would pay for its tax credits of up to $400 for working couples by raising the maximum tax rate on high-income individuals from 31 to 35 percent. His own program, emphasizing a cut in taxes on capital gains, was spurned earlier by the House on a vote of 264 to 166 that followed party lines closely but not exactly.
House Democratic leaders did their most energetic sales job in months, with Speaker Thomas S. Foley and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, working intensely on the telephone to swing the last few members into line. They argued that whatever the imperfections of their bill, it was better for the House, and the Democrats, than inaction. [Roll-call, page D4.]
 
Action Moves to Senate
 Many Democrats said they considered the tax cuts ineffectual, and others thought the bill's provisions to index capital gains for inflation were too generous to the rich. But an even stronger reason for opposition, especially among members uncertain about their new districts, was the risk of voting for higher taxes at all.
The margin was nowhere near veto-proof strength, and in the Senate, the indications are that a smaller tax break for the middle class and smaller increases on the rich are likely to be considered. Action there starts on Tuesday in the Finance Committee.
Voting for the House bill were 219 Democrats, one Republican and one independent; 163 Republicans and 46 Democrats voted against it, but some of those Democrats were prepared to back the bill if their votes were essential.
One member of the task force for rounding up votes, Representative Donald J. Pease of Ohio, said that at 10 A.M. today Democrats had only 198 sure votes. "I'd say the last 30 votes came in because of personal phone calls from Gephardt and the Speaker," he said.
Throughout the debate, Democrats argued that their measure would make the tax code fairer to the middle class and "return to the time-honored tradition of taxing people according to their ability to pay," as Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, maintained.
The tax cuts in the bill would cost $79.5 billion over six years. Higher tax rates, principally on higher-income individuals, would raise $93.5 billion, permitting the leadership to present the measure as having the additional virtue of reducing the deficit overall.
Here are the main provisions of the bill:
*The main break for the middle class is a tax credit equal to one-fifth of a worker's Social Security and Medicare taxes, up to limits of $200 for individuals and $400 for working couples. Those limits would be reached by individual workers with about $13,000 in wages, and by couples with about $26,000. The credits would cost $45.9 billion.
*The current maximum individual rate of 31 percent would be raised to 35 percent for individuals with taxable income over $85,000 and couples with taxable incomes over $145,000. That would raise $53.6 billion over six years.
*A 10 percent surcharge would be imposed on taxes attributable to incomes over $1 million, a provision that would affect about 60,000 people. That would raise $10.5 billion over six years.
*In a change both in tax law and in philosophy, Democrats voted to index against inflation gains on any items acquired after Jan. 31 of this year, so that only that part of the profit that exceeds increases in the Consumer Price Index would be subject to tax. Another provision would cut the maximum capital gains tax rate from 28 to 14 percent on stock in small businesses held at least five years.
 
Fairness Is Issue
 Democrats called their bill the "Tax Fairness and Economic Growth Act of 1992," but they talked more about fairness than growth. "Stand up for the people we represent," Mr. Gephardt said. And Representative Robert T. Matsui, Democrat of California, said that the individual income tax changes "won't have an effect on growth, but will have an effect on equity."
But there were other elements in the bill designed to stimulate the real estate market and economic growth more generally, with several provisions taken from Mr. Bush's bill.
Those included an extra 15 percent of first-year depreciation for plant and equipment purchased after Jan. 31, penalty-free withdrawals of up to $10,000 form individual retirement accounts for purchases of a first home, or for educational or medical expenses, and an easing of "passive loss" tax rules for real estate professionals.
Democrats contended that their bill was consistent with the spirit of the 1990 budget agreement because it was balanced over six years. But they acknowledged that it was not balanced, year by year, as the 1990 act required, and wrote a waiver of that act's provisions into the bill.
The budget act problem was one primary focus of Republican attacks today. Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the minority leader, argued that the budget agreement was "the only defense this country has against the majority's voracious spending habits."
 
'Ridden With Gimmicks'
 But Democrats made a similar assault in the debate on Mr. Bush's program. Representative Thomas J. Downey of Long Island said the bill was "ridden with gimmicks" in accounting changes provided to make it fit within budget act boundaries.
Mr. Bush's bill emphasized a cut in the maximum tax on capital gains from 28 to 15.4 percent, along with the accelerated depreciation provision and the real estate measures.
Representative Bill Archer, Republican of Texas, called it "pro-growth, pro-housing, pro-savings, pro-job and pro-fiscal responsibility." Mr. Michel said a provision for a $5,000 tax credit against the purchase of a first home would create 700,000 new jobs.
The capital gains proposal, he said, "unlocks old investments," adding that it provided "the small-business community with start-up capital -- and small businesses are where most of the new jobs are created in our economy."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
Moving Toward a Crucial Round, Presidential Contest Turns Rough

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
Gov.Bill Clinton lashed out at former Senator Paul E. Tsongas today for "coldblooded" economics, while Mr. Tsongas accused Mr. Clinton of distorting his record and being too hot-tempered under fire.
The exchange marked a day when the candidates' gloves were off, their moods were snappish as the Presidential campaign lurched toward a critical round of primaries and caucuses this Tuesday in Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, Idaho, Utah and Washington. 
 Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska also kept up his criticism of Mr. Clinton's explanation of his draft record during the Vietnam War, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson was suddenly, and accidentally, reinserted into Presidential politics.
Any semblance of collegiality was gone in the Democratic race and the Republican primary struggle was, if anything, even rougher.
Patrick J. Buchanan broadcast television commercials in Georgia that accused President Bush of financing "pornographic and blasphemous art" through the National Endowment for the Arts. The advertisement was denounced today by Charles Black, a senior adviser to the Bush campaign as "another in a series of blatant lies."
 
Clinton a Target
 Mr. Black suggested that a counter-strike was coming, and no one was surprised.
Mr. Clinton was the most popular target among the Democrats, and with the campaign moving toward his home turf in the South, he fought back today with some of the most slashing language he has used on the stump.
"If you want more corporate power with less accountability, if you want somebody who talks tough but acts easy on the people at the top of the totem pole, you should vote for Senator Tsongas," Mr. Clinton said in Denver. "I am tired of what is coldbloodedness being passed off as courage," Mr. Clinton added, referring to Mr. Tsongas's claim to be the economic truth-teller in the race.
One of the key points of distinction between the two men is their stance on a tax cut for the middle class. Mr. Clinton supports it as a matter of fairness, while Mr. Tsongas opposes it, saying it might be good politics but calling it a bad policy that will not help the economy or curb the deficit.
Mr. Tsongas, campaigning in Denver, shot back, in what seemed like a reference to Mr. Clinton's draft record, "Is Bill Clinton now our resident expert on courage?"
 
Kerrey on Clinton
 Mr. Kerrey was in Florida today, trying to keep alive his dispute with Mr. Clinton over the latter's draft status during the Vietnam War. "I've tried to be sympathetic with Bill Clinton's problems, and all the other Americans who made the decision in conscience not to go to Vietnam in the 60's," said Mr. Kerrey, who lost part of his leg in Vietnam and won the Medal of Honor there. "It was a difficult time. But I find myself not believing that he really wanted to get in, but couldn't."
Mr. Kerrey, who has used the draft issue to attack Mr. Clinton's ability to beat Mr. Bush in the general election, added, "Electability was a question that Bill Clinton raised. I'm now saying on that question what everybody privately is saying."
Mr. Clinton has denied accusations that he sought to avoid the draft, but Mr. Kerrey and others have questioned his account that in the fall of 1969 he made himself eligible for the draft and did not try to manipulate the system to avoid it.
Today, Mr. Clinton chastised Mr. Kerrey and asserted the Nebraskan was questioning his patriotism. "I love my country," he said. "I love and support the idea that people are willing to serve it in uniform."
 
The Jesse Jackson Issue
 The pressurized atmosphere led, inevitably, to the kind of stumble Mr. Clinton made Wednesday night that brought him into conflict with Mr. Jackson.
The Arkansas Governor, who was giving a series of interviews to local television stations, was asked by a reporter about Mr. Jackson's campaigning in South Carolina with Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa Mr. Clinton apparently and mistakenly understood this to mean that Mr. Jackson had endorsed Senator Harkin. Between interviews, in remarks that the Governor did not know were picked up by a waiting crew -- and which were later broadcast by a Phoenix, Ariz., television station -- a furious Mr. Clinton told his aide, "It's an outrage, it's a dirty, double-crossing, back-stabbing thing to do."
Mr. Clinton called Mr. Jackson to smooth things over today and later announced, "It's fine between us." Perhaps equally important, Mr. Clinton was in Atlanta today picking up the endorsement of Mayor Maynard Jackson, a formidable power in the region and a longtime ally of Jesse Jackson.In a statement today, Jesse Jackson, who accrued significant power in the Democratic Party with his past two drives for the nomination, seemed not entirely mollified.
He said he remained open to "offer advice and counsel to all of the campaigns," that he was "disappointed" by Mr. Clinton's remarks and that a meeting was in order. Still, the statement seemed more muscle-flexing than high pique, by Jackson standards.
Given the mood of the day, however, it did not take Mr. Tsongas long to try to turn Mr. Clinton's outburst about Mr. Jackson against the Governor from Arkansas.
Initially, Mr. Tsongas had to prompt reporters to ask him about the incident. After fielding several questions from local reporters in Seattle about his policies on bicycles and the spotted owl, Mr. Tsongas bluntly said: "Is someone going to ask me about the Reverend Jackson issue or should I just expound on my own?"
"I think the American people want a President who's cool under fire," Mr. Tsongas said once he got the question he wanted. "And that kind of instinctive, angry, emotional outburst, I don't think is appropriate." He added that the Clinton outburst "gave the American people a pretty good look into what a person does under stress."
Senator Harkin, meanwhile, asserted, "Do we want as a President someone who on the basis of a rumor flies off at the handle, vehemently making statements on the basis of a rumor?"
Mr. Tsongas, who held a news conference in Denver this morning and traveled to Seattle later in the day, joined the crowd trying to cast themselves as the most "electable" candidate in the field, which is becoming the buzz word among Democrats who see a new vulnerability in President Bush this fall, and fear that their party will not exploit it.
Mr. Tsongas's differences with his party were on full display today, however, as he called on the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to stop running advertisements advocating a middle-class tax cut, which the Democratic leadership supports and Mr. Tsongas does not. A spokeswoman for the campaign committee said the advertisements were aimed at Mr. Bush, not Mr. Tsongas.
The Clinton campaign clearly hopes to make Mr. Tsongas's economic policies a vulnerability as the race moves toward more blue-collar areas. Mr. Clinton asserted today that Mr. Tsongas lacked a true understanding of the human side of the nation's problems.
"I believe that a President is more than an economic mechanic pushing buttons and pulling levers," Mr. Clinton said. "I reject that cramped and limited view of the Presidency. Franklin Roosevelt didn't get this country off its back by saying the only thing we have to fear is a lack of venture capital."
Mayor Jackson of Atlanta used his news conference with Mr. Clinton today to chide Democrats for attacking one another. "Please let's not end up with a nominee who is attacked by the other candidates and therefore is weakened when the time comes to take the fight to George Bush," the mayor said.
This was not, however, the theme of the day.

HEADLINE: New Dispute Roils Western Sahara: Who'll Vote?

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAAYOUNE, Western Sahara, Feb. 22

 BODY:
In this once-desolate landscape of dunes and sand walls, a vast and teeming tent city has sprung up in recent weeks as tens of thousands of people, mostly descendants of nomads, have gathered to take part in a United Nations-sponsored referendum on Western Sahara.
But it could turn out to be a long wait.
The referendum was supposed to end a 17-year conflict between Morocco and the Polisario Front, a Libyan- and Algerian-backed guerrilla movement. 
 Potentially at stake, too, Western diplomats here say, is the fate of one of the United States' strongest allies in Africa: King Hassan II of Morocco. The King has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the region and risked undermining the legitimacy of his monarchy in an effort to assert sovereignty over the territory.
 
U.N. Sends Troops
 A cease-fire began in September, and soon afterward a 375-member United Nations peacekeeping force took up positions in this harsh but mineral-rich expanse of the Sahel region west of the Sahara. Indigenous residents, called Sahrawi, were scheduled to vote in January on whether the territory would become an independent state, presumably governed by the Polisario, or be absorbed by Morocco as its heritage from precolonial times.
Moroccan analysts and foreign diplomats say the area would provide Morocco with a symbolic barrier against the encroaching Islamic fundamentalism in the region, in its Arab neighbors, Algeria and Mauritania, and to a lesser extent in Libya.
But the referendum has been postponed indefinitely and efforts to end the conflict have been stymied by an increasingly bitter dispute over who among the various nomadic herdsmen, who have ignored frontiers and roamed freely over this region for centuries, should be allowed to take part.
"The peace plan included a calendar, which was a guide, and that calendar normally would have seen an accelerated process, and let's put it this way, we're not there yet," said Gen. Armand Roy, the Canadian commander of the United Nations peacekeeping force.
Another United Nations official put it more bluntly: "It will be months, and perhaps even years, before this thing is finally sorted out."
The peace plan was proposed by Javier Perez de Cuellar in August 1988 when he was United Nations Secretary General and was accepted in principle by Morocco and the Polisario Front.
Both sides initially agreed that the voting would be based on the last official census, which was taken by the Spanish colonial authorities in 1974 and which counted 74,000 inhabitants in a territory about the size of Colorado.
But the Moroccans now insist that a second list of more than 120,000 additional Saharans should be qualified to vote. For one thing, the Moroccans say, the Spanish census took no count of the nomads who have traditionally roamed the region and who, for political or economic reasons, have settled in neighboring territories rather than within what was Spanish Sahara.
Meanwhile, they say, at least 30,000 Sahrawis have set up camp here and in nearby villages in hopes of voting. "It may take a month, or 20 years, but we'll still be here until this thing is settled and the Sahara is Moroccan again," said Mohammed Ould el Issaoui, a poet and camp leader. He is one of dozens of Sahrawis interviewed who said they believed that the region had always been part of Morocco.
 
View of Vote is Uncertain
 In truth, surveillance of visitors is so intense that it is hard to know what the 100,000 or so people in this desert outpost really think about the referendum.
Predictably, perhaps, Moroccan officials voice little doubt about the outcome of the vote. As for what would happen if Morocco were to lose the referendum, Salah Zemrag, the provincial Governor in Laayoune, said: "It's impossible to think that Morocco will not win. It's just inconceivable."
The conflict first erupted in 1975 after Spain handed over its former colony to Morocco and Mauritania. With backing mostly from neighboring Algeria, the Polisario movement began a guerrilla struggle for independence.
Meanwhile, Morocco annexed the northern two-thirds of the territory and took over the rest when Mauritania renounced its claim four years later.
The conflict also opened a deep rift within African politics, resulting in Morocco's withdrawal in 1983 from the Organization of African Unity after half its members voted to seat the Sahara Arab Democratic Republic, the Polisario's self-styled government in exile, as the territory's representative.
Since then, however, Polisario has fared poorly, at least militarily. The guerrilla group exercises limited control over only a sliver of empty desert along the territory's eastern and southern frontiers, Western diplomats here say. In 1980, Morocco began building what eventually became a 900-mile wall of sand and stone, punctuated with land mines and studded with barbed wire and electronic sensors, to keep Polisario guerrillas from infiltrating into the territory. And for the most part, that tactic has worked.
 
Algerian Move Hurts Rebels
 The Polisario has also been losing political support in Algeria, its main backer. In 1988, Algeria agreed to restore diplomatic relations with Morocco, healing a breach that began when the Western Sahara issue erupted.
Meanwhile, Morocco has strengthened its claim over the 102,703-square-mile territory, taking administrative control of all the towns and phosphate mines and the entire Atlantic coast.
In an effort to win over their desert subjects, the Moroccans have given them much. Local officials are eager to show off new school buildings, hospitals and housing and then contrast them with the dilapidated and boarded-up tin structures left by the Spanish.
The cost has worsened Morocco's domestic problems. The economy has fallen into a deep slump, in large part because of slack demand for phosphate but also because of the expense of keeping a Saharan-based force of 100,000 on a war footing. By some accounts, maintaining control over the territory is costing Morocco at least $100 million a year.

HEADLINE: Drug War to Widen on Same Budget

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN ANTONIO, Feb. 27

 BODY:
President Bush and six Latin American leaders ended a two-day conference on the drug problem today with promises to broaden the war on drugs, but with no pledges of more money to fight it.
Mr. Bush said at a news conference here that they had "established an aggressive agenda for the rest of the century" for battling drugs. The initiatives include new legal efforts to curb money laundering, international controls on the sale of chemicals used to manufacture cocaine and missions to Canada, Japan and Europe to involve the rest of the industrial world in the anti-drug battle. 
 But Mr. Bush was unable to satisfy demands by the leaders of the Latin American nations for more money and investment to create alternatives to the drug trade for their citizens.
"I don't want to be here under any false colors," Mr. Bush said. "We are operating at enormous deficits that concern the American people enormously. I mean, they are really concerned about the size of the deficit. So we don't have all the money to spend on all the programs that we think are worthwhile."
 
Frequent Requests for Aid
 A senior United States official at the meeting said later that requests for increased economic help were frequent at the meeting.
The leaders of Mexico, Colombia and Venezuela, the more industrialized Latin American nations at the meeting, generally called for new measures to increase their countries' exports to the United States, bolstering their economies and creating jobs at home.
The leaders of two less-developed South American nations here -- Peru and Ecuador -- pressed for outright grants to create new industries and agricultural markets in their countries to replace those now consumed by the drug trade. The Bolivian President, Jamie Paz Zamora, urged Mr. Bush to spur United States business investment in Bolivia to create jobs.
The aim of all six Latin American leaders was to provide new employment for thousands of peasants who now grow coca leaf or heroin poppies or otherwise earn their livelihood in the drug trade.
The United States now spends less than 5 percent of its $12.7 billion annual drug-control budget in Latin America, devoting by far the bulk to programs in the United States.
"Up to now, all our struggles against the drug traffic basically have been financed with Ecuadorean capital," said President Rodrigo Borja Cevallos of Ecuador, whose nation is just beginning to feel the full consequences of the drug trade. "But this financing is not sufficient."
President Alberto K. Fujimori of Peru, the most outspoken leader at the meeting, said that his nation had failed to curb production of coca leaves, the basic ingredient of cocaine, largely because of a shortage of money.
Mr. Fujimori was especially critical of Congress, which he said had stalled the release of United States anti-drug funds because of what he said were exaggerated concerns about human rights abuses by the Peruvian Army and police.
A communique issued at the conclusion of the meeting outlined a series of measures, largely legal and diplomatic, that the seven nations plan to undertake. They agreed to set up regional police training centers, to expand intelligence sharing and to tighten procedures for controlling light aircraft, ships and cargo shipments through international ports and free zones, all of which havae been used to advantage by drug smugglers.
They also pledged to modify banking and fiscal control laws within their own countries in an effort to curtail money laundering.
 
Annual Meeting Planned
 The seven countries -- represented by six Presidents and a lower-level delegation from Venezuela -- did not formally establish a hemispheric group to consult periodically on drug issues as some South American delegations had suggested, nor, after meeting stiff resistence from Peru, did they agree on specific goals for reductions in drug production, trafficking and consumption. They did, however, agree to send "high-level" representatives to an annual conference in the region.
Today's drug conference was far less dramatic than the first such meeting, two years ago, when leaders met in Cartagena, Colombia, to declare war on the cocaine industry.
United States officials have asserted in recent days that the price of cocaine has risen while its purity has diminished in the last two years because of the crackdown on drug cartels.
Other drug experts have said, however, that the overall outlook in the struggle against drug trafficking remains bleak. They say that cocaine prices have not risen measurably and may indeed have fallen, and that the supply of the drug in the United States remains as abundant as ever, especially in the face of falling demand.
