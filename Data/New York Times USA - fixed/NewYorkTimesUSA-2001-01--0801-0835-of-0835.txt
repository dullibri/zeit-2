HEADLINE: Why Fight the Surplus? 

BYLINE:  By Alice M. Rivlin; Alice M. Rivlin, an economist at the Brookings Institution, is a former director of the Office of Management and Budget and a former vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve Board.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Contrary to conventional wisdom, Alan Greenspan is not an oracle; he is a brilliant economist with certain political views. And that means when he speaks we should listen critically, sorting out the economics from the ideology. We would have done well to remember that last week, when Mr. Greenspan, in a meeting before the Senate Budget Committee, endorsed tax cuts.
 Monetary policy is the principal assignment of the Federal Reserve. Fed action is the best instrument for getting a slow economy back on a healthy growth track, and if the Fed's Open Market Committee reduces short-term interest rates by half a percent this week, as is predicted, it will be doing its job well, building on its move earlier this month to cut rates by a half-point and increasing the chances of restoring economic momentum in the second half of the year. 
 Tax-and-spending policy is not the job of the Fed. Hence, when Alan Greenspan endorsed an immediate tax cut before the Senate Budget Committee last week, he clearly stated that he was giving his personal views, not speaking for the Fed, and he has every right to do that. 
Moreover, Mr. Greenspan did not endorse the Bush administration argument that tax cuts are needed to rev up the slumping economy now or in the next few months. Indeed, he pointed out that Congress takes a long time to enact tax reductions, and that any cut could end up stimulating an economy that is already well recovered.
Instead, Mr. Greenspan's case for a tax cut rests entirely on his perception of a curious new danger -- the peril of zero debt. He is worried that if the federal government runs surpluses of the magnitude now projected by the Office of Management and Budget over the next decade, it will quickly pay off its debt by buying back its bonds. So it will then have to invest the surpluses -- but in what? Mr. Greenspan thinks the government should not own private or state and local securities, because politicians would try to influence investment decisions and end up investing in companies that might not be the most profitable. So he recommends an immediate tax cut to get the country on a "glide path to zero federal debt."
This proposal is weak on both economic and ideological grounds.
First, the projected surpluses are not guaranteed. These surpluses will occur only if steady high economic growth continues, and that in turn depends on the continuation of high productivity growth. If we wait a year or two, we will have a firmer basis for knowing whether the recent productivity growth can survive a slower economy and hence, whether the projected surpluses will in fact materialize.
Second, the zero-debt problem is temporary. The Social Security and Medicare trust funds account for most of the projected surpluses, and those will be drawn down quickly when the boomers begin retiring after 2011.
Third, the government, especially in its Social Security and Medicare funds, could own non-federal assets without political meddling. For instance, these accounts could hold index funds that by law could be well insulated from political influence.
Fourth, the zero-debt problem, if it exists, calls for reducing surpluses, not taxes. The problem could just as easily be solved by increasing government spending. Mr. Greenspan is a proponent of minimal government and personally prefers lower federal spending. But many of us see the urgent need for public action -- rebuilding crumbling schools, providing health coverage for low-income working families or improving Medicare benefits. 
Indeed, the partial privatization of Social Security -- a favorite proposal of the new president -- could be accomplished only with a large infusion of government money. After all, the government would still need to pay benefits already promised to older workers and retirees who would not benefit from privatization. These benefits could no longer be covered by the contributions of younger workers, who would have diverted at least part of their Social Security taxes into personal retirement accounts.
There is undoubtedly room for some tax cut -- preferably one focused on working families who need it -- but it would be foolish to rush into a large tax cut now to avoid the zero-debt problem. Why enact large tax cuts, only to find in a few years that we don't have the public resources needed to solve some of our country's most urgent and widely acknowledged problems?

HEADLINE: Daimler to Reduce Chrysler Work Force by 20% 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: AUBURN HILLS, Mich., Jan. 29 

 BODY:
The Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler A.G. announced today that it would reduce its work force by 26,000, or 20 percent, over the next three years, mainly by not hiring replacements for retired workers but also by laying off thousands of employees.
 Dieter Zetsche, the former Mercedes executive sent from headquarters in Germany two months ago to become Chrysler's chief executive and president, said the job cuts were necessary to restore Chrysler to profitability even as the auto market slows with the weakening of the American economy. "The markets are shrinking, competition is brutal, we are under pressure from imports and an incentive war is on," Mr. Zetsche said at Chrysler headquarters here today. 
 Chrysler officials declined to estimate the number of layoffs, saying that would depend on how many chose to retire first. But executives said the layoffs would include 3,100 factory workers in Mexico and South America, 2,500 white-collar employees in the United States and Canada and 1,800 white-collar contract workers, mainly here, in the northern suburbs of Detroit.
Up to 3,000 factory workers in the United States and Canada who have less than a year of seniority will also lose their jobs, said Gary L. Henson, Chrysler's executive vice president for manufacturing. But a contract with American and Canadian labor unions, signed in September 1999 at the height of Chrysler's prosperity, will shield most blue-collar workers there from the brunt of the job cuts.
Union leaders were critical today of Chrysler's plans. As recently as October, Chrysler officials were talking about expanding factories, said Jim O'Neil, secretary-treasurer of the Canadian Auto Workers union. "This came down on us pretty quick," he said.
Chrysler will not start laying off white-collar workers until early in March, after offering early retirement to 2,400 salaried employees and seeing how many accept.
Still, there were clumps of grim-faced engineers in the hallways of Chrysler headquarters today.
"Everyone's just wondering: is it me, is it me, is it me?" a Chrysler employee said.
Wall Street had been expecting job cuts of the size announced today, and a few analysts had suggested that the cuts might be even larger. In trading on the New York Stock Exchange today, DaimlerChrysler shares fell 95 cents, to $47.29.
Chrysler said it would close six factories, five of them in Mexico and South America. The sixth, in Detroit, is an outdated engine plant previously scheduled to be shut down, and Chrysler has already modernized two engine factories nearby and begun transferring workers to them.
It also said it would furlough thousands of workers indefinitely by canceling a shift at each of six factories in the United States and Canada, and by slowing assembly-line speeds at two more factories. But except for the workers with less than a year's seniority, Chrysler's labor contracts guarantee that furloughed workers continue to draw 95 percent of their after-tax, straight-time pay, excluding overtime, through a combination of state unemployment benefits and supplemental payments from the company.
As state unemployment benefits expire, typically after 6 to 12 months, Chrysler will provide all the payments necessary to maintain the workers' incomes at least at the 95 percent level until the current labor contract expires in September 2003. The company will rehire the workers in factories as more senior workers retire.
Before taxes and overtime, assembly-line workers with three or more years' experience now earn $45,000 a year; after-tax pay varies by the state of residence.
Mr. Zetsche said that roughly a quarter of Chrysler's 94,200 factory workers were eligible for retirement with full benefits if they chose to retire; American and Canadian workers become eligible after 30 years of work, regardless of age. Mr. Henson said that in recent years 3 to 5 percent of Chrysler workers had been retiring annually.
Until recently, Chrysler had been hiring workers to replace retirees. By contrast, General Motors has been installing automated systems and making other productivity changes while allowing workers to retire without being replaced. Gary L. Cowger, G.M.'s group vice president for manufacturing and labor relations, said in an interview earlier this month that his company's somewhat older factory work force had been shrinking by 6 to 7 percent a year. So the Chrysler plan announced today will produce only a slightly faster shrinkage of its manufacturing work force than one of Chrysler's main competitors is already achieving.
John S. Franciosi, Chrysler's senior vice president for employee relations, said the company had begun discussing with union officials a possible offer of incentives for workers to retire. Mr. O'Neil said the Canadian union wanted such offers so that older workers would retire and allow younger ones to keep their jobs. The U.A.W. had no comment, but has resisted retirement incentives in the past, fearing that workers will spend the money instead of saving.
Chrysler is in financial trouble partly because of decisions made after its acquisition in November 1998 by Daimler-Benz. Those decisions included continuing production of large numbers of an older version of Chrysler minivans right up until the new minivan went on sale last summer. Chrysler ended up having to sell huge numbers of the older model at deep discounts, leading to a $512 million loss in the third quarter and contributing to a loss in the fourth quarter that financial analysts estimate at $1.25 billion.
But Chrysler also made mistakes before the sale to Daimler, notably by expanding its work force and investing heavily in more expensive engines for which customers proved reluctant to pay extra. Mr. Zetsche said today that Daimler had no plans to sell Chrysler, and that Chrysler benefited from being part of a much bigger company as the American market weakens. "From a Chrysler perspective, the merger at that point in time is a very, very positive thing," he said.
Most American shareholders sold their stakes soon after the companies were combined. Many German shareholders, however, are angry that the value of their stock has tumbled by more than half since the days soon after the merger.
Chrysler's labor contracts, which run through September 2003, bar the company from any sale or closing of factories in the United States and Canada even if the market weakens. In case of a severe recession, the company can discuss factory closings with the unions.
Chrysler agreed to the deal because Ford was trying to spin off a high-cost auto parts division at the time and General Motors was seeking to shrink its manufacturing operations to match its dwindling market share. Once Chrysler approved the ban on factory closings and sales, the U.A.W. and the Canadian Auto Workers successfully insisted that Ford and G.M. accept the same terms in nearly identical labor contracts they signed a few weeks later.
Mr. Zetsche said today that the company had not proposed factory closings in talks with union leaders. "We did not intend to do something which would be rejected, and which we would have to withdraw," he said.

HEADLINE: Nudging Church-State Line, Bush Invites Religious Groups to Seek Federal Aid 

BYLINE:  By LAURIE GOODSTEIN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 29 

 BODY:
Flanked by an array of religious leaders, President Bush today signed two executive orders that throw open the doors of government to religious and community groups as part of a broad effort to refashion the way government delivers social services.
 The moment was not merely one of those "thousand points of light" photo opportunities favored by the former Bush administration, in which notable do-gooders were ushered into the White House for a presidential handshake and five minutes of recognition. 
 Instead, what the current President Bush promised religious leaders today was far more extraordinary, a new version of "reinventing government," with a religious cast. 
The move is likely to be applauded by many religious leaders and Americans who believe that faith has long been the missing ingredient in government programs for the homeless, drug addicts, prisoners, the mentally ill and the unemployed.
But it will undoubtedly stir up a barbed constitutional debate: about the government playing favorites with religions; about tax dollars spent on programs that discriminate in hiring and firing employees; and about how far public agencies should go in policing religious organizations that are accused of abuses. 
Mr. Bush named Stephen Goldsmith, a former mayor of Indianapolis, and John J. DiIulio Jr., a University of Pennsylvania professor, to White House posts that will scour federal agencies for every opportunity to lift regulatory barriers that previously prevented government money and contracts from being channeled to religious groups.
Mr. DiIulio will head the new White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, which will serve as a liaison to nonprofit groups and identify exemplary programs that can serve as national models. Mr. Bush also established centers at the Departments of Justice, Education, Labor, Health and Human Services, and Housing and Urban Development to ensure that they cooperate with religious and secular nonprofit organizations.
The president is expected to announce more details of his initiative on Tuesday at the Fishing School, a religion-based program for youth in Washington founded by a retired police officer. One of Mr. Bush's primary proposals is to allow all taxpayers to deduct charitable gifts, even those who do not now itemize deductions.
"When we see social needs in America," Mr. Bush said today, "my administration will look first to faith-based programs and community groups, which have proven their power to save and change lives." 
Mr. Bush's plan will meet resistance from civil libertarians, and even from some within religious organizations. 
"This is going to be an all-out battle," said Joseph Conn, a spokesman for Americans United for Separation of Church and State. "A lot of people see this as one of the biggest violations of church-state separation that we've seen in American history." 
It will not be a battle of the faithful versus the faithless. The administration may be surprised, critics say, when the battle is joined by some religious groups and whole denominations that sense danger ahead. They fear that when government officials start poring over proposals from religious groups, the government ultimately favors one program, and therefore one religion, over another. Mr. DiIulio said today that the White House would try to avoid such conflicts by using empirical methods to determine which programs have a track record of success.
"We will work with what is effective," Mr. DiIulio said in an interview, and added, paraphrasing the Bible, "And ye shall know this and us by our works."
Already, the White House's religious predilections are being scrutinized based on who was invited, and who not, to the meeting there today. In his comments, Mr. Bush repeatedly mentioned the diversity of the group. He was joined by five prominent black preachers and a Muslim imam. To his right was a Catholic nun, to his left an Orthodox Jew. Gathered behind him were about 20 Christian leaders and pastors, many of them evangelicals. 
The heads of most of the largest religious charitable agencies, including those run by Catholics, Presbyterians, Methodists and Jews, were noticeably absent.
One problem facing the administration is that Muslims, Catholics, Protestants and Jews only begin to represent diversity in the most religiously diverse nation on earth. Critics have asked how the White House office would look upon a proposal for financing from the Church of Scientology, which has long operated what it claims is a highly successful drug-treatment program, or the Nation of Islam, which works with African-American youth.
"If faith is that important, then you have to provide everybody with the services that correspond to their own particular faith," said Marc Stern, a lawyer with the American Jewish Congress. "But that's not how these programs work. The government one way or another picks its favorite provider. You can expect a lot of Baptist programs in Texas and few Mormon ones, and the opposite in Utah. So what does equality mean under those circumstances?"
Another sticky constitutional question that looms is how far the government can go in financing groups that base their program on a religious approach.
"Government should never fund religion," Mr. Goldsmith said. "It can fund the soup, it can fund the shelter, it shouldn't fund the Bibles."
Mr. Goldsmith acknowledged, however, that it would be difficult to detect groups that misuse government grants. "Is it possible to move the money on the other side of the line? Of course," Mr. Goldsmith said.
Some of the constitutional issues the administration faces are foreshadowed in the lawsuits filed against states since the start in 1996 of a provision in the welfare bill known as charitable choice, the legislation championed by John Ashcroft, then a senator from Missouri, that allowed religious groups to contend for government contracts to help welfare recipients adjust to the work world.
Texas, for example, gave $8,000 to the Jobs Partnership of Washington County, a program that required participants to study Scripture and taught them, in its own words, "to find employment through a relationship with Jesus Christ."
Now the state is being sued in Federal District Court in Austin by the American Jewish Congress and the Texas Civil Rights Project, which claim that the Jobs Partnership bought Bibles for students. In evaluation forms, a third of the program's students said they had been pressured to join a church or change their beliefs.
"The government was funding a program where religion is built into the warp and woof," Mr. Stern said. "Religious indoctrination is the essence of the program, and we think the essence of the First Amendment is that government cannot fund that sort of effort."
Another significant issue is that the White House initiatives, like the charitable choice rules, allow groups that receive government money to discriminate based on religion in deciding whom to hire and fire.
The Kentucky Baptist Homes for Children, which receives financing from the state, is being sued for firing one of its counselors after a picture of her at a gay rights parade appeared in a photography exhibit at a county fair. The agency said it had the right to dismiss an employee it did not consider an appropriate role model. The suit, now in federal district court in Kentucky, is being brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and Americans United for Separation of Church and State.
Mr. Bush made a point of saying today that religious groups that sought an entree to government would not be asked to abandon their principles.
"We will encourage faith-based and community programs without changing their mission," Mr. Bush said. "We will help all in their work to change hearts while keeping a commitment to pluralism."

HEADLINE: President Offers Plan to Promote Oil Exploration 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN and DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 29 

 BODY:
President Bush said today that he was "deeply concerned" that the power crisis was "spreading beyond the California borders" and vowed to make it easier for companies to explore, exploit and transport oil and gas for the production of more electricity.
 In a meeting in the Oval Office this morning, which the president described as the first in a series to deepen his involvement in energy issues, Mr. Bush named Vice President Dick Cheney to head a task force that he said would devise ways to reduce America's "reliance upon foreign oil" and to "encourage the development of pipelines and power-generating capacity in the country." 
 While Mr. Bush did not offer concrete proposals today to help California, he appeared to be using its acute electricity shortage to help sell a long-term national energy strategy he often discussed during the presidential campaign. 
He said he intended to act "boldly and swiftly" to enact his plan, which includes an effort to pass legislation allowing drilling in protected areas of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and granting waivers to states that seek to run older plants at full capacity -- even, administration officials said, if that means violating clean air standards. 
"There's a long-term issue as well, and that is, How do we find more energy supplies, how do we encourage conservation on the one hand and bring more energy into the marketplace?" Mr. Bush told reporters.
"And a good place to look is going to be A.N.W.R.," he continued, using the abbreviation for the Alaskan wilderness area. 
He added, "I campaigned hard on the notion of having environmentally sensitive exploration at A.N.W.R., and I think we can do so." 
Today's assignment puts Mr. Cheney at the center of an issue he knows well as the former chief executive of the Halliburton Company, the oil services giant. Halliburton and its rivals would all probably benefit from an aggressive government push to promote exploration and to weaken environmental controls.
Elements of Mr. Bush's plan will clearly face opposition from environmental groups and some Democrats in Congress. But just as predictions of rising government surpluses and the slowing economy gave a lift to his sweeping tax-cut initiative, the California crisis has aided Mr. Bush's efforts to sell an energy policy that in more normal times would probably have faced intense opposition.
Senator Frank H. Murkowski, an Alaska Republican and chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, said that the California situation had made people wake up to a looming energy crisis.
"With the previous administration we could not even get an acknowledgement that we had an energy problem in this country," said Mr. Murkowski, whose committee will hold hearings on Wednesday about California's electricity situation. "People are now starting to realize that if you just rely on outsiders for your energy you will pay the piper."
Some environmentalists criticized Mr. Bush's approach sharply, arguing that he used California as an excuse to push an oil industry agenda bearing at best an indirect relationship to the electricity troubles.
"It's just irresponsible to lead Americans to believe that new drilling in Alaska is going to have an impact on their electricity bills," said Adam Kolton, Arctic campaign director for the Alaskan Wilderness League. "Frankly, it does not even pass the laugh test. There's simply no link between the problems in California and the wildlife refuge."
Mr. Bush's 10-year, $7.1 billion energy policy focuses mainly on oil and gas development, not the shortage of power generation and bottlenecks in distribution that have contributed to the California crisis. He wants to offer tax incentives to promote domestic oil production, as well as ease restrictions on drilling for oil and natural gas in parts of the 1.5 million-acre Alaskan refuge. Fully exploiting Alaskan reserves would probably require building a pipeline to ferry natural gas to mainland markets.
Those steps would do little to relieve the acute shortage of electricity that has forced California to issue its highest electricity alerts for two weeks running, warning that power might be cut off at any moment to selected parts of the state. 
In an interview today, Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser, Lawrence B. Lindsey, also described a series of short- and medium-term steps that he said the administration could "encourage and help states to take."
Acting on requests from California and other states hit by high prices and energy shortages, he said the Bush administration could issue pollution waivers that "would allow older plants to come on stream" in peak periods. Such plants in California now pay fines when they operate, adding to the financial burden on utilities, which cannot pass the higher production costs on to consumers.
Power generating companies are staunch opponents of the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments, signed into law by Mr. Bush's father. The law sets deadlines for every city to meet health standards for air quality, though it gives states some flexibility in carrying out the standards. California has some of the nation's strictest air pollution control measures.
So far, California has not requested federal easing of environmental law, and Gov. Gray Davis has said that the state can extract itself from its electricity debacle without abandoning clean air targets.
But other states are seen as eager to allow some older, coal-powered plants to run for a longer time and might be eager to take advantage of a more flexible federal approach.
Mr. Lindsey also spoke of constructing new, higher-capacity transmission lines. "The governors in Utah and Wyoming tell me that they have excess power now, but they can't get the electricity to California," he said. Such construction, of course, is also likely to run into opposition from those who oppose the building of new lines. Similarly, gas turbine power could be increased in California, he said, but only with the construction of new gas pipelines.
"Every idea is a tradeoff," Mr. Lindsey said, noting that the current federal requirements that out-of-state utilities sell more power to California "is causing problems now in Arizona and Oregon."
Bush administration officials have not offered many concrete proposals to help California secure electricity supplies. They have argued that the problem stems from the state's botched effort at deregulation and that the solution lies within the state, where Governor Davis and the legislature are considering proposals to relieve the debt burden of utilities, to make consumers pay more and to let the state government arrange long-term purchases of power from independent generating companies.
Mr. Lindsey noted today that higher prices to consumers "would certainly encourage conservation." But he said that was a state decision. Moreover, Governor Davis fears that big increases in the retail price of electricity could prove politically disastrous for him.
Mr. Bush has largely stuck to his pledge to make California resolve its struggle without large-scale federal aid. He agreed last week to extend a Clinton administration emergency order that required power generators in neighboring states to use surplus generating capacity to supply California. But that policy is highly unpopular among those states, and Mr. Bush said it would not be extended beyond Feb. 7.
Mr. Bush said today that the electricity problem went well beyond California, though he did not propose measures to deal with power problems in other states.
Several states in the Northwest have complained repeatedly that federal orders to sell surplus power to California have forced them to drain water tables for hydroelectric plants, endangering their own energy resources and potentially damaging the environment.
Rates are also rising around the region. The Bonneville Power Authority, which has provided cheap electricity for decades to its Northwest customers, said it plans a 60 percent increase in rates over the next five years because of the ripple effect from California's problems.
The White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer, said today that Arizona had also suffered collateral damage because aluminum plants there were forced to shut down for lack of power. He said farmers in neighboring states were hit by power shortages as well.
"Energy represents approximately 6 percent of our nation's G.D.P., and the costs for consumers for energy are going up, nationally as well, of course, as in California," he said.
Along with Mr. Cheney, Mr. Bush's energy task force includes Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill; Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham; Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans; Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman and Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta. It is also to include the Environmental Protection Agency administrator-designate, Christie Whitman, and the Interior secretary-designate, Gale A. Norton.

HEADLINE: RESTAURANTS; 
Where Restraint Is Not on the Menu

BYLINE:  By William Grimes 

 BODY:
TUSCAN STEAK'S name says a lot about its intentions. In three compressed syllables, it manages to press two big pleasure buttons. Tuscany, which now has the power of an international brand, seduces with the promise of simple, accessible food and superb wine suffused with a romantic glow. Steak presents Americans with the food they love best: slabs of red meat.
 In a kind of green-card marriage, Tuscany has embraced steak for economic reasons, and the inconvenient fact that the signature dish at Tuscan Steak is not the famous bistecca alla Fiorentina, a very expensive cut from the increasingly rare Chianina cattle, is absolutely beside the point. The point is lots of Italian food, and even more meat, aimed at diners whose one, desperate desire when eating out is not to leave the table hungry. 
 As an equation, Tuscany multiplied by steak equals enormous crowds. Jeffrey Chodorow, the restaurateur behind China Grill, Asia de Cuba, Hudson Cafeteria and the Miami original of Tuscan Steak, knows how to get a turnout. You have to serve food, because, after all, it is a restaurant, but there's no reason to get obsessive about it if the design and concept are right. Mr. Chodorow is an astute observer. Like the studio moguls of yore, he knows how to read popular taste and cater to it. He knows how to put on a show.
As a piece of stage design, Tuscan Steak makes a powerful impression. Jeffrey Beers has transformed three floors of a former Midtown corner office into a high-energy social arena. There's more than a hint of the Four Seasons in the simple lines and soaring space of the main dining room, insulated from the street by a bronze silk curtain. The room is defined by a two-story wine wall at the back and a glass partition in the front, encasing blown-up photographs of Italian stone walls.
The piazza-like main room leads to a more intimate dining area with wraparound booths. The mezzanine bar and lounge, with invitingly intimate booths and tables, is one of the most civilized settings to have an aperitif that Midtown has seen in many a day. A second bar and lounge, on basement level, aims at a younger crowd, the demographic that doesn't mind back-and-forth restroom traffic.
The food is designed to render criticism null and void. It comes out of the kitchen with great efficiency, heaped high and spread wide. A lot of it is heavy-handed and overproduced. Some of it is quite good. And some of it is heavy-handed, overproduced and still pretty good, like the osso buco risotto with Barolo essence, big enough and rich enough to make four break a sweat. It's garnished with very large crostini layered with melted taleggio cheese. 
The restaurant has two signature dishes. The first is a basket of toasted bread slices daubed with white truffle oil and crusted with garlic. There's no point in resisting. The second is, of course, the steak, specifically, slices of T-bone brushed with olive oil and rosemary, then thrown on the grill and served with garlic puree. It's good. The servings are stupendous. A "grande" is 28 ounces. A "piu grande" tips the scales at 50 ounces, which is a little more than three pounds of meat. A hostess told me that only one customer has been witnessed finishing off a piu grande, a bodyguard in Miami.
At Tuscan Steak, you get the feeling that the cooks have been issued shovels rather than spoons. Restraint is not on the menu. A giant roasted lobster was perfumed with truffle-lobster sauce, propped up on an oversize pillow of basil mashed potatoes that looked like day-old guacamole, and showered with a dense layer of fried basil leaves. In a perverse way, it suggested Cleopatra on her barge. A few slaves waving palm fronds would have been appropriate.
Herb-grilled rack of lamb, not terribly flavorful, gets no help from a green-apple and basil chutney, a condiment that seems to belong with a different dish, perhaps in a different restaurant. A triangle of baked polenta was hard enough to chip teeth. Grilled salmon, topped with fried herbs, is mismatched with a blood-orange vinaigrette, charred apples and fennel. A veal chop in a sauce of grilled mushrooms and Marsala was dry and tough.
As often as not, pasta comes to the rescue. Puffy gnocchi in a simple Gorgonzola cream sauce, and not too many of them either, offer a welcome contrast to the more lavish productions on the menu. So does the potent, garlicky linguine with chopped clams, crushed red pepper and parsley. The bigger-gauge gnocchi that come with a tomato-basil sauce have an unpleasantly slimy quality, however.
When my table of six waffled on dessert choices, the waiter suggested a sampler platter. I envisioned little bites of this and that. The platter, just a little smaller than a surfboard, headed toward my table like a tableau of shame. Heads turned. Onlookers elbowed their dining partners and snickered. The platter turned out to be many full-size desserts assembled in one place. It looked like the Las Vegas Strip on a plate.
The triple-cream cheesecake led the assault. It was fluffy and velvety at the same time, a real killer, and the first one I took home lasted three days. Chocolate mousse had the taste and texture of a butter stick dusted with cocoa, and in fact all the chocolate desserts were dense and heavy. But the revisionist cannoli, wrapped in phyllo pastry and sprinkled with citrus sugar, shined. There were too many of them, of course. But at Tuscan Steak, more is more. Excess means success. And everybody seems happy with the formula.

Quirky Classical Beacon May Shake, Rattle and Roll

BYLINE:  By Stephen Kinzer 

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
For nearly half a century, lovers of classical music in the Chicago area have been turning to WNIB-FM (97.1) for eclectic and sometimes obscure programming. They hear live broadcasts of the Cleveland and the San Francisco Symphony Orchestras, interviews with contemporary composers and even, on April Fools' Day, broadcasts of a work by John Cage that consists of 4 minutes 33 seconds of silence.
 Occasionally the barking of one of three dogs that make the studio their home can be heard in the background while announcers cue up Bryn Terfel or Martha Argerich. 
 This mix of fine music and down-home warmth has been the station's trademark since it began broadcasting in 1955. It is still run by the same couple who started it, Bill and Sonia Florian, who virtually live in the studio and have made the station an extension of their own quirky preferences and personalities. 
But the station's long run as a beacon of classical music in the Midwest is apparently ending. The Florians, both now approaching 70, have sold it for $165 million to an out-of-town company that is expected to switch its format to pop music. 
"We do it with a lot of regret," Ms. Florian said. "Radio has changed so much in the 45 years since we started, and it's going to change more with satellite and Internet radio. It's becoming more of a business and much less a labor of love, which it was for us for a very long time. When you combine that with the price that was being offered and our sense that there's going to be a recession, we decided we should do it now."
When the Florians bought their station, the FM band was just beginning to fill up, and stations could be purchased cheaply. They paid $8,000 for theirs.
Later they bought a smaller station that transmits from north of Chicago, WNIZ-FM, a deal that allowed them to cover a larger area including southern Wisconsin. Both stations, which now simulcast to a total of about 350,000 listeners, are included in the sale package.
Prices for stations began rising steadily after the late 1950's, but they took a sharp jump after Congress amended the Federal Telecommunications Act in 1996 to ease restrictions on the number of stations that a single company may own. The couple turned down several offers in recent years but were finally persuaded to sell when they received the $165 million offer from Bonneville International Corporation of Salt Lake City, a company affiliated with the Mormon Church. Bonneville already owns 18 stations across the country, including three in Chicago.
The price is one of the the highest ever paid for a radio station in Chicago. Bruce Reese, Bonneville's president, said media companies like his competed intensely for the few stations that come onto the market.
"This is a good business with a nice margin, and it's in a period of consolidation," Mr. Reese said. "Americans are still in love with their cars, and radio is the medium of choice there. The new law gives companies like ours a chance to develop some scale."
Mr. Reese said his company had hired market researchers who are working speedily to determine what kind of format to program on WNIB. He said he would announce his choice after the Federal Communications Commission gave what was expected to be routine approval to the sale, probably in the next few weeks.
Although Mr. Reese said he had not ruled out keeping the station's programming, industry analysts said that format would not be nearly as lucrative as more popular ones. Bonneville owns one classic rock and two adult-contemporary stations in Chicago.
The demise of classical music on WNIB would reflect a nationwide trend. By one count, the number of commercial stations in the United States that offer mainly classical music has dropped to 37 today from 52 a decade ago. There are also slightly more than 100 nonprofit stations with classical formats.
In another reflection of this trend, the only commercial radio station broadcasting mainly classical music in Denver, KVOD, was recently sold. Its classical broadcasts ceased on Dec. 31.
Chicago is one of the few cities with two classical music stations. The second, WFMT-FM, is expected to continue with that format.
"Deregulation revolutionized radio and made the value of stations really astronomical," said Kal Rudman, who publishes a group of radio industry trade journals. "Now, with companies able to buy as many stations as they want, it's becoming very difficult for niche music like classical to survive."
"This certainly isn't a good trend for classical music in general, because when any kind of music disappears from the airwaves, that's more or less the end of it," Mr. Rudman said. "National spot advertisers want to target the age group from 25 to 54, and the classical audience is heavy with the over-55 group. It shows you again that this business is not about music. It's about advertising."
Mrs. Florian said she and her husband planned to use most of their newfound wealth to establish a foundation that would provide money "for the arts, for animals and for preserving habitats."
On a recent morning she sat at the station where she and her husband have spent nearly every day of their adult lives, looking at a brochure advertising a world tour of remote places. The stops include Katmandu, Ulan Bator, Vientiane and the ancient ruins of Petra, Samarkand and Angkor Wat.
"I've been hearing the names of those places all my life," she said. "They're faraway and exotic, and that's what I'm looking for now."

HEADLINE: More Than Just a Wrongful Termination 

BYLINE:  By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH 

 BODY:
Not long after Richard D'Sa went to work as art director for Playhut Inc., a California toy maker, he was asked to sign an agreement. If he left for any reason, the agreement stipulated, he would not work for a competitor for a year. In addition, he would give Playhut 30 days advance notice each time he changed jobs the next five years.
 Mr. D'Sa, the father of two young children, balked. What if Playhut laid him off, and he could not get a new job without breaching the agreement? Who would pay his bills? 
 Mr. D'Sa says he raised those questions but got only a deadline to sign for an answer. He refused, and Playhut fired him, on the advice of its outside human-resources consulting firm, the Worldtec Group International. Playhut thought it was on solid ground, since it had the right to dismiss anyone for any reason that was not banned by law.
But Mr. D'Sa sued the two companies in state court anyway. And last month, a state appellate court issued a ruling that not only gave him an unambiguous victory, but also threatened to blunt or even disable the weapon of choice of employers everywhere for stemming staff defections: broadly written noncompete agreements.
The court declared Mr. D'Sa's dismissal a wrongful termination that entitled him to sue Playhut for lost income, emotional distress and punitive damages. And while his case does not have a direct bearing on the enforceability of noncompete agreements -- after all, he never signed one -- employment lawyers said the judge's reasoning could have national reverberations.
"This case is a sober warning to any company that has standardized, multistate noncompete agreements," said Victor Schachter, a partner at Fenwick & West in Palo Alto, Calif., which represents management.
As it happens, there are many such companies. As labor markets have tightened and job hopping has increased, more businesses have turned to noncompete agreements to hold onto restless top performers and keep control of their trade secrets and client lists.
Before the economic expansion started a decade ago, such agreements were limited mostly to television personalities, Wall Street professionals and others with unusual skills. But now, employers are using them to rein in workers as diverse as computer engineers, car salespeople, hairdressers and security guards.
The agreements are often written very broadly, barring departing employees not only from taking colleagues with them or walking off with their client lists, but also from working for competitors or starting rival businesses.
Employment lawyers say many companies know full well such restrictions will not withstand court scrutiny, but figure the small risk of a legal challenge is well worth the rewards of cowing most employees into believing they are legally bound to stay put.
As the agreements have proliferated, though, so have the lawsuits. Many recent cases have involved former employees blocked from starting their own businesses. Last fall, for example, Gino and Emilio -- fashionable Pittsburgh hairdressers who use only their first names -- landed in federal court after they opened their own salon near the shop where they had mastered their trade. For three weeks, while they were enjoined from cutting their customers' hair, their plight was a local cause celebre.
Gino and Emilio settled out of court and returned to their swivel chairs, but other cases have continued to trial. And as long as the noncompete agreements are not overly broad, courts have generally been willing to enforce them. 
But Mr. D'Sa's case was different. Rather than signing a noncompete agreement and being sued after he quit, he failed to sign an agreement and sued his employer after being fired. A California trial court threw out his wrongful-dismissal complaint, but he appealed, and a three-judge appellate panel reinstated it.
The appellate court found that in California, at least, noncompete agreements violate "public policy" and are therefore illegal. A California statute specifically states that contracts restraining people "from engaging in a lawful profession, trade or business of any kind" are void.
Playhut's lawyers had argued that like most Americans Mr. D'Sa could be dismissed "at will" by his employer, except for reasons banned by law, like racial discrimination or retaliation for whistle-blowing. But the appellate court found that the California statute is just such a law.
In California, "the interests of the employee in his own mobility and betterment" come before "the competitive business interests of the employers," Judge H. Walter Croskey wrote.
That made Mr. D'Sa's dismissal a "wrongful termination in violation of public policy," a significant finding because it entitled Mr. D'Sa to seek payments for emotional distress if his case went to trial. He will also be able to seek punitive damages from Playhut, "to make an example of the company for his conduct," said his lawyer, Michael J. Faber. Wrongful dismissals that do not involve public policy issues entitle workers to claim only back wages and other economic damages.
Playhut declined to comment. The Worldtec Group International, the consulting firm that advised Playhut, did not return phone calls seeking comment, nor did the lawyer representing the two companies.
Few other states have statutes putting employee interests so firmly ahead of business interests. Yet employment lawyers said the California ruling could have broad repercussions. Mr. Schachter of Fenwick & West, for example, said many of his clients had been issuing overly broad noncompete agreements for mere psychological effect, assuming that if an employee ever took them to court, they could escape liability by saying they were not enforcing the agreement.
"This is quite commonplace, and now, it's quite dangerous," Mr. Schachter said. "In California, the public policy is so strong that the mere existence of these noncompete clauses is a violation of the law, even in those cases where you don't seek to enforce them."
Playhut's lawyers had argued that employees knew its noncompete agreement was legally invalid, and "could sign the agreement without fear." But the court held that employees were not likely to be so well-versed in law.
Employment lawyers said workers in other states were likely to try to import the California concept.
"Every company needs to do a self-audit of their noncompete clauses," Mr. Schachter said. "If they end up trying to get everyone to sign one of these agreements that's unlawful, they are inviting a lawsuit and substantial punitive damages."

To the Editor:
 Re "Economic Groups Call for New Power Supplies" (news article, Jan. 26): 
 Where were "some of New York City's most powerful economic interest groups" a month ago, when the City Council and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani reached agreement on an interim plan to export the city's residential garbage to distant landfills? 
The city is spending about $300 million annually from its expense budget for new disposal costs, and is newly beholden to national waste management companies. Now those same companies are demanding that the city eliminate the price cap on commercial waste, showing their muscle by dropping thousands of small-business customers.
Civic leaders need to wake up to how the city's future economic well-being is challenged by our garbage crisis.

HEADLINE: Western Banks Raise Premium on Japan Loans 

BYLINE:  By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 30 

 BODY:
In recent weeks, European and American banks have raised the interest rate premium they charge their Japanese counterparts on short-term loans, a small but worrisome sign that the financial health of the struggling Japanese banking industry may be deteriorating as the fiscal year draws to a close. 
 Compared with the premiums Japanese banks were charged at the height of the financial crisis of the late 1990's, the recent increases are fairly tame, analysts say. In late 1997 and early 1998, before the government engineered a sweeping bailout of the financial system, Japanese banks were paying up to a full percentage point over the benchmark rate, known as the three-month Libor, to borrow money overnight or for a few days because wary foreign lenders were trying to limit their exposure to Japan. The Bank of Japan wound up having to step in and provide the banks with financing. 
 By contrast, the premium now is generally only about four basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Still, that is a noticeable increase on last year's average of just seven-tenths of a basis point, according to Bloomberg Financial Markets, and it hit a high of seven basis points -- 10 times the 2000 average -- on Jan. 11.
Analysts said the change in sentiment implied by the rise is puzzling, given that the Bank of Japan pumped money into the financial system at the end of 2000 to meet normal year-end cash needs and has yet to mop up the extra liquidity.
"If it's only a one-week movement in the premium, then it's no big deal," said James Fiorillo, senior banking analyst at ING Barings in Tokyo. "It could be that kind of a blip. But we're keeping an eye on it."
The rise is a reflection of general jitters over the health of the banking sector. "The premium is there to show the degree of confidence overseas banks have in Japanese banks," said Walter Altherr, a banking analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in Tokyo.
Analysts, economists and even some politicians say the banks have not made enough progress in dealing with bad loans or forcing troubled borrowers to restructure. A new wave of bankruptcies and the weakness in the Japanese stock market have combined to put increased pressure on the banks. Credit rating agencies have lowered their assessments of banks' preferred shares. And there are frequent forecasts of an imminent banking crisis in the Japanese news media. "There are many questions about the quality of the banks' capital," said Marshall Gittler, a strategist at Bank of America.
Until March 31, the government has the authority to spend up to 70 trillion yen ($600 billion) to stabilize the banking system, and there has been talk of extending the authority into the next fiscal year. But making use of the authority would pose problems. The government would have to issue bonds to finance the spending, at a time when politicians are trying to reduce Japan's huge public-sector deficit. And the public is growing increasingly sensitive about the use of tax money to rescue failing institutions, particularly banks.

HEADLINE: EN ROUTE: HAWAII; 
The True Treasures of the Pacific

BYLINE:  By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: HONOLULU 

 BODY:
FISH is to Hawaii as beef is to Texas. Isolated in the mid-Pacific, surrounded by waters of proverbial purity, Hawaiians have caught and eaten fish of many varieties in vast quantities ever since they first arrived here from the Marquesas Islands by canoe 1,500 years ago.
 Today the islanders of the 50th state -- whether Japanese, Chinese, Caucasian, Hawaiian, Samoan or Filipino in origin -- consume prodigious quantities of prime seafood. Per person, they eat twice as much fish as mainland Americans, and they consume more sashimi, or sliced raw fish, than anyone except the Japanese. 
 They blend sea salt, ground candlenuts and a seaweed called limu kohu with cubed raw fish in a concoction known as poke (pronounced POE-kay). They grill, steam, broil and saute reef fish, deep sea fish and bottom fish and use them in soups, stir-fries and stews. There is always plenty left over to export to Japan and the mainland United States. In recent decades, Hawaii has helped to make fresh tuna a staple on the American dinner table and has shipped increasing amounts of swordfish as the stocks in the Atlantic have dwindled. Other fish, like opah and wahoo, still relatively little known on the mainland, are likely to become increasingly available there in the next few years, and mainlanders are likely to admire them as ardently as the Hawaiians always have. Most of the fish in Hawaii is as fresh as an ocean breeze. Boats that land old or mishandled fish don't last long in the intense local competition, and restaurants foolish enough to serve it find their clientele vanishing.
Stop some morning at the restaurant called Breakfast, Lunch and Crab, a plain-Jane sort of place run by the ebullient chef Sam Choy, and you'll see people eating grilled mahi-mahi with soy-butter sauce for breakfast. An island favorite now popular throughout the United States, mahi-mahi is not only mild and mellow but, in Mr. Choy's view, "idiotproof, because it stays moist no matter how much you abuse it."
Visit grander premises for lunch or dinner and you'll find a parade of more elaborate preparations of mahi-mahi, ahi tuna and less familiar fish, like moi, opah, opakapaka and onaga. Big-name chefs like George Mavrothalassitis, Alan Wong and Roy Yamaguchi combine them sometimes with Pacific Rim ingredients like ginger, wasabi, shiso, lotus root and lemon grass, sometimes with Atlantic Rim ingredients like shallots, zucchini, beets, truffles and fennel. Or wander through Chinatown and you'll be staggered by the abundance of carefully iced fish in the display cases, especially the great, wine-red slabs of bigeye tuna, some the size of a six-rib roast beef. The best may cost $30 a pound retail, but it still sells out in a hurry.
Over the New Year holiday in Honolulu this year, my wife, Betsey, and I witnessed a veritable frenzy of fish consumption. Hawaiians of Japanese origin like to welcome the new year by eating either ahi or onaga, also known as ruby snapper. Ahi has red flesh, onaga has red skin, and for the Japanese, red symbolizes happiness and prosperity. By now, the custom has spread far beyond the bounds of the Japanese community.
The fishing industry here has stayed healthy while the rest of the economy has stagnated over the last decade, but now it faces a new problem. In his final weeks in office, President Bill Clinton created an 84-million-acre underwater nature preserve around the northwestern Hawaiian Islands in an effort to save the area's coral reefs. Most open-ocean fishing and much bottom-fishing for snappers and other species was banned within the preserve.
Conservationists cheered, but commercial fisherman, already bitter because of earlier restrictions imposed on them but not on boats based in California, attacked Mr. Clinton's ruling. Jim Cook, a fisherman and former chairman of the Western Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Council, said it amounted to nothing more than "giving the great white father in Washington control over Hawaiian resources." 
But for all the heated words, none of the prime food fish are disappearing from the market here, and there are no obvious signs that stocks are dwindling like those of cod in the Atlantic and roughy in the Pacific. One big reason is that many Hawaiian favorites are migratory, swimming within reach of local fisherman only a few months a year.
WHETHER mainland visitors arrive from Boston, the stronghold of scrod and bluefish, or from Florida, which dotes upon pompano and grouper, or from California, where sand dabs and petrale sole are mainstays, they find themselves in a whole new world, piscatorially speaking, when they hit Hawaii. Even familiar fish often have unfamiliar names, though some of those names are making their way onto mainland menus. 
We start with the tunas, the most expensive and the most highly prized local fish. Bluefin tuna, caught mostly in the Atlantic, is a rare visitor to these waters. The great prizes here are the two species known as ahi: the plump yet streamlined bigeyes (Thunnus obesus), which range up to five feet long, and the sleeker, more torpedo-shaped yellowfins (Thunnus albacares). Bigeyes, which are indeed distinguishable by their big eyes, more than an inch across, congregate in Hawaiian waters in winter; yellowfins (no kin to the yellowtail), marked by a yellow dorsal fin, swarm here in summer. Both, at their best, are rich in iron and copper, giving their flesh its red hue.
With a full-bodied, almost beefy flavor and a silky texture, raw ahi is one of the world's gastronomic treasures, in the same class with Maine lobster and Dover sole and Belon oysters -- especially the hyper-rich belly meat that the Japanese call toro. Quickly seared so that it is slightly crisp on the outside and meltingly pink in the center, the fish displays another but no less delicious aspect of its character.
Most ahi is caught by boats that range far out to sea on trips that often last two or three weeks. Once in position, they play out as much as 40 miles of line, which lies between buoys near the surface, with hundreds of baited hooks dangling from shorter leads that drop from the main lines. When the fish are landed, fishermen treat them with all the respect due to creatures that, properly handled, command thousands of dollars apiece at the United Fishing Agency auction in Honolulu.
"We handle them real careful," a captain named Tom Webster, with 35 years' experience, told The Honolulu Star-Bulletin a few years ago. "We land them on a carpet on the deck, they are quickly killed so they don't thrash and they are carefully iced and re-iced to get the body temperature down."
THE goal, of course, is to get each tuna to port as quickly as possible and in the best shape possible. That will make it a candidate for the sashimi market. If the fish is handled roughly, it will bruise or crack. Bad. If the fish is left in the water too long after being hooked, its skin colors and flesh color will fade. Worse. If the skipper waits too long before returning to port, the fish will exhibit murky eyes or an off-putting smell, the telltale signs of spoilage. Worst.
The growing demand for sashimi-grade tuna, and the tremendous prices it commands, led to the obsession with quality. Frank Goto, the general manager of the fishing agency, said that 25 years ago, tuna were thrown haphazardly onto the deck, covered with wet burlap bags and left there for days. At first, he said, "the skippers laughed when we told them they had to chill the fish on board, but little by little they saw economic reality."
Each tuna is sold individually at the fish auction. Inside a sparkling clean, hangarlike shed on the waterfront here, where even the keenest nose would have trouble detecting a fishy smell, the sleek, silvery fish are lined up on pallets on the floor, with crushed ice clinging to them. Twenty-five or so buyers shuffle from pallet to pallet, huddling around the burly auctioneer, Wayne Higashi, who calls out the prices in a lingo incomprehensible to outsiders, beginning by offering the tuna at the highest possible price and dropping it until interest awakens.
Most of the buyers, although not all, are men; most, although not all, are of Asian origin. They are a colorful lot. Several have knives jammed into the tops of their rubber boots; one of them, a former sushi chef named Nobu, often wears a red-and-green jester's cap. They represent exporters, wholesalers, markets, restaurants, itinerant vendors, mom-and-pop fish shops.
Notches are cut into the tails of the tuna before they are displayed. That allows potential buyers to evaluate the color of the flesh, one important element in determining quality. It also allows them to reach inside, pull out a bit of the flesh and roll it between their fingers to evaluate the fat content, which is even more important. High fat content, several of the buyers told me, is the key to taste as well as texture in tuna.
"Much of the best stuff," said Don Leong, president of Wing Sing Seafood Inc., "goes to the best restaurants here in Honolulu. Alan Wong, maybe. The Halekulani hotel. The Kahala Mandarin. No secret about it. When they call in an order, the top chefs don't specify price. They tell me to buy the best, and they're willing to pay top dollar, whatever it costs to get it."
On the day I visited, at the very peak of the holiday season, the auction began at 3 a.m. to accommodate the expected volume. More than 100,000 pounds of fish was sold that day, a third of it tuna, a tenth of it prime ahi. One fine specimen went for $7.80 a pound and found itself on a plane to Los Angeles in an hour or so; at 136 pounds, the price worked out to $1,060.80. In boom times in Japan in the 1980's, it might have brought several times that.
Not all Hawaiian tuna are aristocrats like bigeye and yellowfin. Local fishermen also catch tombo, or albacore, a species often used for canning, which has lean, light-pink flesh and a sweet, subtle taste, and boldly flavored aku, or skipjack, its prettily striped cousin. These smaller fish are usually broiled, but they, too, are sometimes served raw, especially aku.
The same long-line fleets that land tuna also land billfish -- Pacific blue marlin, or kajiki, one of the greatest of game fishes, whose firm texture makes it ideal for broiling and grilling; striped marlin, or nairagi, the tenderest of the billfish; hebi, or shortbilled spearfish, with a springy texture and lemony taste; and dense, meaty shutome, or broadbill swordfish, much of which ends up as steaks on East Coast menus. The blue marlins are huge; cut in two, one fish fills an entire pallet on the United Fish Agency auction floor.
"We sell everything," Brooks H. Takenaka, the assistant general manager of the auction, told me as we walked up and down the aisles of fish awaiting sale. "With the plethora of cultures in Hawaii, there's a market for everything. There's no bycatch. Fishermen throw nothing back. A cat could starve here."
In fact, not quite everything is sold at the fish auction. Many of the delicate reef fish such as goatfish, and the exquisite moi, or threadfish, once reserved for the old Hawaiian nobility, reach market through other channels. Because they are within easy reach by small boat, they are also caught in large numbers by amateur fishermen and served in island homes.
Slim, good-natured, articulate, the son and grandson of fishermen, Mr. Takenaka is himself a marine biologist. Each morning, he prowls the floor, checking the stock, schmoozing with buyers and watching, always watching, how the fish are handled. While I was with him, he bawled out a porter who let a marlin fall from a dolly -- "Robert, you have to do better than that" -- and urged another to put more ice on a big mako shark lurking in a corner.
NEARBY were dozens of boxes of the brightly colored snappers caught by day boats along the drop-offs between the shoals and the deep water surrounding the islands. They come in many colors: ruby, known as onaga or long-tail, a tender, clean-tasting fish, often baked in a salt or herb crust; pink, or opakapaka, with a slightly flakier texture; black; gray; and so on. Snapper is a name of convenience; actually, each of the Hawaiian varieties comes from a different genus, and the Florida red snapper comes from still another. They have in common the unaggressive flavors that endear them to people put off by more assertive tastes.
I also spotted an old favorite of mine: long, slender onos, fast-swimming open-ocean fish that are as much fun to eat as they are to catch on light tackle. "Ono" means "delicious" in Hawaiian, which seems apt; grilled, ono tastes like chicken or veal with a slight tang. Hawaiians will tell you that its alternate name, wahoo, derives from Oahu, the name of the island on which Honolulu is situated. 
But nothing Mr. Takenaka sells is quite as dramatic-looking as the great, round red-and-orange opahs, known as moonfish in tribute to their profiles, and nothing was quite as beautiful on this particular morning as a trio of mahi-mahis that had been brought in by the trawler Mary I. Its captain, Mr. Takenaka said, "puts love and attention into every fish; he catches just a few, takes good care of them, rushes back into port, and then goes to find more."
Most of the freckled, blunt-nosed mahi-mahis on offer were rather drab-looking, but not the Mary I's; their bellies were bright lemon yellow and lime green. They bore a disconcerting resemblance to a mahi-mahi I caught years ago in Florida, after a taxidermist had at it, except a lot more natural. Surprise, surprise: the Mary I's fish went for twice as much as the rest.

SEARED MAHI-MAHI IN LOBSTER SAUCE WITH MACADAMIA NUTS
Adapted from Roy's, Honolulu
Time: 1 hour 30 minutes

1/4 cup macadamia nuts
1 cooked lobster shell (body and claws), broken into pieces (reserve meat for another purpose)
1/4 pound sliced bacon, cut into 2-inch lengths
1 small carrot, peeled, roughly chopped
1 small onion, peeled, roughly chopped
1 stalk celery, roughly chopped
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil
2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme
5 whole black peppercorns
1/2 cup tomato paste
4 cups heavy cream
Salt and white pepper
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
4 7-ounce skinless fillets of mahi-mahi, red snapper, sea bass or other white fish.

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Bake macadamia nuts on a baking sheet until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Set aside. Raise oven temperature to 375 degrees. Bake lobster shell on a baking sheet for 20 minutes. Set aside.
2. Place a large flameproof casserole over medium-low heat, and saute bacon until soft. Add carrot, onion, celery, basil, thyme and peppercorns. Saute until vegetables have softened, about 10 minutes. Add lobster shells, tomato paste and heavy cream. Stir well, and simmer until reduced by half, about 45 minutes.
3. Place a very fine strainer (or one lined with cheesecloth) over a large bowl. Pour in lobster sauce; discard shells and vegetables. Season sauce with salt and white pepper to taste, and keep warm.
4. Place a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, and add vegetable oil. When hot, add fish fillets. Sear on both sides, about 1 minute a side for medium rare. Immediately transfer to four warm plates, and drizzle lobster sauce on and around each fillet. Garnish with macadamia nuts.

Yield: 4 servings.

AHI KATSU WITH WASABI GINGER SAUCE
Adapted from 3660 on the Rise, Honolulu
Time: 45 minutes

1 scallion, trimmed and thinly sliced
1 tablespoon finely chopped ginger
1 tablespoon prepared wasabi paste
1/4 cup rice wine vinegar
2 tablespoons heavy cream
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into cubes
1 quart vegetable oil, more as needed
8 ounces sushi-quality ahi (tuna) or swordfish steak, 1 inch thick
4 sheets nori, each about 7 1/2 by 8 inches
1 bunch spinach leaves
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 large eggs
All-purpose flour
2 cups panko (Japanese bread crumbs).

1. Prepare wasabi ginger sauce: In a small saucepan, combine scallion, ginger, wasabi and rice wine vinegar. Place over medium heat, and reduce by half. Add cream, and again reduce by half. Add soy sauce, and reduce heat to low. Whisk in butter cubes one at a time until incorporated. Remove from heat, and keep warm.
2. Fill a wide, deep saucepan with oil 2 1/2 inches deep. Place over high heat, and heat to 350 degrees. Meanwhile, prepare ahi katsu.
3. Cut fish into pieces 1 inch wide and 1 inch thick and as long as the longest side of the nori. Spread nori sheets on a work surface and spread each sheet with a single layer of spinach leaves. Place one piece of ahi along the edge of each sheet; if necessary, smaller pieces can be placed end to end. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Beginning at the side with the ahi, roll nori tightly. Brush edge with water, and press to seal. There will be four rolls.
4. In a wide, shallow bowl, combine eggs, 2 tablespoons water and enough flour (about 1 cup) to make a thin batter. In a separate bowl place about 1/2 cup flour, and in a third bowl place panko. Dip each roll into flour, then into batter, then into panko.
5. Deep-fry rolls until golden brown. Drain on paper towels, and slice into pieces 1 1/2 to 2 inches wide. Serve with wasabi ginger sauce.

Yield: 4 servings.

HEADLINE: Dinner Will Be Served In About Six Months 

BYLINE:  By RICK MARIN 

 BODY:
AT a birthday party full of food people I met an ebullient chef with a broad Italian accent who told me he was opening a restaurant on 22nd Street, just west of Park Avenue South -- my block. Not just any chef: Cesare Casella, scion of the family that owns Il Vipore, the famous Tuscan restaurant in Lucca.
 Beppe, his new place was to be called. And it would open soon, a couple of months at most. That was last summer. 
 Six months later, there's still newspaper covering the windows and a Dumpster in front. The Reuters building in Times Square has gone up faster. As if to rub it in, Tamarind, an Indian restaurant next door to Beppe, will open this week. And construction didn't start on it until September.
Mr. Casella is in good company. Half a dozen high-profile places announced as fall 2000 openings turned into 2001 propositions. Terrance Brennan's Artisanal, planned for November, now looks like mid-March. Tom Colicchio of Gramercy Tavern thought he'd be taking reservations for his solo project, Craft, in early December, not March 1. The Citarella in Rockefeller Center, promised for early November, has no roof. Karen and David Waltuck's hotly anticipated Le Zinc opened in late November after being announced for October -- October 1999, that is.
Many obstacles restaurant owners face are familiar to any homeowner who has undertaken renovations, with a few added complications. 
The town house in Rockefeller Center that will house a Citarella restaurant and market is only 64 feet deep, said Joe Gurrera, Citarella's owner. The small space created mechanical problems, like putting in an elevator, he said. "Everything has to be custom made."
Used to owning his own buildings, he now finds himself a tenant with many taskmasters. There's the developer, Tishman Speyer Properties; the Landmarks Preservation Commission; the architect, David Rockwell; a mechanical engineer; a lighting designer; a structural engineer; a general contractor, "and there's me," he said.
Has there been yelling?
"A little yelling," Mr. Gurrera said. "Not that much." The cold weather kept the workers from finishing the roof. With no roof, there is no heat, slowing things down even more. "It's very disheartening," Mr. Gurrera said.
That's easy for him to say. What about the legions of Midtowners in need of quality herring?
Meanwhile, hype-hungry diners wait with appetites piqued for the hot new place, whose hotness may begin to cool the longer it takes to unshutter the doors. 
Mr. Colicchio blamed an economy that was strong for such a long time. So many people were building, he said, it was "very, very difficult to get carpenters and electricians." (A problem that may abate as the economy slows.)
Craft, on 19th Street behind Gramercy Tavern, was designed with some tricky woodwork, he said, so they used union carpenters, who work shorter hours. "They're gone by 2 o'clock," he said. For much of December, he said, the tradespeople wouldn't come into Manhattan because of the cost of traveling time in holiday traffic. And the building boom put professional equipment -- chillers and boiler systems -- on back-order. The foreman left. They had to break a new guy in. The kitchen is in the basement, where a dishwasher blocked the second exit corridor mandated by the New York City Buildings Department. 
Larry Bogdanow, an architect, said his restaurant jobs are among the fastest, because of the pressure to open by a certain date, but they can also be the most fraught. "You've got mechanical issues, venting, Fire Department inspections," he said. "Those things are much more closely inspected and probably should be. A retail store, you design it, you build it, you open it."
The Buildings Department position is that getting permits and approval from the city for restaurants is not excessively difficult. "Is it any more complicated than any other kind of construction?" said Ilyse Fink, a spokeswoman for the department. "Probably not."
Nonetheless, expediters appear to be a must. For fees in the several thousands of dollars, they will handle the permit and license filings, and generally hack through the red tape. 
Sprinkler systems must be correctly installed or retrofitted to meet the code. Con Ed must approve the gas line, and with old buildings, there is always the dreaded danger of hitting asbestos. 
Le Zinc, in TriBeCa, is in a landmark district, so even the most minor change to the building's facade was subject to city approval. But that wasn't what made Le Zinc a year late, Mr. Waltuck said. 
"The deal was on-again, off-again," he said. Complex legal and real-estate wrangling went on between the Waltucks, the landlord, a tenant who held the lease and another chef who was interested in the space. That lasted a couple of years. Once construction started in September, it took 10 or 12 weeks. 
"It ended up happening against all odds," Mr. Waltuck said. He and his wife had hoped to open in the fall of 1999 -- the 20th anniversary of their first restaurant, Chanterelle. "I like to think it increases the anticipation," Mr. Waltuck said of the delay.
Mr. Brennan and his wife built their first restaurant, Picholine, with their bare hands. But they weren't building a cave, with five different temperature controls for 200 varieties of cheese, as they are at Artisanal. Just negotiating the lease for Artisanal took four to six months, Mr. Brennan said. They signed at the end of August and started planning to redesign the old American Place space on 32nd Street off Park Avenue. Choosing a contractor took two months, until they settled on one the architect, Adam Tihany, had used before. "It was supposed to take 12 weeks from the time we got going," Mr. Brennan said. He still hasn't got the custom doors for the cave.
Picholine customers kept asking when Artisanal was going to open. "We didn't want to mislead anybody, but we were anticipating late fall," Mr. Brennan said. Anyway, he added, "No one expects you to open when you're supposed to."
That's one way of spinning a delay. Mr. Colicchio doesn't buy it. 
"I think you can push a date back once or twice, but if you put it back too much, the public loses confidence in your ability to operate," he said. "People think, 'This restaurant is going to have problems.' "
Mr. Casella, who was the chef at Coco Pazzo and, briefly, Il Cantinori, said the hard lesson he has learned six months behind schedule on his own restaurant is, "If you try to save money, you're going to spend more money." He and his partner hired Mr. Bogdanow to do the design only, then tried to economize in the construction phase. There were problems with the gas, Mr. Casella said. The building had housed a Chinese restaurant that, he would discover too late, had no certificate of occupancy. Its sprinklers were all wrong, an inspection a few weeks ago revealed. A new system had to be installed, pushing back the opening date yet again.
Second week in February. I hope he meant this year.

HEADLINE: W.T.O. Picks Qatar Capital As Meeting Site 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Jan. 30 

 BODY:
Brushing aside objections from labor advocates and human rights campaigners, the World Trade Organization formally agreed today to hold the group's next top-level meeting in autumn in Doha, the capital of the Persian Gulf state of Qatar. The meeting's dates will be set next month.
 The Doha meeting is the subject of increasing international attention because momentum is building for a proposal to begin a new multiyear round of global trade talks there. 
 The big industrial countries of Western Europe generally favor starting the new round, which had been scheduled to start at the last major meeting, in Seattle in December 1999. That meeting drew unexpectedly disruptive street protests, and talks never got off the ground, partly because of American insistence that environmental and labor standards, two major concerns of the antiglobalization protesters, be included in the new trade round.
European Union officials met with more than a dozen countries in Geneva today to explore the feasibility of restarting the process in Doha, after remarks by the European Commission president, Romano Prodi, at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, that he hoped talks could begin later this year. 
A spokesman for the European Union said its officials would like to sound out developing countries about the feasibility of a new round. But the union would prefer to establish a separate forum for discussion of the relationship between trade and social development issues, to permit the trade talks to proceed unburdened by the kinds of disputes seen at the Seattle meeting. 
The choice of Doha as a site was made by a consensus of the 140-nation trade organization and widely backed by the developing nations who predominate in the group. But it drew criticism, partly because of authoritarian Qatar's human rights record and the difficulty of organizing protests there on anything like the scale of those in Seattle. 
In response, officials in Qatar have pledged to allow unfettered access to the country during the conference and to permit demonstrations, a rare sight in the conservative country, as long as they are peaceful. The nongovernmental organizations accredited to the Seattle meeting will also be accredited to Doha, said Mike Moore, the director general of the W.T.O.

HEADLINE: U.P.S. Posts 9.5% Increase In Fourth-Quarter Earnings 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Jan. 30 

 BODY:
United Parcel Service said today that its fourth-quarter earnings rose 9.5 percent as expansion in Europe increased international shipments.
 Net income climbed to $724 million, or 63 cents a share, compared with $661 million, or 56 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Sales rose 6.1 percent, to $7.9 billion from $7.45 billion. 
 Analysts had expected the company to earn 61 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
U.P.S. increased the average daily number of international deliveries by a larger-than-forecast 13 percent, led by 30 percent growth in European shipments. A focus on overseas shipments helped U.P.S. and its main rival, the FedEx Corporation, increase profit as business grew at a slower rate in the United States, their main market.
"They have been working more, focusing more, on upgrading their product in Europe," said James Valentine, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
The company projects that sales will rise 8 percent to 10 percent this year and that per-share earnings will climb 9 percent to 11 percent as economic growth picks up in the second half, a forecast consistent with analysts' estimates.
U.P.S. began using more than 400 Texaco gasoline stations in Belgium last year as package pick-up points to cut costs and add to customer convenience. The company also gained access to some of the letter delivery market operated by Deutsche Post A.G., Europe's largest mail company, which is run by the German government.
The company increased weekly flights that circle the globe to handle an increase in deliveries. U.P.S. plans to begin six new weekly flights to China on April 1, a service the company expects to add $100 million in sales in its first full year.
United States deliveries rose 2.8 percent as the company struggled with lower retail sales, which hampered holiday shipments.
Shares of U.P.S. rose 80 cents to $61.60.

PERSON: Florence Tyson 

HEADLINE: Florence Tyson, 82, Early Advocate of Creative Arts Therapy 

BYLINE:  By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Florence Tyson, an early practitioner of creative arts therapy who for many years led a clinic for emotionally troubled people in Manhattan, died on Jan. 18 at her home on the Upper East Side. She was 82.
 Ms. Tyson founded the community-oriented Creative Arts Rehabilitation Center in Midtown, on the fringes of the theater district, in 1962 and directed it until 1990. She was then a senior consultant until 1995, when the center ran out of money and had to close. 
 It was one of the first outpatient clinics in the United States to use music, dance, drama, painting and poetry as therapy. 
Born in Brooklyn, Ms. Tyson majored in art at Brooklyn College and had an early career in advertising and as a fund-raiser. She began to practice music therapy in the 1950's when it was new and music in a mental hospital was looked upon as largely recreational.
But based on her experience in mental hospitals, she insisted that the arts could also be effective tools in the treatment of many conditions, including schizophrenia and chronic depression.
She founded and directed a fund that raised money to send unemployed musicians to work with hospital patients.
As the trend of emptying the state's large mental institutions grew, she started her center in a basement and later moved it above a restaurant at 51st Street and Eighth Avenue. Her idea was to keep patients from relapse and readmission.
She elaborated on her approach in a book, "Psychiatric Music Therapy: Origins and Development." First published in 1982, it remains in print as a primer for fellow professionals.
Ms. Tyson is survived by her companion, Saul Lishinsky of Manhattan; a sister, Lillian Cohen of Princeton, N.J.; and a brother, William Tyson of Philadelphia and Cascais, Portugal.
One of her center's staunchest supporters and fund-raisers was Celeste Holm, its president for 18 years. In 1995, the actress offered to sell the Oscar she won for her supporting role in the 1947 film "Gentlemen's Agreement" to keep the clinic open, to no avail.
But, in a way, Ms. Tyson's mission had been accomplished. To buttress her belief in it, she liked to quote Friedrich von Schiller, the poet and dramatist, about art "bringing people to their senses."
In fact, when the center closed, its trained therapists were able to move on to other such clinics established since she founded hers.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
As in the sport, the experts are issuing post-mortems of the plays in Super Sunday's Ad Bowl.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
MADISON AVENUE is closely studying the results of the Ad Bowl played during Super Bowl XXXV, examining data from surveys and polls both online and offline to help sharpen the advertising for next year's game, only CCCLXI days away.
 That scrutiny is hardly surprising now that the Super Bowl has become the biggest day of the year for advertisers as well as for football and its fans. The increasing interest in the commercials that appear during the game has generated a growing spate of post-mortems from academics, pollsters, marketing consultants and agencies, all seeking to capitalize on the attention generated by an event watched by what is usually the largest television audience of the year. 
 "It's their day to shine," Allen Weiner, vice president for analytical services at Nielsen NetRatings in New York, said of the marketers that spend the huge sums required to become Super Bowl sponsors. 
Nielsen NetRatings, a joint venture of NetRatings Inc. and the Nielsen Media Research division of VNU, monitored changes in traffic at the Web sites of advertisers, whether dot-coms or traditional marketers, from computer users at home and at work. (The Media Metrix division of Jupiter Media Metrix is compiling similar data, to be released today.)
Mr. Weiner listed six "big winners" in terms of increasing traffic to their Web sites. Four were advertisers during the game: the E*Trade Group, which ran two spots and sponsored the halftime show; Electronic Data Systems, which ran an eye-catching 60-second spot centered on squirrels; Hotjobs.com, which ran one whimsical spot; and a Hotjobs competitor, Monster.com, a unit of TMP Worldwide that ran two humorous spots.
The two others benefiting from the Super Bowl, Mr. Weiner said, were Charles Schwab & Company, which sponsored the kickoff show before the game started and ran a spot featuring the Duchess of York; and AdCritic.com, a showcase for commercials that is run by Peter Beckman, an advertising aficionado.
Visitors to AdCritic.com were asked to vote for their favorite Super Bowl spots in a poll titled "When Football Isn't Enough"; as of early yesterday evening, more than 373,000 had done so. Four of the top 10 commercials were for the Budweiser and Bud Light beer brands sold by Anheuser-Busch.
The spot in first place showed a group of preppies offering "What are your doing?" as an alternative version of the Budweiser catch phrase "Whassup?"
Two commercials scoring well in the online poll that were not from Anheuser-Busch were the fanciful Electronic Data Systems spot and a hilarious spot for E*Trade from the game's first quarter, offering a rueful recap of the recent debacle for investors in dot-com stocks.
That spot resonated so deeply because it served to reference, with a wink and a nudge, the stark difference in the advertiser lineups between this year's Super Bowl and last year's. In 2000, there were 17 dot-com sponsors. In 2001, that number had dwindled to three: E*Trade, Hotjobs and Monster.
"We were having a company party, and when the E*Trade commercial was finished, everyone applauded," said Richard Johnson, chief executive at Hotjobs in New York. "It was so dead on."
Mr. Johnson said the spot his company ran, early in the third quarter, "did everything it was supposed to do," generating traffic to the company's Web site "even more than we had expected."
"Who stops during the middle of the game to post their resume on an employment Web site?" he asked. "But people did."
Another advertiser interesting in driving eyeballs to its Web site was a not-com, MasterCard International, which ran a spot in the fourth quarter promoting a vacation contest that consumers can enter by visiting www.mastercard.com.
"We've had 22,000 visitors, which is a good start for the program," said Larry Flanagan, chief marketing officer at MasterCard in Purchase, N.Y. "We've never done anything like this before."
There were other polls and surveys to determine the spots people liked. One, conducted by NTN Communications in Carlsbad, Calif., an interactive television network for restaurants and bars, found four of the five highest-rated spots were for Budweiser and Bud Light; the winner was a "Whassup?" commercial about an alien spy returning home.
A study by Clickin Research in Austin, Tex., showed much larger increases in likability and recognition for less familiar brands that ran commercials during the game than for Super Bowl mainstays like MasterCard and Budweiser.
For instance, a series of four commercials that appeared in the first three quarters for Accenture, the company formerly known as Andersen Consulting, "was very effective," said Dr. Martha Russell, president at Clickin.
Jim Murphy, global managing director for marketing and communications at Accenture, said: "Our commercials were not aimed at the general public. We were reaching senior executives, not beer drinkers. We used the Super Bowl because we could reach 50 percent of our audience in one day." He added that "our Web site traffic" doubled.
Other advertisers whose spots helped to increase familiarity and likability, according to the Clickin survey, included Electronic Data Systems; Cingular Wireless, a joint venture of BellSouth and SBC Communications; Hotjobs; E*Trade; and Monster.
There were also efforts to measure other aspects of the performance of the commercials. A study by Greenfield Online in Wilton, Conn., showed that the spots deemed most popular were not always the same as those that made viewers "more likely to purchase" the advertisers' goods or services.
While the commercials for Anheuser-Busch and the Pepsi-Cola soft drink sold by PepsiCo topped the lists for both "liked most" and "more likely to purchase" in the Greenfield survey, there were some disparities. For example, commercials for Volkswagen of America and E*Trade ranked among the most liked but did not make the other list, while commercials for Cingular and the coming Vivendi Universal film "The Mummy Returns" ranked among the spots that made viewers more likely to purchase what was advertised but did not make the list of most liked.
A study for the Zyman Marketing Group also sought to determine the effectiveness of the spots, based on intent to purchase.
In several instances, the study concluded, some of the commercials that lost on likability in surveys like the USA Today Ad Meter scored high marks on increasing purchase intent. They included all four commercials for Accenture and a simple spot for Cingular, one of three, that showed a man dancing.
"Our Super Bowl research has again shown that making ads that consumers like does not necessarily have a bearing on whether they will buy more of your product," said Sergio Zyman, chief executive at Zyman Marketing in Atlanta.

HEADLINE: Federal Judge Dismisses Three Suits On Auctions 

BYLINE:  By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
A federal judge yesterday dismissed three lawsuits against Sotheby's and Christie's by buyers at foreign auctions who said they had been cheated in a price-fixing scheme dating back to 1992. 
 Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled that because the auctions took place abroad without any direct or substantial impact in the United States they could not be tried under domestic antitrust laws. 
 "Unless the court is to impute to Congress an intention to establish an antitrust regime to cover the world, the answer must be no," he wrote. 
The lawsuits were filed on the heels of a $512 million settlement last fall of a class-action lawsuit brought by more than 100,000 customers who say they were defrauded in a price-fixing scheme involving commissions between Sotheby's and Christie's. Judge Kaplan is considering a request for final approval of the settlement and has set a hearing for Friday to consider objections. 
The J. Paul Getty Trust, which runs the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, will be among those objecting. Officials said the trust opposed the settlement because it offers no compensation for the oversees transactions. (Over the years, the Getty has bought millions of dollars of fine art at Sotheby's and Christie's in London.) "It also discriminates against purchases in excess of $50,000," said Deborah Gribbon, vice president of the trust and director of the museum.
The settlement stipulates that auction buyers will receive 5 percent of the sales price on each purchase of $50,000 or less and a flat $2,500 for each purchase above $50,000. 
Judge Kaplan's decision follows a pattern of courts dismissing similar claims involving foreign transactions, including a case on behalf of foreign customers trying to sue Microsoft under United States antitrust laws. 
Sotheby's and Christie's applauded the judge's decision. "We have said all along that it was inappropriate for this lawsuit to be filed in the U.S. courts and we are very pleased that this case has been dismissed," said Sotheby's in a written statement. Christie's issued a statement that said in part, "The court's decision brings us closer to the day when we can put this matter behind us." 
But Paul T. Gallagher, a partner at Cohen Milstein Hausfeld & Toll, one of the law firms representing the foreign buyers and sellers disagreed. "It's the old adage the defendants may have gotten what they wish, and it may be to their detriment," he said. "This decision only increases the likelihood that both Christie's and Sotheby's will have to address legal claims outside the United States, most particularly the U.K." He added that he was preparing lawsuits that would be filed in the British courts. 
Had the lawsuit by foreign buyers been allowed to proceed it could have cost Sotheby's and Christie's millions of dollars more. As it is, both auction houses have agreed to pay $256 million to settle the claim. A. Alfred Taubman, Sotheby's former chairman, has agreed to pay $156 million of Sotheby's portion. As part of the settlement, agreed to in October, the two auction houses have the option of paying $100 million of the settlement in the form of coupons to future sellers that can be put toward commission fees. 
But Judge Kaplan, skeptical that the coupons were worth the same as cash, hired economists to evaluate them. Under pressure from the plaintiffs' lawyers, Sotheby's and Christie's sweetened the deal earlier this month, agreeing to pay cash for unredeemed certificates at face value five years after their issuance. 
Now they have gone one step further, according to people familiar with the negotiations. Amid concerns that the coupons would not be worth as much as cash, the houses have agreed to issue $125 million in coupons rather than $100 million, without reducing their cash payments. The result, they said, would be to increase the value of the coupons to sellers by 25 percent. This implies that the coupons are expected to trade at 80 cents on the dollar. Also, the houses would allow customers to redeem the coupons after four years at face value, even though they would still be accepted for five years. A spokesman for Sotheby's confirmed these details.

Sega Forsaking Consoles to Focus on Game Software

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL 

 BODY:
As Sega Enterprises had hinted and video game industry analysts had expected, the company said yesterday that it would abandon its Dreamcast game console and focus efforts on producing game software.
 Once considered the third big game console competitor, along with Nintendo and Sony, Sega hit its heyday in the early 1990's with the Sega Genesis game console. But its subsequent machine, the Saturn, faltered, and deeply disappointing sales of the Dreamcast, introduced in late 1999, appear to have driven Sega, a Japanese company, from the hardware business altogether. 
 Sega officials said the company did not have deep enough pockets to market the Dreamcast, of which roughly 6.5 million were sold worldwide, the company said. 
"Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft have huge war chests and Sega is unable to compete with them at their game," said Charles Bellfield, vice president of communications for Sega of America. Microsoft plans to enter the game console market later this year with its own system, the X-Box.
Mr. Bellfield said Dreamcast sales did not meet expectations in part because of a slowdown in economic conditions, and a lack of consumer confidence that Mr. Bellfield blamed on delays in determining the winner of the presidential election in the United States.
Mr. Bellfield said Sega plans layoffs, but he did not specify how many of the approximately 3,500 Sega employees worldwide would be affected.
The move marks not just a financial change but a cultural one for Sega, which for years has produced video game software to be played exclusively on its game console. Now, the company will make its games accessible on some of the competing consoles, including that of its archrival, Sony, which recently launched the PlayStation 2.
Sega said it has licensed three of its games to be published on the Sony PlayStation 2, the first of which will come out in April.
Sega officials said they believe their software business can soar now that it is not limited by the number of Dreamcast game consoles that it sells.
"Now we'll be limited purely by the number of people who want to play games." Mr. Bellfield said.
John G. Taylor, a video game industry analyst with the Arcadia Investment Corporation, based in Portland, Ore., said the restructuring paves the way for Sega to grow as a software company. As it is, Sega is widely considered to publish high-quality, innovative video games, Mr. Taylor and other industry analysts said.
"There's no question that if Sega applied itself, it could be one of the leading independent video game studios in the world," Mr. Taylor said.
Whether it will remain independent, however, is a question that remains unresolved. Executives in the video game industry said a number of companies, including Sega's biggest competitors, have been in discussions about whether to acquire Sega.
"There could be a real bidding war," said David Cole, president of DFC Intelligence, a market research firm, adding, however, that such an auction could drive the price so high that Sega "would be too rich for anybody to acquire.".
As part of the announcement, Sega said it will lower the price of its Dreamcast consoles to $99, from $149, in hopes of liquidating its inventory; the company already had reduced its price from $199 last fall. Mr. Bellfield said the company is not disclosing the size of the inventory. 
In its new incarnation, Sega said it also plans to emphasize online gaming and developing games for other devices, like hand-held computers and cellular phones. The company has said it expects its profit margins to improve by emphasizing software. "This is a great path to profitability," Mr. Bellfield said.

HEADLINE: Schwab Tells Some Workers To Stay Home 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
Forget casual Fridays, the Charles Schwab Corporation has started canceling Fridays.
 In a bid to cut expenses, Schwab, the San Francisco-based brokerage firm, has told about half of its employees not to show up for work on three Fridays in the next five weeks. Stretching out the weekends will bolster Schwab's reported earnings for the quarter, even though the firm expects most of the eligible workers to use vacation time. 
 Christopher V. Dodds, Schwab's chief financial officer, said the three-day weekends are the latest in a series of steps the company has taken since November to reduce costs during a slump in stock trading by the individual investors who are Schwab's main customers. Their trading, on which Schwab earns commissions, dropped off when prices of technology stocks collapsed last spring and has not bounced back. 
That slowdown contributed to a 27 percent drop in the firm's earnings in the fourth quarter, during which it barely surpassed the 12 percent pretax profit margin that its executives have pledged to exceed every quarter. Late last year, the brokerage firm slashed the salaries of its executives by 5 percent to 50 percent, froze most hiring and told employees to limit their spending on travel and entertainment.
"We are looking as a management team at a whole wide range of steps we could take without resorting to the blunt ax of layoffs," Mr. Dodds said. "We view layoffs as darn-near the last resort."
Mr. Dodds declined to say how much money Schwab expected to save from these measures, which he described as creative alternatives to laying off workers. The savings from the Fridays off "is not a huge amount of money," he said.
Amy Butte, an analyst at Bear, Stearns, estimated the Fridays off could reduce the firm's compensation costs by $9 million to $15 million, or less than a penny a share. Ms. Butte, who recommends buying Schwab's stock, called the decision to avoid layoffs "a long-term positive" because it would build good will with employees and maintain the firm's capacity to handle higher levels of trading activity when the market rebounds.
The last time Schwab laid off a significant number of workers was in 1988, Mr. Dodds said. Other financial services companies have been eliminating jobs in recent months. This month, Merrill Lynch eliminated the jobs of about 55 stock and bond analysts; in July, it cut about 1,800 jobs in its brokerage operation.
"There's nothing innovative about companies that decide to hoard labor when there's low demand," said David I. Levine, an associate professor of labor economics at the Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley. But it has become an uncommon strategy as reciprocal loyalty in the workplace has come to be seen as a quaint notion, he said.
"Schwab is bucking this trend and saying they want to create careers," Mr. Levine said. "I think many employees remain interested in career jobs and, conversely, are resentful when companies apparently capriciously lay people off."
Mr. Dodds said all employees who do not deal with Schwab's customers or support those who do have been told to take the three Fridays off. Schwab expects that group to comprise between 8,000 and 13,000 of its 26,000 employees.
Customers should not notice a difference when they visit branches or conduct trades online or by phone, he said. Mr. Dodds adamantly denied a report yesterday by The Wall Street Journal that Schwab "is considering a series of drastic cost reductions, including closing the firm down every Friday for several weeks."
Mr. Dodds said that the firm had never considered closing its branches or shutting operations and did not consider the steps it is taking to be drastic. "That was a complete mischaracterization," he said. "We are a service business. We are going to be there for our clients."
A Schwab spokesman said the firm did not yet know how many of the eligible workers would take the Fridays off without pay and how many would use vacation days. Either way, Mr. Dodds said, the long weekends will help the firm meet the earnings goals it reiterated two weeks ago when it announced its first decline in quarterly earnings in three years.
On its books, the firm accrues a liability for unused vacation time built up by its employees. As they use the vacation days, the firm reduces the liability, increasing its reported earnings for the period.

Consumer Confidence Falls As Fed Considers Rate Cut
As the Federal Reserve opened a two-day meeting to set interest rates, a closely watched consumer survey reported that people's confidence in the nation's economic health has taken its biggest single-month plunge since 1991.
 Americans remain relatively upbeat about current business and employment conditions, but their expectations for the next six months have dropped to the lowest point since 1993, according to the Conference Board, the research firm that conducts the survey. Page A1. 

P.& G. Profit Rises, but Sales Fall

HEADLINE: CONSUMER OUTLOOK FOR NEXT 6 MONTHS TAKES SHARP DROP 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
As the Federal Reserve opened a two-day meeting yesterday to set interest rates, a closely watched consumer survey reported that people's confidence in the nation's economic health had taken its biggest single-month plunge since late 1990, when the last recession was under way.
 Americans remain relatively upbeat about current business and employment conditions, but their expectations for the next six months have dropped to the lowest point since 1993. Since May, those expectations have fallen from near their all-time high to a level far below average, according to the Conference Board, a business research concern in New York that conducts the survey. 
 "People are reading about gloom and doom and job losses," said Ian Shepherdson, the chief domestic economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., and one of the few analysts to have predicted the extent of the sharp decline in the outlook among consumers. "They're saying, 'It hasn't reached me yet, but I'm hunkering down.' " 
The gap between people's attitudes about the current climate and their expectations for the future is now wider than it has ever been in the 34 years of the poll.
Economists blamed the dismal outlook among consumers on the steep drop in the stock market late last year and a recent wave of layoff plans announced by major corporations even though the unemployment rate remains at a three-decade low.
Typically, a drop in expectations precedes a decline in consumers' assessment of current conditions.
"People are worried," said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist for Merrill Lynch. "The confidence index would have to fall a lot more before you have a contraction, but it's not a positive sign."
Just before the confidence index was released, the Federal Reserve convened a regular meeting of the policy-making committee that sets interest rates. Most analysts predicted the Fed would announce another rate cut of a half of a percentage point today. The Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, who had engineered a surprise half-point reduction in interest rates on Jan. 3, told Congress last week that the economy had already slowed to a crawl and warned that the nation could fall into a recession this year if consumers become so worried that they sharply curtail their spending.
As manufacturers have tried to get rid of excess inventories that built up in recent months, their production has declined sharply, leading to factory shutdowns and job layoffs, Mr. Greenspan said. "The crucial issue," he added, "is whether that marked decline breaches consumer confidence."
Investors now appear confident that a half-point cut in the Fed's target rate for overnight loans between banks, to 5.5 percent, is coming when the central bank ends its session today. In the futures market, trading in federal funds contracts suggested that investors even think a reduction of three-quarters of a point is more likely than a cut of just a quarter-point.
Despite yesterday's sharp drop in the confidence index -- which combines expectations and current attitudes -- it remains higher than it was during all of 1995 and 1996, when the economy slowed but avoided a recession.
Consumer spending also appears to be increasing modestly this month, as most large retail chains are selling more goods than they did this time last year, according to the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. Mortgage applications are rising, too.
But policy-makers have grown alarmed about the swift reversal of people's expectations. Over the last two months, companies -- including DaimlerChrysler, J. C. Penney, Xerox, Whirlpool and WorldCom -- have reacted to the slowing economy by announcing plans for thousands of job cuts, causing concern among many workers. At the same time, declines in the stock market in late 2000, rising energy prices and falling corporate profits have raised widespread fears about the nation's economic weakness, including warnings from President Bush and some of his advisers that the economy is flirting with a recession.
"We're in a gray zone," said Richard D. Rippe, the chief economist for Prudential Securities. "Consumers are in a fragile condition."
The expectations component of the index -- which was 77 this month, down from 97 last month and 119 in May -- has reached a level that often coincides with the start of a recession, said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center. But the part of the index that covers current conditions -- 171 in January, down from 176 in December and 184 in May -- suggests that only a slowdown is likely, Ms. Franco added.
The overall index fell to 114, down from 129 in December. It reached its high-water mark of 145 in May. Over the last three decades, every decline as big as the drop in recent months has occurred during a recession, said Mark Vitner, an economist at First Union Bank in Charlotte, N.C.
The index numbers represent the feelings of consumers who are surveyed; the higher the numbers, the more optimistic are the respondents.
The Conference Board says it sends questionnaires to a different group of 5,000 households each month and usually receives responses from about 3,500. The University of Michigan, which publishes the other widely followed consumer survey, has also reported declining confidence lately.
Many economists consider consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of economic activity in the United States, to offer the best hope for sustaining growth in the first half of 2001. Over the last two years, corporate spending on new equipment has accounted for an unusually large portion of growth, as companies have invested billions of dollars in new technology.
Now, with the slowing economy squeezing profits, such investments are being made far less frequently. Through the first half of last year, business spending on capital goods grew at annual rate of 20 percent. In the third quarter, growth fell to 5 percent.
When the government releases a set of statistics on the nation's overall economic activity for the fourth quarter of 2000, business investment is likely to show a decline at an annual rate of about 4 percent, said Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of Hoening & Company, a brokerage firm in Rye Brook, N.Y.
"A big contributor to growth just left the premises," Mr. Barbera said.
Consumers are sticking around for now, but they seem to be eyeing the exits.

GRAPHIC: Graph: "Concern for the Future"The Conference Board's January survey of consumer confidence found that people thought the economy was not in quite as good shape now as they thought it was a year ago. But their confidence in what the situation would be six months from now had eroded sharply. Graph shows CURRENT SITUATION* and FUTURE EXPECTATIONS* from 1996-2001.*Each month 5,000 households are surveyed about their view of current business and employment conditions and their expectations about business, employment and family income in six months. These feelings about the economy are indexed to 1985 = 100. (Sources: The Conference Board; Bloomberg Financial Markets)(pg. C10)

HEADLINE: Vote Lifts Conservative Land Groups 

BYLINE:  By JAMES RISEN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30 

 BODY:
Gale A. Norton's confirmation today as secretary of the interior by the Senate, by a comfortable 75-to-24 margin, can also be seen as a victory for several conservative environmental groups with which Ms. Norton has been connected in her career.
 The groups, which include the Mountain States Legal Foundation, the Political Economy Research Center, the Defenders of Property Rights and the Coalition of Republican Environmental Advocates, have played an increasingly important role in the battles over Western land use and other environmental issues. Some have been pressing for the rights of property owners against the federal government in response to what they view as overly cumbersome federal environmental regulations and aggressive moves to protect Western land. Others have pressed for a free-market approach to environmentalism, arguing that market forces should determine the proper uses of federal lands. 
 In recent years, these groups have become a counterweight to the larger and better-financed liberal environmental organizations, like the Sierra Club, that opposed Ms. Norton's nomination. They have also received money from Eastern social conservatives and Western business interests, public records show. 
Some involved with these groups emphasize that Ms. Norton, a onetime member of the Libertarian Party and the former Republican attorney general of Colorado, will not automatically favor their positions as interior secretary.
"I know when she takes on a new role, all bets are off," said Nancie Marzulla, president of the Defenders of Property Rights, a group that defends property owners in disputes with the federal government. "If I have a case to take before her, I expect she will probably grill me harder than other people."
Until her appointment, Ms. Norton served on the group's board of advisers and previously worked with Ms. Marzulla at the Mountain States Legal Foundation, based in Denver. 
But others in the conservative environmental movement are optimistic that Ms. Norton will promote free-market environmental ideas. 
"Gale Norton's nomination gives the Republican Party a chance to embrace these ideas," said Jane Shaw, a senior associate at the Political Economy Research Center, in Bozeman, Mont. 
Critics of Ms. Norton, however, have attacked her positions on land use and private property and view the groups with which she has been affiliated as antienvironmental. 
"Her whole life has been devoted to restraining federal authority and making it easier for extractive industries to do their business," Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, an environmental organization in Washington that opposed Ms. Norton's nomination, contended.
"The pedigree for these think tanks and law firms," Mr. Cook said, referring to the ones with which Ms. Norton has been connected, "has at every turn been to oppose environmental regulations." 
Financing for several of the groups with which Ms. Norton has worked has come from Richard Mellon Scaife, a figure involved in many of the attacks on former President Bill Clinton. The heir to a Pittsburgh family's fortune, Mr. Scaife has donated money to conservative land-use groups. The Sarah Scaife Foundation, which lists Mr. Scaife as its chairman, provided a total of about $200,000 in 1999 to groups with which Ms. Norton has had ties.
Another prominent conservative family, the Coors of Colorado, has also provided consistent backing for several conservative Western land-use groups through a foundation, records show. In 1999, the Castle Rock Foundation, a Coors foundation, provided about $100,000 to groups with which Ms. Norton has been affiliated, records show. 
Oil, mining and timber interests -- particularly small and independent Western operators -- have also pitched in, each with contributions of a few thousand dollars. The financial records suggest that on one of the crucial environmental issues faced by Mr. Clinton and now by President Bush -- the debate over the federal control of public land -- Western and Eastern conservatives have found common ground. 
One of the most prominent groups with which Ms. Norton has been connected is the Mountain States Legal Foundation, where she worked for about four years after law school. James Watt, whose tenure as interior secretary in the Reagan administration was controversial, was Ms. Norton's mentor there. The foundation handles litigation on cases relating to property rights and federal land management in the West. 
The Sarah Scaife Foundation gave $25,000 to Mountain States in 1999, records show, although William Perry Pendley, the president and chief legal officer of Mountain States, said he did not know whether the Scaife foundation was still a donor. Mr. Pendley also emphasized that Mountain States, which received more than $2.3 million in total contributions in 1999, has thousands of individual donors, and relies heavily on small ranchers, timber operators and independent oil and gas producers. 
The Sarah Scaife Foundation has also given money to other land-use groups, including the Political Economy Research Center. In 1999, the foundation gave $177,000 to the center, the foundation's records show. Ms. Norton has done research at the center, and she remains close to its executive director, Terry Anderson, who served on the Bush-Cheney transition team on Interior Department issues.
The Castle Rock Foundation, established with the Coors fortune, has also contributed to land-use groups with which Ms. Norton has been affiliated, including the Mountain States Legal Foundation, the Political Economy Research Center and the Defenders of Property Rights. 
Castle Rock gave $35,000 to Mountain States in 1999, and $75,000 in 2000, as well as $40,000 to the Political Economy Research Center. It also gave $25,000 to the Defenders of Property Rights in 1999. 
Mountain States and other land-use groups have also been financed by mining, oil and timber interests. The legal foundation listed modest donations in 1999 of $5,000 from mining giant Phelps Dodge Corporation, $6,000 from Idaho Forest Industries Inc. and $8,000 from the Louisiana Pacific Corporation. It also received donations from a variety of groups representing contractors and ranchers. 
In 1997, Ms. Norton also helped create what is now the Council of Republicans for Environmental Advocacy to change the Republicans' image on environmental issues, but less is known about the group's finances. The group held a Washington fund-raiser in 1998, raising $100,000, according to The Washington Post. Italia Federici, a former aide to Ms. Norton who now runs the group, did not respond to repeated requests for an interview.

Amazon, Facing Slowdown, Cuts 1,300 Jobs

BYLINE:  By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Faced with a sharp downturn in its sales growth, Amazon.com said yesterday that it would close two operations centers and lay off 1,300 people, or 15 percent of its work force.
 With those job cuts, Amazon's biggest layoffs ever, the company said it expected to show an operating profit in the fourth quarter of this year. Although that does not mean Amazon will necessarily turn a profit based on conventional accounting methods, it was the first time the company promised investors a profit of any kind -- a crucial milestone in an market increasingly skeptical that online retailing is viable even for Amazon, operator of the largest Web store. 
 Three weeks ago, Amazon announced that its sales would barely meet its goal for the fourth quarter of 2000, as profit margins had fallen below target levels. Yesterday, the company released final fourth-quarter results that were slightly better than its revised projections. 
Amazon lost $545 million in the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $323 million a year earlier. The loss included charges of $339 million for writing down the value of its investments in and acquisitions of Internet companies. Sales were $972 million in the quarter, up 44 percent. Sales in 1999 increased 130 percent from 1998.
Rather than conventional measures of profits or losses, Amazon prefers investors to use its measure of "pro-forma" income, which excludes noncash charges like the cost of options and some other items. On that basis, Amazon lost $90 million, down from a loss of $185 million in 1999. That was a loss of 25 cents a share -- one cent better than analysts had expected after revising estimates in the wake of Amazon's recent warning.
The company said that its losses had fallen to 6 percent of sales in the fourth quarter, down from 26 percent of sales a year earlier. 
Amazon said yesterday that its sales for 2001 would be $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion, down from the $4 billion it had forecast last October. At that pace, Amazon's full-year sales would increase 20 percent to 30 percent. For all of 2000, its sales increased 68 percent to $2.76 billion. The company attributed the slowdown to a cooling economy and reduced consumer interest in online shopping.
Investors seemed to shrugged off the cost-cutting moves and profit promises, which came after the market closed. Amazon's shares fell 69 cents, to $18.25, in after-hours trading.
"There was nothing new," said Lauren Levitan, an analyst with Robertson Stephens. "The cuts they made are steps in the right direction, but they don't improve the fundamental economics of their business."
Ms. Levitan said the market had expected Amazon to aim for profitability by the end of this year. But she said that since the company was now forecasting an especially slow first quarter -- sales growth of 13 percent to 22 percent -- its success would depend on its performance later this year. As a result, she said, investors would see little reason to buy the company's stock.
But Anthony Noto, a Goldman Sachs analyst, said he saw the report as an indication that Amazon's profitability goal was realistic. 
"They have improved every single metric I was following," Mr. Noto said. For example, he said, inventory levels and fulfillment costs have been declining while gross profit margins have increased. And yet, Mr. Noto hardly expects Amazon's shares to take off. He has set a target price of $25 in 12 months.
To cut costs and streamline its network of operations centers, Amazon said yesterday that it would close its distribution center in McDonough, Ga., which it had opened two years ago, as well as its customer-service center in the company's home town, Seattle. The company said it would also begin operating its original warehouse, in Seattle, only during peak holiday periods. 
These moves will eliminate 450 jobs in Georgia and 400 customer service jobs in Seattle. The company planned to cut an additional 450 jobs in its headquarters. The cutbacks will result in a charge of $150 million in the first half of the year.
Seattle had been the center for a union organizing movement at Amazon, but the company said that fending off the union was not a factor in its decision to cut jobs there. Rather, Seattle has higher costs than its other service facilities in West Virginia and North Dakota, the company said. Hourly employees in Seattle and Georgia will be given the opportunity to transfer to other locations.
The company said it made an operating profit selling books, music and videos in the United States of $39 million, but lost money on other products and in overseas sales. And even the operating profit profit came at the expense of much slower sales growth, as Amazon raised book prices substantially. Sales of books, music and videos in this country grew by 11 percent, to $511 million, compared with a 82 percent growth rate a year earlier. 
"We have definitely made a choice to trade profitability for growth," Warren Jenson, Amazon's chief financial officer, said yesterday.
Amazon's other businesses in the United States, including electronics, kitchen supplies and tools, lost $56 million, down from a loss of $128 million a year earlier, even as sales more than doubled to $315 million.
Overseas, sales doubled to $145 million, but Amazon's international operations lost more money, $44 million, than in the fourth quarter of 1999, when it lost $30 million. 
With Amazon continuing to lose money, investors have been focused on how quickly the company is using its cash. In 2000, it used $265 million of its cash, of which $135 million went to capital expenses like building warehouses and buying computers. That left a year-end 2000 total of $1.1 billion in cash, with the company expecting to use an additional $200 million this year.
The year-end numbers, however, overstated Amazon's available cash. Like most retailers, it is paid immediately by customers over the holiday selling season, but has several months to pay its vendors. By the end of the current quarter, as a result, Amazon expected to have only $650 million in cash, although it expected to increase that to $900 million by the end of the year.
On a calls to investors, Mr. Jenson denied reports that the company was seeking additional financing.
"Unless we seek to raise cash to further our financial flexibility," he said, "we have no need to do so."
Amazon said that it would allow employees with stock options that are virtually worthless, because they are set at prices as high as $100, to exchange them for options at a lower price. The new option will be set at the lowest price for Amazon's shares from Jan. 1 to Feb. 14. (The lowest price so far this year is $13.88.) 
These new options will be available to sell over the next two years, rather than the five years vesting schedule Amazon has typically used. But employees who opt for the program will get fewer new option than old options. The exact ratio varies, but on average employees will get about 3 options for every four they trade in.

PITNEY BOWES ISSUES EARNINGS WARNING AND WILL CUT JOBS

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 Pitney Bowes said yesterday that it would eliminate 700 to 800 jobs and reduce its first-quarter and 2001 profit projections because the country's economic expansion is slowing and the company's technology is changing. Pitney Bowes, which makes postage meters, expects a first-quarter profit of 52 cents to 53 cents and a profit for the year of $2.35 to $2.37, its chief executive, Michael Critelli, said. 
The company, based in Stamford, Conn., plans the job cuts, which represent about 3 percent of its nonsales staff, as part of a reorganization it will announce later this quarter, Mr. Critelli said. The company also announced its fourth-quarter results and said it earned $148 million, down from $178 million a year earlier.

HEADLINE: On Way Out, Whitman Backs Newark Arena 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Jan. 30 

 BODY:
Hours before leaving her office for good, Gov. Christie Whitman announced today that she had agreed in principle to contribute $215 million in grants, loans and public financing toward a new arena in downtown Newark to house the state's professional basketball and hockey teams, the Nets and the Devils.
 The proposal, the final step in her evolution from critic to supporter of a $325 million Newark arena, does not guarantee that the Devils and the Nets will have a new home for their 2005 seasons, as the teams' owners envision. The plan must be approved by the Legislature, some of whose members angrily rebuked the governor for working out the deal without them as she was about to start her new job as head of the Environmental Protection Agency. 
 Donald T. DiFrancesco, a Republican who will become acting governor on Wednesday, indicated in a statement today that he supported the goal of a Newark arena but would work toward his own agreement. 
By putting a deal together, Mrs. Whitman moved the ball forward on a development that would be enormously important for Newark's emerging steps toward rebirth. She guaranteed that the issue would become a major one for the Legislature this year. And she raised the stakes for Mr. DiFrancesco, a candidate for governor in November who will want to be remembered neither as the man who hurt the economy of heavily Republican Bergen County by paving the way for the teams to leave the Continental Airlines Arena in the Meadowlands, nor as the man who drove the Devils from New Jersey by denying them the home they sought in Newark.
For nearly three years, Mrs. Whitman had either resisted or placed strict conditions on any state assistance in financing the arena in Newark, the state's largest city. Today, the day she was confirmed as E.P.A. administrator, Mrs. Whitman unveiled an "accord in principle" that she had reached with the owner of the New Jersey Nets and the New Jersey Devils that she said balanced her desire to keep the teams in New Jersey "without placing an undue burden on New Jersey's taxpayers."
The proposal calls for a state grant of $50 million. In addition, the accord would make the private developers of the arena eligible for $75 million in state loans and as much as $90 million in financing from local governments like the city of Newark and Essex County.
The accord also calls for the developers to sign an agreement not to compete with the state-owned Continental Arena. That arena, where the Nets and the Devils now play, would continue to be used for concerts, college sports and other entertainment. 
As recently as August, in a move that many saw as the opening salvo in negotiations with backers of a Newark arena, the Whitman administration insisted that all public financing not exceed $75 million. At that time, the YankeeNets, the owner of the Nets and the Devils, was seeking $123 million in government assistance.
In an interview before leaving her office in the State House today, Mrs. Whitman conceded that she had changed her position "to some degree" on the amount of state aid she was prepared to support. But she said her current position limited direct state aid to $50 million and provided $75 million in the form of loans that would be repaid with revenue generated by the new arena.
And while she dropped her earlier opposition to state and local support for the project, aides to the governor said she did so only after getting guarantees from the YankeeNets that no public agency would be responsible for cost overruns on the project.
"What I'm doing is outlining the financial approach that I believe is an appropriate commitment for the state of New Jersey that will allow us to keep the teams, which are important to the state," she said. "The arena is something that is looked on as being good for Newark. But I also don't believe the taxpayers should have the responsibility of building or managing it.
"So I have laid out some parameters that I believe will get us to that end," she said, "but it needs to go through, and ultimately will go through the legislative process."
Commenting on the timing of the announcement, Mrs. Whitman said: "We've been working intensely with the YankeeNets organization; it's been on again, off again. I felt I had a responsibility to bring at least my part of it to a close and set out some parameters against which the rest of the process will take place."
YankeeNets and Newark officials applauded Mrs. Whitman's decision on their behalf as something that could be the framework for a bipartisan agreement in the Legislature. But others questioned whether Mrs. Whitman's announcement would sway Mr. DiFrancesco and others in the Republican-led Senate and Assembly. In a statement today, Mr. DiFrancesco, who will remain president of the Senate while serving as acting governor, was quick to say that he had not been involved in any of the negotiations.
"While it is certainly a worthwhile goal to keep both the Nets and Devils in New Jersey, there are other priorities that must accompany any agreement with the owners," said Mr. DiFrancesco, adding that any final agreement had to involve legislative leaders and provide some relief for Bergen County residents, who would be losing the teams that help boost their economy. 
The Assembly majority leader, Paul DiGaetano, who represents the area around the Continental Arena, said he was angered because he was not included in the negotiations leading up to the agreement. "This accord can only be termed in my opinion as a suggestion by the outgoing governor to the incoming governor and nothing more," he said.
William Schuber, the Bergen County executive and, like Mrs. Whitman, a Republican, was more blunt. "Most of the politicos feel that she was no longer governor the moment the U.S. Senate voted this afternoon to confirm her," he said.
Supporters of the project praised the agreement, but their measured tones made it clear that they realized that it was more a starting point than an ending point for the Legislature. 
Harvey Schiller, the president of the YankeeNets, said in a statement that he was "extremely gratified" by the governor's announcement and that the YankeeNets remained hopeful that it could reach a final deal.
"Governor Whitman has paved the way in this critical financial area, and we now look forward to working with incoming Gov. Don DiFrancesco and leaders of the New Jersey Assembly," Mr. Schiller said.
Mayor Sharpe James of Newark said the proposal set in motion "what we hope will be a bipartisan effort to support the arena."
The Senate minority leader, Richard Codey, a Democrat and supporter of the Newark arena, merely said, "I wish it was DiFrancesco saying what she said."
Mr. Codey said he suspected that Mrs. Whitman had made the announcement on her final day at the State House as a way of keeping her word to supporters among the YankeeNets, like the philanthropist Raymond Chambers and Lewis Katz. The two men, who are both New Jersey residents, have long sought to play a role in revitalizing Newark and so far have committed their $450 million investment in the Nets organization to that end.
"They were disappointed that the governor didn't mention her support for the plan in her last budget address," Mr. Codey said. "I think she was keeping her word to them with this announcement. But it is the right thing to do."
Privately, a number of elected officials said that while Mrs. Whitman's agreement was not likely to survive intact, it provided enough leeway to allow compromise. 
But some were more skeptical, noting that this was a year in which Mr. DiFrancesco would be seeking the nomination for governor from a party whose strength is in the suburbs, not the cities, and which has many important members in Bergen County.
And it is clear that the chances for an arena in Newark will depend in part on what is done to enhance the Meadowlands if the two teams leave. 
Mr. DiGaetano, the Assembly majority leader, said the key to any compromise was a "vision of a Meadowlands complex that is something more substantial than it is now." 
He cited ideas like an amateur sports complex, restaurants and interactive family entertainment attractions. "When someone puts that sort of thing together for the Meadowlands and Continental Airlines Arena," he said, "then that is the framework for a deal."

HEADLINE: Indiana, Split by Time, Struggles Anew 

BYLINE:  By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: VEVAY, Ind., Jan. 25 

 BODY:
It might be 3 o'clock at the tiny Vevay Post Office, but across the street at Danner's Hardware it will only be 2 o'clock. 
 If it is 8 p.m. in Lonna Dilts's living room, it will already be 9 p.m. in her bedroom. 
 And at Tina and Jerry Girton's house, when the clock on his side of the bed reads 6 a.m., it will only be 5 a.m. on her side of the bed. 
"Here," says Mike Danner, the hardware store owner, with a wink, "we don't ever know what time it really is." 
The source of all this anachronism is that man-made, time-taming device: daylight saving time, a practice in which the vast majority of the country turns its clocks ahead an hour each spring and back an hour in the fall. Not Indiana, where a traditional agricultural economy and a stubborn independence streak have kept daylight saving time at bay for decades. 
But now that may be changing, with farmers and other traditional daylight saving opponents losing ground to the avatars of the high-tech economy.
Leaders of technology companies and others say they are tired of outsiders being thrown into chronic confusion over where the little hand is on an Indiana clock. And places like Vevay (pronounced vee-vee), just over the border from daylight savers Kentucky and Ohio, are in a special time warp. Folks working in Kentucky factories or ordering supplies from Cincinnati find it easier to switch to daylight saving time, known here as "fast time." People whose schedules are Indiana-centric, like children going to school or employees at local bank branches, keep their clocks the same, on "slow time."
Many families keep time both ways, unable to synchronize their watches. 
Now, the Indiana Legislature is considering a bill that would adopt daylight saving time statewide. Previous proposals have failed, but this time a well-financed coalition headed by Indiana's blooming high-tech community is leading the charge.
The Hoosier Daylight Coalition says the state's economy is suffering because befuddled Wall Street and Silicon Valley investors never know what time it is. Missed meetings, conference calls and flights to the coasts make the whole state look bush league, they say.
"It's a major impediment," said Scott A. Jones, chief executive officer of Escient Technologies, a technology management company, and founder of the coalition. "A number of companies have chosen not to locate here because of it."
John Gibbs, executive vice president of Interactive Intelligence, a software company, said confusion over time caused investment bankers from Merrill Lynch and elsewhere to miss an important conference call concerning plans to take his company public. 
"It was inconvenient, it was embarrassing, it was cumbersome," Mr. Gibbs said. "It's like, gosh, what time's Indiana on?"
The coalition also includes parents, teachers and the police, who believe more evening daylight reduces crime, and park and golf course operators, anticipating extra evening leisure time. The group has raised $200,000 and is running radio advertisements: "Sometimes, we could use a little more sunshine in our lives."
Gov. Frank L. O'Bannon, a Democrat, surprised everyone this month by endorsing this political hot potato with a split-second mention in his State of the State address.
But since most polls show about half of Indianans like the status quo, this is no easy sell. 
"Just leave the clocks where they're at," said Richard Mangus, a Republican state representative, who has bottled up daylight saving bills before. In 1995, he gummed things up with a joke amendment, proposing Indiana set its clocks half an hour ahead.
This year, Mr. Mangus said, he will propose amendments to "let each county council decide what time they want" and another to restrict daylight saving time to the Indianapolis area.
"The best way to hurt bills is to introduce something obnoxious," he said.
The legislation's opponents include farmers, who like daylight early so it can dry the fields, and who worry that working until sunset will make them miss evening community activities, said Bob Kraft, a lobbyist for the Indiana Farm Bureau. Owners of movie theaters and some restaurants also object, saying darkness helps business. 
And then there's the iconoclast lobby, the people who say: " 'We're different from the rest of the world. Everybody else is out of step,' " Mr. Kraft said.
Morton Marcus, an Indiana University economist, dismisses "the idea that people in New York can't tell what time it is and can't seem to organize their lives," adding, "What's the matter with their Palm Pilots?"
Mr. Marcus said he thought the daylight saving time push was "largely driven by the desire to play golf at night." 
When Congress imposed daylight saving time nationally in 1966, states were given the chance to exempt themselves. Only Indiana, Arizona and Hawaii opted out, but Indiana has engendered the most confusion because it essentially has three time zones. Seventy-seven of its 92 counties stay on Eastern standard time year round. Ten counties in the northwest and southwest corners of the state are on Central time, which the Indiana Legislature would be powerless to change (those counties observe daylight saving time like the rest of the Midwest). Five counties bordering Ohio follow Eastern states by setting their clocks ahead in April and back in October.
That is what happens in Rising Sun, Ind. Almost. Everyone adopts fast time except the schools, sometimes playing havoc with basketball or band schedules.
In the town of Patriot, the Patriot Pizza Parlor used to set its clocks ahead, but will not this year because its customers (mostly slow timers) would come for dinner at the restaurant's 8 p.m. closing time, thinking it was still 7 p.m.
In East Enterprise, a single building houses a fast-time post office and a slow-time bank.
And in Vevay, one can schedule a 9 a.m. dental check-up with Dr. Robert Findley and still be early for a 9 a.m. appointment with the optometrist, Dr. John Sieglitz. The Swiss immigrants who settled this inviting town of antebellum homes, county seat of Switzerland County, apparently did not import their country's exacting sense of time.
As for the daylight saving time bill, people in Vevay are, naturally, of two minds.
After all, peaceful coexistence seems rooted in the Ohio River soil. The headquarters of the Democratic and Republican Parties are right next to each other, and the Republican Party chairman owns the Democratic Party's building. 
And the newspaper publishes two editions that are exactly identical except for their names - and the fact that one (The Switzerland Democrat) is read by Democrats and the other (The Vevay Reveille-Enterprise) is read by Republicans.
The editor, Patrick Lanman, says that subscribers to The Reveille-Enterprise actually call to complain if they get a Democrat by mistake, and if the drugstore is out of Democrats, people will go to another store, rather than simply picking up a Reveille-Enterprise.
As if in deference to the two time zones, the clock on the old courthouse was stopped for many years, frozen at 9:36 a.m.
Dr. Fidelia Valenzuela, a semiretired family practitioner, would like the clocks to be consistent. When she had a full-time practice with her husband, they set their clocks on slow time in the morning and fast time in the afternoon, "so we could get home earlier," she said.
Since the television stations come from Cincinnati, the television schedule is on fast time, and they miss favorite programs until they adjust.
But Janna Pavy is happy the way things are, even though her kitchen clock stays on slow time; her husband, Gary, who works for a subsidiary of an Ohio plastics factory, sets the bedroom clock on fast time; and "we fight over the clock in the living room."
Ms. Pavy, a dental technician for the slow time dentist, Dr. Findley, said patients on fast time schedule 5:30 p.m. appointments, "and it's only 4:30 p.m. here, so we can get in quite a few people that way. I kind of want it to stay."
And Ann Mulligan, executive director of the welcome center, is appropriately ambivalent. 
"I have mixed emotions about switching because it's kind of quirky, and in tourism that's good because people laugh and talk about it," she said. "Although they're always here at the wrong time, and it drives tour groups to distraction, I'm somewhat reluctant to admit it, but in a way I'd miss it like this."

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about Indiana's reluctance to adopt daylight saving time referred incorrectly to the counties that go on Eastern Daylight. Three of them border Kentucky, not all five; two border Ohio.

MANHATTAN: NEW M.T.A. CHIEF
Peter S. Kalikow, 58, a real estate developer and former owner of The New York Post, was nominated as chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority yesterday by Gov. George E. Pataki. Mr. Kalikow's nomination was expected but is subject to confirmation by the State Senate. He has been M.T.A. vice chairman since the fall of 1999 and would succeed E. Virgil Conway, 71, chairman since 1995, who announced recently that he would step down. (NYT)

ALBANY: TAX-FREE COMPUTERS
Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader of the State Senate, said yesterday that he was distressed to find that New York ranked in the bottom third of the nation in the percentage of homes with computers. He and the Senate Republicans said the state should pick a week in August, before the school year begins, when the state's 4 percent sales tax and municipal sales taxes would not apply to sales of complete home computer systems. There was no immediate comment from the Democrat-controlled Assembly. (AP)

NEW CITY: NEW BALLOT LEGISLATION
A bill that would eliminate the possibility of a "hanging chad" controversy in Rockland County was introduced yesterday. The measure would replace the punch card system for absentee ballots with an optical scan system like the one used to grade standardized tests in school. The legislation, sponsored by Ryan Karben, who heads the Democratic majority on the County Legislature, would also call for mailing sample ballots to voters before an election. (AP)

QUEENS: CHILDREN FALL THROUGH ICE
Police officers and paramedics pulled five children out of a frigid pond in Jamaica yesterday after they fell through the ice, the authorities said. The children, four girls and a boy ages 11 to 14, walked out onto Baisley Pond Park around 4:50 p.m., but several feet from shore, the ice cracked and they fell in, said Officer Guy Braun, a police spokesman. Officers from the police Emergency Services Unit pulled two of the children out and onto a raft, and the other three were rescued by officers and emergency medical technicians on the shore, the authorities said. All five were treated at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center and released. Andy Newman (NYT)

MANHATTAN: ROBBERY SERIES SUSPECTED
A Brooklyn man linked to several robberies in Lower Manhattan over the last two months was arrested on Monday after an investigation, the police said. The man, Lerun Nightingale, 29, has a history of theft and assault, the police said. He has been robbing people, often at knifepoint, in Greenwich Village and adjacent neighborhoods since early December, the authorities said. Diane Cardwell (NYT)

CONNECTICUT

STAMFORD: SHORELINE PRESERVATION
Environmental advocates have asked the state government to create a program that would preserve undeveloped sections of Connecticut's shoreline. The Audubon Society of New York State and Connecticut, Save the Sound Inc. and the Regional Plan Association presented lawmakers on Monday with a report compiled after 10 public forums held last summer on the future of Long Island Sound. It calls for the creation of a reserve and financing for research, protection and restoration. (AP)

NEW JERSEY

HACKENSACK: SHERIFF'S PLEA AGREEMENT
The Bergen County prosecutor says he may ask a judge to throw out a plea agreement with the former sheriff, Joseph L. Ciccone, who admitted to corruption charges on Jan. 11 and agreed to step down but then angered the prosecutor by seeking an immediate pension. The prosecutor, William H. Schmidt, said that he had agreed to let Mr. Ciccone, 40, seek a standard pension, effective at age 55, for his 17 years in law enforcement, but that Mr. Ciccone sought a pension, effective immediately, for a disability that he has not specified. Steve Strunsky (NYT)

PASSAIC: ELECTION REFORMS
A court-appointed election monitor for Passaic County reported progress yesterday in eliminating bias against Hispanics, but said more work needed to be done. Walter Timpone, a former federal prosecutor named to oversee elections, noted such success as the relative absence of intimidation at polling places. But he also said that some county election officials had resisted reforms, and that he planned to oversee school elections in April, municipal elections in May and elections in November for freeholder, sheriff and governor. Steve Strunsky (NYT)

ATLANTIC CITY: CLARIDGE HOTEL BID PLAN
Casino regulators have cleared the plan of Atlantic City's biggest casino operator, Park Place Entertainment, to buy the Claridge Casino Hotel, which has been operating under bankruptcy protection since last year. Although Park Place already owns three large casinos, the state Casino Control Commission, in a 5-to-0 vote, decided that the purchase would not give Park Place an unfair edge over its competitors. Sands Hotel and Casino has offered $85.8 million for Claridge, or nearly $3 million more than the Park Place bid. Sands has objected to Park Place's involvement. A federal bankruptcy judge will decide which offer better serves bondholders and employees. Andrew Jacobs (NYT)

TRENTON: PARENTAL LEAVE BILL
A bill that would provide paid parental leave to workers has won support from many Democrats and some Republicans in both the State Assembly and Senate, supporters say. The New Jersey A.F.L.-C.I.O. and other groups announced support of the bill on Monday. The bill would give workers up to 12 weeks of unemployment pay out of the state's Unemployment Insurance Fund if the parents wanted to spend time with their new child. Businesses would still have to contribute to the state's unemployment fund while the employee was on leave. (NYT)

HEADLINE: Revlon Debt Relief 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Revlon Inc. said yesterday that its main unit had agreed to pay a $1.6 million fee and higher interest rates on its loans to be released from requirements that will free up some cash and make it less likely the company will default on the debt. Under the terms of the amendment, Revlon's lenders, led by J. P. Morgan Chase & Company, will permit the company to sell plants it is closing and retain the proceeds rather than pay down bank debt. Revlon said last November that it would cease manufacturing at plants in Mississauga, Ontario, and Phoenix, Ariz.; shift production to Oxford, N.C., and lay off more than 1,000 workers in an attempt to bolster profitability.

HEADLINE: Nokia Lowers Estimates Because of Flat Earnings 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: LONDON, Jan. 30 

 BODY:
Nokia of Finland, the largest maker of mobile phones, warned today that handset sales for the entire industry would slow this year from earlier estimates as consumers bide their time in expectation of next-generation services that will not come to market for months.
 Nokia's trimmed-back estimates come on the heels of a similarly dampened forecast by its big Swedish rival, Ericsson, and reinforce concerns that the break-neck growth is abating at a crucial juncture. 
 Nokia warned that profits in the first quarter would be flat compared with year-ago levels as it cuts mobile phone prices to gain market share. It also said global handset sales for all of 2001 might range between 500 million and 550 million, although its chief executive, Jorma J. Ollila said during a conference call with analysts that he expected the level to be closer to the bottom end of that range. 
"We just don't know exactly what is going to happen," Mr. Ollila said, adding that the level of uncertainty had been magnified by the economic slowdown in the United States.
To some, the message was clear. "The headline is: Game Over, atleast for the next few quarters," said Thomas Langer, an analyst with WestLB Panmure in London.
Shares of Nokia tumbled in trading in Helsinki before recovering to end down nearly 7 percent, at 37.12 euros ($34.40). In New York, American depository receipts of Nokia closed down 6 percent, to $34.83.
Still, Nokia indicated it would not pursue a retrenchment recently announced by Ericsson, which on Friday said it would farm out all its handset production. Nokia, which derives 70 percent of sales and more than 80 percent of operating profit from mobile phones, said it would become more aggressive to protect its already outsized market share.
"Manufacturing is a core business for us and a key competitive advantage," said a Nokia spokesman, Tapio Hedman, adding that Nokia has no plans to contract out much more than the 10 percent of its handset volumes.
Even though Nokia's handset margins are expected to fall to 20 percent by year-end, compared with 21.3 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, that is still far higher than levels reached by rivals, and gives Nokia room to be more aggressive, analysts said.
"Nokia is saying let's leverage our powerful balance sheet and squeeze some marginal players out of the market," said Wojtek Uzdelewicz, an analyst with Bear, Stearns. "That's probably the best strategy right now. Even if this costs Nokia some profits in the near term."
Nokia also reported strong fourth-quarter and full-year profits today that matched analysts' estimates.
The fundamental problem facing Nokia and Ericsson, as well as Motorola of the United States is that the furious sales growth rates for handsets have tapered off as the global penetration rate of mobile phone subscribers reached 12 percent last year. Picking up the slack was to be a range of next-generation digital services that require specially designed handsets.
But with the rollout of these new services taking longer than initially expected, mobile phone companies are facing a lull, analysts said.
"We're facing a new product vacuum," Mr. Uzdelewicz said.
Mr. Hedman of Nokia denied that product introductions were behind schedule and said that the company was meeting targets of introducing next-generation handsets by the third quarter, with sales of the handsets expected to reach millions of units by the fourth quarter. "Every new technology has its challenges," Mr. Hedman said. "But we see no unexpected problems."

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Europe's Technological Elite Discreetly Grins at U.S. Dot-Com Woes

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 30 

 BODY:
The bursting of the Internet bubble last year has brought with it some changes in the pecking order at the World Economic Forum here, which concluded today. 
 Gone are many of the United States-based dot-com executives who have in recent years preached that "the Internet changes everything." Humbled also are members of the Silicon Valley technology elite who have played an increasingly visible role here but are now facing severe cutbacks. 
 In their place is a resurgent high-technology Europe, feeling increasingly confident, buoyed by a strengthened economy, and less inclined to take a backseat to the United States in technology leadership. Indeed, this year at Davos, the Europeans seemed to be openly enjoying Silicon Valley's economic pratfall. 
"This year, there is definitely less lecturing and less arrogance from the Americans," said Erkki Liikanen, a Finnish member of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union and a technology expert. 
"Two years ago you couldn't walk the corridors here without seeing someone from a dot-com company," said Moises Naim, editor of Foreign Policy magazine. "This year we don't see as many of them. Europe did not have a boom and thus it did not have the same distortions, and it is less exposed to the volatility of the market." 
Of course, this is not the first time that America's lead in information technology has been challenged. In the late 1980's Silicon Valley executives were deeply discouraged by Japanese semiconductor competitors, who seemed on the brink of capturing the world chip market. The Japanese threat receded, however, when American control of microprocessor standards came to the fore and the Japanese encountered stiff competition in memory chips in the rest of Asia, the United States and Europe. 
Organizers of the conference each year invite a few thousand national leaders, business executives and other notables to this Swiss ski village. At this year's conference, the high-technology elite included John Chambers, chief executive of Cisco Systems; William H. Gates, co-founder and chairman of Microsoft; and Michael Dell, chairman and chief executive of Dell Computer. 
The Americans spent much of the time here debating whether their economy would have a soft or hard landing. 
And the Japanese remain mired in their extended economic slump, leading Fukushiro Nukaga, a former cabinet member responsible for economic and fiscal policy, to project annual growth straining to rise above 1 percent. 
It was left to the Europeans to look most optimistically toward the future, with a common currency scheduled to go into day-to-day use next year and a combined market that will be as large as that of the United States. 
"There are certain natural advantages that Europe will have in the next era," said Anthony B. Perkins, editor in chief of Red Herring, a Silicon Valley magazine that focuses on the venture capital business. 
New opportunities in Europe the last year have led to an influx of blue-chip Silicon Valley venture capital firms like Accel Partners, Benchmark Capital and Draper Fisher, which have opened offices in Europe. 
A leading American venture capitalist, Ann Winblad, said she was stunned recently to learn of the $75 million bailout of a British consumer e-commerce firm, letsbuyit.com, which was in receivership -- something that she said would not have happened in the United States, given the current market climate. 
"I think you could say that Europe is back," said Laurent Fabius, minister of economy, finance and industry of France, where job growth in 2000 reached its highest level in years. "The size of the European market makes it more and more independent from external demand." 
The new European mind-set is one of focusing on the potential of the Internet as intently as it had taken hold earlier in the United States.
Paul Saffo, a veteran Silicon Valley technology consultant from the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif., remarked, "This is the first year in the past five years where I haven't been approached by a French academic who tried to tell me, 'You know this Internet will never amount to anything.' "
Indeed, a unified approach to technical standards by the Europeans seems to be giving them a significant advantage in a coming second era of the Internet, which will focus on mobile wireless and interactive television. 
European Internet use rose this month to 28 percent of all households from 18 percent in March 2000, putting the Europeans about a year and a half behind the United States, but growing far more quickly, Mr. Liikanen said.
The Europeans already have the greatest penetration of cellular phones as a percentage of the population of any region of the world, and they seem to be adapting to consumer technologies like smart cards and embedded microprocessors more quickly than the United States, Mr. Perkins said. 
Quicker growth in information technology occurred across the board in 2000; Revenue at IBM Europe, for instance, rose 18 percent last year while I.B.M. in the United States grew only 8 percent. 
Despite the new European strength, significant areas of American superiority prevail. For example, Europe still does not match the United States in the culture of entrepreneurial risk-taking, according to the venture capitalist and Internet exponent Esther Dyson. 
"The American attitude is let's make a few mistakes because we'll learn from them," Ms. Dyson said. "The tendency in Europe is to wait for enabling legislation." 
And while Europe and the United States are both ethnically and racially diverse, some people here say that the United States has done a far better job in capitalizing on the skills of immigrants. 
"We have been able to attract immigrants in low-end jobs," said Lucio Stanca, chairman of IBM Europe. "But if an immigrant dreams of becoming an engineer, he dreams of going to California."

HEADLINE: Political Memo; 
The Annual Cut-and-Restore Budget Game Begins

BYLINE:  By ERIC LIPTON 

 BODY:
It is a city where luxury apartments sell for more than $10 million, where a meal for two, without too much effort, can end with a $250 bill, and where the municipal government closed out last fiscal year with a pool of extra cash totaling $3.2 billion -- more than the annual budget of Wyoming.
 So how could Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani put out a new spending plan last week, advocates for the poor ask, that slashes weekend meals for the elderly, after-school programs for city youths and legal aid to impoverished families facing eviction, among dozens of other cuts to welfare and cultural programs? 
 Mr. Giuliani, chipper after a quick weekend trip to Tampa, Fla., for the Super Bowl, had an unapologetic response yesterday, brashly exposing a venerable City Hall budgeting tactic that his administration employed once again this year, one that his critics reluctantly admitted is frustratingly successful. 
"This is a game we play every year, if you have not figured it out yet," the mayor said with a snicker. "We take things out of the budget, we put them back."
The goal of this annual "mindless dance," as the mayor called it: start off the budget debate with a generous round of cuts so the legion of lobbyists and the 51 members of the City Council focus their energy on restoring the money, instead of pushing for more. 
"In order to make sure the budget does not grow by 7 percent, 8 percent, 10, 12 percent, that is what you do," Mr. Giuliani said, estimating that he saves taxpayers several hundred million dollars a year. "Every year you have to be willing, if you are the mayor, to have a good sense of humor and have The New York Times and The Post and The Daily News and everybody else write that you are cutting pacemakers for people and you are putting old people in the zoo or something. I mean it is ridiculous, it is ridiculous."
Advocates for the poor and City Council leaders were in agreement yesterday with Mr. Giuliani on one point. The process is ridiculous, they said.
"It creates at least one economic benefit: a great deal of hiring of lobbyists," said Councilman Herbert E. Berman, chairman of the Council's Finance Committee.
But Mr. Berman and others were also unanimous in their disgust with the annual invitation to the mayor's dance, which they said was harmful to the dozens of nonprofit community groups and city agencies threatened with cuts, because they cannot properly plan their programs.
"It is like we have been going to dance lessons for eight years," said Michelle L. Yanche, staff director at the Neighborhood Family Services Coalition, which represents organizations that serve city youths. "We all know our steps. But I would love to never go to this dance again."
The cut-and-restore tradition goes back to well before Mr. Giuliani arrived at City Hall, since it was also a favorite of Mayors Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins. Mr. Berman said he remembered that Mr. Dinkins proposed slashing the animal feed budget at a city zoo one year, which was restored by the time the budget was adopted. 
"What were we going to do: let the animals starve," Mr. Berman said, "or let them loose to wander the street and feed on live people?"
Mr. Giuliani has left the zoo food alone. But his $39.32 billion spending plan for the 2002 fiscal year, released Thursday, has tens of millions of dollars in proposed cuts, most of which, Council members said, would be restored: $19.2 million to city museums and cultural groups, $20 million in health programs, $19.7 million in youth programs, $6.5 million in City University of New York scholarships, $4 million for drug treatment and mental health services, among others.
Some cuts reflect perennial political battles, like the repeated effort by the mayor and his Human Resources Administration to curtail support for the Legal Aid Society of New York, which is paid by the city to defend poor families facing eviction, yet at the same time often takes the city to court.
"For some inexplicable reason, Human Resources seems to think that preventing evictions promotes dependency," said Steven Banks, deputy attorney in charge of Legal Aid's civil division, who again and again has fought successfully to have grants for legal aid restored.
In some cases, the proposed cuts are relatively severe, such as the 66 percent reduction in grants to more than 300 city cultural groups, ranging from the Dance Theater of Harlem to the Big Apple Circus. Ms. Yanche estimated that the plan would take a 25 percent cut in youth services, from after-school recreational activities to anti-dropout efforts.
Money for an evening center for teenagers in Forest Hills, Queens -- as well as a staff that goes out to street corners to encourage youths to join basketball and street hockey leagues -- would be eliminated, as would a college-counseling and career-planning program in Red Hook, Brooklyn, for former high school dropouts, Ms. Yanche said, citing two examples.
"It certainly makes it very difficult for us to argue for anything beyond restoration," she said.
The most intense reaction so far has concerned the mayor's proposal to cut services for the elderly, including a new weekend meal program that was started after city staff members noticed that some were coming to senior centers on Fridays with brown bags to stash away food.
"In a city of such wealth, you have many seniors who live on $3 a day after they pay for food and rent," said Bobbie Sackman, director of public policy at the Council of Senior Centers and Services. "Here we are offering them a meal for the weekend, and it is being cut. It is shocking. I think it outrageous."
Ultimately, all of the politicians at City Hall benefit from this budget dance, said Glenn Pasanen, associate director of City Project, a budget watchdog group. After the months of lobbying and rallies on the steps of City Hall, the Council gets credit for restoring the money.
"The mayor is setting a brush fire, which the Council is content to put out in the name of progress," Mr. Pasanen said. "It is absurd."

HEADLINE: Bush and Fox Hope Nations Will Become Better Amigos 

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 30 

 BODY:
Americans have long seen Mexico as a river of illegal drugs and immigrants flowing north. But if the nations' two new leaders have their way, it may soon be seen as a fountain of energy, labor and trade.
 Presidents Bush and Vicente Fox will meet on Feb. 16 at Mr. Fox's ranch, in Mr. Bush's first border crossing as commander in chief. They have more in common than a taste for cowboy boots and enchiladas. Both have ideas that could transform the political and economic relationship between the superpower and the striving nation to the south. 
 "Our common border is no longer a line that divides us, but a region that unites our nations, reflecting our common aspirations, values and culture," the secretary of state, Gen. Colin L. Powell, said today in Washington at his first news conference, held jointly with the new Mexican foreign minister, Jorge Casteneda.
Seeing the border as a symbol of unity, calling Mexico and the United States next-door neighbors with common needs and intertwined fates, has been long been Mr. Fox's political refrain. It is a fairly new tune for American foreign policy, but the changes, symbolic and substantial, are already happening.
Mr. Bush wants to greatly expand trade across the border, calling commerce "the long-term solution" for illegal immigration. Both presidents say that if Mexico's economy becomes stronger, fewer Mexicans will head north looking for work.
"The thing that really has to be done to solve this problem is to continue to help the Mexican economy grow, so that jobs are in the south, so that the great magnet is no longer just in the north, but it is also within Mexico," General Powell said today.
Since Mr. Fox's election six months ago, illegal migration has fallen off along the border, from California to Texas, if the plummeting number of arrests is any sign. 
But millions of Mexicans work illegally north of the border, and American labor leaders and senior Republican senators, as well as the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, say it is time to legalize them. 
The goal should be to let them "come into America legally to work, have their rights protected and accumulate human and financial capital to take back to Mexico," said Sen. Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican.
Mexico is sending more than sweat and muscle: on Monday, it started selling 50 megawatts a day of electricity to California, enough to power 50,000 homes, to help the state in its energy crisis. That Americans would turn to Mexico for something so basic could be a harbinger of something big. 
Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have been talking for months about the need for a hemispheric energy policy -- "an approach that looks at all of North America as one giant market," as Mr. Cheney put it. If both sides agree, the United States could invest in Mexican power plants and get cheap electricity in return.
There is even talk in Washington of ending the annual rite of certification -- a political process, which Mexico finds humiliating, in which the White House weighs whether the Mexicans are doing their part in the war on drugs. 
It did not hurt that Mexico's Supreme Court had just ruled that hundreds of drug suspects may be extradited from Mexican jails by American law enforcement agencies.
All this is music to Mr. Fox's politically attuned ears. He wants it all to happen -- and more, much more. In time, he says, the two nations can be so integrated, economically and politically, that the border would be more like the common wall of adjoining homes and less like a militarized frontier.
It may not be that wild an idea. Mexico is "the house next door," Mr. Greenspan argued at a closed meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in 1995, when Mexico's economy was near collapse and the Fed stepped in with a multibillion-dollar bailout.
"The house catches on fire, and cinders going in our direction threaten to burn our house down," he said, according to transcripts of the internal debates released last week. "Can we say we are not going to help them put out the fire?"

HEADLINE: Wrong Way on Energy 

 BODY:
In his opening days in office, President Bush has taken on a number of issues such as taxes and education with discipline and an appearance of growing confidence. Perhaps for that reason he believes that California's energy crisis has given him the hot hand for rolling back environmental standards and pressing his shortsighted campaign to open the 1.5-million-acre coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration. It hardly signals a balanced approach to put Vice President Dick Cheney, also an oil man, in charge of a task force aimed at developing an energy strategy to reduce America's "reliance on foreign oil" and "bring more energy into the marketplace." Mr. Bush made clear that legislation asking Congress to open the refuge would be an essential component of that strategy. 
 The president is certainly right on one point. The country needs a rational energy strategy that, as he also noted, encourages energy conservation as well as responsible exploration. But the first step in that strategy should not be to start punching holes in the Arctic Refuge. Even with improved drilling technologies, Mr. Bush's plan to open the refuge is as environmentally unsound and intellectually shaky as it was when Ronald Reagan suggested it 20 years ago and when Mr. Bush's father suggested it a decade ago. 
 For starters, it is wholly specious to suggest, as Mr. Bush does, a connection between opening the refuge and California's energy problems. Less than 1 percent of California's electricity comes from oil. California's fuel of choice is natural gas, and if Mr. Bush wants to find natural gas, there are far better places than the coastal plain to look for it. One such place is Alaska's North Slope, which includes far bigger proven natural gas reserves than even the most optimistic estimates for the coastal plain. Another is the National Petroleum Reserve, to the west of Prudhoe Bay, where former Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt made available over four million acres for leasing.
To date, the oil and gas companies have shown little interest in the reserve and no interest in investing in the necessary infrastructure to transport natural gas from the North Slope. So it is outrageous for them to clamor for access to the pristine lands of the refuge at a time when they have barely begun to tap the significant resources in areas of far less ecological value.
Finally, as this page has noted many times before, the relatively trivial amounts of recoverable oil in the refuge cannot possibly justify the potential corruption of a unique and irreplaceable natural area. While government estimates of "technically recoverable" oil in the coastal plain run as high as 14 billion barrels, the amount of "economically recoverable" oil at today's prices -- the only figure the oil industry itself pays any attention to -- is a little over three million barrels. That is about six months' supply for the nation. A much larger amount, in conjunction with a grave national-security emergency, would be needed to consider even the environmentally sensitive drilling of which Mr. Bush speaks. 
Before the California energy crisis blew up, the environmental community was reasonably confident that a coalition of Democrats and moderate Republicans in both the Senate and House could defeat, albeit narrowly, any effort to open the refuge to drilling. These calculations could change if, as now seems possible, Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney decide to make opening the refuge a matter of party loyalty. 
If they do, Congress, particularly the moderate Republicans, should turn a deaf ear. What Congress should insist on instead is a comprehensive energy strategy that emphasizes conservation as well as exploration and does not rely on old cliches like "freeing America" from foreign oil -- an impossibility under any circumstances -- or on unnecessary invasions of fragile public lands.
It should not be impossible to fashion a plausible exploration program that satisfies both environmental and energy needs. But the Bush administration is plainly going to need guidance from an energized environmental community to get there.

HEADLINE: SURPLUS ESTIMATE HITS $5.6 TRILLION 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30 

 BODY:
Even as projections of the federal budget surplus were revised upward once again, the Bush administration squared off with Democrats today over whether the government can afford everything the new president promised during the campaign, from a big tax cut to a national missile defense system.
 Despite growing concern about an economic downturn that could put a crimp on tax revenues this year, the Congressional Budget Office informed members of Congress late today that it expects the surplus to swell to $5.610 trillion over the next decade, in line with estimates that have been circulating on Capitol Hill for weeks. 
 The new projection, which is to be released officially on Wednesday, is $1 trillion higher than the budget office's previous estimate, in July, and about $600 billion more than the Clinton administration's final projection, which was released last month.
Of the total projected surplus of $5.610 trillion, $2.488 trillion would come from the Social Security system, the budget office said, and by agreement of the two parties will be off limits for tax cuts or additional spending. The remainder, $3.122 trillion over the next 10 years, is up for grabs as Congress awaits the administration's budget proposal and begins developing tax and spending plans of its own. 
Even before the budget office disclosed the new surplus figures, administration officials said that President Bush's plan for a $1.6 trillion tax cut over the next decade and his calls for more spending on the military, health care and education could all be accommodated comfortably without any risk to the government's fiscal health.
"We are seeing a government that is awash in surplus money, even with an economy that is softening from where it used to be," Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, said.
Speaking after a meeting with Republican leaders at the White House, Mr. Bush said, "Taxes must fit into a budget, which they will."
The budget office's projections suggested that the government would be able to pay off as much of the national debt held by the public as is possible to redeem easily -- all but about $800 billion of the total $3.4 trillion in debt held by the public -- within the next decade.
The projections assume that the economy will grow 2.4 percent this year, and then rebound next year to a 3.4 percent growth rate before easing off to slightly more than 3 percent for the rest of the decade.
Those assumptions are markedly more optimistic than the budget office's previous forecasts, and reflect a growing consensus among economists that the economy's long-term potential has improved because of heavy investments in technology.
Democrats acknowledged that the bigger surplus estimate would make it easier for Mr. Bush to sell his tax plan, which includes a reduction in all income tax rates, a break for two-income couples, doubling the child credit and repealing the estate tax. 
Senator Max S. Baucus of Montana, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said after meeting with Mr. Bush this evening that there was general agreement that "an across-the-board tax cut makes sense and a significant tax cut makes sense."
But Mr. Baucus and Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, the senior Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said they had told Mr. Bush that the size of the tax cut should be determined by how much money is available after budgeting for other needs, including education, cutting the national debt and putting Social Security and Medicare on sound fiscal footing.
Mr. Baucus said there would have to be a compromise between Mr. Bush's $1.6 trillion plan and the desire of many Democrats to hold the tax cut to the $800 billion range.
Seeking to head off the considerable momentum toward a tax cut as big as Mr. Bush is seeking -- or bigger -- other Democrats said that the surplus was not as big as it looked, given the claims staked on it by both parties.
They warned of a feeding frenzy of tax cuts and spending that could leave the government in deficit again, especially if the budget office's projections prove to be too optimistic.
"The great risk here is that fiscal discipline gets abandoned," said Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the senior Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee.
Mr. Conrad and Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said that Congress and Mr. Bush have only about $2.5 trillion available for tax cuts and new spending initiatives -- and that there is a significant risk that the two parties and Congress could burn through that money and more this year.
Beyond taking Social Security's $2.488 trillion surplus off the table, they said, there is a bipartisan consensus in Congress that the surplus generated by Medicare -- about $400 billion -- should also be considered off limits for tax cuts or spending.
They then listed a series of other initiatives that they said are all but certain to eat up at least $200 billion more of the surplus, including increased military spending and an array of tax breaks. 
After taking into account $300 billion to $400 billion in additional interest costs the government would face if the surplus were used for anything other than reducing the national debt, they said, Mr. Bush's tax plan would leave little or nothing for initiatives like providing prescription drug coverage to retirees and increasing spending on education.
White House officials said they see the numbers differently. For one thing, they said, Mr. Bush did not agree that the Medicare surplus should be taken out of the budget. They also said that Mr. Bush would not settle on how much he would request in more military spending until the Pentagon has completed a top-to-bottom review of its long-term needs.
"There is ample room for the president's priorities," said a senior White House official.
