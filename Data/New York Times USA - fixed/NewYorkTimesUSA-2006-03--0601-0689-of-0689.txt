HEADLINE: After 5 Terms as Newark Mayor, James Opts Not to Run Again

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE; Josh Benson and Tina Kelley contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: NEWARK, March 27 

 BODY:
Mayor Sharpe James entered his sixth race for mayor 11 days ago with the flourish of a Las Vegas heavyweight, arriving at City Hall astride a police bicycle to deliver his petitions in gym shorts. He dropped out on Monday, with a letter delivered to the city clerk only minutes before the ballots were to be sent to the printer.
 Mr. James, who has also been a state senator since 1999, said he was stepping down because he was ''an opponent of dual office holding'' and wanted to focus on state issues. He emphasized that he thought he would have won the May 9 election if he remained in the race because Newark is better off now than when he was first elected in 1986.
''Under my leadership Newark has climbed the rough side of the mountain and has become a renaissance city with pride, prosperity and progress,'' he wrote. ''Newark is now a destination city with planned programs and economic projects that will surface over the next decade.'' 
 His decision ended weeks of uncertainty about his intentions, upended the race for mayor, and signaled the end of his 20-year tenure. During that time, Newark, a city of 280,000 once synonymous with urban failure, saw a revival of its downtown, even as crime, bad schools and poverty continued to afflict its neighborhoods. 
 Mr. James, 70, one of the last of the big-city mayors to come out of the civil rights movement, ran Newark with a mixture of boosterism and hard-edged machine politics that rewarded loyalty. In the process, he built a formidable political organization that could determine the outcome of statewide races. 
 The mayor was again facing a determined challenge from Cory Booker, a former member of the Municipal Council who lost to Mr. James four years ago by 6 percentage points. His withdrawal clears the way for a face-off between Mr. Booker and State Senator Ronald L. Rice, the deputy mayor and a James loyalist. 
 ''Sharpe James is really the last of that group of New Jersey politicians that came to power as a result of the Newark riots,'' said the Rev. Reginald Jackson, executive director of the Black Ministers Council of New Jersey, who said the mayor would leave a mixed record. ''It's the end of a major era in the life of the city, because I'm not sure anyone now has the capacity to put together a machine like Sharpe James did. He dominated the politics of Essex County and, in some major ways, the state.'' 
 Mr. James grew up poor on Howard Street in the city's South Ward. A teacher before entering politics, he started his civic career as a member of the Municipal Council in 1970. After defeating Newark's first black mayor, Kenneth Gibson, in 1986, he developed a reputation for being the impoverished city's most exuberant cheerleader. 
 He presided over the construction of a gleaming performing arts center that opened to rave reviews in 1997, a minor league baseball park, new housing and the demolition of crime-ridden high-rise housing projects. His most recent effort is now under construction -- a $310 million downtown arena that will become home to the New Jersey Devils hockey team.
 Clement Price, a Rutgers historian who teaches a course about this mostly black city, said the mayor deserved credit for using his power to help Newark ''recalibrate its image'' after the 1967 riots. 
 ''He will be remembered as one of the leading figures who successfully slowed down and all but stopped Newark's slide into invisibility,'' Mr. Price said.
 His administration suffered several scandals along the way. His police chief went to prison in 1996 after being convicted of embezzling $30,000 from city accounts. A year later, his chief of staff was convicted of taking kickbacks for contracts with the city after investigators found $157,000 under floorboards in his home. The Housing Authority, after a federal audit last year, was ranked as one of the most troubled in the nation.
 Mr. James's approach to politics was also put on display in the Oscar-nominated 2005 documentary ''Street Fight,'' which portrayed Mr. James and his supporters as up-from-the-street brawlers who intimidated opponents and sought to label Mr. Booker as an interloper who was not black enough to run the city. 
 The mayor's withdrawal shocked some supporters. The Rev. Perry Simmons, pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church, said, ''I'm saddened because I considered him a friend. He will now be moving on to do other things, and I liked the work he was doing.'' 
 Anthony Gamble, 54, a sanitation worker who was shopping downtown yesterday, said he did not understand why the mayor would step aside.''I love Sharpe,'' he said. 
 Others in Newark rejoiced at the prospect of change. At Mr. Booker's headquarters less than a mile from City Hall, passing cars and motorcycles honked in celebration of the mayor's announcement. 
 Mr. Booker offered measured praise for his former opponent. ''I have tremendous respect for the longevity of the career of Sharpe James, which is still continuing today in the State Senate,'' he said.
 Mr. Rice said in an interview at City Hall that he planned to defend the mayor's record against Mr. Booker. ''This is takeover time, and those of us who have been around for a long time understand that,'' he said. 
 Mr. Jackson, who remained neutral in 2002 and this year, was less deferential to the mayor. He pointed out that Mr. James leaves behind a city with failing schools and entrenched poverty. Though he was elected 20 years ago on a promise to improve living conditions for a city he then described as ''two-thirds poor, one-third struggling to make a living,'' little has changed for many of the city's residents. 
 One-third of Newark's children still grow up in poor families, according to state figures. The unemployment rate of nearly 11 percent is roughly twice the state average, and the median household income of $26,000 makes Newark poorer than every other major American city except Miami, according to 2004 census figures.
 ''The legacy of Sharpe James will be a mixed legacy,'' Mr. Jackson said.
 The mayor emphasized in his letter that his administration demolished thousands of units in ''failed public high-rise housing projects'' and replaced them with new housing that ''citizens are now fighting to get into.'' He also seemed to be leaving somewhat reluctantly. He took several swipes at Mr. Booker for being ''a highly paid outsider'' who was ''invisible, inactive, a 'no show' at community events.'' 
 Mr. Booker did not offer a response. Ellis Cose, who has written several books about racial and urban issues, said that Mr. James would probably keep fighting as long as the public would let him. 
 ''He represents a dying breed of these old time black politicians who came to power largely off of issues of race and who cling to power largely with issues of race,'' he said. ''Sharpe James represents big city machine politics -- he's the last of a breed.''

 BODY:

Triumph of the Will
 Last week, Warner Home Video brought out a superb set of Busby Berkeley musicals from the 1930's; this week, Synapse Films is re-releasing in a slightly upgraded version its edition of Leni Riefenstahl's ''Triumph of the Will,'' by far the most notorious Nazi propaganda film. The coincidence is too suggestive to ignore. Ever since Susan Sontag linked Riefenstahl's Nazi ''documentaries'' (the films were, in fact, as carefully staged as any Hollywood feature) with their geometrically arranged goose-stepping soldiers to the extravagant fantasies of Berkeley's mammoth dance numbers, many critics have assumed a kinship between the filmmakers. 
Berkeley's abstract musical numbers, with their own geometric patterns and tendency to absorb individuals into standardized, idealized groups, seem to apply the characteristics Sontag listed in her essay ''Fascinating Fascism'': situations of control, submissive behavior, endurance of pain, domination through pageantry, turning people into things, multiplications and ''orgiastic transactions between mighty forces and their puppets.'' Rather than smartly tailored military uniforms, Berkeley placed his performers in scanty costumes that emphasized the symmetry of legs and bosoms; the uniform platinum wigs that many of his chorines wore invite comparison with the caps and helmets of Hitler's massed forces at the Nuremberg rallies filmed by Riefenstahl in 1934 (filmed one year after Berkeley's best film for Warner Brothers, ''Footlight Parade''). 
 The resemblances are striking: ''Triumph of the Will'' is, effectively, a series of extravagantly staged production numbers played out on massive sets designed by Albert Speer and choreographed according to Speer's instructions, all designed to be observed, not by the participant in the mass party rally, but by Riefenstahl's cameras. Certainly there was something in the air, and not just in Nazi Germany, that drove people to find a sense of strength and safety in numbers, after the economic individualism of the 1920's culminated in the stock market crash and the Depression.
 But the distinctions ultimately override the similarities. Berkeley's favorite element, played out so beautifully in the ''By a Waterfall'' number in ''Footlight Parade,'' was water, with all of its flowing, gushing, pooling connotations of sexuality and childbirth. Men are in the minority in Berkeley's numbers, often appearing as wide-eyed tenors (Dick Powell, before his tough-guy image of the 1940's), leering oldsters (Guy Kibbee, Hugh Herbert) or sexually precocious infants (played by the dwarf actor Billy Barty). Women are Berkeley's subject -- objectified, certainly, but still imbued with life force and sexual allure.
 Men, of course, are Riefenstahl's subject -- the Aryan gods observed, in strikingly homoerotic imagery, as they bathe at their campsites and prepare for a big day of rallies and regimentation. And there are their more modestly proportioned masters: Hitler, Goebbels, Himmler and the rest of the party elite, who exercise their will over the masses with a crook of the finger or a wave of the hand. Riefenstahl's favorite element, emphasized again and again in ''Triumph'' (particularly in the visually stunning scenes of the night rallies) was fire: fire blazing in giant cauldrons, fire carried by burning torches as the troops go through their midnight maneuvers. If Berkeley is Eros, Riefenstahl is Thanatos: the death instinct played out as a mechanical spectacle of discipline and dehumanizing symmetry. 
 The Synapse edition of ''Triumph of the Will'' comes from an excellent 35-millimeter fine-grain print and features a sustained commentary track by the historian Anthony Santoro, who identifies many of the minor players Riefenstahl glosses over while providing a necessary historical (and occasionally moral) context for the spectacle. A Riefenstahl short, ''Day of Freedom,'' has been included as an extra. $34.95, not rated.

The Children Are Watching Us
 World War II was still going well for the Italians in 1942 while Vittorio De Sica was filming ''The Children Are Watching Us,'' a family melodrama centered on a small child, Prico (Luciano De Ambrosis), who becomes a mute witness to the degeneration of his parents' marriage. Like many movies made in Italy and Germany during the war, the conflict is not mentioned, and life seems to be going on as it always did, with no visible deprivations and the occasional trip to the seashore. But the film was not released until after the Allied invasion. At that point the film could be appreciated, in the words of Carlo Lizzani as reported by Stuart Klawans in his essay for the Criterion DVD edition of the film, ''as a 'testimony of truth' which stripped away the rhetoric and 'false morality' of Fascism by looking at things through a child's eyes.''
 It is, in truth, hard to find a political undercurrent in ''The Children Are Watching Us.'' That's something that would emerge with De Sica's later collaborations with the screenwriter Cesare Zavattini (only one of six writers credited on ''Children''), the 1946 ''Shoeshine'' and the 1948 ''Bicycle Thief.'' The film is an exercise in almost pure pathos, structured as a series of abandonments centered on the silently suffering child, who often looks into the camera with the large, wet eyes one associates with sad clown paintings. But the sentimentality that would sink the later De Sica, in films like ''The Garden of the Finzi-Continis'' and ''Sunflower'' (both 1970), has not yet overrun his work. The parents are cold, icy figures, and even the servants who in many Italian films would provide a dose of working-class love to the floundering boy are portrayed as envious and unreliable. 
 This fine transfer from the Criterion Collection highlights, in its excellent contrast and sharp resolution, the great stylistic contribution of De Sica's early work -- the rediscovery of deep-focus staging, just as it was being revived in the United States by directors like Orson Welles, William Wyler and Alfred Hitchcock. Could De Sica have seen ''Citizen Kane'' (1941) despite the wartime restrictions? It is striking in any case how filmmakers, separated by a war and an ocean, began working simultaneously on ideas that had lain fallow since the end of the silent era (while Kenji Mizoguchi, in Japan, had never abandoned the method). Does form trump borders that content cannot cross? $29.95, not rated.

HEADLINE: The 1918 Flu Killed Millions. Does It Hold Clues for Today?

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
Flu researchers know the epidemic of 1918 all too well.
 It was the worst infectious disease epidemic ever, killing more Americans in just a few months than died in World War I, World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam Wars combined. Unlike most flu strains, which kill predominantly the very old and the very young, this one -- a bird flu, as it turns out -- struck young adults in their 20's, 30's and 40's, leaving children orphaned and families without wage earners.
 So now, as another bird flu spreads across the globe, killing domestic fowl and some wild birds and, ominously, infecting and killing more than 100 people as well, many scientists are looking back to 1918. Did that flu pandemic get started in the same way as this one? Will today's bird flu turn into tomorrow's human pandemic? 
 And what, if anything, does that nearly century old virus and the pandemic it caused reveal about what is happening today? 
 The answer is: a lot and not enough. The 1918 pandemic showed how quickly an influenza virus could devastate American towns and cities and how easily it could spread across the globe, even in an era before air travel. 
 It showed that a flu virus could produce unfamiliar symptoms and could kill in unprecedented ways. And it showed that a bird flu could turn into something that spreads among people. 
 But the parallels go only so far, researchers say. For now, they are left with as many questions as answers.
 In the fall of 1918 flu struck the United States and parts of Europe hard and traveled to every corner of the world except Australia and a few remote islands. A few months later, it vanished, burning itself out after infecting nearly everyone who could be infected.
 The virus arrived at even the most improbable places, like isolated Alaskan villages. In one such village, Wales, 178 of its 396 residents died during one week in November, after a mailman arrived by dog sled, bringing the virus along with the mail. 
 Public health officials tried in vain to contain its spread. In Philadelphia, people were exhorted not to cough, sneeze or spit in public. 
 But the virus spread anyway. On Oct. 3, Philadelphia closed all of its schools, churches, theaters and pool halls. Still, within a month, nearly 11,000 Philadelphians died of influenza.
 Anyone who doubts that flu deaths can be horrific need only read the memoirs of physicians like Dr. Victor C. Vaughan, who treated influenza victims in 1918.
 Dr. Vaughan, a former president of the American Medical Association, was summoned by the surgeon general to Camp Devens, near Boston, where the flu struck in September. He later described the scene in his memoirs.
 The men, Dr. Vaughan wrote, ''are placed on the cots until every bed is full, yet others crowd in.''
 ''Their faces soon wear a bluish cast; a distressing cough brings up the blood stained sputum,'' he continued. 
 ''In the morning, the dead bodies are stacked about the morgue like cord wood,'' Dr. Vaughan said. ''This picture was painted on my memory cells at the division hospital, Camp Devens, in the fall of 1918, when the deadly influenza virus demonstrated the inferiority of human inventions in the destruction of human life.''
 Still, scientists are left with an abiding mystery: Where did the 1918 virus come from?
 Investigators know more than they once did. They know exactly what the virus looked like, thanks to Dr. Jeffrey Taubenberger, chief of the division of molecular pathology at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, and his colleagues, who obtained snippets of preserved lung tissue from three victims of the 1918 flu and managed to fish out shards of the virus and piece together its genes. Although the 1918 virus was a strain different from the A (H5N1) virus that is now killing birds, it was, Dr. Taubenberger found, a bird flu. 
 What is not known is how the 1918 virus moved from birds to humans.
 One clue could come from knowing what flu viruses existed before the 1918 pandemic. Perhaps the 1918 virus entered the human population before 1918 in a more benign form then mutated to become a killer. Or perhaps it suddenly showed up in humans, jumping directly from birds to people.
 To find out, Dr. Taubenberger and Dr. John Oxford of the Royal London Hospital are looking for human flu viruses that existed before 1918. London Hospital has a collection of human tissue obtained from 1908 to 1918. Dr. Taubenberger is searching for flu viruses in lung tissue from people who died of pneumonia in those years, hoping to use the same methods that allowed him to piece together the 1918 virus to resurrect a flu virus that was in humans before 1918. 
 The 1918 virus also is teaching researchers about experimental vaccines that scientists hope will protect against a variety of influenza strains. The plan had been to make a sort of universal flu vaccine that would protect against various flu viruses. Then people would not need a flu shot each year, and the vaccine might stop pandemic flu strains from ever gaining a toehold. 
 But, says Dr. Terrence Tumpey, a microbiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, although the experimental vaccines protect against ordinary human flu viruses, they do not protect against the 1918 virus. Nor do they protect against today's A(H5N1) bird flu virus.
 That leaves scientists with a puzzle. If they are worried about a 1918-like flu, they want a universal vaccine to protect against it, and they wonder what makes these bird flus so impervious? At this point, no one knows, Dr. Tumpey says.
 Another abiding mystery is that neither the 1918 influenza pandemic nor any other human influenza pandemic began with a flu pandemic that killed birds. And, scientists add, if the 1918 pandemic had begun that way, it would have been noticed. Even if the deaths of wild birds went undetected, the deaths of domestic fowl would have been recorded.
 Wild birds are inured to most flu viruses -- clouds of the viruses normally infect them, living in their gastrointestinal tracts but causing little or no disease. Sometimes, those flu viruses infect poultry and, while they usually cause little illness, some flu strains can be lethal to fowl and economically devastating to farmers. 
 That, Dr. Taubenberger says, ''has been recognized for 150 years.'' In the 1920's, scientists even isolated viruses from what they used to call fowl plague and what is now known to be bird flu. They were not the same viruses that infected humans. 
 The problem is in deciding what all this means. 
 The history of the 1918 flu can take scientists only so far, Dr. Taubenberger said.
 ''We don't know how the 1918 pandemic evolved and how the virus emerged into a form that was the finished product,'' he said. ''What we sequenced was a virus that was ready for prime time, not its precursor.''
 ''Ultimately,'' Dr. Taubenberger said, ''the answer to the big question is, We don't know. There is no historical precedent for what is going on today.''

HEADLINE: New Rise in Number of Millionaire Families

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
The number of American households with a net worth of $1 million or more, excluding their principal residence, grew to a record 8.9 million last year, the British market research firm TNS Financial Services said in a report to be released today. 
 More than one in seven of the households were in just 13 of the nation's 3,140 counties, TNS said.
The number of millionaire families rose to 7.1 million in 1999, said Jeanette Luhr, a TNS manager who directed the survey, and then, after the Internet bubble burst, dropped steadily to 5.5 million by 2002. The ranks of millionaire households rose to 6.2 million in 2003 and 8.2 million in 2004, she said.
 In most large counties, about one household in 12, or about 8.5 percent, was worth $1 million or more, Ms. Luhr said. An exception was Nassau County on Long Island, where millionaire families were more than twice as common, at 17.5 percent of all households.
 The households had an average net worth, excluding principal residence, of nearly $2.2 million, of which more than $1.4 million was in liquid, or investable, assets. The survey counted some tax-deferred retirement savings but did not include individual retirement accounts in the liquid assets. 
 Despite a rising stock market, Ms. Luhr said that more than half of those surveyed said they had ''become much more conservative in their investment approach over the past year.'' 
 The survey found that 29 percent of the millionaire households did not own stocks or bonds and 32 percent did not own mutual funds. One in four had a second mortgage on a home.
 Half of the heads of millionaire households were 58 or older, Ms. Luhr said, and 45 percent were retired.
 Just 18.7 percent of the millionaires own -- or owned before they retired -- part of a business or professional practice, an indication that high-wage earners who save and invest are the dominate group, at least among those on the lower rungs of the millionaire class.
 TNS also found that while 73 percent of those it surveyed said they would prefer to do all of their financial business at a single institution, hardly anyone did. 
 Ms. Luhr said that 195 counties had at least 10,000 millionaires and that slightly more than a third of all counties had at least 1,000 millionaires.

HEADLINE: As Prices Rise, Loyalty Follows the Lowest Fare

BYLINE: By Joe Sharkey

 BODY:
IN the domestic airline business, less bad news is good news these days. 
 So some industry people are congratulating each other over new estimates that airlines in North America will collectively lose only about $5.4 billion this year, compared with $10.8 billion in 2005.
That projection, by the International Air Transport Association, is based on an assumption that oil prices will average $57 a barrel this year. Incidentally, oil prices rose to $64.16 a barrel yesterday. Still, Giovanni Bisignani, the director general of the International Air Transport Association, was a font of cautious optimism last week in a speech and a subsequent interview in New York. 
 For world airlines in general, ''cost-cutting and the economic recovery have been so strong that we cut our 2006 loss projections in half, to $2.2 billion,'' he said. Actually, carriers in Europe, the Asia-Pacific and other world markets are projected to post profits totaling about $3.2 billion this year, but those gains will be offset by the $5.4 billion in projected losses in North America. 
 But even in North America, Mr. Bisignani said, higher fares, reductions in domestic capacity and continued cost-cutting are leading to ''higher yields'' and improved financial conditions. 
 Higher yields, by the way, is another way of saying higher fares.
 On domestic airlines, yields were up 10.1 percent in the first two months of this year compared with the same period last year, according to the Air Transport Association. At the same time, the number of passenger miles flown rose 1 percent, while the number of available seats fell 4.6 percent.
 Here's what I think that all portends. 
 One, domestic fares will rise more than some industry analysts have been predicting. Given high oil prices, airlines still cannot make money at current fare levels.
 Two, projections for steadily growing demand for domestic air travel may be overly optimistic. That is because a certain percentage of demand, mostly leisure travel, has been driven in recent years by rock-bottom fares. That bottom-rung leisure niche -- its size is unknown because so many business travelers jump into it when it is convenient -- is extremely price-sensitive. If air fares increase significantly, and they have been edging up week by week, leisure demand may start eroding.
 Three, if and when that happens, major airlines are going to be looking for more support from their most loyal and lucrative customers, frequent business fliers, who have to continue flying. But, as noted here last week, airlines have lost the loyalty of a good number of those customers, especially the ones who maintain elite status levels. 
 That is because elite status benefits like upgrades and first chance at choice coach cabin assignments like exit rows and aisle seats have been sharply reduced. Last year, airlines cut first-class fares to the point where flying in first class now often costs little more than flying full-fare coach -- meaning fewer first-class seats were available as free upgrades. And airplanes are now flying full, and choice seats are booked well in advance on many flights, without regard to status.
 There was a lot of reaction to last week's column about what many business travelers, myself included, see as the deterioration of elite status programs. A good number of readers said that they, like me, were so unhappy with the decline in benefits for maintaining loyalty that they had simply given up on working to hit the annual mileage mark for elite status.
 A small number of mileage geeks, devout believers in the sanctity of frequent-flier programs, were hostile toward my suggestion that the elite status game was not worth the effort.
 But a significant number of other readers also pointed out something that anyone who understands simple industry economics readily concedes. ''You have been flying on unbelievably cheap fares long enough,'' one fellow wrote. ''The airlines and their employees have subsidized you and all travelers. It is time for you to start paying a fair price for your safe air travel and stop the whining.''
 I believe he is correct about fares. But elite status members who feel alienated despite their loyalty certainly are not whining when they say they are now looking at air travel as a commodity. They are simply making rational buying decisions without regard to brand loyalty anymore.
 Mr. Bisignani acknowledged that the days of fares sold below costs were waning. Fares ''have been quite low for some time,'' he said, adding, ''They will increase.''

HEADLINE: Manhattan to J.F.K., Well Above the Traffic

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
After a two-decade absence, helicopter shuttles between Manhattan and Kennedy International Airport resumed yesterday with a critical assist from the federal government.
 At 7 a.m., U.S. Helicopter, a start-up company, whisked its first passengers from the Downtown Manhattan Heliport, over Brooklyn, Queens and the security lines at Kennedy, to the American Airlines terminal. The hourly flights, which last less than 10 minutes, cost $139 each way.
 Included in that price is the luxury of avoiding the long security screening lines at the airport. At the request of U.S. Helicopter's executives, the federal Transportation Security Administration set up a checkpoint, with X-ray and bomb-detection machines, to screen passengers and their luggage at the heliport. 
 The security agency is spending $560,000 this year to operate the checkpoint with a staff of eight screeners and is considering adding a checkpoint at the heliport at the east end of 34th Street. The agency's involvement has drawn criticism from some elected officials.
 ''The bottom line here is that there are not enough screeners to go around,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. ''The fact that we are taking screeners that are needed at airports to satisfy a luxury market on the government's dime is a problem.''
 Congress has placed a limit on how many screeners the security agency can employ, and last summer, the agency said it would reduce the number of screeners at Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark airports.
 But Charles A. Gargano, vice chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the Wall Street heliport, on Pier 6 in the East River, called the resumption of the service a boon for the downtown economy.
 ''This is much more than just to have something nice,'' Mr. Gargano said. ''It is an essential element to rebuilding Lower Manhattan.''
 Douglas Hofsass, the federal security director at La Guardia Airport, said the screeners at the heliport came from La Guardia, but the security agency bought new machines to screen passengers and their bags. He said he was hiring new screeners to replace the old ones at La Guardia.
 ''Our mission is to make the airport commute easier,'' said Jerry G. Murphy, the chief executive of U.S. Helicopter. He said the company expects its fleet of eight-passenger Sikorsky S-76 helicopters to carry as many as 150,000 passengers to and from local airports a year. 
 Most of those passengers are expected to be investment bankers and other business travelers who want to save time and avoid the hassles of the normal trek to the airport.
 Airport helicopter service had its heyday in the 1970's, and eventually stopped operating after five people died when a spinning rotor broke off a New York Airways helicopter on a helipad atop the Pan Am Building. 
 After sampling the shuttle yesterday, Mikael Audebert, a travel agent from Orlando, Fla., said he would recommend it to his affluent clients.
 Mr. Audebert grinned as the 2:35 p.m. flight rose off the tarmac at Kennedy before dipping its nose and making a beeline toward the Statue of Liberty. Within a minute, the helicopter was cruising, with only a slight chop, about 1,000 feet above the traffic on the Belt Parkway and Mr. Audebert was taking pictures.
 ''Every time we come to New York, it's just a nightmare,'' he said. ''We use a limo that costs $115 and it stinks. The driver is not nice.'' But, he added, as he gestured around the compact, leather-padded cabin, ''This is amazing.''
 Bobby Weiss, a self-employed stock trader and real estate broker who was U.S. Helicopter's first paying customer yesterday, said he would pay $300 for a round trip to Kennedy, and he expected most corporate executives would, too.
 ''It's $300, but so what? It goes on the expense account,'' said Mr. Weiss, adding that he had no qualms about the diversion of federal resources to smooth the path of highfliers. ''Maybe a richer guy may save a little time at the expense of a poorer guy who spends a little more time in line.''

HEADLINE: Pataki and Silverstein Inch Closer To a Deal on the Trade Center Site

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
After two weeks of recriminations and intensive back-door bargaining, the Pataki administration and the developer Larry A. Silverstein are back where they started: close to a deal that would relieve Mr. Silverstein of financial responsibility for building the Freedom Tower, the most symbolic and economically troubled skyscraper at ground zero.
 There are still a number of financial issues that could prove to be insurmountable. But the deal now under consideration could be remarkably lucrative for Mr. Silverstein if it is approved on Thursday at a board meeting of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, according to state and city officials and authority executives. 
The developer, who has the obligation to rebuild all the commercial space at the World Trade Center site under his lease with the Port Authority, would not have to build and lease a 2.6-million-square-foot tower. The authority would take control of the skyscraper, which is widely thought to be too big, wrongly placed and unlikely to be rented to corporate tenants, who view it as a potential target.
 He would get a rent reduction worth ''hundreds of millions of dollars'' over the life of his lease and would retain the right to develop the most valuable sites at ground zero for three office towers along Church Street between Vesey and Liberty Streets.
 Despite shedding financial responsibility for the 1,776-foot Freedom Tower, Mr. Silverstein continues to insist on getting a developer's fee for the tower that could be as high as $100 million. He and the Pataki administration have agreed, however, that about $950 million of the $2.9 billion in insurance proceeds for rebuilding would be allocated for the Freedom Tower, according to both sides in the negotiations.
 The talks between the two sides over a major realignment at ground zero resumed in secret after a noisy breakup on March 14. With everyone having agreed to stop talking in public, the Silverstein camp, state officials and Port Authority executives are reluctant to be quoted. 
 If the two sides come to a formal agreement by Thursday, it could still leave unresolved a series of important issues, ranging from Mr. Silverstein's development fees to his share of the infrastructure costs at ground zero and the authority's plans for a multistory shopping mall on Church Street. And that would set the stage for more haggling in the coming year. Some officials contend that if they announced a deal before all the issues were resolved they would lose any leverage with Mr. Silverstein, whose ceaseless bargaining has driven some to distraction.
 But an agreement would allow construction of the Freedom Tower to begin next month as scheduled, with a press conference that will draw national attention for Gov. George E. Pataki, who will leave office in January and is considering a presidential bid.
 Governor Pataki, who chose the name Freedom Tower, has continued to defend the building despite a clamor against it in recent weeks.
 On Friday, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, a Democratic candidate for governor, said the Freedom Tower could easily turn into a white elephant because it lacked ''economic viability.'' He blamed the problem on Governor Pataki, who insisted that the tower be built first, against Mr. Silverstein's advice. 
 Governor Pataki dismissed Mr. Spitzer's criticism yesterday, saying, ''The Freedom Tower is a very important part of showing our country and the world that New York is not afraid to build tall.'' He said, ''We believe it can be done in an economically viable way, as can the redevelopment of all of Lower Manhattan.''
 If the Port Authority takes control of the Freedom Tower, the Pataki administration expects to move state, city and federal agencies into the building.
 The deal now under discussion would have the Port Authority take control of the Freedom Tower and what is known as Site 5, at Greenwich and Cedar Streets, where the heavily damaged Deutsche Bank building awaits razing. The authority believes that the site, which would face Liberty Park, could be sold to a residential developer for as much as $350 million.
 But the authority wants assurances that the land will be transferred from the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and that it will be zoned for housing. It also wants to reach an agreement with Mr. Silverstein for a shopping mall that would comprise the lower floors of two office towers he would build at Church and Cortlandt Streets. 
 The Bloomberg administration and the authority view the mall as important in establishing a vibrant street life in the neighborhood. Mr. Silverstein has resisted that, in part because it would require him to build a ''sky lobby'' for the corporate tenants on possibly the fifth level rather than the ground floor.
 Finally, Anthony R. Coscia, the authority's chairman, has said that he does not want a deal that enriches Mr. Silverstein while shifting all the risks and financial obligations to the authority. He has also said that the new arrangement should ensure that as much as $100 million is available for building the memorial.

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY

 BODY:

A380 DEBUT -- Singapore Airlines plans to begin the first commercial service of the Airbus A380 in December, and will unveil its cabin design for the new superjumbo jet in September, according to Subhas Menon, the airline's vice president for the Americas. In an interview, Mr. Menon said that all 10 double-deck A380's that Singapore has ordered will be configured with about 475 seats in first class, business class and economy cabins. 
Most of the 12 other airlines that have ordered the jets -- none of them United States carriers -- have said they will fly their A380's with about 550 seats, though the plane can seat nearly 900 in an all-coach configuration. The first service will be on one of the airline's signature long-haul routes, Singapore to Sydney, Australia, with a London route to follow as more planes come into service, Mr. Menon said. In September, Singapore will unveil an A380 cabin design that stresses ''convenience and comfort, as well as an enhanced ability to do some of the things people need to do on long-haul travel, like work, relax, sleep and get in shape,'' he said, adding, ''We want to emphasize the space.'' The new business- and first-class seats will be introduced around the time British Airways is expected to announce details of a $170 million makeover of its own premium-class flat-bed seats. Singapore has not set a date for starting A380 service to and from the United States, but Mr. Menon said the carrier was looking more closely at using San Francisco International Airport, which has made the necessary modifications to accommodate the giant jet.

A380 TEST -- In a passenger evacuation test required for regulatory certification of the A380 jet, Airbus said it managed to get 873 passengers and 20 crew members off one of its new double-deck jumbo aircraft on Sunday within the required 90 seconds. The test was conducted in a darkened hangar at an Airbus site in Hamburg, Germany. Airbus said that only half of the aircraft's 16 exits were used to empty the jet. During the test evacuation, one passenger suffered a broken leg, Airbus said. The Associated Press reported that 32 other passengers suffered minor injuries. The successful test paved the way for authorities to ''certify the aircraft in time for delivery by the end of 2006,'' Airbus said.

SUMMER TRAVEL PLANS -- Business travelers often fly on short notice, but summer is the time for trips to major trade shows and conferences, which are typically booked in advance. This year, in particular, business and leisure travelers are making earlier-than-usual summer domestic travel plans, says the Travel Industry Association of America. In a survey, the trade group found that more than 80 percent of Americans who anticipate taking trips this summer have already begun plans. One reason is that ''strong air and hotel demand has resulted in higher prices and fewer bargains,'' causing earlier-than-usual bookings to lock in prices, the group said. JOE SHARKEY

HEADLINE: Shares Fall in Slow Trading Ahead of Fed Rate Meeting 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks slid yesterday in the second-slowest trading this year on the New York Stock Exchange as investors anticipated the Federal Reserve's 15th consecutive increase in interest rates.
 Economists expect the Federal Reserve Board's Open Market Committee to conclude a two-day policy meeting today by raising the benchmark lending rate a quarter-point, to 4.75 percent. The chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, will be presiding over his first committee meeting since he succeeded Alan Greenspan in February.
Some investors, however, say the central bank may lift borrowing costs too far before ending the streak. 
 ''This is probably as good as it's going to get'' for the stock market any time soon, said Edgar Peters, chief investment officer at PanAgora Asset Management in Boston. ''I don't believe the Fed is actually close to ending the rate hikes.''
 Utilities, among the shares most sensitive to changes in rates, dropped as government bond yields rose. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 1.34 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,301.61. The Dow Jones industrial average retreated 29.86, or 0.26 percent, to 11,250.11. The Nasdaq composite index added 2.76, or 0.12 percent, to 2,315.58.
 About 1.37 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, 17 percent below the three-month average. Nine stocks fell for every seven that rose on the Big Board.
 ''We've had such a quick run here in the first quarter, to see the market trade sideways or taper off a little bit wouldn't be that unusual,'' said Bart Barnett, head of equity trading at Morgan Keegan in Memphis.
 Utility stocks had the steepest loss among 10 industry groups in the S.& P. 500 on concern the Fed will drive bond yields higher, making dividend payouts at utilities less attractive.
 A gauge of utility stocks lost 0.8 percent. The measure has a 3.5 percent dividend yield, almost twice the S.& P. 500's 1.8 percent. Exelon, the largest operator of nuclear power stations in the nation, decreased 82 cents, to $53.97.
 Johnson & Johnson fell amid speculation its anemia drug may have more competition from an Amgen medication. The Food and Drug Administration approved Amgen's Aranesp anemia medication for use every three weeks, providing a more convenient dosing option for patients on chemotherapy. That may give Amgen an edge in the $10 billion market for anemia drugs over Procrit from Johnson & Johnson, which requires once-weekly dosing. Johnson & Johnson slid 45 cents, to $59.94.
 General Motors climbed 28 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $22.93, for the biggest gain in the Dow average behind Alcoa. G.M. said it would increase production of its new sport utility vehicle models, including the redesigned Chevrolet Tahoe, after demand exceeded its expectations. 
 Shares of metal producers rallied as prices for silver, copper, zinc and gold jumped. An S.& P. 500 measure of raw material companies gained 0.6 percent, for the largest advance among 10 industry groups.
 Alcoa increased 50 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $30.33. The company might earn $2.41 a share this year, 6 cents more than previously expected, a Citigroup investment research analyst, John Hill, wrote in a note.
 Citigroup increased its forecast for aluminum, copper, nickel and gold prices, and raised its rating on Phelps Dodge to hold from sell. Phelps Dodge advanced $1.47, to $76.61. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold rallied $2.50, to $56.19.
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 4.70 percent, from 4.66 percent late Friday, and the price, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, fell 9/32, to 9813/32. 
 Following are the results of yesterday's auctions of three-month, six-month and two-year Treasury bills.

HEADLINE: Our Trade With China

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Regarding the legislation that Senator Lindsey Graham and I have introduced and our attempts to urge China to play fair in the global marketplace (editorial, March 27), Senator Graham and I have never argued that our bill would eliminate the growing trade deficit with China. Rather, it would reverse one of the inequities in our free-trade system. 
 It is a tenet of free trade that the currencies of large economies should float. The economists I have talked to all agree that when a major power like China pegs its currency, it creates inefficiencies in the world trading system and harms American companies and workers.
 Nudging China to float its currency on an established and reasonable timetable is a worthy goal.
 Our preference has never been to impose a 27.5 percent tariff on all Chinese goods that enter the country. Rather, by using this admittedly blunt instrument, we have sought to get both countries to agree to a gradual path to a floating currency. 
 After four years of work, we believe that we are close to achieving our goal. I returned from China with renewed confidence that while China faces serious problems, it can step up the pace of currency reform and create a win-win solution for both countries.

Central Bank Raises Interest Rates Again And Suggests Another Increase Is Likely
The Federal Reserve's interest-rate-setting committee raised the benchmark federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 4.75 percent, and suggested that at least one more increase was in the cards. It was the 15th such increase in consecutive meetings of the group. [Page C1.] 


Two Senators Drop Plans for Tariffs Against China
Two of China's most relentless critics in Congress announced a temporary cease-fire in their long-running attack on China's foreign-exchange practices. In an about-face, Senators Charles E. Schumer and Lindsey Graham dropped plans for a bill that would threaten steep tariffs on Chinese imports. [C1.]

G.M.'s Chief in a Spot, but He's Been There Before
Rick Wagoner, the chief executive of General Motors, has been here before. In 1992, at the age of 39, he was the chief financial officer and was among a fresh slate of executives call on to replace the existing management and rescue the company from the worst financial crisis in its history. Now the question is: Can he do it again? [C1.]

Two weeks after it increased its 2005 loss by $2 billion, G.M. said that it would restate several years' worth of results for its GMAC financing arm. G.M. also said it did not know if it would be able to sell a controlling interest in GMAC because of the complexity of arranging a deal. [C5.]

General Motors laid off several hundred white-collar workers on Tuesday, its latest move in a restructuring plan that is cutting deeply into all ranks of the company. [C5.]

A Dubai Company Decides to Turn the Other Cheek
The president of the Emirates Group, Dubai's airline, readily acknowledges that he was dismayed by what happened in Washington to DP World, the giant port operator that is one of Emirates' sister companies. As one of Boeing's largest customers and a major buyer of General Electric jet engines, the Emirates Group is the Dubai company best positioned to retaliate against the United States by taking its business elsewhere.

HEADLINE: Rise in Consumer Optimism Confounds Analysts

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Americans' optimism in the economy rebounded in March, sending a widely followed barometer of consumer sentiment close to a four-year high, a private research group said yesterday. 
 The Conference Board said that its consumer index rose 4.5 points, to 107.2, the highest level since May 2002, when the reading was 110.3. Analysts had expected a reading of 102.
 The latest measure was up from a revised 102.7 in February, which was down 4.1 points from January and broke a three-month rebound from last year's gulf hurricanes.
 ''The improvement in consumers' assessment of present-day conditions is yet another sign that the economy gained steam in early 2006,'' Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board Consumer Research Center, said in a statement. ''Consumer expectations, while improved, remain subdued and still suggest a cooling in activity in the latter half of this year.''
 The component of the consumer confidence index that assesses views of current economic conditions rose to 133.3, from 130.3. The component that measures consumers' outlook over the next six months improved to 89.9, from 84.2 in February.
 The Conference Board index is derived from responses received through March 21 to a survey mailed to 5,000 households in a consumer research panel. The figures released yesterday include responses from at least 2,500 households.
 Despite the improvement in consumer confidence, a modest stock market rally evaporated after the Federal Reserve raised an important interest rate by a quarter percentage point yesterday afternoon and left the door open for further rate increases. The new level of 4.75 percent in the federal funds rate is the highest in five years and will probably lead to higher consumer borrowing costs.
 The report from the Conference Board said that overall assessment of current conditions remained favorable, but that their views on labor market conditions were mixed. Consumers saying jobs are ''plentiful'' increased to 28.4 percent, from 27.4 percent, while the number saying jobs are ''hard to get'' rose to 20.7 percent, from 20.2 percent.
 The outlook for the labor market was also more upbeat. Those expecting fewer jobs to become available in the coming months decreased to 16.6 percent, from 19.9 percent in February, while those expecting more jobs edged up to 13.9 percent, from 13.4 percent.

HEADLINE: ARCHDIOCESE SET FOR SCALING BACK

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO; Reporting for this article was contributed by Manny Fernandez, Colin Moynihan, Andy Newman and Fernanda Santos.

 BODY:
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York announced plans yesterday for the most sweeping reorganization in its history of more than 150 years, recommending the closing of 31 parishes and 14 schools throughout the metropolitan region.
 At the same time, the archdiocese recommended creating five new parishes in Staten Island, Orange County and Dutchess County and constructing several new church buildings, mostly in northern Westchester County, Rockland County and Dutchess County, where many Catholics who have left the city have relocated.
The closings would hit the archdiocese the hardest in its southern parts -- the Bronx, Staten Island, Manhattan, Yonkers and central Westchester. The Bronx and Manhattan alone accounted for 17 of the 31 parishes that are to be closed.
 The announcement had long been expected. For more than two years, archdiocesan officials have been studying how to deal with a growing shortage of priests, coupled with the changing demographics of the archdiocese, which in its entirety stretches from Staten Island in the south to the Catskills in the north. Some churches in the northern suburbs have been bulging at the seams, while others in the city have struggled to get by, often requiring large financial subsidies from the archdiocese. 
 ''A lot of these are just no-brainers,'' said Msgr. John J. Jenik, pastor of Our Lady of Refuge in the Bronx and a member of a panel of lay leaders and priests convened by the archdiocese that recently reviewed the reorganization plans. ''When you've got diminishing numbers of priests, large cash investments in places, dwindling numbers and economies of scale, it's not wise stewardship.''
 Each of the parishes and schools on the list of closings will have the chance to discuss their situations with archdiocesan officials. Final decisions concerning the schools will be made by April 24, said Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the archdiocese. He set no schedule for final parish decisions.
 It is unclear what will happen to the buildings of churches and schools that are closed. Some will be sold, Mr. Zwilling said, but others may be converted to other archdiocesan uses.
 The archdiocese is a relative latecomer to the reorganization process, which has occurred in varying degrees around the nation. Cardinal Edward M. Egan's predecessor, Cardinal John O'Connor, was reluctant to close churches, but Cardinal Egan made it clear that the reorganization was one of his priorities when he became archbishop in 2000. 
 Waves of closings caused turbulence more than a decade ago in Chicago and Detroit. More recently, when the Archdiocese of Boston moved in 2004 to close or consolidate more than 80 parishes, angry parishioners conducted sit-ins and won reprieves in some cases.
 The recommendations announced yesterday in New York promised to convulse the archdiocese, and many people interviewed in parishes on the list vowed to fight. 
 ''We very much want to stay open, because we're doing a lot of good for a lot of kids,'' said the Rev. John Flynn, the pastor of St. Martin of Tours in the Bronx, who learned from a reporter that his parish school was on the list. Undaunted, he said he was optimistic that ''we can prove that we should stay open.''
 Some parishes whose members were sure they would lose their churches were spared. In these pockets, there was a feeling of relief, even celebration.
 ''I'm having a cardiac arrest right here,'' said Msgr. Robert McCabe, who had been certain his parish, St. Mary in Haverstraw, Rockland County, would be closed because of dwindling attendance and other factors. ''I was 99 percent sure I was going to be closed. Now I'm going to unpack my bags.'' 
 There was even greater relief in areas where parishes and churches were added.
 At St. Joseph's Church in Croton Falls in northern Westchester, more than 2,800 attend Sunday Mass every weekend, according to archdiocesan figures, but the church has space for only 160 people. Church officials also use the school auditorium, which holds 325, but the result is eight different Masses on Sunday, three at the church and five in the auditorium, an organizational nightmare.
 In the spring, 165 children in that parish are scheduled to receive their first communion, said Msgr. James R. Moore, and they will be split into eight different first communion services. ''I knew the cardinal was looking at all of the different areas, so we feel very blessed to have been picked for expansion,'' he said.
 According to archdiocesan officials, the number of Catholics in the metropolitan region has not necessarily decreased over the years, but has shifted. There are more than 2.5 million in the archdiocese today, spread out over 409 parishes, according to archdiocesan estimates, and there were about 2.1 million in the early 80's. There are 287 Catholic schools.
 The real comparison that needs to be made, Mr. Zwilling said, is how the population has shifted from 1900 to 2000, because many of the parishes were created more than a century ago. 
 In 1900, less than a quarter of the Catholics in the archdiocese lived in upstate New York, he said, but the figure in 2000 was almost 40 percent. ''We have been trying to minister to a church in the 21st century with a layout and configuration that was established in many cases in the early 20th century,'' Mr. Zwilling said. 
 Of the 31 parishes to be closed, 16 will either get small churches that will function as chapels for the community or get to keep their buildings and become missions attached to other parishes. 
 Even that news was bitter for many because it means they will lose many of the services that come with a full-fledged parish, such as having a priest on site in a church rectory. 
 ''I'm extremely disappointed,'' said Claire Harris, a parishioner at St. Augustine in the Bronx, who learned that her parish would close and get a chapel. ''Yes, we can stay together as a worshiping community because we do have the chapel, but it takes away a lot from us. There's not the stability of a priest, or a central place where people can come to for counseling. It's not a place to go to.''
 Many of the parishes slated for closures have been fixtures in their communities for decades. Our Lady Queen of Angels in East Harlem, which is on the list, was built in 1886 to serve German residents. It now draws a mixture of about 400 Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, Mexicans and African-Americans for Sunday Mass. 
 ''Once you close this place, you throw history away,'' said Gregoria Fuentes, 54, who grew up across the street from the church and was going in to 7 p.m. Mass yesterday. 
 Dorothy Day, the writer and social worker who founded the Catholic Worker movement, worshiped for decades at the Church of the Nativity in the East Village, which is on the list of closings. The archdiocese has been talking about closing the church for years, said Joanne Kennedy, a managing editor of the Catholic Worker newspaper and one of the parishioners who had been working to save the church. 
 ''It's not a great surprise, although it's heartbreaking,'' Ms. Kennedy said in the newspaper's office around the corner on East Third Street.
 She said the archdiocese had discouraged the effort to save the parish. ''We had one meeting at a closed parish, and the archdiocese told us we couldn't meet there, that our meetings were not sanctioned. They said we were leading people on.''
 Although an average of fewer than 400 show up for Sunday Mass, according to archdiocesan figures, the church has many other programs. On the steps of the church yesterday afternoon sat Robert Johnson, a volunteer at the church's soup kitchen. 
 ''We feed about 200 people every Saturday,'' said Mr. Johnson, 66, who had come to rest a bit on the steps on his way home from his construction job. ''They'll all have to find someplace else to eat.''
 Behind him the parish bulletin was posted on the wall, showing the modest collections in recent weeks -- $966, $1,388, $1,251. The bulletin mentioned that the church's penny drive was still on. ''Save pennies,'' the notice read. ''We are still in need of pennies.''

 CORRECTION:
A map on Wednesday showing parishes and schools affected by the reorganization plans of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York misidentified one Bronx parish and school scheduled for closing and gave an erroneous identification from archdiocesan officials for a Manhattan parish set to close, with its church officially becoming a chapel. The Bronx parish and school are St. Anthony's at 4505 Richardson Avenue, not St. Anthony's at 1496 Commonwealth Avenue. The church that would be downgraded to a chapel is Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, at 307 East 33rd Street, not the Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus at 457 West 51st Street.

HEADLINE: Facts and Folly

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN; Maureen Dowd is on a book tour.

 BODY:
I was leaving for a trip the other day and scooped up some reading material off my desk for the plane ride. I found myself holding three documents: one was the Bush administration's National Security Strategy for 2006; another was a new study by the Economic Strategy Institute entitled ''America's Technology Future at Risk,'' about how America is falling behind the world in broadband. And the third was ''Teaching at Risk,'' a new report by the Teaching Commission, headed by the former I.B.M. chairman Louis Gerstner Jr., about the urgent need to upgrade the quality and pay of America's K-12 teachers.
 The contrast was striking. The Bush strategy paper presupposes that we are a rich country and always will be, and that the only issue is how we choose to exercise our power. But what the teaching and telecom studies tell us is that key pillars of U.S. power are eroding, and unless we start tending to them in a strategic way, we aren't going to be able to project power anywhere. 
Because we've long been rich, there is an abiding faith that we always will be, and those who dare question that are labeled ''defeatists.'' I wouldn't call Lou Gerstner a defeatist. He saved I.B.M. by acknowledging its weaknesses and making dramatic changes -- beginning with scrapping I.B.M.'s arrogant assumption that because it was such a great company, it could do extraordinary things with average people. Mr. Gerstner understood that an extraordinary company could stay that way only if it had a critical mass of extraordinary people. This is the message of his Teaching Commission: We cannot remain an extraordinary country without a critical mass of extraordinary teachers.
 ''If teaching remains a second-rate profession, America's economy will be driven by second-rate skills,'' Mr. Gerstner says. ''We can wake up today -- or we can have a rude awakening sooner than we think.''
 The Teaching Commission notes that ''our schools are only as good as their teachers,'' yet this ''occupation that makes all others possible is eroding at its foundations.'' Top students are far less likely to go into teaching today; salaries are stagnant; nearly 50 percent of new teachers leave within five years. To remedy this, the commission calls for raising teachers' base pay, finding ways to reward the best teachers, raising standards for acquiring a teaching degree and testing would-be teachers, on the basis of national standards, to be certain they have mastered the subjects they will teach (theteachingcommission.org).
 Meanwhile, the report by the Economic Strategy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, is equally harrowing. It notes that while the U.S. led the world in broadband Internet access in 2000, it has now fallen to 16th place. In 2000, 40 percent of the world's telecom equipment was produced in America. That share is now 21 percent and falling. The U.S. ranks 42nd for the percentage of people with cellphones.
 In an age when connectivity means productivity, when communications infrastructure is at the heart of any innovation ecosystem, these things matter for job creation and growth. The lack of ultra-high-speed networks in the U.S. ''makes it impossible for U.S.-based companies to enter key new business sectors'' -- one reason venture capitalists are moving their R.&D. start-ups to Asia, E.S.I. noted. 
 ''The wealth and long-term economic growth of the United States,'' it added, ''have long depended upon technological advancement as a means of competing with our foreign rivals. America's emphasis has always been on achieving such high levels of productivity that it could be the low-cost producer while still paying high wages.'' The study offers a variety of regulatory and investment prescriptions (econstrat.org). 
 It's not surprising that the Bush strategy paper is largely silent about these educational and technological deficits, as well as about the investment we need to make in alternative fuels to end our oil addiction. Because to acknowledge these deficits is to acknowledge that we have to spend money to fix them, and the radical Bush tax cuts make that impossible. It would be one thing if we were going into debt to solve these problems that affect our underlying national strength. But we are going into debt to buy low-interest houses and more stuff made in China. 
 We're like a family that is overdrawn at the bank just when the parents need to send their kid to college, buy a computer and a D.S.L. line, and replace a gas-guzzling furnace. Whatever ''strategic plan'' that family has for advancement, it won't get anywhere until it rebalances its books.

HEADLINE: Bolton Presses for New Method Of Calculating Dues at the U.N.

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 28 

 BODY:
John R. Bolton, the American ambassador, will outline a proposal for fundamental changes in calculating United Nations dues on Wednesday that he said would address Congressional concerns that ''the United States doesn't get value for money.''
 The plan, which Mr. Bolton is to present before the House International Relations Committee, has circulated privately and infuriated China and Russia, whose dues would rise, while the obligations of the United States, Japan and major European countries would decline. 
 ''Obviously, when any country's contribution goes up, that is not going to be popular,'' Mr. Bolton said in an interview on Tuesday.
 ''But the real question is, will the U.N. step out of an antiquated system that it is using now and use something that in the best judgment of most contemporary economists in the international field is a better method,'' he said.
 That method, known by economists as purchasing power parity, or P.P.P., would determine a nation's ability to pay under a system that measures comparative standards of living, rather than using the existing method of basing contributions on gross national products.
 ''The real issue in calculating the scale of assessments is how you evaluate the strength, the size of economies that are in very different circumstances, with currencies which are often not directly convertible, and that have official exchange rates which are not reflective of the actual size and strength of the economy,'' Mr. Bolton said.
 Mark Groombridge, an economic counselor at the United States mission, said he ran into fierce opposition from China, Russia, India and some developing countries when he discussed the proposal before the General Assembly's budget committee on Monday. ''It is fair to say that the U.S. was subject to intense questioning and scrutiny on the matter,'' he said.
 Mr. Bolton said the opponents argued that the collection of data was incomplete and imperfect, but he said that the same was true of the current system.
 According to International Monetary Fund figures, the P.P.P. calculation would result in China's gross domestic product rising from its current position of 7th in the world to 2nd, and Russia's from 16th to 10th. India would go from 12th to 4th.
 Japan has suggested its own reform plan, which has also drawn opposition from Beijing and Moscow because it would call for a minimum rate of 3 to 5 percent of the United Nations budget for the five permanent members of the Security Council. 
 The United States, which pays 22 percent, would be unaffected. So would Britain at 6.1 percent and France at 6 percent. But China's current rate is 2.1 and Russia's is 1.1 percent.
 Japan, which is the second highest contributor at 19.5 percent, has seen its ambitions to become a permanent member thwarted this year, at least in part because of opposition by China.
 New calculations of assessments are made every three years, and the current one is to be decided this summer by a panel of experts and sent to the General Assembly for adoption.
 Mr. Bolton said the United States was prepared to ''cushion'' the effect on countries whose dues would rise the most by phasing them in over a three-to-five-year period. ''That certainly eases the burden,'' he said. ''We're prepared to take mitigating factors into account.''
 The United States estimates that its portion of the $1.9 billion budget would decline from 22 percent to 21.5 percent under its plan, a change that Mr. Bolton argued was so slight that it undermined claims that the American plan was devised to benefit Washington.
 ''That's why nobody can say we have an ulterior motive with respect to the United States in this,'' he said. ''We think we have a reform that is consistent with the idea of advancing the ideals of all member governments. Member governments should really be assessed in accordance with their real world economic capacity.''
 He added: ''The point about purchasing power parity is that it's not an effort to put the U.S. in a better position or to put somebody else in a worse position. It's an effort to say, 'How do we really capture the strength of economies in the real world, how do we find a better way to reflect that reality in setting the U.N. assessment rate?' ''

HEADLINE: The Seductive Surplus

 BODY:
New York has a surplus, and that's leading the state into trouble. The word going around Albany is that after the legislators pass a budget of $112 billion or so this week, they will be able to ''declare victory now and declare bankruptcy later.'' There's an uncomfortable amount of truth in the joke. 
 The surplus -- somewhere between $2 billion and $4.5 billion -- is like political catnip for Albany's 212 legislators, who face re-election this year, and Gov. George Pataki, who is clearly hoping that this budget will promote him as a presidential candidate. Instead of using this money to reduce the state's huge mountain of debt, Mr. Pataki and the Republican state senators are pushing tax cuts for the rich, the moderately rich and the elderly. The Senate has even proposed dropping the sales tax on private planes.
 The Democrats controlling the Assembly are also utterly uninterested in paying down debt to increase long-term solvency. But when it comes to blowing the surplus, they have much better priorities. They want, among other things, tax cuts on the poorer end of the economic spectrum and more money for high-needs schools, as ordered repeatedly by the state's courts. But not even the Assembly has been able to undo the ruinous political formula that decrees that funds for needy urban schools must be matched by more spending on wealthy suburban schools. 
 Governor Pataki will have 10 days to ''adjust'' the budget, and he should look closely at the hundreds of millions of dollars in health care spending that the lawmakers added to his original proposals at the behest of the powerful leaders of the health care unions.
 And it goes without saying that he should cut the slush funds. Nothing's settled until it's settled, but the Legislature's budget could put almost $1 billion into this kitty, which is divided up by Albany's three top leaders and parceled out to members' districts across the state. It is very possible that even with a surplus, the state would have to borrow money to pay for it.
 But even if Mr. Pataki hacks away at some of the excess spending, that effort will do little to improve the state's long-term financial prospects if he and the legislators insist on eating up the surplus with tax cuts. It's ridiculous that the legislators, who are almost all from districts gerrymandered into impregnability, and a governor whose presidential hopes are still a mirage can be doing so much damage with an eye toward pleasing the voters. They should use the surplus to pay off debt and honor the court order to improve the state's worst schools.

HEADLINE: After Dubai Uproar, Emirates Air Holds No Grudges

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: LONDON, March 28 

 BODY:
The president of the Emirates Group, Dubai's fast-growing airline, readily acknowledges that he was dismayed by what happened in Washington to DP World, the giant port operator that is one of Emirates' sister companies. 
 ''It is rather a slap in the face,'' Maurice Flanagan, the Emirates president, said during a recent interview here. Dubai executives, he said, thought they had a close relationship with the United States.
''Most of my senior Arab colleagues were educated in the States,'' he said, adding that one even gets up ''in the middle of the night to watch basketball.'' 
 As one of Boeing's largest customers and a major buyer of General Electric jet engines, the Emirates Group is the Dubai company best positioned to retaliate against the United States by taking its business elsewhere. But that is the farthest thing from his mind, Mr. Flanagan said. 
 DP World agreed to sell six newly acquired port operations in the United States this month after American lawmakers raised security concerns. Rather than divert aircraft orders to Boeing's rival Airbus, though, executives at the company say they have decided to turn the other cheek.
 They have pledged not to change their treatment of American companies and are forging ahead with ambitious expansion plans, which include direct flights from the Middle East to California, then to other United States cities that could include Houston and Chicago.
 To appreciate the commercial scope of the Dubai royal family's business ambitions, there may be no better gauge than the Emirates Group. In 21 years, it has grown from a fleet of two planes that flew only to Karachi, Pakistan, and Bombay, to 90 aircraft that cover routes from New York to Australia. 
 Thanks to attentive customer service at competitive fares and in-flight perks like wide seats and hundreds of movies, Emirates may bypass the airline it most resembles, Singapore Airlines, by the end of the decade, analysts say. By 2012, Emirates may even be the most popular long-distance airline in the world, they say, surpassing American Airlines and British Airways.
 Dubai is ''perfectly located to be the global hub of this century,'' said Mr. Flanagan. ''Look at a map of the world, with the Americas down one side and China and Japan down the other,'' he said. ''If you balance that all on a point, that point is Dubai.''
 Like most government-backed Dubai companies, the chairman of Emirates is a member of the royal family -- in this case Sheik Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum -- and run by an international mix of executives. Mr. Flanagan, who was a member of the Royal Air Force of Britain and a British Airways executive, has been with Emirates since it started in 1985. 
 Emirates is part of a group of booming businesses founded by the Maktoum family that includes real estate, a new financial center, several investment funds and DP World. 
 Mr. Flanagan, 77, claims cheerfully that he the ''oldest and deafest'' among his airline executive peers, thanks to his stint in the Air Force at a time when wearing earmuffs was ''sissy.'' He is just as cheerfully confident about Emirates' success. 
 In the next two years, Emirates plans to add 30 planes. To give those planes a place to land and take off, Dubai's airport is expected to triple its capacity to at least 75 million passengers a year.
 By 2010, Emirates will have more long-distance seats than British Airways and Lufthansa, according to a Goldman Sachs report. ''All the European carriers are set to suffer as a result,'' the report said. 
 Emirates has posted a profit for 17 years in a row, and returns more than $100 million a year to shareholders in dividends.
 ''Not only did the airline have to be profitable, it had to be top class,'' said Peter Hill, a former Emirates executive who now runs SriLankan Airlines. ''In the culture of Dubai, there wasn't any second-best.''
 But its rivals have long complained that the airline receives hidden government subsidies, a claim Emirates executives have always vehemently denied.
 ''When we started in 1985, the rules were quite clear,'' Mr. Flanagan said. ''The sheik said, 'Here's $10 million, don't come back for more.' We get nothing special.''
 Emirates, for example, buys its fuel from the big oil companies like other airlines; Mr. Flanagan said its fuel costs had doubled in line with market prices.
 Since Emirates started releasing full financial data, analysts have found little evidence to support the complaints. ''An overview of the audited financial accounts contains no material surprises once one gets used to seeing consistent profits at an airline,'' UBS said in a report.
 Emirates' success rest on several factors. The airline does not have the legacy costs of its American and European rivals, which include costly pension plans and benefits. It can rely on cheaper labor, generally from Asia and India. Dubai has no income taxes, and its airport imposes relatively low operating costs.
 Using its less expensive airport as a hub, Emirates moves passengers long distances -- the most profitable part of the business -- from New York to Singapore, or Russia to Africa, always with a stop in Dubai. Often, passengers take advantage of the break to stay a day or more in one of Dubai's luxury hotels, or do some tax-free shopping. 
 The Emirates Group's growth has gone hand-in-glove with the construction of extravagant hotels and huge amusement parks in Dubai. The plans keep getting grander, potentially drawing more visitors and Emirates passengers. Under construction, for example, is the Dubailand theme park, expected to be twice the size of Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., with an indoor rain forest and a covered snow park.
 ''The government has done a great job stimulating travel to the region,'' said Jonathan Wober, an analyst with HSBC in London. 
 Emirates' growth plan has its skeptics, though. 
 One possible negative was highlighted by the controversy over DP World: the company is relying for some of its future growth on attracting a lot more American customers. Because of its politically sensitive connection to the Middle East, that may not be easy.
 Emirates has developed such a strong brand in Britain and Australia that the company is seen as ''practically separate'' from the Middle East, said Damien Horth, an airline analyst with UBS in Hong Kong. ''That will be very difficult in the United States, if not impossible,'' Mr. Horth said.
 But Emirates' target audience of international business executives is not as wary of the Arab connection as American consumers or Washington politicians are. 
 Emirates now runs two flights a day directly between Dubai and John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. It plans to start direct flights from either Los Angeles or San Francisco in the near future.
 Mr. Flanagan dismissed the notion that Emirates was more vulnerable to terrorism than other airlines. ''We're accepted by all the United States authorities, who give us high marks because of security,'' he said. 
 Long-term trends in aviation may be more of a problem, particularly as new ultralong-distance aircraft roll out from Boeing and Airbus. ''If you can fly nonstop with a competitor,'' noted Mr. Wober of HSBC, ''why connect with Dubai?'' 
 But Emirates Group is counting on getting its fair share of the growing long-distance business. It is the single largest buyer of Boeing's 777 aircraft and has encouraged Boeing to build a larger model of its new 787 jet as well. Over all, it has 37Boeing planes now flying, and 63 on order.
 Emirates is also by far the biggest supporter of Airbus's new superjumbo A380 aircraft, with 45 planes on order. The next closest airline has ordered a third as many planes, prompting executives from some rival airlines to refer to Emirates as ''Bank of Airbus.'' Airbus declined to comment for this article. 
 Indeed, as Mr. Flanagan noted in regard to the Boeing planes and their G.E. engines, ''All those aircraft that we've ordered and engines have viable European alternatives.'' 
 But he quickly dismissed any notion of retaliation for the DP World debacle. ''We love Boeing, we love the aircraft, we love the people that we deal with,'' Mr. Flanagan said.
 The only thing that could cause Emirates to order less from Boeing is ''political considerations quite beyond our control,'' he said. Asked to elaborate, Mr. Flanagan explained that the United States would have to ''force Boeing to stop selling to us.'' 
 As for the political reaction to the ports deal in the United States, ''I just can't understand it,'' Mr. Flanagan said. ''It can't be simply to embarrass the president, can it?''

HEADLINE: Critics Zero In on Rick Wagoner 

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 28 

 BODY:
In 1992, with General Motors in the worst financial crisis in its storied history, its board ousted top management and brought in a fresh slate of executives with orders to burst through the automaker's turgid culture. 
 The youngest was its 39-year-old chief financial officer, Rick Wagoner, a virtual unknown outside the company who was as shocked as everyone else when he was summoned back from G.M.'s operations in Brazil for a post that usually went to men a decade or two his senior. He helped fashion a turnaround plan that stemmed the bleeding and put G.M. back on the road to profitability.
Now, G.M. is reeling again, and this time it is Mr. Wagoner, 53, its chairman and chief executive, who is under pressure to save the company as well as his job.
 Whether he can do either is far from certain. 
 The slide that Mr. Wagoner helped to reverse 14 years ago has returned and accelerated. For 2005, G.M. reported its biggest loss -- $10.6 billion -- since 1992, and its lowest market share since the Depression. And the decline is not stopping, prompting analysts to wonder whether G.M. is headed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
 The bad news has put Mr. Wagoner in a harsh spotlight and woken up G.M.'s board, with its newest member, Jerome B. York, who is allied with its biggest investor, demanding that Mr. Wagoner take action. ''This is truly a desperate situation,'' said James P. Womack, an efficiency expert who has followed G.M. for years.
 Mr. Wagoner's fall from corporate hero to besieged executive reflects the unforgiving nature of the ever-changing auto industry and his own management mistakes. A G.M. lifer, he long resisted bold moves that might have transformed G.M., instead moving methodically -- more like a bureaucrat trying to protect the status quo than a visionary intent on remaking the company.
 In doing so, critics say, G.M. forgot some lessons that it learned a decade ago. Mr. Wagoner has failed to reduce G.M.'s labor costs by repeatedly agreeing to expensive contracts with the United Automobile Workers that made it difficult to shed excess workers. 
 The company also routinely churned out uninspired vehicles under Mr. Wagoner, who came up through the finance ranks, the classic route for a G.M. chief, rather than manufacturing or sales. The failure to recognize Americans' growing environmental awareness slowed G.M.'s embrace of hybrid-electric vehicles, allowing foreign rivals like Toyota to win sales and publicity.
 Calling Mr. Wagoner a ''paint-by-numbers kind of guy,'' Mr. Womack said, ''What you've got here is a quarterback with an out-of-date playbook, and the opposition isn't going to be beaten by any of the plays.''
 Mr. Wagoner declined to comment for this article. But his loyalists, alarmed at the criticism, are hustling to defend him, portraying an executive firmly in charge and working 12 hours a day or more both in the United States and around the world, to turn the company around. 
 A spokesman, Stephen Harris, said: ''I can understand why people might be speculating. But the reality is that Rick has the support of the board and the management team and employees at G.M. and its dealers -- the vast support of all the constituencies you can think of. He's definitely very focused.''
 Moreover, G.M. is trumpeting glimmers of good news, like the promising early sales of a restyled lineup of sport utility vehicles, and corralling allies of the embattled chief executive to defend him.
 But even allies acknowledge that Mr. Wagoner, a lanky native of Virginia, is under pressure. ''Time is finite,'' said Richard E. Dauch, the chief executive of American Axle, a parts supplier that does 78 percent of its business with G.M. Despite pledging his support for Mr. Wagoner's efforts, Mr. Dauch went on, ''You try the patience of your board and you try the patience of your investors.''
 Indeed, some critics ask, how much time should the board allow Mr. Wagoner to fix the problems? Wouldn't G.M., which faces a ruthlessly competitive present with no resemblance to its fabled past, be better off with a boss who has the passion to embrace change?
 It has been a sobering time for Mr. Wagoner, who joined G.M. in 1977 after getting an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School. Winning high marks for his quick, analytical mind and easy manner, Mr. Wagoner held a series of jobs in G.M.'s treasurer's office in New York. In the 1980's, he shifted to international operations, then overseen by John F. Smith Jr., who had impressed G.M.'s outside board members as having the potential to run the company.
 Though Mr. Wagoner had earned a reputation as ''a comer,'' his promotion in the 1992 management shake-up was unexpected. But working with Mr. Smith, who was named chief, Mr. Wagoner proved his mettle. 
 G.M. sliced $4 billion in its purchasing costs, first under the mantle of a colorful Spanish executive, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, and then, after he departed, under Mr. Wagoner's wing. The company accelerated the closing of 25 plants and eliminated 75,000 jobs, reorganizing its far-flung operations. 
 Meanwhile, Mr. Wagoner, who was put in charge of North American operations in 1994, brought in an outsider, Ronald A. Zarrella, to sharpen the image of G.M.'s brands and weed out underperforming dealers. The company retooled Cadillac, winning praise for the bold new look and livelier marketing featuring Led Zeppelin tunes.
 The company's earnings soared, and its stock peaked at more than $90 a share in early 2000.
 But with success, G.M. lost its urgency. Mr. Wagoner did not heed calls to eliminate some brands, instead buying Hummer when the popularity of its large S.U.V.'s was at its peak. As competition increased, G.M. frequently relied on gimmicks like no-interest financing and discounts to sell its cars, diminishing their effectiveness and conditioning buyers to expect big rebates and financing plans. Inventories piled so high last spring that G.M. rolled out employee discounts to every buyer, sending sales soaring -- and then crashing once the plans ended. G.M.'s shares also plummeted, closing Tuesday at $22.75.
 Critics say the emphasis on rebates proved Mr. Wagoner's bent was more for financial solutions and less for the nuts and bolts of auto building. Two years ago, when Toyota and G.M. celebrated the 20th anniversary of their joint venture in Fremont, Calif., which makes the Pontiac Vibe and Toyota Matrix, senior Toyota executives spent two hours on a walking tour of the factory.
 Notably absent were high-ranking G.M. officials, including Mr. Wagoner, say those who were present, although he attended a ceremony in the factory the next day.
 Likewise, after insisting last fall that G.M.'s highest priority was to make its plants capable of building more than one type of vehicle -- a major advantage of Japanese auto plants -- Mr. Wagoner admitted he did not know how many already could do so. (G.M. says 8 of its 23 plants in North America are flexible.) 
 His supporters say no chief executive of a big company can know everything. ''You have to surround yourself with people who know the other parts of the company,'' said David Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research, and the son of a former G.M president. ''Rick has done that. That's one of his strengths.''
 Still, the numbers in recent years tell a dismal story. Since Mr. Wagoner became the chief executive in 2000, G.M. has lost 6 points of market share, falling to just under 25 percent -- 10 points lower than in 1992, when it sold 35 percent of all cars in the United States. In contrast to Toyota, which last year earned about $2,000 a vehicle worldwide, G.M. lost about $1,200. Only once in 14 years has G.M. achieved its target of earning 5 cents on the dollar in its North American operations.
 In that time, more than 100,000 G.M. factory workers have lost their jobs, and another 30,000 more are set to go by 2008, leaving 83,000, even as foreign rivals have been increasing sales and adding workers.
 While some fault Mr. Wagoner for not acting faster to reduce costs, his associates credit him with refusing to ''blow up'' G.M. in a confrontation with the U.A.W., which paralyzed the company with a seven-week strike in 1998, the year he became president. 
 Recently, supporters say, this strategy paid off when G.M. negotiated a buyout deal with the union to reduce staff without a showdown. G.M. will offer its 113,000 hourly workers and 13,000 workers at Delphi, its parts supplier, up to $140,000 to leave their jobs. G.M. is also willing to take back 5,000 workers from Delphi, spun off from G.M. in 1999, to help it lower costs.
 But critics say the cost of moving so slowly has been high. The debt now carries junk ratings. Critics add that Mr. Wagoner only became serious about making tough decisions after Kirk Kerkorian, G.M.'s largest individual shareholder, bought a stake of just under 10 percent last year and began agitating for change. 
 The pace picked up when Mr. York, a representative of Mr. Kerkorian, joined G.M.'s board in early February. Already, he has led the board's outraged reaction earlier this month to accounting fumbles that caused G.M. to delay its annual report and restate its earnings for the second time in four months, causing its 2005 loss to swell by $2 billion. (On Tuesday, the company filed its annual report, which included another restatement.)
 Mr. York, meanwhile, is on a fact-finding mission inside the company, preparing a report he plans to give directors at May's board meeting.
 But even before he joined the board he had an impact. After his January speech in Detroit calling on G.M. to move faster, the board in February halved the dividend -- which Mr. Wagoner had defended -- and eliminated its $60,000 in cash payments to directors, who now receive all their compensation in stock. 
 Mr. Wagoner still enjoys the public support of G.M.'s board, but the question is for how long. Industry insiders are already buzzing about possible successors, though it might not be easy to find someone to succeed him.
 Perhaps because of Mr. Wagoner's relatively young age, G.M. has not groomed a successor inside its ranks -- indeed, four executives who once worked for him have become top executives elsewhere, including Lewis B. Campbell of Textron, whose name has been mentioned as a possible successor, and Mark Hogan, the president of the auto supplier Magna, one of the young Turks who helped fashion the last G.M. turnaround.
 The other candidate most often mentioned is Carlos Ghosn, the head of the French automaker Renault, who is admired by Mr. York for his deft restructuring at Nissan, including a complete overhaul of its product lineup. Saving G.M. would cap Mr. Ghosn's career as an industry icon. But so far he has deflected questions about G.M., saying that his job is to fix Renault. 
 Mr. Womack wonders whether anyone with the right stuff will want Mr. Wagoner's job. ''There are a lot of people out there who would take it,'' he said, ''but does anyone have the spark, the creativity and the ability to create a new concept?''

HEADLINE: Computing The Mysteries Of Attraction

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
ELIZABETH BRERETON was a freshman at Connecticut College and Robert Smith was a sophomore at Wesleyan in 1965 when they became a part of what might have been this country's first computer dating service. 
 It was called Operation Match, and it sent questionnaires to college campuses around the country. ''There were stacks of them as you went into the dorms,'' Ms. Brereton remembered. Students rated their own looks, intelligence and interests on a scale from one to five and described their ideal date using the same measures. They then returned the survey, along with a $3 fee, to the Operation Match offices in Cambridge, Mass.
 The idea had sprung out of a late-night discussion among some Harvard students about the inanity of blind dates and mixers. The students realized that computers had made it possible to pair up compatible dates far more easily than the stiff campus dating scene of the 1960's could. You wouldn't have to worry about circumstance keeping you from meeting your perfect match at a party. You would have a list to work from. 
 Ms. Brereton's and Mr. Smith's responses, like the thousands of others, were transferred to punch cards and fed into an enormous Avco 1790 computer, according to Harvard publications. Six weeks later, it spat out lists of mates for everyone. 
 When Ms. Brereton got hers in the mail, the 10 names on it included Mr. Smith, a tall future lawyer from New Jersey. And Mr. Smith's list included Ms. Brereton, a tall upstate New Yorker planning to become a social worker. 
 But neither one of them picked up the phone to call the other.
 OPERATION MATCH had its moment in the sun, appearing in the Valentine Day's issue of Look magazine and on the CBS quiz show ''To Tell the Truth.'' But it never really had much of a chance. There just was not enough computing power at the time. For a matchmaking system to succeed, it would need to analyze surveys instantaneously and let students sit in front of computers for themselves. It would, of course, need the Internet.
 Today, online personal ads have mushroomed into a $500 million annual business, with Barry Diller and Yahoo among the biggest players. No other industry makes as much money online from monthly fees, not even pornography, according to Jupiter Research.
 But the dating sites have their own problems. There are thousands upon thousands of listings on the big sites, like Match.com, and they are often filled with exaggerations. The business is not growing rapidly anymore. So the original idea that those Harvard students had -- compatibility through technology --is suddenly hot again. 
 Match.com has started Chemistry.com, which relies on the compatibility theories of a Rutgers anthropologist. The plot of the recent comedy ''Must Love Dogs,'' with John Cusack and Diane Lane, revolved around PerfectMatch, another site. Further up the cultural spectrum, The Atlantic Monthly devoted its March cover story to the different academic ideas behind Chemistry, PerfectMatch and a third site, eHarmony. 
 There is, in fact, some legitimate social science here. For one thing, similar people really are more likely to stay together. 
 During the first five years of marriage, the divorce rate for a couple of the same religion hovers around 24 percent, no matter what that religion is. But it jumps to 38 percent for a marriage between a mainline Protestant and a Catholic and 42 percent for one between a Jew and a Christian, according to Evelyn L. Lehrer, an economist at the University of Illinois, Chicago. 
 Divorce rates are also somewhat higher for interracial couples and for couples with a wife who is at least four years older than her husband. (When the man is a lot older, on the other hand, divorce is no more likely than when spouses are about the same age.)
 This is a bit depressing, because it sounds almost like an excuse for segregation. But take the data for what they are -- national averages, not individual destinies -- and averages are quite useful when thousands of people are involved. Chemistry and eHarmony both match people with similar demographic profiles.
 From here, the sites move into the still murky science of personalities. PerfectMatch deems some traits, like energy level and optimism, important for a couple to share, so that they don't clash over how to lead their lives. But with others -- flexibility, perfectionism, emotion -- a marriage can benefit from difference.
 I have no idea which of these theories will end up being right. And the people running the sites insist they have no illusions about replacing the mystery of human attraction. ''What this does is try to narrow it down so you spend less time with people who are totally out of the question,'' said Pepper Schwartz, the sociologist behind PerfectMatch's system. ''We're just upping your chances.'' 
 It is the same thing innovative people are doing in all kinds of fields now. Doctors are combining patient records with medical databases to double-check their intuition. Ben S. Bernanke, the new Federal Reserve chairman, is attracted to the notion of letting an economic formula help set interest rates. Big league baseball is in the midst of a scientific revolution, using extensive data to make better decisions about ballplayers. 
 But love seems like the final frontier in the debate between gut instinct and hard evidence. It's just hard to accept that a computer might know something about romance that we don't. Which brings us back to Ms. Brereton and Mr. Smith.
 In 1969, four years after he filled out his Operation Match survey, Mr. Smith went to a mixer, of all things, for graduate students at the University of Chicago. He saw a woman across the room he wanted to meet, and he walked over to introduce himself. Her name was Elizabeth Brereton. ''We knew immediately that we had been matched by Operation Match,'' she said. Four months later, they were engaged.
 They have spent the last three decades living outside of Boston in a house that has been filled with children, friends and more than its fair share of overnight guests. I met their oldest child, Matthew, in first grade, and during college I spent an entire summer living in the Smiths' guest room.
 So in honor of the Smiths, here is a prediction about which matchmaking site will finally fulfill Operation Match's grandest ambitions. It will be the one that helps pair people up while making them think that they have found love all on their own.

HEADLINE: It Isn't Amnesty

 BODY:
Here's one way to kill a cow: take it into the woods in hunting season, paint the word ''deer'' on it and stand back. 
 Something like that is happening in the immigration debate in Washington. Attackers of a smart, tough Senate bill have smeared it with the most mealy-mouthed word in the immigration glossary -- amnesty -- in hopes of rendering it politically toxic. They claim that the bill would bestow an official federal blessing of forgiveness on an estimated 12 million people who are living here illegally, rewarding their brazen crimes and encouraging more of the same.
That isn't true. The bill, approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee in a 12-to-6 vote on Monday, is one the country should be proud of. Four Republicans, including the committee's chairman, Arlen Specter, joined eight Democrats in endorsing a balanced approach to immigration reform. The bill does not ignore security and border enforcement. It would nearly double the number of Border Patrol agents, add resources for detaining illegal immigrants and deporting them more quickly, and expand state and local enforcement of immigration laws. It would create a system to verify workers' identities and impose tougher punishments on employers who defied it. 
 But unlike the bill's counterpart in the House, which makes a virtue out of being tough but not smart, the Specter bill would also take on the hard job of trying to sort out the immigrants who want to stay and follow the rules from those who don't. It would force them not into buses or jails but into line, where they could become lawful residents and -- if they showed they deserved it -- citizens. Instead of living off the books, they'd come into the system. 
 The path to citizenship laid out by the Specter bill wouldn't be easy. It would take 11 years, a clean record, a steady job, payment of a $2,000 fine and back taxes, and knowledge of English and civics. That's not ''amnesty,'' with its suggestion of getting something for nothing. But the false label has muddied the issue, playing to people's fear and indignation, and stoking the opportunism of Bill Frist, the Senate majority leader. Mr. Frist has his enforcement-heavy bill in the wings, threatening to make a disgraceful end run around the committee's work.
 The alternatives to the Specter bill are senseless. The enforcement-only approach -- building a 700-mile wall and engaging in a campaign of mass deportation and harassment to rip 12 million people from the national fabric -- would be an impossible waste of time and resources. It would destroy families and weaken the economy. An alternative favored by many businesses -- creating a temporary-worker underclass that would do our dirtiest jobs and then have to go home, with no new path to citizenship -- is a recipe for indentured servitude.
 It is a weak country that feels it cannot secure its borders and impose law and order on an unauthorized population at the same time. And it is a foolish, insecure country that does not seek to channel the energy of an industrious, self-motivated population to its own ends, but tries instead to wall out ''those people.'' 
 It's time for President Bush, who talks a good game on immigration, to use every means to clarify the issue and to lead this country out of the ''amnesty'' semantic trap. He dislikes amnesty. Mr. Frist dislikes amnesty. We dislike amnesty, too. 
 The Specter bill isn't amnesty. It's a victory for thoughtfulness and reason.

HEADLINE: Fed Panel Raises Rate To 4.75%

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28 

 BODY:
At Ben S. Bernanke's first meeting as head of the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee, the watchword was no surprises.
 As expected, the Federal Open Market Committee raised the benchmark federal funds rate on Tuesday by a quarter of a percentage point, to 4.75 percent, and suggested that at least one more increase was in the cards. It was the 15th such increase in consecutive meetings of the committee.
In its statement describing the decision, the central bank veered little from the Fed's prior assessments of the economy and the expected path of monetary policy, underscoring Mr. Bernanke's stated intention to maintain the course set by his predecessor as Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan. 
 Despite its predictability, the Fed's statement still modestly unsettled financial markets, bolstering the dollar in foreign exchange markets and sending the prices of stocks and government bonds lower. The broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.64 percent, to 1,293.23. [Page C9.]
 Though virtually all investors expected the rate increase, a substantial minority of operators on Wall Street had held hopes that the Fed would indicate that it would be the last one in the cycle that began in June 2004, when the benchmark rate stood at 1 percent. They were disappointed by the clear suggestion that the Fed still saw the need for further tightening.
 ''He was paving the way for another rate hike,'' said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at Bank of America. ''He knew full well that with this type of language the market would price in a hike to a 5 percent funds rate.'' 
 The Fed's statement relied on words nearly identical to those used after the committee's previous meeting in January, Mr. Greenspan's last after 18 years as head of the central bank. It said that ''some further policy firming may be needed'' to keep inflation under wraps.
 It pointed out that the economy was growing robustly after a slowdown in the fourth quarter of last year. It noted that core inflation, beyond food and energy, had ticked up only modestly, but it warned that the rising prices of energy and other commodities could add to inflation pressures in the future. 
 Though the committee's statement was pored over by financial analysts for any hint of the new chairman's intentions, the market tremors appeared to have little to do with the new management at the Fed. 
 Mr. Bernanke is expected to put his own stamp on the central bank eventually. He has long said that he supports more transparency, letting the markets know more clearly how the Fed reaches its decisions and what is the expected path of policy. He has argued in favor of setting a specific inflation target -- within a range -- to make explicit the Fed's goals. 
 He apparently judged Tuesday not to be the day for bold moves, however. Untested as Fed chairman, Mr. Bernanke had a clear interest in projecting continuity with the Greenspan Fed.
 At most, the new statement provided a mere hint of Mr. Bernanke's desired transparency. ''It was the same policy message but with a little innovation in communication,'' said Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor who is now an economic forecaster at Macroeconomic Advisers in Washington.
 The whiff of change came in the second paragraph of the Fed's five-paragraph statement, the passage often referred to as the ''snapshot paragraph,'' in which the committee assesses current economic conditions. It offered a somewhat more detailed analysis of current conditions than the one issued in January. 
 Significantly, it calmed fears that wage increases might spur inflation by pointing out that productivity gains were holding down the growth in labor costs. 
 At the same time, the Fed went beyond the expected description of the economy's current status to elucidate what it saw as its likely future path. ''Economic growth has rebounded strongly in the current quarter,'' it said, adding that growth appeared ''likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace.'' 
 Mr. Bernanke comes to the helm of the nation's central bank at a delicate moment for monetary policy. Since the Fed started increasing interest rates, financial markets have come to expect a quarter-point rise in interest rates at pretty much every committee meeting.
 But after 15 consecutive rate increases, the cycle of monetary tightening is reaching its peak as interest rates approach what is seen as a ''neutral'' rate that is not so high that it slows economic growth but not so low that it allows inflationary fears to come back to life.
 With underlying inflation at 1.8 percent, excluding food and energy, the Fed's preferred measure is still within the range of 1 percent to 2 percent considered comfortable by most officials. That leaves the Fed debating how far to raise rates merely to counter the risk of higher inflation as opposed to the reality of prices rising too fast. 
 In a note to investors, a Goldman Sachs economist, Andrew Tilton, said that ''the potential for disagreement on policy decisions increases now that the Fed is roughly at 'neutral' and the data become more important.''
 With the economy growing at a healthy clip but facing the potential headwind of a weakening housing market, the decision on when to end the cycle of rising interest rates will not be trivial. 
 The outlook for inflation is slightly worse than in January, with increases in producer prices and consumer price inflation. Payrolls have expanded by some 200,000 a month and retail sales have grown sharply.
 Fed economists have argued that a slowing housing market is likely to dampen overall economic growth. Housing, however, is not sinking yet. Sales of existing homes rose in February, housing starts remain strong and by some measures home prices are still rising.
 In testimony to Congress last month, Mr. Bernanke argued that in coming quarters the Fed's policy-setting committee ''will have to make ongoing, provisional judgments about the risks to both inflation and growth, and monetary policy action will be increasingly dependent on incoming data.''
 Given such uncertainties, mused Ethan S. Harris, chief economist of Lehman Brothers, ''Bernanke moved into the job right at the time it got interesting.''

HEADLINE: TOP AIDE LEAVES WHITE HOUSE JOB; BUDGET CHIEF IN 

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28 

 BODY:
President Bush replaced his chief of staff, Andrew H. Card Jr., with another longtime loyalist on Tuesday, a step unlikely to satisfy calls within his own party for fresh thinking to address the administration's troubles.
 In turning to Joshua B. Bolten, his budget director, as the new chief of staff, the president stayed within what one close associate called a ''circle of comfort'' and what Mr. Bush's critics consider a closed world that brooks little doubt or dissent.
 Mr. Bolten worked for Mr. Bush's father on international trade and has filled important policy posts for Mr. Bush since 1999, when Mr. Bush began campaigning for the White House. [Man in the News, Page A16.]
 The White House left open the possibility that Mr. Bolten would, in turn, replace other senior members of the staff. 
 The change, however incremental, occurred at a crucial moment in Mr. Bush's presidency and, in a White House remarkable for the stability of its senior staff, represented at least a symbolic turning point. 
 With Mr. Bush's poll numbers at or near their lows, his agenda stalled, his party no longer staying in line behind him and the Iraq war overshadowing almost everything he does, the president has been under pressure to give his administration new energy and direction. 
 Mr. Card's departure and Mr. Bolten's appointment signaled a possible start to achieving those ends, but shed little light on whether more substantive changes were to come.
 In interviews and public statements, Mr. Bush's aides said that the president had accepted Mr. Card's resignation reluctantly and that if there were shifts in policy to go along with Mr. Bolten's arrival, they would be gradual.
 ''The president's style is not Saturday Night Massacre,'' a senior White House official said Tuesday night, a reference to Richard M. Nixon's series of firings in the Watergate scandal. The official said Mr. Bolten had ''been given full authority'' to reshuffle the White House staff if he deemed it necessary.
 Asked in an interview with CNN Espanol whether more changes were coming, Mr. Bush replied: ''Josh has just begun to take a look at the White House structure. And I haven't had a chance to talk to him about the future yet.''
 Other officials said they would be surprised if the move foretold any major shifts of policy on Iraq, economic management or other elements of the domestic agenda. 
 People close to Mr. Bush said he deliberately chose an insider who understood how this White House operated, even at the risk of angering Republican members of Congress who have said the White House has failed to consult with them sufficiently and blundered on the response to Hurricane Katrina, the nomination of Harriet E. Miers for the Supreme Court and the handling of Dubai's effort to take over management of some American port terminal operations.
 ''The differences between Andy Card and Josh Bolten are at the margins,'' said Donald Evans, the former commerce secretary and one of Mr. Bush's closest friends. ''Josh is somebody the president knows well, and he knows how he operates. He can hit the ground running, and that's what the president wants. Just like any C.E.O., he wants to promote from the inside.''
 But that may not satisfy the Republicans who have been calling for more wholesale change. Mr. Bolten, although not part of the Texas clique that has dominated the White House, has had a hand in nearly all big domestic policy initiatives.
 And though he has little experience in the national security issues on which Mr. Bush's political fate probably rests, he is respected among Republicans on Capitol Hill, where the president has had trouble holding his party together. 
 Karl Rove, who serves both as Mr. Bush's chief political strategist and deputy chief of staff for policy, remains in his posts, despite lingering public uncertainty over whether he will be charged in the inquiry into the leak of a C.I.A. officer's name.
 On paper, Mr. Rove's policy position makes him subordinate to Mr. Bolten, who held the same job during Mr. Bush's first term, though in practice Mr. Rove has few rivals in influence or breadth of portfolio, especially with Mr. Card departing. 
 A former White House official said, ''It's hard to imagine the two of them operating hand in glove,'' but noted that Mr. Rove and Mr. Card managed to work together, if warily.
 At a brief ceremony in the Oval Office, Mr. Bush said Mr. Card, a Massachusetts Republican who appeared tired and emotional as he stood at the president's side, had approached him ''and raised the possibility of stepping down.'' 
 White House officials said Mr. Card raised the possibility on March 8, just after the White House was taken by surprise by the ferocity of a Republican uproar over the Dubai controversy. That was the latest in a series of cases in which Republicans complained that the White House had been slow to detect approaching troubles, and Mr. Card had repeatedly said that if the White House staff made missteps, ''it should be directed at me.'' 
 Mr. Bush made the final decision last weekend at Camp David, aides said.
 ''He thought it might be time to return to private life,'' Mr. Bush said of Mr. Bolten, who has served longer than any other chief of staff except Sherman Adams, who worked under President Dwight D. Eisenhower from 1953 to 1958.
 While largely unseen in public, Mr. Card has been one of the most crucial members of Mr. Bush's team, arriving at 5:30 each morning to organize the president's agenda, act as gatekeeper to the Oval Office and provide advice.
 He never sought the limelight, saying a few months ago on C-Span: ''I'm very comfortable with the reality that I am a staffer. I'm just a staffer.''
 A year ago, he told a reporter, ''The biggest mistake you can make in this job is to confuse yourself with one of the president's best friends.''
 Clearly there is a bond between the two men, forged in some respects on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, when Mr. Card whispered into Mr. Bush's ear at an elementary school in Sarasota, Fla., that a second plane had hit the World Trade Center and that ''America is under attack.'' 
 On Tuesday, Mr. Bush recalled that day and praised Mr. Card, citing ''legislative achievements from education to Medicare,'' the successful confirmation of two Supreme Court justices and the response to the Sept. 11 attacks. 
 Mr. Bolten will start on April 15, continuing a steady path toward the center of Mr. Bush's innermost circle. Starting in 1999, after he left a senior post with the investment bank Goldman Sachs in London, Mr. Bolten was the policy director of the 2000 Bush campaign. 
 He was a deputy chief of staff under Mr. Card from 2001 to 2003 and since then has been the budget director. 
 Mr. Bush praised Mr. Bolten as ''a man with broad experience, having worked on Capitol Hill and on Wall Street and in the White House'' and described him as being respected by members of Congress of both parties. 
 Mr. Bolten is a graduate of Princeton University, the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs and the Stanford Law School. 
 While most Republicans welcomed the move, several made clear that they did not believe it went far enough.
 ''I'm one of those who has said I think they need some new blood, more people of stature in the White House,'' Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, said on Fox News.
 Mr. Bolten has not been a major player on Iraq policy, except for drawing up the budgets for the American troop presence there and the reconstruction. He will now become a significant player in the running debate in the White House over how Mr. Bush can begin to extract American troops.
 As part of his job, he will sift through the intelligence that goes to Mr. Bush, and join many of the meetings on Iraq in the Situation Room. But the task of extracting troops over the next year will remain largely in the hands of Mr. Bush's longest-serving aides, who have now outlasted Mr. Card: Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, among others.

HEADLINE: Neglected Solo Gamers, Now Heroes Once Again 

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL

 BODY:
As the new video game The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion begins, the hero -- that's you, the player -- appears within a dank subterranean cell in a grim medieval dungeon, the silence broken only by the mad ramblings of another hapless prisoner. 
 In moments, the cell's door creaks open, and armor-clad guards rush in, surrounding his majesty, Emperor Uriel Septim VII. Pursued by assassins, the venerable emperor and his guardians are rushing for an ancient tunnel to flee the Imperial City -- a tunnel that just happens to lead from the player's cell.
But the assassins are waiting in ambush. As they close in, and the guards fall, the emperor, with his final breaths, implores the player to escape, find the kingdom's lost heir and seal the gates to hell -- which are, of course, about to let loose a horde of demons on the world.
 For a gamer, the scene is at once utterly familiar and thoroughly fresh, much as a modern interpretation of ''King Lear'' can be considered inventive, even though the audience already knows how the story ends. 
 But imagine if only one theater company in the world still focused on producing old plays. Then imagine the pressure and anticipation from the few remaining fans if that one group of Shakespeareans put on a new show only every four years or so.
 If you can imagine that, you can understand Oblivion's place in the game world and why for thousands of gamers of a certain generation, men and women in their late 20's and 30's who grew up on big medieval fantasy epics, Oblivion has been such a rush. Since its release for PC's and the Xbox 360 last week, the game has sold out in stores across the country and appears to be supplying the first noticeable competition to World of Warcraft, the ''American Idol'' of games, for the hearts and minds of many old-school players.
 Two decades ago, games played by one person at a time, in which the player's character navigates a high-fantasy world of goblins and elves, constituted the best-selling state of the art. But today, fantasy role-playing games that can be played by hundreds, thousands, or even millions of players at once, all meeting in cyberspace and navigating the world they collectively inhabit, have become vastly more popular. And in the process, single-player fantasy swashbucklers have been relegated to dustbin status, an afterthought, if any thought, for most game makers. 
 Yet for Todd Howard, 35, and the rest of the Elder Scrolls team at Bethesda Softworks in Rockville, Md., harnessing the latest technologies in the service of old-style fantasy epics is like using modern tools to create the toys you always dreamed of as a child.
 ''We wanted to make that quintessential fantasy role-playing experience, like we had growing up,'' said Mr. Howard, Oblivion's executive producer. ''I like the traditional things like skeletons and trolls and zombies. But we also wanted to make Oblivion the role-playing game for the next generation -- both the next generation of hardware and the next generation of people who haven't played these kinds of games.''
 By focusing the action on an individual character -- a stand-in for the player himself -- a single-player game can often deliver a more emotionally compelling experience than games in which countless numbers participate. And if, by chance, that individual character is charged with saving civilization from some terrible evil, well, all the more so. 
 Oblivion begins with the player being anointed the chosen one, a hero whose destiny is to save the world, as in epics stretching back thousands of years. It is a powerful dramatic device -- and the other characters, being mere figments of the imagination, don't mind being relegated to a supporting role.
 ''The biggest and most important difference is that single-player games don't have what you call a continuity problem in the storytelling, simply because you don't have multiple people in the game world,'' said Mipam Thurman, 27, an avid gamer who works in marketing for Tibet House, a New York City nonprofit group. ''In a single-player game, if you kill the dragon, it's dead forever. In a multiplayer game the dragon respawns every 20 minutes so the next player can kill it. So in a single-player game the village that was being besieged by the dragon can forever thank you and be grateful, but in a multiplayer game that can never happen. So the accomplishments in a single-player game can seem much more important and memorable.''
 In a multiplayer game, one player cannot become the all-powerful savior, because there are all those thousands of other players in the same situation. As one among many, you start out as a nobody and only very slowly gain status. It can take hundreds of hours before you get any real power -- and even the most powerful player is still just a cog in the overall story of the game's world. In a multiplayer game, all power is relative, and all success is partial. 
 Rebeca Ames, 26, a World of Warcraft player who works for the Brooklyn Children's Museum and has dabbled with Oblivion, said the absence of a social context often leaves single-player games feeling a bit pointless. ''There's no doubt some people are saying, 'I'd rather be playing Oblivion,' since it came out,'' she said. ''But I end up feeling in a single-player game that there's no one to share your accomplishments with.''
 Judging by the success of Oblivion's predecessor, Morrowind, which has sold more than five million copies (including expansion packs) since its release in 2002, many players still enjoy the rare single-player fantasy game. But just as significant as the heroic element may be the element of nostalgia. 
 In the early- and mid-1980's, millions of families across the country bought their first home computer -- often an Apple II or Commodore 64 whose primary user was likely to be an elementary school or middle school-age child, usually a boy. Much of the time, that boy used the computer to play top role-playing games like those in the Wizardry, Ultima and Bard's Tale series -- the first video games that allowed players to feel as if they were actually delving after the dragon's gold rather than simply reading ''The Hobbit.'' Today, some of those boys have grown into gamers in their early- to mid-30's, and single-player fantasy games -- as unfashionable as they are -- are like mother's milk to them.
 World of Warcraft, made by Blizzard Entertainment, has been the leviathan of game play for the last 18 months and now has more than six million paying subscribers around the world. Oblivion is no overall threat to that game, but for the first time, even some serious, highly structured World of Warcraft guilds have seen small groups of players take leaves to focus on another game: Oblivion. On one World of Warcraft Web message board, a group of postings is titled, ''Oblivion Is Obliviating Raiding Guilds.''
 Like many of the new Oblivion fanatics, Mr. Howard grew up in the early 1980's. Now he has the power to help reinterpret and reinvigorate the role-playing genre that drew him and other young men his age into gaming in the first place.
 Greg Vederman, editor-in-chief of PC Gamer magazine, said that economics had trumped these single-player games: role-playing games are expensive to make, and individual sales (generally $50 or so) can't compare with the monthly fees (as much as $15 per player) generated by the most popular online games.
 ''I don't think it's that the audience has disappeared for these kind of games,'' Mr. Vederman said. But he added, ''If you're a publisher and you're going to invest the years and millions of dollars to make one of these games, you're probably going to do an online game because the potential upside is so much higher.''
 Yet for all the lure of cyberspace, Mr. Howard and his team remain some of the last guardians of one of gaming's oldest traditions.
 ''The whole idea of the game is that you can be whoever you want and do whatever you want,'' he said. ''There's this wide-open fantasy world on your computer or your television. It's sort of the Elder Scrolls motto: 'Live another life in another world.' And that's what we let people do.''

Customize, And Save The World Your Way
 In addition to its heroic story lines and huge game world, one of the other elements that has drawn players to the Elder Scroll series has been its ''modability,'' in gamer parlance -- that is, the ease with which the game can be modified and customized by fans. 
 For the PC version of Oblivion, Bethesda Softworks has released a ''construction set'' that allows players with a bit of technical acumen to alter the game in almost every way imaginable, from changing the appearance of monsters to adding entire new quests and stories. (The Xbox 360 version is not so easily changed by fans.) Dozens of such ''mods'' are already being posted on Internet sites like Oblivion Source (www.oblivionsource.com.)
 Given the core gamer demographic, modifications that make female characters appear nude or topless are among the most popular mods. Yet Todd Howard, the game's executive producer, does not expect a controversy around his game similar to the media and political firestorm that engulfed Rockstar Games last year. That happened after clever players figured out how to reveal a hidden scene in that company's Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas that allowed the player's digital avatar to simulate sex with his girlfriend. 
 ''The Grand Theft Auto situation was about people unlocking content that was already programmed into the game,'' he said. ''That is very different from what we're doing, which is making the tools publicly available for people to create their own content. Some people will make new quests. Some people will make nude mods. A lot of people on the Internet like nudity. Is that a big surprise?'' SETH SCHIESEL

The Disposable American
Layoffs and Their Consequences
By Louis Uchitelle
283 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $25.95
 Is the layoff the great American wound? In Louis Uchitelle's account, it seems a wound in triplicate. It hollows out companies so they can't compete. It hollows out the country by removing middle-class jobs. It hollows out the middle-class employees who are laid off and then too often drop permanently to a demeaning, low-wage way of life. To Mr. Uchitelle, who reports on economics for The New York Times, corporate America's addiction to the layoff has gone past the point of economic rationality. In this fascinating book he tries to tell the history of the United States in our time as the unchecked rise of layoffs. 
 ''The Disposable American'' is a history in which odd characters like Pat Buchanan, the former chief executives Jack Welch and Albert J. Dunlap (known as Chainsaw Al), the economist Alfred Kahn and others loom large -- but so do Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Robert E. Rubin, former secretary of the treasury. But Mr. Uchitelle is just as interested in ordinary people and in the way that layoffs keep tormenting those who have been let go. As he writes, ''I did not think in the early stages of the reporting for this book that I would be drawn so persistently into the psychiatric aspect of layoffs.'' 
 The layoff, Mr. Uchitelle argues, has transformed the nation. At least 30 million full-time American employees have gotten pink slips since the Labor Department belatedly started to count them in 1984. But add in the early retirees, the ''quits'' who saw the layoffs coming, and the number is much higher -- a whole ghost nation trekking into what for most will be lower-wage work. This is the Dust Bowl in our Golden Bowl, and to Mr. Uchitelle, layoffs in one way are worse than the unemployment of the 1930's. At least then, most of the jobless came back to better-paid, more secure jobs. Those laid off in our time almost never will.
 Mr. Uchitelle effectively wrecks the claim that all this downsizing makes the country more productive, more competitive, more flexible. He is willing to admit that downsizing can be necessary. ''The global economy is not to be denied,'' he writes. But to lay off is now like a business school tic, whether it makes any sense or not. With fewer employees, many companies begin to crumble. Innovation also suffers. ''Rather than try to outstrip foreign competitors in innovation, a costly and risky process, we gave up in product after product,'' Mr. Uchitelle writes. As he points out, many of the business stars now are companies, like Southwest Airlines, that have refused to downsize at all. A growing number of economists argue that layoffs cause more problems than they solve.
 The heart of Mr. Uchitelle's book is his detailed, wide-ranging reporting. He is present, taking notes, while airline mechanics are being counseled into job training that will take them into lower-wage work. If they were not so painful, these moments would have a certain droll comedy. One mechanic ends up running a water taxi for tourists. Another goes into maintenance. Others find jobs ''throwing boxes'' at Federal Express. As one of the ex-mechanics tells Mr. Uchitelle years later: ''It is hard to look in your son's eyes and explain to him that you are making $12 an hour and know his high school friends are making that much on the side.'' 
 In one of his shrewder moves, Mr. Uchitelle goes right into the enemy camp, as it were, and looks in on a reunion of Harvard graduates, the class of '68. But even Harvard grads are among the wounded now -- some have received pink slips. Mr. Uchitelle makes a strong case that the whole middle class is at risk. During the Clinton era, the claim was that the United States was expanding high-wage, high-skilled jobs, and that the laid off could simply jump into jobs as good or better. But Mr. Uchitelle takes apart this argument. After all, he writes, as of 2004, more than 45 percent of American workers were earning $13.25 an hour or less. The jobs that the country has been ''growing'' the fastest include those like janitor, hospital orderly and cashier.
 It nettles Mr. Uchitelle that even the center-left politicians have said so little about this trend -- or have done so little to stop layoffs. In fact, layoffs rose faster in the first half of the 1990's than they did in the first half of the 80's. Mr. Uchitelle particularly blames Mr. Clinton. One of his chapters is titled ''A Green Light From Clinton.'' Mr. Uchitelle writes: ''As much as anyone, he disconnected the Democratic party from its past, specifically its New Deal concern for job security and full employment.'' Indeed, it is Mr. Uchitelle's point that it took government action to bring about the reign of layoffs. 
 He is also clear that this began long before the Clinton presidency. Mr. Uchitelle puts special emphasis on the deregulation of many industries, the dilution of the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act of 1978 and what he regards as other political wrong turns. Still, in a brief concluding chapter, it is unclear whether Mr. Uchitelle sees any good solutions now -- including a solution that he attributes to this reviewer.
 In this retelling of American history, Mr. Uchitelle is baffled by the collapse of any serious resistance to these mass layoffs. Even the protestors who began to sound off in the 90's generally believed that companies did have to downsize or die. It bothers Mr. Uchitelle that the mechanics and others he covers in this book and gets to know personally often blame themselves. ''Whenever I insisted that layoffs were a phenomenon in America beyond their control, they agreed perfunctorily and then went right back to describing why it was somehow their fault or their particular bad luck.'' 
 Many readers know Mr. Uchitelle as a business journalist with an acute analytic bent. That is in this book, but there is a surprising passion as well. He urges -- demands -- that Americans speak up: not to give empty speeches about how more of us should go to college, or ''skill up,'' but to stop the layoffs from ravaging us all.

HEADLINE: Using an Iceberg to Tell The Colorful Tales of Alaska

BYLINE: By MATT VILLANO

DATELINE: FAIRBANKS, Alaska 

 BODY:
WAY up north, in this city notorious for cubelike buildings that are cheap and easy to heat, the brand-new University of Alaska Museum of the North has everyone literally thinking outside the box.
 Situated on the campus of the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, the museum rises from the landscape like an iceberg. The swooping exterior hints of breaching whales and calving glaciers. Curves abound. Giant windows shaped like arched eyebrows peer out on the Tanana Flats, toward Mount McKinley.
And that's just the outside. Inside, the museum takes arts and crafts pieces and puts them together to tell a colorful story of Alaska. Native American work sits beside nonnative art. Paintings, baskets and caribou skulls hang from the walls. 
 The museum is to open fully on May 1 after a $42 million expansion paid for by Congress, the State of Alaska and corporate, foundation and individual donors. The project, involving renovation of the existing museum space and the addition of a new wing, is part of a cultural and economic renaissance in the state's second-largest city. (Anchorage is the largest.) It is a comeback marked by a new train station, new department stores, a housing boom and the anticipation of drilling in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge, about 500 miles north. 
 ''It all started with a big idea and the community support to make it happen,'' said Aldona Jonaitis, the museum's director.
 That big idea originally belonged to Dr. Jonaitis, a Queens native. She wrote her dissertation on southeast Alaskan art, reflecting an interest ignited by a trip to the state when she was younger. In February 1993, officials at the university recruited her from her post as vice president for public programs at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. On the day of her first interview in Fairbanks, the temperature was far below freezing. Undaunted, Dr. Jonaitis took the job and sold her tiny TriBeCa apartment for a 2,000-square-foot-house overlooking the Alaska Range.
 When she arrived, the university's museum was underfinanced and overcrowded with stuff, and sat in a cubelike building. Still, Dr. Jonaitis dreamed of putting more of the collection on display. She liked that no other museum in Alaska had established itself as the state's flagship, a distinction she thought she could snatch in no time. Most of all, Dr. Jonaitis wanted to transform the museum into a place that people outside of Alaska would talk about, and was excited when the chancellor commissioned her to build a new wing.
 ''I couldn't believe I'd have the chance to build a new museum in such an amazing place,'' said Dr. Jonaitis, who still talks with a pizza-parlor accent. ''That's when it hit me: why not build the new museum in a signature building, and craft it around the spirit of Alaska?''
 In 1998, the university hired Hammel, Green & Abrahamson, an architecture firm based in Minneapolis, to capture this spirit. Joan Sorrano, the firm's vice president, flew to Alaska and spent weeks taking in the natural beauty. 
 By the time she returned home, some major themes had emerged: ice, whales, mountains and snow.
 ''One thing that I was thinking about was how when ice moves, it shears off and one plane shifts over another plane,'' she said. ''I wanted to express this notion of something that's been here forever, always changing, always becoming something new.''
 Ms. Sorrano wrote plans that revolved around a giant cantilevered form, a jagged snow-white section that appeared to slide over a lower, more rectangular element. Building this was not easy. One threat was the Fairbanks climate; with summer temperatures soaring into the 90's and winter temperatures hitting 60 below zero, contractors constantly battled the elements. 
 The exhibitions inside were also arranged to reflect the diversity of life in the Great North. Beneath the tall ceilings of the Rose Berry Alaska Art Gallery, for example, is the Okvik Madonna, a 1,500-year-old walrus-ivory native carving of a mother and child. Nearby, ''Mt. McKinley,'' by Sydney Laurence, a landscape painter, shares a wall with an Inupiat parka made of ground squirrel, wolf and wolverine furs. 
 Within the gallery are sections, like ''A Sense of Place,'' where there are Alaskan works like imagery of a boreal forest and an outhouse intended to convey that many Alaskans do not have running water. In the ''Art as a Process'' section, visitors learn how the Nunamiut Eskimos make caribou-skin-covered kayaks. 
 ''Over the years, museums have been criticized for segregating different kinds of art,'' Dr. Jonaitis said. ''We wanted to demolish those barriers and have people come here and say: 'Aha! Art can be so many things.' ''
 Planning this gallery began in 1999, months after the design got under way. Dr. Jonaitis invited colleagues from all over the art world to participate, as well as members from local tribes. 
 During one meeting, an Athabascan Indian bead worker talked about cutting a salmon. Ruth B. Phillips, a committee member and professor of art history at Carleton University in Ottawa, said that the bead worker opened the group's eyes to how Native Americans see art in ways others may not.
 ''To her, the fish was not an object but a subject,'' Dr. Phillips said. Not every art expert is convinced that the museum's radical approach will succeed. Janet Berlo, a professor of art history and visual and cultural studies at the University of Rochester, said that despite recent efforts at the National Museum of the American Indian to display crafts alongside fine art, the Fairbanks strategy of putting disparate genres together could attract criticism. 
 ''You might get academics or art critics saying it's a mishmash of things that don't belong together,'' said Dr. Berlo, who specializes in Native North American art and teaches a course in museum representation. Still, she noted, ''I think it's a good way to introduce people to these kinds of art without hitting them over the head.''
 Even Dr. Jonaitis said that the Museum of the North might not be for everyone. 
 ''Alaskans are not like anybody else in the world,'' she said. ''Whatever those differences are, this museum celebrates them, and that's something we're really proud to do.''

HEADLINE: Museums Roll Again, But Where Are All The People?

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

DATELINE: New Orleans 

 BODY:
THE T-shirt in the gift shop of the National D-Day Museum here says it all: We Have Returned.
 That play on Gen. Douglas MacArthur's 1942 pledge after leaving the Philippines is the museum's way of saying that it is back from the punishing blows of Hurricane Katrina. It reopened in December. If you would like to buy the $13 T-shirt, by the way, the museum would be grateful. Business is hell. On a recent Thursday morning, there were almost as many volunteers on hand to describe the exhibitions as there were visitors to look at them. On an average day in 2005 before Katrina, the museum got about 800 visitors, with 1,000 a day on weekends.
 ''We know it will be a slow build,'' said Clem Goldberger, the museum's senior director of marketing, ''but we know that the numbers will come back over time.'' 
 More than six months after the storm, enormous stretches of the city's neighborhoods are still devastated. But dozens of museums are starting to bring back the city's artistic soul. The situation is ''what would be if you had a significant natural catastrophe that had destroyed major portions of Queens and Brooklyn and Staten Island -- but most of Manhattan was intact, including Wall Street and Central Park and the theater district,'' said J. Stephen Perry, chief executive of the New Orleans Metropolitan Convention and Visitors Bureau. ''This is, truly, without a doubt, a tale of two cities.''
 One by one, museums have reopened (for an update, visit neworleansmuseums.com), and each has a tale to tell.

THE NATIONAL D-DAY MUSEUM (www.ddaymuseum.org), which is housed in an old brewery, stood up to the storm with only a little leak from a skylight. But vandals broke in during the chaotic days afterward; a steel gate protected the displays, but the vandals tore up the gift shop and coffee shop and defecated in the building. The damage required 90 days to clean up.

NEW ORLEANS MUSEUM OF ART (www.noma.org) just reopened at the beginning of this month. Its Beaux-Arts building sits in City Park, which had heavy flooding. But while the storm damaged some works in the sculpture garden, the museum itself, which sits atop high ground, was an island. The museum and garden sustained about $6 million in damage, said E. John Bullard, the museum's director. It has reopened three days a week for now, but Mr. Bullard said that he hoped to be up to five days a week by June when an Ansel Adams show opens -- and, he joked, ''to celebrate the beginning of hurricane season.''

THE OGDEN MUSEUM OF SOUTHERN ART (www.ogdenmuseum.org), a favorite of New Orleanians, reopened in late October. J. Richard Gruber, the director, said that the staff struggled in the weeks after Katrina to complete a book project about the city's vanishing architectural marvels, titled ''Missing New Orleans.'' They quickly added an epilogue with photos of Katrina damage. Instead of author photos, the people who worked on the book included pictures of their own ruined homes. ''It underscores the reality that we're coping with,'' Mr. Gruber said.

CONTEMPORARY ARTS CENTER (www.cacno.org), a home for visual and performing arts that occupies a four-story warehouse built in 1905, suffered extensive damage to its 20,000-square-foot roof and lost 41 windows. But the center reopened in January. Water severely damaged its offices, but ''by the grace of God, all I can say is none of the water ended up destroying any of the art or art spaces,'' said Jay Weigel, the center's executive and artistic director.

THE HISTORIC NEW ORLEANS COLLECTION (www.hnoc.org) suffered almost no damage and was the first museum to reopen, on Oct. 11. Through June 30, it is featuring ''Common Routes: St. Domingue-Louisiana,'' an exhibition that documents the city's ties to Haiti and celebrates, as the museum's executive director Priscilla Lawrence put it, ''the commonality of our diversity.''
 Other museums have not been so lucky. At the Louisiana State Museum (lsm.crt.state.la.us), a historical institution in the Old U.S. Mint in the French Quarter with a large collection of jazz documents, large pieces of the roof were ripped off by Katrina. About 3 percent of the collection was damaged; the museum has freeze-dried the materials and is studying ways to restore them. But the building will probably not open until late 2007, said Kacey M. Hill, the museum's public information director.
 Many museums have had to cut staff, and executives have gotten reacquainted with mops and brooms. Now all they need is visitors. About 80 percent of visitors to the D-Day Museum were tourists and conventioneers, and there have not been many of either since Katrina. Mr. Perry said that the numbers will improve over time, with conventions in 2006 reaching about half their normal level, and expected ''almost fully normal'' by 2008. 
 Other museums, like the Ogden, have a broader base of local visitors. The Ogden made up for sparse daytime attendance by bringing people together for its Thursday night music program, Ogden After Hours. The events have served as rallying points, attracting hundreds of visitors -- ''probably double or triple what it was'' before the storm, Mr. Gruber said. The Contemporary Arts Center has also kicked off a music series, and Mr. Weigel said that it was a way to help begin the healing process for New Orleans. ''It's hard during the day to live a normal life here right now,'' Mr. Weigel said. ''At nighttime and weekends people are really looking to be engaged again.''
 For some people, museumgoing has been a long-delayed homecoming. Ted and Marcie Chiasson from Belle Chasse, La., took their daughters, Sarah, 8, and Marisela, 8 months, to the New Orleans Museum of Art on a recent Saturday. 
 ''I saw in the paper that it reopened,'' Mr. Chiasson said. ''There's so much closed in the city, there's not much to do.'' Sarah had seen a picture of a clay horse in The Times-Picayune, and she wanted to see it close up. ''She bothered us all week to come to the museum,'' Mr. Chiasson said. The couple had not been to the museum since the late 1970's. 
 In the museum entry hall, the clay horse is displayed in a case. It is more than 2,000 years old, a wonder from the Western Han Dynasty of China. It stands with head erect, tail up, a survivor, its face almost smiling.
 To the left of the horse hangs a large painting, ''St. Sebastian,'' by the Renaissance artist Giuliano Bugiardini. St. Sebastian, a martyr who is often shown pierced by arrows, survived his injuries, according to legend. Some artists show him in agony, others in a grace-suffused calm. In the hands of Bugiardini, he looks exasperated. 
 His image seems at home in New Orleans, wounded but hanging in there.

HEADLINE: Antiquities And Politics Intersect In a Lawsuit

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
INCREASINGLY, the world of antiquities and museums has become a politically charged one, with museums acknowledging that art that was found to be looted must be returned. But when the objects come from a country that is viewed as an enemy rather than an ally, the arena of antiquities takes a different twist. Consider the fate of some artifacts from Iran.
 In 2004, federal prosecutors in New York seized a 2,500-year-old silver ceremonial drinking vessel of Iranian origin. Because imports from Iran are severely restricted, a dealer had listed the object on import papers as coming from Syria and sold it to a collector for $950,000. 
At the time, authorities heralded the case as part of a broadening crackdown on antiquities trafficking. But these days, they will not discuss the piece's future or even confirm that it has been stored in a warehouse since its seizure.
 It is not clear when, or even if, the ceremonial vessel, which is known as a rhyton, will go back to Iran. But one unrelated development might affect its fate. A group of American citizens, armed with a $300 million court award against the government of Iran, has brought actions against the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago as well as other museums holding Iranian artifacts. Their goal, unusual as it might sound, is to seize the objects so they can be sold off, thus satisfying at least part of that judgment.
 The group of nine Americans received the financial award in 2003 when the Iranian government defaulted on a lawsuit, which was filed in a Chicago federal court, by not defending itself. In that lawsuit, the Americans, who were injured in a 1997 suicide bombing in Jerusalem, charged that Iran had financed its political ally, Hamas, to carry out the blast.
 To collect that judgment, however, the plaintiffs have to seize assets belonging to Iran, a task complicated by two factors, a dearth of such assets in this country as well as American legal principles that effectively immunize a foreign government against such seizures.
 In this context, the artifacts, which date to the glory days of the Persian Empire, are an inviting target. In the 1930's, the Oriental Institute, for example, conducted extensive excavations at sites like Persepolis, bringing back thousands of artifacts. Some of those objects were granted to the institute by the Iranian government for its role in the excavation, while others, including a vast library of cuneiform tablets, were lent to the museum for study, with the understanding that they would eventually be returned, said Gil Stein, the institute's director.
 Mr. Stein said it took decades for scholars at the Oriental Institute to decipher the tablets and begin to publish what they had learned about the history of ancient Persia. Finally, in 2003, the institute announced that it had arranged to begin returning some of the artifacts to Iran, information that soon came to the attention of David J. Strachman, a lawyer in Providence, R.I., who represented the plaintiffs in the bombing case.
 When Mr. Stein went to work a few days later he got a surprise. ''He served us with a summons saying that you need to turn this stuff over in 10 days,'' he said. 
 A legal battle ensued. Both the Oriental Institute and the State Department took the position that the artifacts were part of Iran's national patrimony and therefore did not fit the definition of a commercial ''asset'' that could be seized to satisfy a judgment.
 Their position, however, suffered a setback in December when an opinion held that only the government of Iran could claim that its assets were immune from seizure, and Iran continues to ignore the legal proceedings. Both the museum and federal officials have asked the judge in the case to set that opinion aside.
 Meanwhile, the group of bombing victims has filed claims against a list of institutions with extensive Persian collections, including the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and Harvard University. Mr. Strachman said he was not interested in fighting a cultural war but simply wanted his clients to get the money that was owed to them.
 So far, the only Iranian property his group has seized is a small house in Lubbock, Tex., which the former shah of Iran bought for his son while he was taking flight training in the United States. ''If Iran would pay this judgment we would not be here,'' Mr. Strachman said.

HEADLINE: Who Owns Art?

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
KARMA never sleeps. When people steal from other people, redress always comes, though maybe not for a long time and in unexpected forms. Because the history of art is, in large part, a history of theft, karmic action is always at work. Somewhere, it's always payback time.
 We got a juicy taste of this recently, when the Metropolitan Museum of Art, after decades of stonewalling, agreed to return several possibly stolen -- that is, illegally excavated -- objects to Italy, one being the famous Euphronios krater. Yet the Met affair was small potatoes compared with orgies of art larceny in the not-so-distant past.
 Under Napoleon, French armies hauled ton after ton of Pharaonic sculpture from Egypt and back to Paris. Around the same time, the British were shipping the Elgin marbles to London. Later in Africa, in 1897, British troops, in a punishing mood, stripped clean the ivories and bronzes from the altars and palaces of the West African kingdom of Benin and sent those exquisite objects home, too. 
 Our own time is even more pillage-happy, if only because transportation is easier. Monumental Khmer sculptures were airlifted from Cambodia during the Vietnam War and flown to destinations unknown. Nok sculptures, among the oldest-surviving African artworks, are being dug up and smuggled out of Nigeria. Using aerial surveillance, looters have found Mayan temple sculptures deep in the jungles of Guatemala, then sliced them up and carried them away.
 More visible to the world through photojournalism was the pillage of icons and murals from Greek Orthodox churches in the Turkish-occupied section of Cyprus and the depredations of the Taliban in Afghanistan. China's single-minded rape of Tibet's temples and monasteries is the stuff of legend. The plundering of Iraq's archaeological sites in the present war -- preventable because it was long predicted -- is in calamitous progress. 
 And, frankly, we have read so much about looting and high-level squabbles over who owns what that we're getting tired of the whole business. So the Euphronios krater will be in Italy instead of in New York. So one more Iraqi pot disappears or Buddha bites the dust. Do we really care? I probably wouldn't if I didn't relate to the matter personally. 
 As an indoorsy child growing up in Boston, I clocked up a lot of museum time early. By age 11 or so I had a list of favorite objects in local collections, the ones I thought of as ''mine.'' Heading the list was a small painting in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum of two women and a man gathered around a clavichord in a sun-touched room. The painting was called ''The Concert,'' by Jan Vermeer.
 At the time I knew nothing about Dutch art. For me, it had very particular, localized resonance. Its silver-blue tones around a central patch of rich rust-red were the colors of a New England autumn, foliage in mist. Its immaculate interior was an image of home perfected, beyond change. Someone told me that Vermeer paintings were rare. That my city had one was a wonderful thing. The Gardner treated it as special, too, placing it on a small table near a window, so you could contemplate it one on one. 
 Then in the early morning of March 18, 1990, ''The Concert'' was stolen from the museum by two men who cut it from its frame, presumably rolled it up like a scroll and took it away. I was living in New York by then, but I felt bereft and angry. Why on earth did they do that? They could never put the painting on the open market. The best they could do is sell it to someone who would keep it hidden, or destroy it? Sixteen years later, ''The Concert'' is still missing, and I still miss it, because I associate it with my hometown, which means my childhood, with who I was and who I am. 
 I think of the Vermeer, and about the important emotional role certain objects can play in our lives, when I hear talk about art being looted and about demands for the return of cultural property. I observe with interest how people deal with this peculiarly disorienting kind of loss. 
 In Tibet, in what might be called a campaign of aesthetic genocide, China tried to destroy an entire culture by obliterating its religious art. And rumor has it that the Dalai Lama, living in exile in India, welcomes the collecting of Tibetan art in the West as a way to physically reconstitute a culture that no longer has a home of its own. 
 Other people in other cultures take a far less philosophical view of having their ''cultural heritage,'' otherwise known as patrimony, on the international market. Demands for restitution and the prevention of further plunder have grown more insistent. No wonder that questions about who owns art, and what ownership actually means, are looming large in the museum world. 
 Some observers attribute this patrimony consciousness to a resurgent nationalism. Art is, and has always been, a political power supply. It functions competitively, like wealth: I have a lot, and you do not. It speaks the power language of ''authenticity'' and ''quality'': what I have is better (older, bigger, classier, rarer, holier) than what you have. Art can be recruited to shape and advertise culture identity, to create a history, real or artificial. 
 Most recent public debates over cultural property have approached the subject in terms of power politics. And the terms of the arguments, however passionately voiced, tend to be as concrete and unsubtle as corporate spread sheets, and just as intent on yielding profit. 
 Some of the players who sit at the table are archaeologists, people who recover the history of the ancient past through its material remains. On the other side are the dealers, collectors and museums -- the art market -- who buy and sell such art, with or without a documented history. 
 Archaeologists insist that objects should remain where they are found until they can be studied in their original context: what they meant in the past is their most important meaning in the present. The market, on the other hand, wants to get objects moving, circulating, selling, valuating. Archaeologists assert that by turning freshly excavated material into an instant cash crop, the market essentially underwrites looting. The market replies that archaeologists, by insisting that objects remain in what are often unstable parts of the world, expose the artifacts to potential destruction. 
 Last to speak are the ''source'' countries, the places where the objects under dispute are actually found. Often poor and embattled, the countries were long excluded from the discussion. But beginning in the 1960's, with the rise of colonial independent movements worldwide, they began to assert their right to control the fate of the art that they claim as their own. In later years, multiculturalism and identity politics strengthened their case and fortified their resolve. 
 For a brief time, the art establishment seemed to be adjusting itself to the countries' position, which was popularly perceived as holding an ethical high ground. But with the present era of political reaction, that moment has passed. The concept of cultural heritage is being dismissed by many as politically correct manipulation. The new mainstream agenda is geared less to restoring art to its claimants than it is to distributing it in ways that benefit ''everybody.''
 But the claimants are unlikely to fall silent. Some of them understand well the political effectiveness of their claims; many of them know from experience that ''everybody'' has always meant, and will doubtless continue to mean the West. At the same time, the more that Western influence grows, the more certain that threatened cultures will insist on preserving their patrimony for themselves.
 It would seem, in fact, that debate about art and ownership, at least as it is being conducted, has reached a stalemate. International laws to combat cultural theft seem to be stimulating rather than reducing black-market activity. Recent images of archaeological sites in Iraq, pockmarked with looters' trenches, offer sobering evidence of the health of the trade in illicit antiquities. 
 Surely the only thing to do at this point is try to turn karma around, to transform a history of theft into an experiment in sharing -- to replace debate and legislation with cooperation, to replace implacable suspicion with trust, or at least gestures of trust. 
 Any place would be a good place to start. Implicit in the idea of one culture preserving another, ascribed by some to the Dalai Lama, is another idea: that of stewardship as opposed to possession. This assumes that museums and individual collectors alike regard themselves as keepers instead of owners of art, responsible for conserving it in the present, and responsible for letting it go when circumstances are auspicious to do so in the future. 
 Certain art projects, like the Byzantine Fresco Chapel Museum in Houston, supported by the Menil Foundation, already operate on this model. When Byzantine frescoes from a Greek Orthodox church on Cyprus were ripped out, smuggled off the island and then came on the market, the foundation, with the approval of the Church of Cyprus, bought the paintings. The foundation agreed to conserve them and install them, on long-term loan, in a consecrated chapel in Houston. The idea is that the frescoes will one day return to a less politically volatile homeland. 
 Other initiatives have been designed to ensure that art that would ordinarily end up on the market has at least a chance to remain, profitably, within its country of origin. A project called the Culture Bank, founded in Mali by a Peace Corps volunteer, Todd Vincent Crosby, helps create cooperatively-run village museums. Villagers are invited to bring significant family objects to the museums and leave them as collateral against cash loans. The more historical information the owner can provide about an object, the more ''value'' it has. 
 As long as loans are repaid, more loans can be taken out against the object, which remains on view in the museum, accessible to local and foreign visitors. Thus, instead of leaving the village as a one-time sale to a dealer or foreign buyer, historical objects have a continuing economic value, and remain where they were made, a living connection to the past. 
 Even with such art-retaining grass-roots initiatives, Western institutions will never want for new material. They are rich; much of the rest of the world is poor. But perhaps in return for the privilege of continuing to gather acquisitions, Western cultural institutions may consider being more forthcoming about how their collections were formed. 
 A significant example of such self-disclosure was the 2000 exhibition ''ExitCongoMuseum: A Century of Art With/Without Papers,'' organized by Boris Wastiau at the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Tervuren, Belgium. The museum has one of the finest collections of African material in the world, much of it acquired in acts of outright colonialist theft from what was once the Belgian Congo. 
 Mr. Wastiau aired this long-unarticulated history of exploitation through displays of objects, photographs and archival documents from the Tervuren collection. The exhibition roused a chorus of protest from those who took it as a smear on a monument. To them, a venerable institution had been lost to revisionist history. To others, the time was long past when the museum as it had existed should go or be transformed into a cautionary artifact.
 You might think of this as karmic closure. The ideal resolution of karma is enlightenment. Enlightenment has been described as the ending of desire, the acceptance of transience. And art, of course, is transient. Ask the people of Cambodia, Guatemala and Nigeria; ask the archaeologists who are staring at miles of empty holes in Iraq and at the museum with a suddenly empty vitrine. The reality is, no one owns the earth or what comes out of it. The earth owns us, and will have us back in its time. 
 As for enlightenment, I am not there yet, far from it. I think of that little table beside a window in the Gardner Museum, which now has an empty frame and a small card with the printed words: ''The Concert'' by Jan Vermeer, stolen March 18, 1990. And I want the painting back. It's mine.

HEADLINE: Jagr Conjures Memories Of Some Ranger Greats

BYLINE: By Dave Anderson

DATELINE: GREENBURGH, N.Y. 

 BODY:
SOONER or later, almost any conversation about the Rangers these days gets around to Jaromir Jagr, and as Coach Tom Renney leaned against the glass wall of the team's weight room after practice yesterday, he quietly defined Jagr's value.
 ''On the ice,'' he said, ''he's as important a player as this franchise has ever had.'' 
Notice that he didn't say that Jaromir Jagr was the most important player the Rangers have ever had, merely that he was as important. And you can't rebut that, because in addition to his 52 goals and 109 points, Jagr's most endearing contribution has been his waking the echoes of so many names, which were, in each one's time, as important to the Rangers and their long frustrated followers as he is now. 
 Those names drift back through eight decades. Names like Mark Messier, Adam Graves, Jean Ratelle, Rod Gilbert, Vic Hadfield, Andy Bathgate, Chuck Rayner, Buddy O'Connor, Bryan Hextall and Bill Cook.
 Jagr knows Messier, of course. When Jagr was with the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Washington Capitals, he skated against Messier, who this season called Jagr ''the best hockey player in the world.'' Which is what Messier was when he led the Rangers to the Stanley Cup in 1994 after a 54-year famine.
 Jagr also skated against Graves, now in the Rangers' front office as a special assistant for community relations. Jagr's 52 goals has tied Graves's single-season record for the Rangers, who visit the Islanders tonight in their pursuit of a playoff berth after seven shameful seasons. Not that Graves was surprised.
 ''When I had 40,'' Jagr said yesterday, ''Adam told me he thought I would do it. I wasn't that confident. It looks easier when you're outside.''
 Jagr has also tied Ratelle's franchise record of 109 points, set during the 1971-72 season. Ratelle was the smooth center for Gilbert and Hadfield, who had 50 goals that year. Ratelle had 46 goals and 63 assists in only 63 games before a broken ankle sidelined him.
 ''I know Rod, too,'' Jagr said, referring to Gilbert, now the Rangers' director of community relations, ''but I never met Ratelle or Hadfield.''
 Jagr is surely a candidate for the Hart Trophy as the N.H.L.'s most valuable player. If he wins the Hart, he will be only the fifth Rangers recipient, the first since Messier in 1991-92, his first season as a Ranger. The other M.V.P.'s were Andy Bathgate, Chuck Rayner and Buddy O'Connor.
 Bathgate, a classy right wing, was the 1958-59 M.V.P. He also shared the point-scoring title with Bobby Hull and led the league in assists in 1961-62, when Doug Harvey was the Rangers' coach and the Norris Trophy winner as the league's top defenseman.
 Rayner was the goaltender when the Rangers went to the 1950 Stanley Cup finals before losing Game 7 to the Detroit Red Wings in double overtime. O'Connor was a center who finished second in the league in points in the 1947-48 season. 
 If Jagr were to earn the Art Ross Trophy as the league's top scorer, he would be only the only third Ranger to lead the league in points scored. Bryan Hextall, the right wing who scored the Stanley Cup-winning goal in 1940, did so in 1941-42. In what is now considered the prehistoric era, right wing Bill Cook twice led the N.H.L. in scoring, in 1926-27, the Rangers' first season, and again in 1932-33, when they won their second Cup.
 With eight rookies, these Rangers aren't likely to win the Stanley Cup, but they could win a playoff round or two, especially if they finish first in the Atlantic Division. That would give them home-ice advantage, at least in the opening round.
 ''Home ice, that would be huge,'' Jagr said. ''Especially for our fans after not having been in the playoffs for so long. For us now, it's important to play all our games like they were playoff games, to believe you can beat any team in the league.''
 Of the Rangers' 10 remaining games (including 6 on the road), 6 are against teams below them in the standings -- 3 with the Islanders and one each with the Devils, Boston and Pittsburgh. They play two against a team higher in the standings (Ottawa) and two against the Philadelphia Flyers, whom they are battling for first place in the division.
 ''We have to get back to the efficient, smart, economical, hard-working team that we were before the Olympics,'' Renney said. ''We have to bring urgency to our game because of what we're in pursuit of.''
 After those seven empty seasons without playoffs (eight, if you count the season-long lockout in 2004-5), Jaromir Jagr has put the Rangers back on the hockey map and resurrected some glorious Rangers names, names that many of their long-frustrated followers, and Jagr himself, may not have even known.
 ''What he's done for the franchise, the city, the fans,'' Renney said. ''His tentacles reach really far.''

HEADLINE: Possible Opening for Unions In German Software Company

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, March 28 

 BODY:
With its stock options, Silicon Valley-like image and reputation as Germany's answer to Microsoft, SAP would seem a rather fruitless place to organize a labor movement.
 But this Thursday, 9,000 SAP employees in Germany will take what could be the first step toward bringing unions into this 34-year-old company, Europe's most successful software developer. They are to vote for a committee that will later hold an election for a works council, a legal entity that represents workers.
SAP does not welcome this change, viewing it as unnecessary in a company with healthy management-employee relations and an entrepreneurial culture. Neither do most of the employees: in a vote this month, 91 percent rejected a proposal to set up a council. 
 ''I thought, in a democracy, when you have a vote of 91 percent to 9 percent, the 9 percent would accept that,'' the chief executive of SAP, Henning Kagermann, said Tuesday in an interview.
 In this case, however, three employees who supported a works council filed a petition with a German labor court. Because Germany guarantees workers the right to organize, even if most oppose it, SAP concluded that it could not block the creation of such a council. It accepted an offer by another group of employees to conduct an election for its members.
 ''You have to respect that there is a law,'' Mr. Kagermann said.
 The success of the campaign demonstrates the enduring power of organized labor in Germany, even at a time when membership in unions is declining and when unions have lost much of their muscle in extracting wage increases from old-line industrial companies like Volkswagen.
 SAP was named Germany's best employer last year, in the category of companies with 5,000 or more employees, by Capital, an economics magazine here. It is the world's largest maker of business software, with a 62 percent market share, compared with 16 percent for Oracle, its nearest competitor.
 But these are not reasons to oppose a works council, according to IG Metall, the union that has backed the campaign and represents workers in the computer industry. 
 ''People say, 'Why do we need a works council? Things are going well. Leave us in peace,' '' said Bernd Knauber, a union secretary at IG Metall in Heidelberg, north of SAP's headquarters in Walldorf. ''But when the problems erupt, then it's too late to start a works council.''
 The German operations of I.B.M. and other American technology companies have works councils, he noted. Members of IG Metall marched in front of I.B.M.'s offices in Stuttgart last year to protest job cuts.
 A works council does not have to have union involvement. In practice, however, unions often come to play an influential role because they have experience and expertise in promoting workers' interests.
 ''Works councils have had an enormous impact in unionizing the shop floor,'' said Michael Fichter, an expert in labor relations at the Free University of Berlin. ''This is a very sensitive issue for a company like SAP, where you don't have production line employees.''
 Mr. Fichter, however, said he doubted IG Metall would make inroads with SAP employees. They would probably not earn higher wages if the union negotiated for them, he said. And SAP solicits the employees' views in other ways. 
 Like all major German companies, SAP follows the principle of co-determination, which stipulates that workers and shareholders have an equal voice in the oversight of the company. Employees hold 8 of the 16 seats on SAP's supervisory board.
 SAP is studying whether to change its legal standing from a German company to a European company -- a move some German newspapers have suggested is connected to the labor issue, since it could open the way for SAP to move outside the country. Mr. Kagermann denied any link, and said leaving Germany would make little sense for SAP.
 Now that a works council is inevitable, Mr. Kagermann expressed little concern about its effect on relations between management and employees. He predicted that the union would have trouble making headway in the council.
 ''It's always possible that one or two of the members will come from the union,'' he said. ''The question is, Will it be a majority or a minority? I don't see, in SAP's case, that it will be a majority.''
 The three SAP employees have not spoken publicly about their campaign, and Mr. Kagermann said he had forgotten their names. ''What is very encouraging,'' he said, ''is that 91 percent of people, in principle, said they don't need this.''

HEADLINE: Bank Shares Lead Decline as Fed Raises Interest Rates

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for a 15th time and signaled that further increases are ahead.
 Bank of America led a retreat in bank shares, which are among the most sensitive to rate changes, as bond yields climbed. Oil prices jumped to an eight-week high, also hurting the market.
The rate decision, the first since Ben S. Bernanke became Fed chairman, cut short a rally that had preceded the central bank's afternoon announcement. The Fed lifted the benchmark lending rate by a quarter- point, to 4.75 percent, and said in a statement that ''further policy firming may be needed.'' 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 95.57 points, or 0.9 percent, to 11,154.54, for its worst performance since Feb. 28. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 8.38 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,293.23, the steepest loss since March 6. The Nasdaq composite index declined 11.12, or 0.5 percent, to 2,304.46. 
 Stocks have stalled near five- year highs since mid-March on concern the economy and earnings will not be strong enough to overcome increases in borrowing costs.
 The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 19/32, to 97 26/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 4.78 percent, from 4.70 percent on Monday. 
 ''People are under the impression that higher rates will draw money out of stocks'' by making bonds more attractive, said Michael Panzner, head of sales trading at Rabo Securities USA in New York.
 Earlier, a measure of consumer confidence added to concern that the economy was strong enough for the Fed to keep raising interest rates. The Conference Board's confidence index rose to 107.2 in March from 102.7 the previous month. Economists had expected a reading of 102.
 Financial shares fell because higher rates curb demand for mortgages and loans. Bank of America slid 76 cents, to $46.06. J. P.Morgan Chase lost 55 cents, to $41.56. 
 After the Fed's decision, futures traders added to bets that the central bank would increase the benchmark rate to 5 percent at the next meeting on May 10. Interest rate futures now show a 90 percent chance of a quarter-point increase in May, up from 76 percent on Monday.
 Crude oil for May delivery jumped 3 percent, to $66.07 a barrel in New York, the highest close since Feb. 1. Energy stocks advanced with the surge in oil. ConocoPhillips rose 65 cents, to $63.75. Schlumberger, the oil field services company, jumped $1.63, to $124.58. Eli Lilly dropped $2.29, to $56.38, after analysts cut their outlook for the stock on concern about slow sales of its Cymbalta depression drug. 
 Monsanto, a producer of genetically modified crops climbed $2.89, to $83.45 after P. J. Juvekar, an analyst at Citigroup Investment Research, said the company might get an earnings lift from ethanol.
 Level 3 Communications, an operator of long-distance phone and data networks, rallied 71 cents, to $5.18. The company said it expected to exceed some of the first-quarter and full-year forecasts it gave last month.
 Almost two stocks fell for every one that rose on the New York Stock Exchange. Some 1.56 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board, 6.2 percent below the three-month average.
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of four-week Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: U.S. Arrests 7 on Charges of Credit Data Trading

BYLINE: By TOM ZELLER Jr.

 BODY:
The Secret Service yesterday announced seven arrests in five states and the District of Columbia as part of a continuing crackdown on online forums where credit card data and other stolen consumer information is routinely traded. 
 A total of 21 people have been arrested in the United States and Britain in the last three months in the undercover operation, the agency said.
It is the largest federal law enforcement action taken against the thriving online trade in credit card numbers, bank accounts, passwords, personal identification numbers and other data since an earlier effort, Operation Firewall, broke up the largest black market trading board, Shadowcrew.com, in 2004. 
 Jonathan Cherry, a spokesman for the Secret Service, said the new crackdown, called Operation Rolling Stone, was aimed at ''online criminal enterprises that threaten our financial infrastructure.'' 
 The arrests yesterday were made in Florida, New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania, California and Washington on a variety of state and federal charges related to online identity theft, credit card and access device fraud, Mr. Cherry said. 
 No names were released. 
 Some of the people arrested, however, have been linked to the compromise of hundreds of thousands of debit card numbers and personal identification numbers. 
 The precise source of the security breaches has not been determined, and may have involved hacking incidents at several retailers. 
 Several financial organizations, including Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Washington Mutual have been forced to reissue cards. 
 The rate of online credit card fraud has remained fairly stable over the last several years, but the dollar amount lost to fraudulent charges has climbed as commerce expands onto the Web.
 A survey of 400 online retailers in the United States and Canada conducted by CyberSource, a provider of electronic payment and verification services, estimated that nearly $3 billion in online revenue was lost to fraud last year, up from $1.5 billion in 2000. 
 In almost all cases of large-scale theft of consumer credit card data, bank account information or other records, the information passes through one of many online trading boards. 
 There, thieves hawk their goods and other members of the criminal underground offer services related to an entire economy geared toward stealing consumer information and turning it into cash. 
 Federal law enforcers have proven adept at using the anonymity of forums like forum.theftservices.com and scandinaviancarding.com to interact with their membership and build dossiers on new targets.
 Another heavily trafficked site, carders.ws, abruptly became inactive yesterday.
 The overall effect of operations like Firewall and Rolling Stone is hard to know, particularly given that the biggest players in the black market for consumer data are in places much harder to reach, like Russia, Ukraine and increasingly, the Middle East, according to Gregory Crabb, an investigator with the international affairs group of the United States Postal Inspection Service and the acting director of its economic crimes division. 
 And while some may be arrested in the United States, the billion-dollar fraud industry keeps thriving, Mr. Crabb said, adding, ''You're really only taking an ice pick to a glacier.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Said Ready to Tighten Its Mileage Rules for Trucks

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28 

 BODY:
The Transportation Department will announce a fuel economy standard for sport utility vehicles, vans and pickups on Wednesday that for the first time will cover vehicles above 8,500 pounds, and will differ in how it categorizes vehicles, according to people briefed on the rule. 
 Last year the Transportation Department published a draft rule that would have divided the category now called ''light trucks'' into six categories, based on vehicle size, and set mileage standards within each size, to encourage manufacturers to make vehicles that get as many miles a gallon as possible.
But policy makers decided in the last few weeks that this would merely encourage manufacturers to ''game the system,'' as one government official involved in creating the rule put it, by making an S.U.V. slightly bigger so that it could move up a category and meet a lower fuel economy standard. Auto makers already move some vehicles into the light-truck category from the car category, to allow lower fuel economy. 
 The government official, who asked not to be identified because the announcement had not been made, said the rule would be structured without categories, which would force manufacturers to make every vehicle in the light-truck sector more efficient. This approach will also put pressure on companies that build small S.U.V.'s and trucks, which now have no difficulty meeting standards based on an average for their fleet, to make all of their vehicles get higher mileage. 
 Experts said that the average number of miles a gallon that light trucks would achieve under the new standard, which will cover the years 2008 through 2011, would be difficult to predict, and would depend on the mix of vehicles sold. 
 The standard for light trucks was frozen at 20.7 miles a gallon from model year 1996 until model year 2004. For 2005, it was 21.0 miles a gallon, then 21.6 miles a gallon for the current model year. Next year it will be 22.2 miles a gallon. 
 The current standard for passenger cars is 27.5 miles a gallon.
 The transportation secretary, Norman Y. Mineta, is scheduled to make the announcement in Baltimore on Wednesday morning.

HEADLINE: Text of Fed Statement on Rates

 BODY:
Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to raise its benchmark interest rates a quarter-point:

 
 The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 43/4 percent.
The slowing of the growth of real gross domestic product in the fourth quarter of 2005 seems largely to have reflected temporary or special factors. Economic growth has rebounded strongly in the current quarter but appears likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace. 
 As yet, the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities appears to have had only a modest effect on core inflation, ongoing productivity gains have helped to hold the growth of unit labor costs in check, and inflation expectations remain contained. Still, possible increases in resource utilization, in combination with the elevated prices of energy and other commodities, have the potential to add to inflation pressures. The committee judges that some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance. In any event, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives.
 Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Susan S. Bies; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Jeffrey M. Lacker; Mark W. Olson; Sandra Pianalto; Kevin M. Warsh and Janet L. Yellen.
 In a related action, the board of governors approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate to 53/4 percent. In taking this action, the board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco.

HEADLINE: Arrest Is Made in Killing Of Veteran Harlem Minister 

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

 BODY:
A Brooklyn man was arrested last night and charged with stabbing to death a minister credited with helping to bring a blighted block of Harlem back to life.
 The man, David Jordan, 44, was charged with second-degree murder in the death of the pastor, the Rev. Philip Melvin Mann, 68. The police said the men knew each other, but provided no further details.
Last night, as he was being escorted out of the 23rd Precinct station house, Mr. Jordan said Mr. Mann had made sexual advances toward him. ''He tried to molest me,'' Mr. Jordan told television reporters. 
 Earlier, those who knew Mr. Mann recalled a pastor who lived what he preached and was determined to improve the lives of those around him. 
 When he was considering starting his church on a forlorn Harlem block in the 1970's, Mr. Mann told people that he could hardly have found a more apt place for a ministry.
 The brownstones were crumbling, older women feared leaving their homes because of rampant crime, and unemployment was high. So Mr. Mann took one of the block's abandoned buildings and turned it into a church.
 But he did not stop there. He opened a community center, started an employment center and distributed free lunches in the summer. He even set up a program that taught bearing and poise to help instill self-esteem in the neighborhood's young people. Perhaps most important, the pastor provided energy and stability to a section of West 129th Street, between Lenox Avenue and Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard, that had little going for it.
 On Monday night, 29 years after he arrived in Harlem, Mr. Mann was found dead in his apartment on Fifth Avenue near 110th Street, not far from his beloved church. He had been stabbed seven times. 
 Mr. Jordan has confessed to the killing, the police said. He is scheduled to be arraigned today. 
 Among the ''untouchables,'' as some in the neighborhood referred to them, Mr. Mann had built a reputation as someone to go to when everyone else had turned them away. They included ex-convicts, drug addicts, gang members and people with AIDS.
 ''He used to counsel a lot of folks who might not find their way to a program, people who I and others might not want to deal with because they were from the street,'' said the former City Councilman Bill Perkins. ''They were people who had been abandoned.''
 The police initially theorized that Mr. Mann's killer was someone he was trying to help. That Mr. Mann might have been killed because of his generosity was almost too much to bear for some friends and admirers. 
 Richard Moore, 34, who lives next door to Mr. Mann's Blessed Trinity Baptist Church, said yesterday: ''He was a very extraordinary person. If you was poor he would talk to you, if you was rich, he'd talk to you. If you had a dark day, he'd give you light. If you was hungry, he'd give you food.''
 On Sunday, hours before its pastor was killed, the church celebrated its 27th year. People realized that something was amiss when Mr. Mann failed to show up for a lunch appointment on Monday afternoon.
 ''He was a stickler for things like that,'' said Hazel Smith Mann, 65. Married since 1964, they were legally separated at the time of his death but remained close. ''Everything was in decent order -- that's how he lived. He would have called to say he was late or something.''
 Mr. Mann, who was born in Richmond, Va., grew up on Long Island and attended Pace University and Union Theological Seminary. He came to Harlem in the 1970's not knowing what to expect, but determined to get people to care about themselves. His fiery sermons typically focused on self-empowerment and tolerance -- including showing compassion for people with AIDS, a disease that in the 1980's was devastating the neighborhood but was rarely discussed during church.
 ''He was determined to do it in Harlem,'' said Ms. Mann. ''He wouldn't go anywhere else.''
 Even those who had no interest in church found Mr. Mann hard to resist. There was his regal posture; his natty style of dress, whether an African caftan or a Western suit; his love of black history; and his charm. ''He would talk to me every time he saw me,'' said Mr. Moore. ''I like to skate on the street, and he used to joke with me about it.''
 Over the years, as the church and its sister organization, the Helping Hand Community Center, grew into what seemed to be every corner of the three-story brownstone on 129th Street, the neighborhood that Mr. Mann had nursed along changed, too. 
 Today, the block houses several churches and community service organizations instead of abandoned buildings. The brownstones are in good shape. And on the corner of 129th Street and Lenox Avenue, developers are building a high-rise condominium that a sign boasts will be ''the crown jewel of Harlem.''
 Those who knew Mr. Mann think the sign should hang a few doors down. ''He always gave me work when I needed it,'' said Spence Trower, who was outside the church yesterday. ''I was in jail a couple of times, and he wrote me. Any time I needed something, he looked out for me. We lost a real good man.''

HEADLINE: Weld Says He Backs Ending Taxes on Incomes Under $75,000

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 28 

 BODY:
William F. Weld, a Republican candidate for governor of New York, told a business group here on Tuesday that he favored eliminating the state income tax for people making less than $75,000 a year.
 But Mr. Weld, the former governor of Massachusetts, was vague about how he would pay for the proposed tax cut, which by his own estimate would cost the state $6.9 billion a year in lost revenue.
''As one who thinks there's no such thing as government money, there's only taxpayers' money, I don't generally start out when analyzing a tax cut saying, 'How am I possibly going to pay for this?' '' he told reporters. ''That's looking at it from the point of view of the government, as though the government ineluctably owns that money.'' 
 He continued: ''The government doesn't own that money, the taxpayers own that money until the government takes it away from them through taxes. And if the government wanted to stimulate the creation of decent paying jobs that could help us hold our 20- to 34-year-olds upstate, I think exempting the first $75,000 of income from the New York State income tax would be a real good first step.'' 
 Mr. Weld first suggested that the state could nearly pay for the tax cut by cutting Medicaid, the federal and state health program for the poor, which costs more in New York State than anywhere else. He said that if New York's program was merely twice as expensive as the national average, the state would save $5.3 billion.
 That prompted a rival for the Republican nomination, John Faso, a former assemblyman, to question Mr. Weld's math.
 ''The numbers don't add up,'' Mr. Faso said, observing that Medicaid is paid for by the state, the federal government and localities -- so a $5.3 billion reduction in the overall program would save the state only about $2.65 billion. ''I'm all for tax cutting, but that kind of appears to be making a proposal on the fly.''
 Andrea Tantaros, a spokeswoman for Mr. Weld, said later that the tax cut could be paid for by several of Mr. Weld's previous proposals, including his call to limit state spending to the previous year's revenues, his proposal to enroll future state workers in defined-contribution pension plans instead of defined-benefit plans and his call to cut down on Medicaid waste, fraud and abuse.
 Mr. Faso, who shared the stage with Mr. Weld, told the business owners that he wanted to cap local property taxes, cut the estate tax and eliminate the corporate franchise tax on manufacturers. For the most part, Mr. Faso and Mr. Weld complemented each other at the forum, peppering their statements with ''I agree'' and ''As was said earlier'' and joining forces against Eliot Spitzer, who is seeking the Democratic nomination. 
 Questioner after questioner expressed anguish at the dire state of the economy upstate. One asked how the men could hope to push their proposals through the Legislature. 
 Mr. Weld said that he had been successful in Massachusetts, even with a Democratic legislature, at breaking gridlock. He offered this formula: ''You have to, you know, make submissive gestures, tug the forelock, not care who gets the credit, be relatively low ego, not care about power.''

HEADLINE: U.S. and Europeans Consider Sanctions Against 40 Belarus Aides

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 28 

 BODY:
The European Union and the United States are considering personal sanctions against more than 40 officials and state journalists in Belarus for their roles in election rigging and crackdowns on civil society there, according to Western diplomats and government officials.
 A list of officials under consideration includes not only President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko and his top staff but also government ministers and security officials, as well as prosecutors and judges involved in trying antigovernment demonstrators and sentencing them to jail. 
The European Union and the United States announced an intention to pursue punitive sanctions immediately after Mr. Lukashenko's landslide re-election victory on March 19, which the West and the opposition have denounced as a sham.
 The draft list of officials, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, reflects the work of diplomats in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, in the days since the election, and after crackdowns against peaceful protesters on March 24 and 25. It includes 43 officials or state journalists by name, and four regional election officials by position.
 ''We have drawn up a list, as the European Union heads of mission, and sent it to Brussels,'' a Western ambassador in Minsk said by telephone on Tuesday, referring to the union's offices in Belgium. 
 The exact form European sanctions might take has not been determined and requires agreement by the entire union, but is likely to include bans on the officials' travel to the 25 European Union countries, the ambassador said. Other steps might be taken as well, including freezing of assets.
 The ambassador spoke anonymously because deliberations about which officials should face sanctions are confidential. He declined to discuss any officials by name.
 The list is expected to be reviewed, and perhaps adopted, when the foreign ministers from the union meet in Luxembourg on April 10.
 American and European officials said that although some names would probably be removed and others added, the speed of the list's creation and the collaboration between Washington and European governments reflected a resolve to apply pressure to Mr. Lukashenko's circle.
 The United States has already banned travel for several officials, and plans to add more. ''We are thinking through the right people to target, and are doing this in very close contact with the European Union,'' David J. Kramer, deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, said by telephone. He added that the list might grow. 
 In contrast to the European Union, the United States is forbidden to disclose the names of people under sanctions. But Washington has already brought sanctions against several officials in Minsk, and is steadily adding more, Mr. Kramer said.
 Before the election, he said, the number of officials was ''fewer than a dozen, and it's going to go up significantly. It's going up pretty much on a daily basis.''
 Mr. Lukashenko, whose inauguration had been scheduled for Friday but was postponed without explanation on Tuesday, is often referred to as Europe's last remaining dictator. The United States and Europe have financed part of the opposition that has begun to challenge him. 
 He runs Belarus, a nation of 10 million people along Russia's northwest border, like a Soviet holdout, where the preponderance of the economy is under state control. He is widely accused of vote rigging, corruption and Soviet-style repression.
 He has been largely out of the public eye since March 20, when, anticipating the fresh round of Western sanctions, he said he was undeterred by Western threats. His spokesman, Pavel N. Lyogky, echoed Mr. Lukashenko on Tuesday.
 Any new sanctions, Mr. Lyogky said in a telephone interview, ''are simply funny. They first of all are groundless, and secondly, they will not bring about any expected effect.''
 In spite of the consensus in the West to apply pressure against the Belarussian authorities, one potential point of contention is what action, if any, to take against prominent government journalists in Belarus.
 Washington has been more willing to try punishing the journalists, whom it regards as K.G.B. officers, Western officials said, while European nations are concerned that limits against Belarussian journalists could lead to fresh restrictions against Western news gathering in Belarus.
 The names of 14 journalists are on the draft list, labeled as ''key figures in the propaganda, distortion of facts and attacks on the democracies and their representatives in Belarus.''
 The list also includes Aleksandr M. Radkov, the education minister, for ''expulsions of students and restrictions on their travel,'' and Stepan N. Sukhorenko, the chairman of Belarus's K.G.B.

HEADLINE: Split Over Immigration Reflects Nation's Struggle

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28 

 BODY:
It is almost as if they are looking at two different Americas. 
 The Senate Republicans who voted on Monday to legalize the nation's illegal immigrants look at the waves of immigration reshaping this country and see a powerful work force, millions of potential voters and future Americans.
 The House Republicans who backed tough border security legislation in December look at the same group of people and see a flood of invaders and lawbreakers who threaten national security and American jobs and culture.
 But both wings of the deeply divided Republican Party are responding to the same phenomenon: the demographic shift driven by immigration in recent decades, a wave that is quietly transforming small towns and cities across the country and underscoring pressures on many parts of the economy.
 The United States has always been a nation of immigrants, but today the country has more than 33 million foreign-born residents, the largest number since the Census started keeping such statistics in 1850. In 2003, foreign-born residents made up 11.7 percent of the population, the highest percentage since 1910. And over the past 16 years, the newcomers, many of them illegal, have poured into places in the South and Midwest that have not seen sizeable numbers of new immigrants in generations. 
 The question of how to cope with the 11 million illegal immigrants believed to be living here -- whether to integrate them, ignore them or try to send them home somehow -- is a question gripping many ordinary citizens, religious leaders, state legislators and policy makers in the White House. And in their bitter, fractious debate, Republicans in Congress are reflecting what some describe as the nation's struggle to define itself and, to some degree, politically align itself, during a period of social change.
 The Senate Republicans on the Judiciary Committee who emerged victorious on Monday with help from Democrats argue that those illegal immigrants who work, pay taxes and learn English should be fully incorporated into American society as citizens. The House Republicans who passed a far different bill in December are pushing to criminalize their presence in the United States. (The full Senate is expected to vote on immigration legislation next week. Any bill that passes the Senate will have to be reconciled with the House legislation.)
 As the party struggles to reconcile these competing visions, frustrations over the stalemate are spilling onto the airwaves and into the streets as some conservatives on talk radio call for a wall to be built along the Mexican border and tens of thousands immigrants and their supporters march in favor of citizenship. 
 ''Right now, we're seeing to some extent the political response to the demography,'' said Roberto Suro, executive director of the Pew Hispanic Center, a nonpartisan research group in Washington. ''And even though the legislative proposals are seemingly technical and narrow, they touch these nerves about how we think of ourselves as a people.''
 ''You end up, after a point, trying to balance our fundamental traditions, the need for order, law and security with a need for openness,'' he said. ''Immigration policy, writ large, has always been partly a matter of national identity. It becomes a values-laden debate. Congress has a hard time with it.'' 
 That difficulty reflects, in part, the swiftness and the enormousness of the demographic shift.
 In 1970, there were 9.6 million foreign-born residents in the country, census data show. By 1980, that figure had surged to 14.1 million. Between 1990 and 2000, the number of foreign-born residents jumped to 31.1 million from 19.8 million.
 Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas, who voted for the legalization of illegal immigrants on Monday, says he has seen and felt the shift in his own state. 
 ''Huge increase,'' he said of the number of new immigrants. ''It's a big issue, and it's one where communities that have adapted to it are more accepting and others are more questioning about the scale of what's taking place.'' 
 But when he wrestled with the issue, Mr. Brownback decided that he could not join the ranks of those who wanted simply to push out illegal immigrants. ''This is also about the hallmark of a compassionate society, what you do with the widows, the orphans and the foreigners among you,'' he said.
 Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, echoed those thoughts in his defense of the legalization program, which would ultimately grant immigrants citizenship.
 ''Where is home?'' Mr. Graham asked his colleagues Monday. ''Their home is where they've raised their children. Their home is where they've lived their married lives.''
 ''Whatever we do,'' he added, ''we have to recognize that for several generations people have made America their home.''
 But to Representative Tom Tancredo, the Colorado Republican who helped spearhead the border security bill in the House, illegal immigrants are far from welcome or essential to this country. 
 He was not moved when he saw the tens of thousands of immigrants, some illegal, and their supporters rallying against his bill. He said he was outraged that people he viewed as lawbreakers felt comfortable enough to stand without fear in front of the television cameras.
 ''For years, the government has turned a blind eye to illegal immigrants who break into this country,'' Mr. Tancredo said. ''It isn't any wonder that illegal aliens now act as if they are entitled to the rights and privileges of citizenship.'' 
 Mr. Tancredo's view of the illegal immigrant as an unwanted outsider, an encroacher, is far from uncommon. 
 The National Conference of State Legislatures has reported a surge in recent years in legislation intended to crack down on illegal immigrants. As of Feb. 28, state legislators in 42 states had introduced 368 bills related to immigration or immigrants, and many of those bills were intended to limit or restrict illegal immigrants. 
 But some Republicans are warning now that tough anti-immigrant legislation may fuel a backlash and threaten the party's hard-won gains with Hispanics, whose numbers have surged in recent years.
 Foreign-born Hispanics voted for President Bush in 2004 at a 40 percent greater rate than Hispanics born in the United States. Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform and a strategist close to the White House, warned that Republicans could squander what the party had gained if lawmakers did not embrace a more welcoming vision of America.
 ''There is a danger that if the face of the Republican Party is Tancredo that we could be weaker with Hispanics for generations,'' Mr. Norquist said. ''If the face of the Republican Party is George Bush or Ronald Reagan, we win. This is up for grabs.''

HEADLINE: Extension of Voting Act Is Likely Despite Criticism

BYLINE: By RICK LYMAN

DATELINE: ATLANTA, March 27 

 BODY:
Representative Lynn Westmoreland, a former builder who represents a jigsaw of predominantly white areas just south and west of Atlanta, acknowledges that the 1965 Voting Rights Act, a cornerstone achievement of the civil rights movement, was necessary in its day to register blacks and overturn decades of laws preventing them from voting.
 But times have changed, Mr. Westmoreland said. 
''It was set up to be temporary, just to get things to where they should be,'' he said. ''And if you look at the results we have here in Georgia, I think you can see that it's worked. Its time has passed.''
 Mr. Westmoreland is one of many conservative Republicans who have serious problems with the law. Yet, even though his party controls the White House and Congress, the law seems in little danger of expiring. A multiyear campaign by civil rights leaders to reauthorize the act, parts of which expire in August 2007, appears to be on the verge of success. 
 Liberal supporters and conservative opponents say they expect it to be reauthorized and, probably, even strengthened in coming weeks, well ahead of the deadline.
 ''The Republicans know that if they question the wisdom of reauthorization the Democrats will relentlessly demagogue them on the issue,'' said Roger Clegg, president of the Center for Equal Opportunity, which opposes reauthorization. ''They'll be called racist and accused of wanting to turn back the clock on civil rights. The Republicans would really like to have this off the table.''
 The Voting Rights Act, a follow-up to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, was intended to break down barriers that had kept blacks from registering to vote, mostly in the Deep South. It prohibits officials from disenfranchising blacks through gerrymandering or vote rigging. 
 Partly by outlawing poll taxes, literacy tests and other laws intended to keep minorities off the rolls, the act had an immediate effect on the numbers of blacks registered in the South. A Census report in 1982, the last time the law was reauthorized, found that the number of registered blacks in Mississippi had grown to 175,000 in 1966 from 22,000 in 1960. Similar increases occurred in Alabama, South Carolina and other Southern states.
 More gradually, but as a direct result, the larger numbers of black voters produced a steady increase in elected minority candidates in the South and nationally. 
 Before the act, civil rights organizations estimate, there were fewer than 300 black elected officials in the United States, with virtually none in the South, said Daniel Levitas, who works with the Voting Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union in Georgia. The Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies in Washington found 1,469 black elected officials by 1970 and more than 9,500 today.
 Representative John Lewis, a former Freedom Rider who was beaten in the march in Selma, Ala., that helped lead to the act, said the people who felt that the law had outlived its usefulness failed to understand what it had done and what it needed to do. Mr. Lewis's district, the Fifth Congressional, encompassing much of urban Atlanta, would look quite different had there been no act, he said, and he is certain that someone besides himself would have represented it for the last 20 years. 
 ''Hundreds of thousands of people across America would still have been denied the right to vote,'' Mr. Lewis, a liberal Democrat, said. ''So it's become almost like apple pie, really. This act has become like America.''
 President Bush has said he supports reauthorization, without specifying what changes in the law he might entertain. 
 The Republican Congressional leadership has shown little interest in battling to overturn it, despite many conservatives' concerns that the act has led to unconstitutional redistricting based on race. A bipartisan bill to renew the law is expected to arrive at the House Judiciary Committee in the next week or two.
 The bill is also likely to include language intended to address Supreme Court decisions that many supporters say have weakened the act.
 In a case involving a school board in Bossier Parish, La., the Supreme Court ruled in 1999 that even though officials had openly described their plan to change voting districts as intended to keep blacks off the board, the Voting Rights Act was not violated because the outcome did not make matters worse for blacks. 
 ''There were zero black school board members before and zero afterward, so it hadn't been made worse,'' Laughlin McDonald, director of the Voting Rights Project, said. ''That was clearly not Congress's intention when the act was passed in 1965, and I expect we will see language in this bill that makes this clear and overturns the Bossier decision.''
 If the bill, as anticipated, emerges unscathed from the committee, it is expected to hit the House floor in the spring or early summer, where it will face opposition from some members like Mr. Westmoreland, who intend to submit amendments that the act's supporters say would weaken it or render it unconstitutional.
 Many provisions are permanent. But some, including some of the most contentious, are temporary and have required subsequent Congressional votes to remain.
 Congress reauthorized the act for five more years in 1970 and for seven years in 1975. In 1982, with President Ronald Reagan's support, it was reauthorized for 25 years.
 Of the sections that require reauthorization, the two that have drawn the most attention are Section 5, which requires some jurisdictions to apply to the Justice Department before changing voting laws, and Section 203, which requires jurisdictions with high numbers of foreign-speaking voters to provide multilingual help at polls.
 The ''preclearance'' in Section 5 has drawn the most complaints, especially from Southerners who feel that their region has made substantial progress since 1965 and no longer needs to be singled out. 
 Advocates of the act point out that although most of the covered jurisdictions are in the South, others are not, including New York City.
 Mr. Westmoreland said he intended to propose an amendment to the reauthorization bill that would make preclearance nationwide. Rather than singling out places, like Georgia, it would require every jurisdiction to apply to the federal government to change its voting laws.
 He said he was also likely to introduce an amendment that would make it easier for jurisdictions to leave the preclearance list, another move opposed by advocates of the act. Other congressmen are expected to offer amendments to dilute the foreign-language requirements of Section 203.
 But at the moment it appears unlikely that any of his proposals will attract the necessary support, Mr. Westmoreland said, adding, ''I'm afraid what's going to happen is this is going to be one of those middle-of-the-night deals where you're voting on it before you know it.''

HEADLINE: Need for Patent Protection

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Patently Ridiculous'' (editorial, March 22):
 While raising valid criticisms, you overstate the case against the patent system. In a ''flatter'' world, where America is valued more for its intellectual and technological capabilities than for its brute manufacturing capabilities, the need for patent protection is more acute than ever. 
 The increase in patents in some fields makes it more difficult to create products that do not infringe on the patent rights of others. In addition, we as a society are pressing our intellectual property rights with unprecedented vigor. These two influences have helped expose concerns over the effectiveness of the system.
 Congress needs to address patent law reform to allow more meaningful application review and opposition and to fully finance the Patent and Trademark Office so that it can do its job more effectively. The Supreme Court's reawakened interest in patent law is encouraging. 
 But this is not a system gone awry. Where to draw the line on patentability is a problem that courts and Congress have grappled with for more than 200 years, and there are no easy solutions.
 The current system is in need of refinement, but we should remember that it helped create the economic engine that is the envy of the world.

HEADLINE: Well Exercised and Supple, French Unions Flex Muscles 

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH

DATELINE: PARIS, March 28 

 BODY:
Armed with hot dogs and baguettes, balloons, buttons, banners and, of course, gallons of red wine, France's major trade unions set out Tuesday to change the law, or to bring down a prime minister trying.
 Responding to their rallying cry, more than a million people showed up in the streets, marching in the familiar protest parades that the unions sponsor from time to time. In Paris, the slow-moving street fair stretched for miles.
''The unions haven't been this united in 20 years,'' said Jean-Claude Mailly, general secretary of Force Ouvriere, as he prepared for the protests that are meant to force Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin to withdraw a contested law giving employers the right to fire recently hired young workers without cause. 
 Despite one of the lowest rates of unionization -- only about 8 percent of the French work force are members -- the unions have enormous leverage over the government. They play a unique organizational role in France's hierarchical society, rallying the populace accustomed to a confrontational relationship with leaders considered elitist. Spark-plug unions, some people call them.
 Their mobilizations have killed efforts to change France's costly, rigid social welfare system before, and have hastened the end of the careers of politicians who got in the way.
 But the unions, too, have their own troubles, rent by internal political and ideological battles that have cost them membership. The French have also been losing faith in the unions' ability to stop unpopular government programs after they failed to defeat painful pension reforms three years ago. The current protests and strikes present the unions with an opportunity to recover their reputation as the protectors of workers' rights.
 In 1995, the last time France's unions were so united, they forced the withdrawal of a plan to trim pensions and curb health care costs, and were widely credited with causing the conservatives to lose elections two years later that left President Jacques Chirac in an awkward power-sharing arrangement with a Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin.
 French trade unions got their start in the late 1800's, about the same time as in the United States. The country's first syndicate, the Confederation Generale du Travail, was formed in 1895, not long after Samuel Gompers organized the American Federation of Labor. But the arc of the two countries' labor movements diverged after World War II.
 ''American politics veered right while French politics veered left,'' said Gerald Friedman, an economist and author of ''State-Making and Labor Movements: France and the United States, 1876-1914.''
 The French far right was discredited by its Nazi collaboration during the war, and the Communist Party emerged as a powerful force. It was able to put the right to strike into the French Constitution.
 That clause makes all the difference: if workers strike in the United States, they risk losing their jobs, but strikers in France do not fear for their jobs, regardless of whether they are union members.
 From the beginning, French unions have mobilized people to put pressure on the government instead of simply pressing employers. They have found a willing populace, thanks perhaps to the romantic legacy of the French Revolution.
 Because French union organizers do not need the support of a majority of workers at an enterprise to form a union, a small minority of a company's workers can call a strike. When they do, many people take the day off regardless of whether they are union members. All they lose is a day's pay.
 But most important, French unions have continued to play a leading role far beyond wage negotiations, fighting to shape a sort of workers' paradise and amassing entitlements for the broader population along the way. It is primarily because of the strength of the unions that all workers enjoy a minimum of five weeks of vacation, affordable health care and a 35-hour week.
 ''The unions are the origin of the great social conquests, the great entitlements enjoyed by France,'' said Andre Narritsens, a historian for the C.G.T., France's largest union.
 That progress has won the unions a measure of popular support far larger than that enjoyed by American unions. Many people in the United States take a jaundiced view of strikes because union members are relatively better off than many private-sector employees. But French polls consistently show strong public support for striking workers, despite the havoc they may cause.
 And with strong ideological foundations, French unions have not become associated with organized crime, as has happened with some unions in the United States.

HEADLINE: Enron Prosecutors Drop Some Charges and Rest Case

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

DATELINE: HOUSTON, March 28 

 BODY:
After more than eight weeks and 22 witnesses, the government rested its case on Tuesday against two former Enron chief executives, Jeffrey K. Skilling and Kenneth L. Lay, setting the stage for the defense to begin its bid to keep them out of prison.
 When they present their first witness on Monday, the defense lawyers' burden will be a bit lighter, because the judge in the case, Simeon T. Lake III of Federal District Court, approved a government request to dismiss some of the criminal counts against the two men. 
Sean Berkowitz, the director of the Justice Department's Enron Task Force, said prosecutors chose not to present evidence on the dismissed charges ''out of economy.'' Judge Lake said he had been ''wondering where the evidence was'' on some of the charges, ''so now I don't have to ask.''
 The government rested its case early Tuesday after a former Enron employee testified about the apparent contradiction between Mr. Lay's rapid disposal of tens of millions of dollars in Enron stock and his public pronouncements that Enron shares were ''an incredible bargain.'' The situation alarmed the employee, Joanne Cortez, enough that she told the Federal Bureau of Investigation about the trades.
 Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling are accused of conspiring to defraud Enron's investors while enriching themselves. If convicted, they could spend decades in prison.
 The judge closed the case for the rest of the week after Ms. Cortez left the stand, joking to jurors that it was ''spring break.'' Defense lawyers agreed to use the time off to streamline their case, which they said they expected to last about four weeks. A defense lawyer said late Tuesday that Joannie Williamson, a former secretary of Mr. Lay's at Enron, would be their first witness. The much-anticipated testimony of Mr. Skilling and Mr. Lay is expected to take about two weeks. Defense lawyers said Mr. Skilling would take the stand as early as the week of April 10, with Mr. Lay to follow.
 The dismissed charges against Mr. Skilling include two counts of securities fraud involving an analyst call and a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and one count of making false statements to auditors. For Mr. Lay, the judge dismissed one count of securities fraud for a Nov. 12, 2001, analyst conference call. Judge Lake denied a defense motion to dismiss four other counts against Mr. Lay.
 Mr. Skilling is now charged with 28 counts of fraud, conspiracy and insider trading, and Mr. Lay with 6 counts of fraud and conspiracy.
 Outside the courthouse, defense lawyers blasted the government's case, saying prosecutors had no choice but to drop the charges dismissed by the judge. Daniel Petrocelli, Mr. Skilling's lead lawyer, said the government case was ''long on atmospherics and short on actual facts.'' He said Mr. Skilling was ''very anxious to take the stand.''
 Michael Ramsey, Mr. Lay's lead lawyer, said he was surprised that the prosecutors had called Ms. Cortez when the government months ago failed to bring insider-trading charges against Mr. Lay. ''That is unheard of in my experience,'' Mr. Ramsey said. Mr. Lay is scheduled to go on trial on bank fraud charges immediately after the current case.
 Mr. Ramsey and Mr. Petrocelli told reporters that they continued to struggle to persuade potential witnesses, including former managers from Enron and the accounting firm Arthur Andersen, to testify on behalf of Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling. Mr. Petrocelli said fear of prosecution was the main reason most stayed away.
 Mr. Ramsey sought to send a message to potential witnesses. ''If you are going to make up your mind to win a case, now is the time to come forward,'' he said. ''We need you down here at this courthouse to tell the truth about Enron.''
 In her testimony, Ms. Cortez, a former Enron employee who oversaw a line of credit the company had set up for Mr. Lay, said she was shocked to discover in 2001 that Enron's compensation committee had increased Mr. Lay's credit line to $7.5 million, from $4 million. The increase came a week after Enron reported large third-quarter losses in October 2001. By the end of the year, Mr. Lay maxed out the credit line, she said. 
 Mr. Lay repeatedly drew down the credit line and repaid it almost immediately with Enron shares he owned, Ms. Cortez said. ''It made me question whether it was being used as somewhat of a tool to sell shares.''
 Ms. Cortez became so concerned that Mr. Lay's stock sales were not being disclosed that she hired a lawyer, who turned her records over to the F.B.I. ''It's a clear indication of something going on for the C.E.O. to be selling so much stock,'' she said.
 ''I thought it was improper, '' Ms. Cortez said. She conceded on cross-examination, however, that she had not known that Mr. Lay had used the line of credit to repay bank loans.
 During 2001, Mr. Lay made withdrawals totaling $77.5 million and paid back just over $70 million, leaving a balance owed of $7.5 million, Bloomberg News reported.
 While Mr. Lay has not been charged with insider trading, prosecutors have asserted that he enriched himself as the company descended into bankruptcy in late 2001.

PERSON: Ken Kaess

HEADLINE: Ken Kaess, 51, Led Ad Agency 

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
Ken Kaess, who as chief executive helped DDB Worldwide solidify its position as one of the world's leading advertising agencies by attracting major new clients and championing its digital operation even after the dot-com boom had faded, died on Monday at his home in Westport, Conn. He was 51. 
 The cause of death was cancer, the agency said.
Mr. Kaess, the president and chief executive of DDB Worldwide in New York, returned to work in February from medical leave but suffered a setback earlier this month.
 Mr. Kaess worked for DDB and its predecessors for three decades. He also worked for Jordan, McGrath, Case & Taylor, and New World Entertainment, where he helped create the animated television series ''Muppet Babies.''
 After running the Los Angeles and New York offices of DDB, he became worldwide president in 1999 and chief executive in 2001.
 During the five years that Mr. Kaess served as chief executive, DDB gained the accounts of major brands and marketers like Capital One, Diet Pepsi and Midas. After the collapse of the Internet bubble, Mr. Kaess successfully fought to keep open the agency's digital operation, Tribal DDB Worldwide, which was named interactive agency of the year for 2005 by the trade publication Adweek.
 Mr. Kaess ''was the driver behind DDB's success during these last five years,'' said John D. Wren, the president and chief executive of the Omnicom Group in New York, the company that owns DDB.
 Mr. Kaess was also the first executive to serve two consecutive terms as chairman of the industry trade organization, the American Association of Advertising Agencies. He was a founder of an annual weeklong event to celebrate the role the industry plays in New York life. 
 Kenneth Richard Kaess Jr. was born July 30, 1954, in Waterbury, Conn. He grew up in Watertown, Conn., and graduated from Vassar College. Mr. Kaess is survived by his former wife, Heidi, and their children, Christopher and Courtney, all of Westport; his father, Dr. Kenneth R. Kaess Sr., of Redding, Conn.; a sister, Karen Kaess, of Greenwich, Conn.; and a brother, Karl, of Wilton, Conn.

PERSON: Joshua B. Bolten

HEADLINE: Longtime Ally, Now a Top Aide; Joshua Brewster Bolten 

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28 

 BODY:
Joshua B. Bolten, the incoming White House chief of staff, would appear to have the insider credentials and ability to soothe Congress that the White House desperately needs.
 He grew up in establishment Washington, the son of a C.I.A. officer, and graduated from the elite St. Albans School, former Vice President Al Gore's alma mater. As White House budget director, he amused his 500-member staff by renaming his weekend rock band Deficit Attention Disorder for a performance at the Office of Management and Budget. He has nurtured relationships on Capitol Hill, and is personally close to President Bush.
But the question is whether Mr. Bolten is the man to right a listing presidency, and whether his skills, instincts and access to Mr. Bush are enough to overcome public anger over the war in Iraq and the growing questions in Washington about the competence of the West Wing staff. Mr. Bolten, after all, has been with Mr. Bush from his first days as a presidential candidate, and in the last three years has presided over the biggest budget deficits in the history of the United States. 
 ''The last time Josh was in here, I said, 'How can a guy as smart as you are come up with such bad results?' '' said Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee. ''He said, 'You can't pin this one on me.' ''
 Republicans in Congress reacted positively to the appointment but with barely stifled yawns.
 ''It's an indication that they're turning the page, which I think will be received favorably, but I don't think there's going to be any significant change in the way things are done over there,'' said Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, who two weeks ago said that the White House staff lacked passion and urgency.
 Still, Mr. Thune said, ''he probably will do a better job of reaching out to Congress.''
 Supporters of Mr. Bolten insisted he would revitalize a moribund policy operation at a White House that failed in the past year to push a Social Security overhaul through Congress and is now facing strong resistance to Mr. Bush's plan to change immigration laws. They said Mr. Bolten, the influential but publicly invisible White House deputy chief of staff in Mr. Bush's first term, would help formulate and drive legislation in a way that Andrew H. Card Jr., the outgoing chief of staff, did not.
 As deputy chief of staff, Mr. Bolten scheduled the president's almost daily 45 minutes of domestic ''policy time'' in the Oval Office, and determined what issue was discussed, who was invited and in large part how it could be sold on Capitol Hill. In the first term he drove an agenda dominated by the tax cuts that the White House relentlessly pushed through Congress.
 ''Josh would have a calendar up in his office, where he would, in consultation with everybody else, map out when the president would be briefed on an issue, then tie it to events on the Hill and major announcements,'' said Cesar V. Conda, Vice President Dick Cheney's former top economic policy aide who worked closely with Mr. Bolten. ''He was really the maestro of the policy process. I was there a month after Harriet Miers took over, and it wasn't the same.''
 Mr. Conda was referring to Mr. Bolten's replacement, now the White House counsel.
 On Capitol Hill, Mr. Bolten, who worked in the White House Congressional liaison office of Mr. Bush's father, regularly stepped in as this administration's deal closer. 
 ''I worked closely with him on everything from Medicare to the tax cuts,'' said Rob Portman, the United States trade representative and a former Republican congressman from Ohio who was a White House point man on Capitol Hill. ''He was the one who ultimately pulled together the agency and White House folks and said, 'How do we get a result here?' He's not an ideologue.''
 Exactly what Mr. Bolten believes is something of a mystery, although he was considered a pragmatist who liked tax cuts and not a supply-side true believer in nearly six years at Goldman Sachs in the 1990's. He spent most of those years based in London, as the investment banking firm's chief lobbyist at the European Union's headquarters in Brussels, although he also worked for a short time there as the chief of staff to Jon Corzine, then the firm's co-chairman and now the Democratic governor of New Jersey.
 When Mr. Bush named Mr. Bolten his budget director three years ago, Mr. Corzine, who was a United States senator from New Jersey at the time, called Mr. Bolten ''on message and loyal to a fault.''
 Mr. Bolten, who described himself as a ''policy geek'' in an interview with Brian Lamb of C-Span late last year, has whitish-gray, closely cropped hair, round wire-rimmed glasses and the prosperous, buttoned-down look of a Washington corporate lawyer. At 51, he retains a slightly youthful look. At the White House, he is considered relatively mellow and more comfortable with reporters than Mr. Card.
 Unlike other members of Mr. Bush's inner circle, Mr. Bolten makes occasional forays to the dinner parties of establishment Washington. He has turned up at the home of Ben Bradlee, the former executive editor of The Washington Post, and the writer Sally Quinn and has regularly dated women in the Bush administration. He distinguished himself at the 2000 Republican National Convention by appearing with the actress Bo Derek.
 Mr. Bolten is also known for his motorcycle collection, although he most often rides a Harley.
 ''I've ridden motorcycles for a long time; it's not just a midlife crisis adoption,'' Mr. Bolten said on C-Span. ''I've been riding motorcycles for about 25 years. And I enjoy it now I think especially because it's a form of relaxation and diversion that's beautiful and exhilarating. But you have to concentrate. So you need to clear your mind of everything else because if you're not concentrating properly when you're riding a motorcycle, you're putting your life in danger.''
 Joshua Brewster Bolten was born on Aug. 16, 1954. A graduate of Princeton and Stanford Law School, he grew up knowing little about the duties of his father, who worked in the C.I.A.'s directorate of operations, the agency's covert espionage arm. He plays bass guitar in his band, normally called the Compassionates. The lead singer is Tabitha Mueller, Mr. Card's daughter.

HEADLINE: Anchor-Advocate on Immigration Wins Viewers

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER and JACQUES STEINBERG; David D. Kirkpatrick and Carl Hulse contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
The nation's most prominent opponent of current immigration policy began his day yesterday on the ''Today'' show on NBC, debating a Hispanic defender of illegal immigrants. He moved on to ''American Morning'' on CNN to denounce a bill passed by the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday as ''an amnesty program.''
 By nightfall he was on a plane headed to Mexico, where he intended to assess critically the planned discussions on the issue between President Bush and President Vicente Fox of Mexico. 
This central figure in the increasingly fractious debate over future immigration policy was not a senator or congressman, nor even a lobbyist on either side of the issue. It was instead, a television news anchor, Lou Dobbs of CNN.
 In the course of insistently offering his ever more passionate views on immigration all across the television landscape in just one 24-hour period, Mr. Dobbs underscored that what works in cable television news is not an objective analysis of the day's events but hard-nosed, unstinting advocacy of a specific point of view on a sizzling-hot topic.
 While its competitors, the Fox News Channel and to a lesser extent, MSNBC, have consistently built successful programs around aggressively opinionated hosts like Bill O'Reilly and Keith Olbermann, CNN has maintained that its mission remains offering straight news coverage, unseasoned with sharp points of view.
 Except for Lou Dobbs. On CNN only Mr. Dobbs's 6 p.m. nightly news program comes accompanied with the disclaimer that it will contain ''news, debate and opinion.'' That is not a new development for Mr. Dobbs. He has had that freedom at CNN for years and his advocacy approach on the immigration debate has been widely discussed in recent months.
 But in the past several weeks, Mr. Dobbs has ratcheted up his criticism of Bush administration policies, first on the Dubai ports deal and now on immigration, to a point where in the view of many he has become a significant factor in shaping public opinion on these issues.
 ''He has got a lot of listenership, and he is not a nut,'' said Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi. ''He is a very thoughtful guy, and he feels very strongly about this issue.''
 Representative Peter T. King, a New York Republican and a leading opponent of the Dubai port deal, appeared repeatedly on the Dobbs show during that controversy and said he believed lawmakers were watching closely.
 ''He definitely influenced politicians who were watching him and listening to him,'' Mr. King said. ''I think he had an impact.'' 
 Mr. King said that Mr. Dobbs was better able than other network reporters to ''grab the issue, be able to keep it going and stay excited about it every night.'' 
 The management of CNN denied yesterday that Mr. Dobbs's soaring profile on the immigration issue -- and the increased ratings he has garnered along with it -- would steer the network toward adding more opinions on other news programs.
 ''Lou's show is not a harbinger of things to come at CNN,'' said Jonathan Klein, the president of CNN/U.S. ''He is sui generis, one of a kind.''
 But CNN was hardly holding back yesterday on giving Mr. Dobbs opportunities to unleash opinions on the immigration debate, views that seem to have only grown more vociferous in reaction both to last weekend's mass marches in Los Angeles and other cities in support of illegal immigrants and the action Monday by the Senate committee.
 On the CNN morning show he called the Senate bill ''an unconscionable act'' and ''a sellout.'' He appeared again on CNN's midday ''Live From'' program, saying, ''I think illegal immigrants are a burden to the taxpayer, unequivocally.''
 Later, the network's ''Situation Room'' program displayed a clock counting down to the hour when Mr. Dobbs would be arriving in Mexico.
 This followed by just a day a confrontation between Mr. Dobbs and a guest on his own program, Janet Murguia, the president of the Hispanic civil rights group National Council of La Raza, during which he lectured her on immigration policy. 
 ''I want you to look me right in the eye, and I want you to hear me loud and clear,'' Mr. Dobbs said to Ms. Murguia, who replied, ''I'm right here.''
 Yesterday, Ms. Murguia said, ''There's no question he's branded a unique format.'' 
 Mr. Dobbs, who previously had a long-running and successful financial news-based program on CNN, said he had never held back on offering his opinions. 
 ''I've been doing this three decades,'' he said. ''I know whereof I speak on the political economy. I don't come to a conclusion out of thin air because of some partisan or ideological viewpoint, but rather with an analysis of the facts.''
 He said he did not believe that traditional objective journalism brought people closer to the truth. Asked if he himself knew what the truth was, Mr. Dobbs said: ''I have strong feelings that I do. I have strong evidence I do.'' 
 CNN certainly has reason to celebrate Mr. Dobbs's expanding profile on the immigration issue. His program, which was up 24 percent in total viewers over the same period last year, is the only good news story in CNN's evening and prime-time lineup, which was otherwise down across the board in ratings for the past quarter. 
 Notably, for the first quarter of the year, Mr. Olbermann's show on MSNBC beat the 8 p.m. CNN show with Paula Zahn for the first time in the audience that matters most to news programs -- viewers ages 25 to 54. But both still trailed far behind Mr. O'Reilly's dominant show at that hour.
 Even as Mr. Klein conceded that ''there is certainly a correlation between Lou's outspokenness and the ratings he has gotten,'' he reasserted that CNN would not be turning to opinion-based programs beyond the Dobbs newscast. 
 ''Cable has always been, certainly for the past 10 years, a hospitable home to outspoken, over-the-top figures,'' Mr. Klein said. ''It cuts through the clutter.'' But, he added, ''What is suitable for Lou is not necessarily suitable for many other, if any other, talent on the network. It is not a signal for some sea change at CNN.''

HEADLINE: Democrats Opening Assault On Bush Security Policies

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28 

 BODY:
Seeking to capitalize on President Bush's troubles overseas, leading Democrats in Congress are unveiling a broad attack this week on the administration's security policies at home and overseas along with a set of proposals intended to demonstrate that they have a credible alternative.
 In a set of policy papers titled ''Real Security: Protecting America and Restoring Our Leadership in the World,'' Democratic leaders in the House and Senate plan to join with leading figures in the party, including former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Wesley K. Clark, the retired general and former presidential contender, in presenting the plan on Wednesday. 
Their purpose, Democrats say, is to rebut the Republican accusation, echoed in some editorial columns, that with Mr. Bush's approval ratings sagging eight months before the next election, party leaders and candidates have not laid out a coherent set of alternatives, especially on Iraq and on dealing with nuclear proliferation.
 The Democrats' material asserts that in combating terrorism, party leaders want to increase financing for Special Operations forces and interdicting terrorist financing and to spend more on economic development in troubled areas like the Middle East and South Asia.
 Democrats also want to give greater powers to the office of the national intelligence director and to investigate accusations of abuse and torture of detainees. They say they want increased financing for screening containers at ports and securing nuclear and chemical plants and training emergency health workers.
 Most of the proposals are not new. Many echo arguments put forward by Democrats and by their 2004 presidential nominee, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, including a demand for more military equipment and body armor for troops and improved veterans' benefits. 
 In the diplomatic field, the proposals say Democrats will ''redouble efforts to stop nuclear weapons development in Iran and North Korea,'' but they offer few details that differ from the Bush administration's effort to get cooperation from allies in Asia, the Middle East and Europe to pressure those countries to abandon their nuclear programs.
 ''In these times of unprecedented challenge and change, real leadership demands preparing for the threats that exist today and those that will emerge tomorrow,'' said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, who will be appearing with Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate Democratic leader.
 ''It demands tough and smart policies that recognize that a stronger America begins at home,'' Ms. Pelosi added.
 In a statement to be released on Wednesday, Mr. Reid is to say: ''Over the last century, Democrats have led America through two world wars, have stared down threats to our security at home and have defeated the ideals of Communism and Fascism. Today, Democrats are here to build on that record.''
 But Republicans, anticipating the Democratic attack, were already circulating their own counteroffensive on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. Senator Christopher S. Bond, Republican of Missouri, said he had just obtained a copy of the Democrats' plan and added, ''It's taken them all this time to figure out what we've been doing for a long time.''
 Mr. Bond said that while Democrats sought to showcase their support of national security, they had tried to block renewal of the antiterrorism law known as the USA Patriot Act and the administration's program of wiretapping without warrants. 
 Democrats say that while their policies lack detail in some respects, they were able at least to put together a package of proposals to which all members of the party could subscribe, calling for more money to be spent on a broad array of items, including port security and foreign aid.
 Meanwhile, the manifesto skirted divisive issues like whether the United States should set a timetable on the withdrawal of troops from Iraq, as advocated by Representative John P. Murtha, Democrat of Pennsylvania, but opposed or not endorsed by other members of his party. 
 Instead, it calls for making sure that 2006 ''is a year of significant transition to full Iraqi sovereignty, with the Iraqis assuming primary responsibility for securing and governing their country and with the responsible redeployment of U.S. forces.''
 Beyond ''redeployment,'' no mention is made of whether American troops should be taken out of Iraq.
 The Democrats' paper also calls for the United States to achieve ''energy independence'' by 2020 by increasing production of alternative fuels.

PERSON: Caspar W. Weinberger

HEADLINE: Caspar W. Weinberger, Who Served 3 Republican Presidents, Is Dead at 88

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT; Maria Newman contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Caspar W. Weinberger, who held high positions under three Republican presidents and oversaw the biggest and costliest military buildup in peacetime history as Ronald Reagan's secretary of defense, died yesterday in Bangor, Me., after a brief illness. He was 88.
 Mr. Weinberger lived nearby in Mount Desert, Me. His son, Caspar Jr., also of Mount Desert, said his father had been undergoing kidney dialysis for two years and died of pneumonia. His wife of 63 years, Jane, was by his side when he died, his son said.
 Until his death, Mr. Weinberger was chairman of Forbes Inc. He had continued to travel around the world until recently, his son said, and wrote a regular column for Forbes magazine. A book by Mr. Weinberger, ''Home of the Brave: A Tribute to Unsung Heroes in the War on Terror,'' which he wrote with Wynton C. Hall, will be published in June by Forge Press. 
 A self-assured man and a tenacious debater, Mr. Weinberger served in Washington off and on for almost two decades. He was a crucial backer of Mr. Reagan's missile-based Strategic Defense Initiative, popularly known as Star Wars. He was also an implacable foe of the Soviet Union, a posture that put him increasingly at odds with Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who leaned more toward arms-control negotiations with Moscow. 
 By the time Mr. Weinberger left the Pentagon in 1987, Mr. Reagan had been swayed by Mr. Shultz (who had the president's wife, Nancy, in his corner). The president who had once derided the Soviet Union as ''an evil empire'' got along well with the Russian leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who seemed cut from different cloth than his drab but ruthless predecessors. 
 Mr. Weinberger never lost his bone-deep suspicion of the Russians, and his comments after the collapse of the Soviet Union suggested that he still had more faith in arms than diplomacy, at least in dealing with the Kremlin. 
 Many felt that Mr. Weinberger's record was marred late in life by questions about his role in the Iran-contra affair -- questions a presidential pardon left unresolved -- but his resume was impressive by any standard.
 Under President Richard M. Nixon, he was chairman of the Federal Trade Commission; deputy director and later director of the Office of Management and Budget, where he earned the nickname Cap the Knife by smilingly arguing against requests for more money; and secretary of health, education and welfare. 
 He remained as secretary of the health and welfare agency under President Gerald R. Ford until 1975, when he left Washington for his native California. He said his wife could better cope with her arthritis there.
 It was after he returned to the capital as defense secretary for Mr. Reagan in 1981 that Mr. Weinberger made his real mark. His mission, he said early on, was ''to rearm America.'' His view was that previous efforts to get along with the Russians without demanding good behavior in return had reinforced ''the Soviet prison wall,'' which stretched, he said, ''from the Balkans to the Baltic.''
 The rise of the charismatic Mr. Gorbachev in the mid-1980's did not soften those views. ''I don't think just because he wears Gucci shoes and smiles occasionally that the Soviet Union has changed its basic doctrines,'' Mr. Weinberger said in 1987, as he was leaving office.
 So while other parts of the federal government were cringing under the cut-to-the-bone philosophy of the Reagan White House (as the old Cap the Knife might have desired), Mr. Weinberger demanded billions more for nuclear arms, ships, planes and tanks. ''This is not a one-year program for summer soldiers,'' he warned in 1981.
 He was true to his word. Year after year, he fought for big increases in Pentagon spending and usually won.
 Mr. Weinberger also tried to alleviate the historic rivalries among the services. He ordered the branches to find more roles for women. He delegated more planning authority to the chiefs of staff and the service secretaries so that he could devote more time to policy.
 A blemish in his 35 years of public service came in 1992, five years after he left the cabinet. That year, he was indicted on felony charges of perjury and obstruction of justice in connection with the covert sale of arms to Iran and the diversion of some of the proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels, or contras.
 The tangled transactions, which came to be known as the Iran-contra affair, were against the declared policy of the United States. Subsequent investigations depicted Mr. Reagan as determined to win the release of American hostages held in the Middle East and eager to obtain the help of Iranian ''moderates'' to do so.
 Mr. Weinberger told a special committee of Congress in 1987 that he was aghast when he first heard White House aides talk about cultivating Iranian moderates. He testified that he had considered the idea ''almost too absurd to comment on,'' and he said as much in a staff memorandum at the time. He told Congress that he thought, erroneously, that he had killed the proposal.
 A special commission headed by John Tower, a former Republican senator from Texas, criticized Mr. Weinberger as not advising the president vigorously enough. Mr. Weinberger rejected the criticism as unfair.
 The special Iran-contra prosecutor, Lawrence E. Walsh, obtained an indictment accusing Mr. Weinberger of concealing voluminous notes that would have cast more light on the roles of Mr. Reagan and Vice President George Bush in the scandal. The notes were scrawled in his almost illegible handwriting in some 5-by-7-inch notebooks that he had donated to the Library of Congress after leaving office.
 The notebooks, some 1,700 of them, lay undisturbed until prosecutors learned of them. To Mr. Weinberger and his supporters, the little books were personal diaries, with jottings about the family dog as well as policy. To prosecutors, they were evidence the former secretary had tried to bury.
 Mr. Weinberger furiously denied the charges, declaring that the prosecutor had pressed him to plead guilty to a lesser count in return for giving damaging testimony against Mr. Reagan, testimony that Mr. Weinberger said would have been false.
 Mr. Weinberger was to have stood trial in 1993. But on Christmas Eve 1992, President George Bush ended Mr. Weinberger's legal troubles, pardoning him and several other officials caught up in the scandal.
 Early in his tenure as defense secretary, Mr. Weinberger learned that he could not change the sprawling military bureaucracy overnight. In 1981, David A. Stockman, the Reagan budget director, pronounced the Pentagon ''a swamp'' of waste and inefficiency.
 ''Maybe he was talking about the Pentagon of a few years ago,'' Mr. Weinberger bristled. ''The Pentagon is not a swamp. It is very dry land.''
 But two years later, Mr. Weinberger acknowledged that some spending absurdities had sprung up under his watch as well as under previous Democratic ones. A common metal bolt that cost 80 cents in 1980 had somehow become worth $17.59 in 1982, for instance.
 Though he oversaw the spending of huge sums as Pentagon chief, Mr. Weinberger sometimes unleashed the budget-cutter in his political personality. Shortly after asking for $30 billion more in military spending for the first two years of the Reagan administration, he announced $1.7 billion in spending cuts through elimination of some projects and postponement of others. 
 In 1985, he canceled the development of an antiaircraft gun that had already cost $1.8 billion and was expected to cost $3 billion more. It just did not work very well, and there was no use throwing good money after bad, the secretary said.
 Mr. Weinberger was soft-spoken, almost courtly in personal encounters. He showed a soft side in 1983, when he vetoed a plan for dogs to be shot so that military doctors could practice treating wounds. (He owned a collie at the time.)
 By mid-1985, there were signs that his influence was waning. Some Congressional leaders had wearied of his demands for more and more money, and he was conspicuously omitted from Mr. Reagan's entourage to the Geneva summit meeting with Mr. Gorbachev. 
 Mr. Weinberger resigned on Nov. 5, 1987. His wife had undergone treatment for cancer, and he said he wanted to spend more time with her at home. ''That's the long and the short and the tall of it,'' he said.
 Not everyone believed him entirely. By many accounts, Mr. Weinberger differed often with Secretary of State Shultz, whom he considered too eager to negotiate with the Kremlin. And some of Mr. Weinberger's critics thought it was no coincidence that his resignation came just weeks after the stock market plunged, heralding a time of retrenching and the end of the Pentagon joy ride.
 Caspar Willard Weinberger was born in San Francisco on Aug. 18, 1917. His father, Herman, was of Jewish Bohemian descent and worked his way through college to become a lawyer. His mother, Cerise, was from an English background. In his book ''In the Arena: A Memoir of the 20th Century,'' written with Gretchen Roberts and published by Regnery in 2001, Mr. Weinberger said his father and grandfather had been indifferent to religion but that he himself had found his mother's Episcopalian faith ''an enormous influence and comfort all my life.''
 Mr. Weinberger graduated magna cum laude from Harvard, where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, in 1938. He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1941 and enlisted in the Army the same year. Decades later, when men with stars on their shoulders had to defer to him, he ruefully recalled that one of his first jobs in the Army was at a camp in California digging ditches for sewers.
 Mr. Weinberger went to officers' candidate school at Fort Benning, Ga., was sent to the Pacific after being commissioned, served more than three years with the 41st Infantry Division and landed on the intelligence staff of Gen. Douglas MacArthur.
 He was a clerk for a federal judge from 1945 to 1947, then started a private practice in the San Francisco area. He broke into politics in 1952, winning a seat in the California Assembly. He was re-elected without opposition in 1954 and 1956. A 1955 poll of newspaper reporters who covered the Legislature selected him as the most able California lawmaker.
 Mr. Weinberger was defeated in a run for attorney general of California in 1958. From 1959 to 1968, he wrote a newspaper column on state government and was moderator of a public affairs television program. He was vice chairman of the Republican State Central Committee of California from 1960 to 1962 and chairman from 1962 to 1964.
 Mr. Weinberger was chairman of a commission on reorganizing the California state government from 1966 to 1968 and was appointed state director of finance by Mr. Reagan, then the governor, early in 1968. The two had a warm relationship, even though in 1966 Mr. Weinberger had opposed Mr. Reagan in favor of a fellow San Franciscan in the Republican primary for governor. Mr. Weinberger was also considered a turncoat by some conservative Republicans because he gave only token support to Barry Goldwater's presidential campaign in 1964.
 As California's finance director, Mr. Weinberger ran an office that had long been considered weak in the state government. By most accounts, he revitalized it.
 Around that time, he was asked to sum up his political philosophy. He replied with a Republican bromide, ''Liberal on human affairs and conservative on fiscal ones.''
 His service under Mr. Reagan in California, and their friendship, burnished Mr. Weinberger's credentials in conservative eyes, enough so that Nixon asked him to be chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. Taking office in January 1970, Mr. Weinberger promised to be an ally to consumers.
 To the annoyance of some conservatives in the administration, Mr. Weinberger took on as an aide William Howard Taft 4th. Mr. Taft had the right name and the right Republican pedigree, but some businessmen thought he had a blemish on his resume: he had been an investigator for Ralph Nader. (Mr. Taft later served as a deputy defense secretary under Mr. Weinberger.)
 In the summer of 1970, Nixon named Mr. Weinberger deputy director of the new Office of Management and Budget. When the director, Mr. Shultz, became Treasury secretary in May 1972, Mr. Weinberger took Mr. Shultz's old job. 
 In November 1972, Nixon needed a new secretary of health, education and welfare to replace Elliot L. Richardson, who had moved to secretary of defense. Mr. Weinberger was a natural for the post, in view of Nixon's stated opinion that the health agency had become ''bloated.''
 Democrats wondered, in the words of Senator Harold E. Hughes of Iowa, if Mr. Weinberger could ''make the transition from budget hatchetman to advocate of people programs.'' He was confirmed by a vote of 61 to 10.
 As his critics had predicted, Mr. Weinberger did try to kill or rein in dozens of programs, including some for hospital construction and school aid. But his stewardship was not marked by the wholesale federal retreat on health issues that some liberals had feared.
 One reason was that Mr. Weinberger embraced some causes that liberals (and not a few conservatives) liked. He tried to get Congress to pass legislation limiting the tar and nicotine content of cigarettes. He envisioned national health insurance. He prodded his own department to protect the civil rights of mentally retarded people who were considered for sterilization. And at his insistence, a better American diet became official departmental policy.
 Another reason he could not live up to his sobriquet of Cap the Knife as H.E.W. secretary was that much of the department's spending was simply beyond his control. The enormous sums paid out for Social Security, Medicare and welfare programs were fixed by law, and often included automatic cost-of-living increases. 
 So in the end, Mr. Weinberger presided over an expansion at the department, an irony that prompted him to warn upon his departure of the perils of big government.
 After resigning from the Ford administration in 1975, Mr. Weinberger became a special counsel to the Bechtel engineering companies. As president-elect, Mr. Reagan turned to him in 1980 for advice on economic issues, opening the door for his career-culminating tenure at the Pentagon.
 Mr. Weinberger's novel, ''Chain of Command,'' written with Peter Schweizer, was published by Artia Books, a subsidiary of Simon & Schuster, in 2005. He was also the co-author, with Mr. Schweizer, of ''The Next War,'' an examination of defense strategy, published by Regnery in 1996.
 Mr. Weinberger enjoyed the theater, opera and ballet and for a time reviewed books for California newspapers.
 In addition to his wife and son, he is survived by a daughter, Arlin Weinberger; three grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. 
 Mr. Weinberger was second only to Robert S. McNamara in longevity as defense secretary. Characteristically, he fired some parting shots in his farewell ceremony on Nov. 17, 1987, complaining that previous presidents and lawmakers had allowed the American military to become weak and flabby. 
 ''We began by doubting the war in Vietnam,'' he lamented, ''and we ended by doubting ourselves.''
 Not even his bitterest foes doubted his patriotism or his intellectual power. But many critics thought he had encouraged Pentagon spending that was wasteful by any standards.
 In the summer of 1993, a three-year study by the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, concluded that under Mr. Weinberger the Pentagon had understated the cost of some weapons by billions of dollars, overstated their effectiveness and exaggerated the threat of the Soviet Union.
 Deriding the study as revisionist history written by bean-counters, Mr. Weinberger said its authors showed no understanding of how the world really was in the cold war era.
 ''Yes, we used a worst-case analysis,'' he said. ''You should always use a worst-case analysis in this business. You can't afford to be wrong. In the end, we won the cold war, and if we won by too much, if it was overkill, so be it.''

HEADLINE: Artworks With a LifeOutside Galleries 

BYLINE: By KEN JOHNSON

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 25 

 BODY:
A favorite fantasy of the art vanguard is the idea of intervention: the artist introduces something into the cultural mainstream that may or may not be recognized as art, but causes those who see it to reconsider and, ideally, to change their relationship to conventional values.
 Kate Ericson and Mel Ziegler were influential collaborators in social interventionist art, beginning officially as a team in 1985 and continuing until Ms. Ericson died of brain cancer in 1995. Their career is the subject of an illuminating time capsule of an exhibition now at the M.I.T. List Visual Arts Center here. ''America Starts Here: Kate Ericson and Mel Ziegler'' was organized by Bill Arning, a curator at the List, and Ian Berry, a curator at the Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery at Skidmore College, where the exhibition opened last fall. 
Ms. Ericson and Mr. Ziegler, who were students at the Kansas City Art Institute in the mid-1970's and attended the California Institute of Arts in the early 80's, did not usually make objects for display in museums and galleries. They preferred nonpermanent projects in settings away from art institutions. The ones involving private homeowners are especially amusing. Once they paid a homeowner to allow them to remove all the doors in a house and stack them in the living room. Another agreed to mow only half of his lawn and groom half of his large yard for a period of time, to the consternation of his neighbors.
 Dada may be what started this sort of thing, but Ms. Ericson and Mr. Ziegler were not absurdist pranksters. (At CalArts their mentors were Michael Asher, John Baldessari and Douglas Huebler, conceptualists known for their wit but not for extravagantly provocative gestures.) Their major projects involved extensive research into the history and current affairs of particular places, and the goal was to raise the social and political consciousnesses of the local residents.
 In the exhibition at M.I.T., a house model painted in a colorful camouflage pattern represents a project executed in 1991 as part of an arts festival in Charleston, S.C. Ms. Ericson and Mr. Ziegler asked an elderly man and his daughter who lived just outside an officially designated historic district to let them paint their house in camouflage, using colors approved by the city's historic preservation review board. The commercially produced paints had names like Moorish Maroon Red and Confederate Uniform Gray, and the project, pointedly titled ''Camouflaged History,'' became a lesson about history and economic, social and racial divisions. 
 While working on ''Camouflaged History,'' Ms. Ericson and Mr. Ziegler kept local residents informed about what they were doing and why in a series of community meetings. In an interview in this show's catalog, Mr. Ziegler recalls that after the festival, the immediate neighbors favored keeping the new color scheme. But residents in the nearby historic district objected, calling it an eyesore. Perhaps they also disliked its implicit exposure of differences in wealth and privilege between neighboring communities. 
 Ms. Ericson and Mr. Ziegler did not refuse to work in museums. In 1990, while engaged in a project for the Museum of Modern Art in New York, they discovered that its curators favored different shades of white for the exhibition walls. So they created an arrangement of bottles containing those shades, each etched with the name used by the museum's painting crew: ''Rubin White,'' ''Riva White,'' ''McShine White.'' The current show extends that idea by painting different walls in the gallery with the curators' favorite whites, and identifying them with discreet signs. One thought this prompts is about how power can be both all-pervasive and subtle to the point of invisibility. 
 Among the more tangible works on view is an antique wooden Dutch cupboard that displays a full set of fine, gold-trimmed white china, produced in 1993 for an international art exhibition in Arnhem, the Netherlands. Look closely and you discover that the dishes have printed on them in fine script the names of more than 800 types of products made by Akzo Chemicals, a company based in Arnhem (now Akzo Nobel). They include sealants, acne control medication, poultry antigens and impregnating products. This creates a nice tension between refined traditionalism and a vaguely frightening industrialism.
 The problem with presenting art of this sort in a gallery is that almost nothing is clear without a good deal of explanation. But if you read all the labels -- or better yet, the excellent catalog -- you get a clear picture of an enterprise marked by intelligence, earnestness, diligence and optimistic pragmatism. Whether Ms. Ericson and Mr. Ziegler managed to change much in the real world, they remain inspirational role models for the wonkier conceptualists and social workers in today's art world. 

''America Starts Here: Kate Ericson and Mel Ziegler'' is on view through April 9 at the M.I.T. List Visual Arts Center, Wiesner Building, 20 Ames Street, Cambridge, Mass.; (617) 253-4680.

HEADLINE: U.S. Raises Standards On Mileage 

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, March 29 

 BODY:
The Transportation Department announced new fuel economy standards Wednesday for sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and minivans that will make some of them go farther on a gallon of gasoline than the average car does, and will apply to many of the biggest S.U.V.'s for the first time. 
 But the overall fuel savings, 8.1 percent when the rule is fully phased in, were characterized as too modest by many conservation advocates, who also noted that the biggest pick-up trucks will still be unregulated. Remarks by auto manufacturers were restrained. 
The transportation secretary, Norman Y. Mineta, speaking on the fifth-floor walkway at a football stadium, said that the cost of the new rule would be justified by the fuel saved, but that more than economics was involved.
 ''Saving fuel is as important to our national security and economic viability as it is to preserving our environment,'' he said, a tangle of highways in the background.
 The final rule that Mr. Mineta announced on Wednesday was slightly tougher than the one his department proposed last summer. He said this was partly because of the president's commitment in the State of the Union address in January to reduce the nation's ''addiction'' to imported oil. But oil consumption would continue to rise under the new rule, he acknowledged.
 The rule covers ''light trucks'' in the model years from 2008 to 2011. The current rules cover vehicles weighing up to 8,500 pounds. But the new one will cover S.U.V.'s that weigh up to 10,000 pounds. That includes the heavier variants of the Chevy Suburban and the Hummer H2. (The H1 is over 10,000 pounds and still exempt.) 
 The rule does not cover heavy pickup trucks, like the Ford F-250, on the theory that those are used mostly in agriculture or business. While many of the vehicles covered under the new rule are used primarily for personal transportation, often with a single person inside, Mr. Mineta said that the people of Baltimore and the rest of the nation understood how important light trucks were ''to maintaining our way of life.'' 
 The rule will save 10.7 billion gallons of fuel over the lifetime of the vehicles in those model years, the department estimated. Currently, the United States uses that much gasoline in less than a month.
 Transportation officials estimated that the rule would cost vehicle manufacturers about $6.7 billion, a big number even by the standards of federal rule-making, and would add about $200 to the cost of the average vehicle. But owners would save that much within four years, officials said, based on a fuel price of $2 a gallon at the beginning of the period, rising to $2.39 over the vehicle's lifetime. In fact, average gasoline prices are already slightly above the second figure.
 The standard is 21.6 miles a gallon for the current model year; it would rise to about 24 miles a gallon in 2011, the last year of the rule, but it would be calculated differently. The new rule sets a fuel economy standard based on the vehicle's ''footprint,'' or how far apart the wheels are. Actual fuel economy will depend on the mix of vehicles sold.
 The smallest S.U.V.'s, like the Suzuki Grand Vitara and the Jeep Wrangler, would have to meet a standard of 28.6 miles per gallon. The car standard is 27.5 miles per gallon.
 Changing the rules to take into account the size of each vehicle has another effect: it puts pressure on all the companies that sell vehicles in the category, and not just those that sell the biggest, thirstiest vehicles. 
 Stephen R. Kratzke, the associate administrator for rule-making at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said that the current standard was irrelevant to companies that built only small S.U.V.'s and pickups, because their fleet average was within acceptable limits even if their vehicles were not particularly fuel efficient for their size. 
 American manufacturers had complained that the current system burdened them but made no difference to Asian makers that sold few or no vehicles at the top end of the range. 
 Mr. Kratzke said that manufacturers would more widely deploy technologies that are already in limited use. Those include six-speed automatic transmissions, power steering systems that run on electricity instead of a belt that draws power from the engine, hybrid-electric drive trains and superchargers. Aluminum might be more widely used as an alternative to steel, but composite materials are still too costly, he said.
 At the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents all the major manufacturers but Honda, Eron Shosteck, a spokesman, said, ''It is going to be a challenge for automakers, but automakers are committed to meeting it.'' 
 Sherrie Childers Arb, a spokeswoman at General Motors, said that when her company analyzed the rule as proposed last year, engineers found it ''challenging but achievable.'' This one will be tougher, but the company has not finished analyzing it, she said.
 Others were more critical. Representative Sherwood L. Boehlert, a New York Republican who is the chairman of the House Science Committee, said the Bush administration had missed an opportunity. ''It's remarkable to me how long we keep making the same mistake over and over,'' he said. ''Nothing is preventing us from making our nation more prosperous and more secure except political failure of will.'' 
 At Environmental Defense, a nonprofit advocacy group, Eric Haxthausen, an economist and expert on cars, said the expansion from 8,500 to 10,000 pounds in vehicle weight should have covered pickups, which make up 80 percent of the category, and the whole standard should have been more aggressive. 
 ''We have to credit them with some modest steps forward,'' he said. ''But given the urgency of the global warming issue and oil dependency issue, this is not the bold step that is called for.'' 
 But Ron DeFore, a spokesman for a group run by industry lobbyists called the S.U.V. Owners of America, said, ''With the manufacturers, even tenths of a mile per gallon are hard to eke out.'' He said 20 million Americans have ''something that's towable,'' from a trailer to a boat, and need powerful engines. And, he added, ''in an era when we're at $2.50 a gallon plus, the real question is why you need a rule like this anyway.'' Economic self-interest will make people buy higher-mileage vehicles, he said.

HEADLINE: Next Stop For Delphi: The Courts

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 29 

 BODY:
Delphi, the auto parts maker, and its largest union, the United Automobile Workers, agreed on one critical point on Wednesday: that the company was likely to ask a bankruptcy court judge to let it set aside its labor contracts and impose sharply lower wages and benefits.
 Delphi executives said they still hoped to reach a deal with the union, but a U.A.W. spokesman said it expected the company to file its request with the court on Friday, the deadline it has set for an agreement. 
This week, the U.A.W. rejected Delphi's latest offer, which included a sweetener to make the wage cuts more palatable. 
 The two sides continue to talk, a Delphi spokesman, Lindsey C. Williams, said: ''Our focus is to get an agreement, but if we can't get an agreement by the 31st, we will file.''
 What happens then could be everything -- meaning a series of strikes that could cripple Delphi's plants and hinder production at General Motors -- or nothing. G.M. spun off Delphi in 1999.
 A bankruptcy court judge is not likely to hear Delphi's arguments in favor of imposing lower wages for several weeks, and a ruling may take 60 days or more. Talks will probably continue during that time.
 As if sending a signal that the union was in no rush to confront Delphi, U.A.W. leaders told local union officials this week that a decision on whether to hold strike authorization votes would be made later.
 Generally, the U.A.W., which has 24,000 workers at Delphi, asks members for their support of a strike before it calls a walkout.
 In January, another parts maker, Tower Automotive, asked a bankruptcy judge to terminate its labor contracts, leading to a strike vote by U.A.W. members. But a bankruptcy judge has held off ruling in the matter while the sides negotiate.
 ''The union has been sophisticated; they've been prudent; they know how to bide their time,'' said David L. Gregory, professor of labor law at St. John's University in New York.
 Less clear is whether Delphi's second-largest union will show similar restraint. That union, the International Union of Electrical Workers, which represents 8,500 workers at Delphi, has already received strike authorization from seven of its eight locals.
 The I.U.E., which represents workers at Delphi plants in Alabama, Mississippi, New Jersey and Ohio, among others, has much at stake. 
 Delphi has already said it wants to cut 5,000 I.U.E. jobs. The company also excluded the union from the deal it reached last week with General Motors and the U.A.W. that offered buyouts to 13,000 Delphi workers if they would leave.
 While a strike at one or more I.U.E. plants would inconvenience Delphi and G.M., a broader walkout by U.A.W. members could cause both companies to shut down, depending on the extent of the strike. 
 That prospect rattled investors Wednesday. G.M. shares fell 60 cents, to $22.15. 
 Meanwhile, Moody's Investor's Services cut its rating on G.M.'s debt, while Standard & Poor's Ratings Services placed the company on CreditWatch with negative implications, meaning that the company was in danger of a downgrade further into junk status. 
 S.& P. cited the situation at Delphi as one reason for its action, which came a day after G.M. restated results at its G.M.A.C. financing arm, and warned that it could have trouble tapping a line of credit.
 G.M. also played a role in Delphi's latest offer, which was a significant departure from its original demand that wages be cut from about $27 an hour to $9.50 an hour. 
 The latest proposal called for a cut of $5 an hour to $22 an hour, with a subsequent cut to $16 an hour in 2007. To ease the sting, each Delphi worker would get $50,000.
 But those hourly cuts are far more than the U.A.W. has ever accepted. In 1979, when Chrysler was near bankruptcy and needed a federal bailout to survive, the union agreed to cuts of $2 an hour that eventually were restored. 
 Even taking inflation into account, the cuts of $5 and up were denounced by local union officials as too much to swallow.
 Rejection of the offer was ''a turn for the worse,'' John Murphy, an auto industry analyst with Merrill Lynch, wrote in a research note. But, Mr. Murphy said, ''This latest move does not mean that a strike is imminent, but simply more likely.''
 Even walkouts at a handful of plants could be costly. A seven-week strike in 1998 at two parts plants in Flint, Mich., nearly crippled G.M.'s production in the United States, and cost the company $1.6 billion, or $34 million a day. 
 This time, Mr. Murphy estimated a two-month strike by the U.A.W. could cost G.M. $7 billion to $8 billion, given that it is in a weaker state than eight years ago.
 Analysts said the U.A.W.'s thirst for a strike might have been tempered by the G.M.-Delphi buyout deal. Union members may prefer, Professor Gregory said, to ''let the dust settle and see where they are a few weeks from now.'' 
 However, Delphi is ready to get on with its bid for sharply lower wages and benefits. Its chief executive, Robert S. Miller Jr., has insisted the motion would be a ''slam dunk,'' once the bankruptcy judge hears Delphi's argument.
 ''Given all the bluster and the braggadocio,'' Professor Gregory said, ''this becomes a sort of weird corporate badge of honor. 
 ''This could be the beginning of the end or the end of the beginning but either way, it's pretty grim.''

Lear Receives a Bank Loan
 SOUTHFIELD, Mich., March 29 (AP) -- The Lear Corporation, the auto parts supplier, said Wednesday that it had obtained $800 million in bank loans, suspended its dividend and sold an interior products division in an effort to strengthen its financial position. 
 But Standard & Poor's Ratings Services lowered Lear's corporate credit rating three notches, pushing it deeper into junk territory. The S.& P. cited a sharp decline in its operating performance in 2005. Lear shares rose $1.54, to $18.49.
 The chairman and chief executive of Lear, Robert E. Rossiter, said the bank loans would help the company refinance its 2007 debt maturities early. The company said it had also reached an agreement in principle for the International Automotive Components Group to acquire Lear's European Interiors Systems Division in exchange for 34 percent of the stock in International Automotive.

John Elsden relishes the excitement of the mint-condition '65 Mustang convertible he takes out of his garage in eastern Virginia only on sunny days. The sporty coupe with a 289-cubic-inch engine growls, rumbles, vibrates and shakes when he puts his foot on the gas pedal. 
 But the Mustang, Mr. Elsden said, is not as zippy as his daughter's year-old sports wagon, a Nissan Murano, and accelerates hardly better than his wife's 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Mr. Elsden, a car buff who has owned a variety of muscle cars, said the average sedan today accelerated faster than many cars designed to turn heads in the old days.
For two decades automakers have been developing technology that could make vehicles go farther on a gallon of gasoline. But instead, they have chosen pep and size -- making vehicles like the new Murano accelerate faster than cars like the old Mustang, and making them bigger. 
 The average vehicle, which 25 years ago accelerated to 60 miles an hour in 14.4 seconds, now does it in 9.9 seconds, a pace once typical only of sporty or luxury cars like Camaros and Jaguars. And vehicle weight now averages about 4,100 pounds, up from about 3,200 in the early 1980's, as many buyers switched to larger, roomier cars or to sport utility vehicles and minivans, and as automakers added safety equipment. 
 Buyers like the extra zoom and room, but these have come at a cost: average fuel economy has fallen slightly over the last two decades. The government's new standards for light trucks like S.U.V.'s, published yesterday, will require an 8.1 percent increase in miles per gallon over the four model years from 2008 through 2011. [Page C1.]
 But over the longer term, significant improvement appears to be lagging. As scientists and engineers look for ways to satisfy the fast-growing demand for energy and to slow climate change, many of them say that fundamental changes are needed in the way fuel is produced and consumed. 
 They say that ways must be found to replace oil and gas, and to get more energy from coal, which will become increasingly important as an energy source, without adding to carbon dioxide emissions.
 And they say that greater fuel efficiency is imperative as the number of motor vehicles, which the Worldwatch Institute says has nearly doubled worldwide in the last two decades, could double again in 15 years. The United States has the highest per capita gasoline consumption of any major country.
 Higher mileage would also significantly reduce emissions of global-warming gases that come from burning gasoline. The increase in vehicle acceleration and weight alone has raised emissions of carbon dioxide in the United States by about 5 percent. 
 If 2005 model vehicles, with their better technology, had the performance and size of those in 1987, they would use only 80 percent of the gasoline they do today, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. That alone would get the country nearly halfway to the goal President Bush set in his State of the Union address: to cut American oil consumption enough to nearly eliminate the need to import from the Middle East. 
 But because Americans have not insisted on better fuel economy, ''we can take the technology in the cars and turn the knob toward performance,'' said Karl H. Hellman, an automotive development expert who retired from the E.P.A. two years ago. 
 Improving mileage now would be easy if drivers sacrificed some zip in new cars, he said, ''but in this country, we don't sacrifice for anything.'' 
 Just as significant as vehicle weight is how much faster autos accelerate, even as more driving is done on congested roads. The E.P.A. does not calculate how much of the poorer fuel economy results from acceleration and how much is attributable to weight, but it publishes figures suggesting that the split is about even. 
 The 2005 Toyota Camry, one of the most popular sedans, accelerates more quickly than some 1975 Pontiac Firebirds. The Chevrolet TrailBlazer, an S.U.V., can reach 60 miles an hour in 8.2 seconds -- about half the time of its 1985 ancestor. The 2006 Cadillac STS-V, which can reach 60 m.p.h. in less than five seconds, is one of many cars that now have more than enough horsepower to pull an 18-wheeler.
 Philip H. Kosak of High Point, N.C., owns a 1965 Mustang, a 2005 Mustang, a Chevrolet TrailBlazer S.U.V. and an extended-cab Silverado pickup. The whole country, himself included, is spoiled, he said.
 He has thought about buying something smaller and more fuel-efficient, especially with gasoline prices often running near $3 a gallon, but he has driven a pickup for years. ''Once you've graduated to that, it's tough to go back. It's like moving back into a smaller home.'' 
 Mr. Kosak, who owns a company that produces snack food, said he drove 30,000 miles a year. He could save hundreds of gallons of gas a year with something smaller, he said, but even at today's fuel prices he can afford the extra expense and does not want to give up the fun of something that performs well. Mr. Kosak, who is 50, says he is looking forward to a lot of driving just for enjoyment.
 But nearly a hundred million households burning an extra few hundred gallons a year add significantly to pollution and a greater reliance on imported oil. That contributes to a larger trade deficit and, at times, the use of American power to protect foreign supplies. 
 Representative Sherwood Boehlert, Republican of New York, who has pushed for years for higher fuel economy standards, said, ''We can talk all we want about our addiction to oil, but words have to be followed with deeds.'' 
 ''It wouldn't be a sacrifice at all. No one really needs that greater power, except specialized vehicles for law enforcement purposes.'' 
 The carmakers say they give customers what they want. ''Performance and safety, those factors are salable into the marketplace,'' said Gerald M. Roussel, manager for energy and environment at the Ford Motor Company's government relations office. And they have done so while reducing emissions of pollutants that cause smog and acid rain, he and others pointed out. 
 In improving fuel economy, virtually everyone agrees that there is a way only if there is a will. ''There is no shortage of technology,'' said John M. DeCicco, a senior analyst at Environmental Defense, a nonprofit advocacy group.
 Technologies already in use include four valves for each cylinder, which allows more power from a smaller, lighter engine, and computer-controlled fuel injection, which increases efficiency and cuts pollution.
 More changes are coming. For example, gas-electric hybrids are increasingly common, but have been used in some cases more to make the vehicle accelerate faster than to go farther on a gallon of gasoline. 
 Indeed, Mark P. Mills, a physicist and energy expert, said that improvements in vehicle efficiency would not reduce consumption because without a significant rise in gasoline prices to encourage buyers to save fuel, most people would simply take advantage of the advances to demand bigger, faster vehicles.
 Mr. DeCicco agreed. ''What we're really talking about here is the need to, through a combination of public policy and awareness, use the technologies at hand with a different set of priorities in mind,'' he said. ''Until we do that, all the invention in the world isn't going to make a difference.''

HEADLINE: Immigrants to Be Proud Of

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Everybody says the Republicans are split on immigration. The law-and-order types want to close the border. The free-market types want plentiful labor. But today I want to talk to the social conservatives, because it's you folks who are really going to swing this debate. 
 I'd like to get you to believe what Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas believes: that a balanced immigration bill is consistent with conservative values. I'd like to try to persuade the evangelical leaders in the tall grass to stop hiding on this issue. 
 My first argument is that the exclusionists are wrong when they say the current wave of immigration is tearing our social fabric. The facts show that the recent rise in immigration hasn't been accompanied by social breakdown, but by social repair. As immigration has surged, violent crime has fallen by 57 percent. Teen pregnancies and abortion rates have declined by a third. Teenagers are having fewer sexual partners and losing their virginity later. Teen suicide rates have dropped. The divorce rate for young people is on the way down.
 Over the past decade we've seen the beginnings of a moral revival, and some of the most important work has been done by Catholic and evangelical immigrant churches, by faith-based organizations like the Rev. Luis Cortes's Nueva Esperanza, by Hispanic mothers and fathers monitoring their kids. The anti-immigration crowd says this country is under assault. But if that's so, we're under assault by people who love their children.
 My second argument is that the immigrants themselves are like a booster shot of traditional morality injected into the body politic. Immigrants work hard. They build community groups. They have traditional ideas about family structure, and they work heroically to make them a reality. 
 This is evident in everything from divorce rates (which are low, given immigrants' socioeconomic status) to their fertility rates (which are high) and even the way they shop. 
 Hispanics and Hispanic immigrants have less money than average Americans, but they spend what they have on their families, usually in wholesome ways. According to Simmons Research, Hispanics are 57 percent more likely than average Americans to have purchased children's furniture in the past year. Mexican-Americans spend 93 percent more on children's music.
 According to the government's Consumer Expenditure Survey, Hispanics spend more on gifts, on average, than other Americans. They're more likely to support their parents financially. They're more likely to have big family dinners at home. 
 This isn't alien behavior. It's admirable behavior, the antidote to the excessive individualism that social conservatives decry. 
 My third argument is that good values lead to success, and that immigrants' long-term contributions more than compensate for the short-term strains they cause. There's no use denying the strains immigration imposes on schools, hospitals and wage levels in some markets (but economists are sharply divided on this).
 So over the long haul, today's immigrants succeed. By the second generation, most immigrant families are middle class and paying taxes that more than make up for the costs of the first generation. By the third generation, 90 percent speak English fluently and 50 percent marry non-Latinos. 
 My fourth argument is that government should be at least as virtuous as the immigrants themselves. Right now (as under Bill Frist's legislation), government pushes immigrants into a chaotic underground world. The Judiciary Committee's bill, which Senator Brownback supports, would tighten the borders, but it would also reward virtue. Immigrants who worked hard, paid fines, paid their taxes, stayed out of trouble and waited their turn would have a chance to become citizens. This isn't government enabling vice; it's government at its best, encouraging middle-class morality.
 Social conservatives, let me ask you to consider one final thing. Women who have recently arrived from Mexico have bigger, healthier babies than more affluent non-Hispanic white natives. That's because strong family and social networks support these pregnant women, reminding them what to eat and do. But the longer they stay, and the more assimilated they become, the more bad habits they acquire and the more problems their subsequent babies have.
 Please ask yourself this: As we contemplate America's moral fiber, do the real threats come from immigrants, or are some people merely blaming them for sins that are already here?

HEADLINE: American Dreams, Foreign Flags

BYLINE: By Linda Chavez. 
Linda Chavez, chairman of the Center for Equal Opportunity in Sterling, Va., was the director of the United States Commission on Civil Rights under President Ronald Reagan.

DATELINE: Pittsburg, Tex. 

 BODY:
HUNDREDS of thousands of flag-waving demonstrators took to the streets in Denver, Los Angeles, Phoenix and dozens of other cities in the last week to protest harsh legislation passed by the House that would make felons of the 12 million illegal aliens living in the United States -- along with anyone who provides them with shelter, food or other services. It didn't take long for a bipartisan majority on the Senate Judiciary Committee to get the message and take a softer tack. 
 On Monday, four Republicans joined all eight committee Democrats to vote down the controversial penalties. Their proposal also calls for admitting more legal immigrants and temporary workers, allowing illegal aliens already in the country to remain here and earn citizenship if they pay a fine, learn English and study American civics. 
The Senate bill has a long way to go before becoming law, however. Despite their victory in this round, supporters of comprehensive immigration reform must be careful in their tactics, including what symbols they embrace. Although American flags were widely visible among the crowd of a half-million in downtown Los Angeles (organizers had asked marchers to bring them), reports indicated that they were outnumbered by those of Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and other countries. And if history is any guide, those foreign banners could spur an anti-immigrant reaction. 
 That's what happened in 1994, when 70,000 people marched in Los Angeles, many waving Mexican flags, to show their distaste for Proposition 187, a California ballot initiative that denied social services to illegal aliens and their children. Initially favored by more than 70 percent of voters, the measure was losing steam as the election approached, with a poll a week before the election showing it ahead by only 1 point. But that sea of green, white and red Mexican flags flooding the streets just before the election signaled to many Californians that those demanding equal treatment were more attached to their native country than to the United States. The proposition scored a surprisingly strong 59 percent of the vote, although the courts eventually declared it unconstitutional. 
 Similar dynamics are playing out today. For all the talk of national security and the economic costs of immigration, the underlying issue driving the current anti-immigrant frenzy is a deep suspicion that this latest group of newcomers won't do what others have before them did: learn English and embrace American identity. 
 Unfortunately, many Latino leaders play right into the hands of those who claim they are different from the Germans, Italians, Poles, Jews, Irish and others who came here in another era. With shouts of ''Si, se puede!'' (Yes, we can!) -- an old United Farm Workers rallying cry -- and signs announcing ''We didn't cross the border, the border crossed us,'' the demonstrators are likely to turn off more Americans than they win over. And the sight of thousands of angry Hispanic students from California to Virginia pouring out of schools to join protest marches will only reinforce stereotypes that Latinos care little about education. 
 Instead of presenting themselves as an aggrieved, foreign presence, immigration advocates ought to be explaining how similar Latinos are to other Americans in their values, aspirations and achievements. It's an easy case to make. 
 Mexican-born men, for example, are more likely to be in the labor force than any other racial or ethnic group, according to the Census Bureau. Nearly half of Latino immigrants own their own homes. While most immigrants from Latin America, especially Mexico and Central America, lag in educational attainment, their children are far more likely to stay in school: according to research by the Pew Hispanic Center, 80 percent of second-generation Latinos graduate from high school. Almost half of second-generation Latinos ages 25 to 44 have attended college, and those who graduate earn more on average than non-Hispanic white workers. 
 Latino immigrants are also starting their own businesses at a rapid pace. The Census Bureau reported that entrepreneurship among Latinos is increasing at a rate three times faster than that of other Americans. Americans of Hispanic descent now own 1.6 million businesses generating $222 billion annually; and while Census data didn't distinguish between immigrants and American-born Hispanics, it suggested that much of this growth occurred in heavily immigrant communities. 
 Like every generation of immigrants before them, Latinos start out on the bottom rungs of the economic ladder, but they don't stay there. They are learning English as quickly as their predecessors, perhaps more quickly thanks to television (a majority of third-generation Latinos speak only English). They are intermarrying at faster rates than earlier ethnic groups, too, with about one-third of married American-born Latinos having a non-Hispanic spouse. 
 These facts, if they were more widely known, would go a long way to calming fears about Latino immigration. If Latino advocates hope to influence the outcome of the Senate debate on immigration over the next two weeks, they would do well to spread the word -- and trade their ancestral flags for the Stars and Stripes.

HEADLINE: The Cost of Invading Iraq: Imponderables Meet Uncertainties 

BYLINE: By Alan B. Krueger. 
This is Alan B. Krueger's last Economic Scene column. He has written columns under that heading for the last six years. Dr. Krueger (www.krueger.princeton.edu) is Bendheim professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton.

 BODY:
THE question of whether it was worth invading Iraq is being asked with increasing frequency and fervency. 
 A Gallup poll this month found that 60 percent of Americans said they did not think it was worth going to war in Iraq, up from 29 percent at the start of the invasion in March 2003.
Fundamentally, deciding whether war is worth it involves weighing the benefits and costs, both tangible and intangible. The many estimates of the cost of the Iraq war that are available are uninformative absent a comparison with the likely benefits, or a comparison with the costs and benefits of the best alternative to invasion. 
 Unfortunately, cost-benefit comparisons of such weighty issues are more art than science. One problem is that the counterfactual situation -- meaning the outcomes that would have occurred had another policy been pursued -- cannot be known for sure. In addition, it is often unclear how to value the outcomes of the policy that is pursued. 
 One of the earliest cost-benefit comparisons was done by Steven J. Davis, Kevin M. Murphy and Robert H. Topel of the University of Chicago on the eve of the invasion in 2003. They explicitly considered a continued policy of containment -- enforcing the no-fly zone and other operations to hem in Saddam Hussein -- as an alternative to invasion and regime change. Assuming that containment and invasion would protect the United States equally well, the question of whether invasion is worth it turns on which policy is less costly, after discounting all likely future costs. 
 Allowing for a 3 percent chance that the Iraqi regime would evolve into a benign government in any future year and a 2 percent real interest rate, the economists reckoned that the cost of pursuing a containment strategy was $258 billion to $380 billion. ''This dwarfs any reasonable estimate of U.S. war costs,'' they wrote at the time. Their anticipated price tag for the war, which they considered conservative, was $125 billion. 
 Professors Davis, Murphy and Topel have revised their figures in a new National Bureau of Economic Research working paper, ''War in Iraq Versus Containment.'' Their estimated war costs have increased to a range of $410 billion to $630 billion, reflecting reality there. 
 William D. Nordhaus, an economist at Yale who warned in 2002 that past war cost forecasts had turned out to be too low, said the updated work is ''economics at its best and worst -- quantifying the almost-unquantifiable.'' 
 In the fog of war accounting, one thing is clear: all costs and benefits can be contested as wildly inaccurate -- in either direction. 
 Consider what the cost of containment would have been had the United States not gone to war. The University of Chicago study now says it is in ''the range of $350 billion to $700 billion.'' This range is arguably grossly inflated because it counts virtually all of the American military forces in the Middle East as dedicated to containing Iraq. 
 While containing Iraq was a central focus, these troops also served many other purposes. They conducted rescue operations in Somalia; performed humanitarian missions in Nigeria, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Jordan; responded to terrorist bombings in Nairobi and Tanzania; and were responsible for military activities in the five Central Asian republics of the former Soviet Union. 
 Additionally, Iran was considered a greater potential long-term threat than Iraq, according to the official command history. It is hard to believe that the United States would not have a substantial military presence in the region even if Iraq was not regarded as a threat. 
 Ideally, only incremental costs would be counted in deciding whether something was worth it; that is, the extra costs of resources used to achieve an objective. 
 Another study of Iraq war costs, by Linda J. Bilmes of Harvard and Joseph E. Stiglitz of Columbia, comes up with an eye-catching estimate of $2.2 trillion, assuming the United States is no longer in Iraq in 2015. This is arguably too high for several reasons. First, it counts future interest payments on the debt created by military spending as well as the direct expenditures. (This is analogous to counting both the sale price of a house and the cost of future mortgage payments as the cost of buying the house.) 
 Second, it counts elevated military recruitment costs that incorporate a premium for higher risk of death or injury because of the war as well as the predicted direct cost of the deaths and injuries; this is double counting if the risk premium is adequate. Finally, it ascribes a big increase in the price of oil to the war, and, as a result, a loss to the American economy of almost half a trillion dollars. 
 A menu of cost estimates is thus available, depending on the counterfactual situation that one chooses. 
 ''The question of whether the war was worth it hinges not on budget costs or economic costs,'' said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who until recently was director of the Congressional Budget Office, ''but on what do we gain in the way of genuine security and international standing.'' The costs, he said, were manageable. 
 The benefits, however, are much harder to quantify than the costs. To Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Jimmy Carter's national security adviser, ''the benefits have been, in fact, very few, beyond the obvious one: the removal of Saddam Hussein.'' Offsetting that, he said the war ''undermined our international legitimacy,'' ''destroyed our credibility'' and ''tarnished our morality with Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo.'' 
 The Chicago economists argue that anticipated improvements in Iraq's living standard, once the country stabilizes, tip the balance in favor of invasion over containment, which in their view had costs that were ''in the same ballpark.'' They also argue that the number of Iraqi fatalities since the invasion is probably no greater than would have been the case under Mr. Hussein. 
 But even if one accepts all of their estimates, their results implicitly raise another question: Why intervene in Iraq and not a country like Sudan, where genocide and oppression are at least as much an affront as they were in Iraq, and where the cost of intervention and prospects for improving lives may offer a better benefit-to-cost ratio than is likely in Iraq? 
 Credible estimation of counterfactual outcomes of alternative policies for cost-benefit comparisons has been a hallmark of modern economics. When it comes to judging whether war is worth it, however, cost-benefit analysis is little more than educated guessing by other means. But at least it provides a framework for where to put the guesses.

HEADLINE: Seattle's Shattered Rave 'Family' Seeks Answers to Killings

BYLINE: By JESSICA KOWAL

DATELINE: SEATTLE, March 29 

 BODY:
The candykids, juggalos, groovers and burners are uniting here with fresh purpose this week. Dancing to the synthesized music that binds them together, planting memorials of candles and their signature beaded bracelets, they join together not to rave, but to mourn slain friends.
 One woman had a rainbow of yarn woven into her hair. Two men had faces painted in red and black. A man in a suit and tie had a pinkish mohawk. Dozens of others wore baggy clothing or unremarkable dress. All showed up on Tuesday at a spring-green park with a spectacular view of the Space Needle. 
Exhausted by sorrow and lack of sleep, they seemed dumbstruck that the community of ravers, who follow a mantra of ''plur,'' for ''peace, love, unity and respect,'' had been punctured by senseless violence.
 Six friends were killed early Saturday, when, the police say, Aaron Kyle Huff, 28, barreled through the front door of a small house on Republican Street, armed with a semiautomatic handgun and a 12-gauge shotgun.
 At 7 a.m., a few dozen ravers were in the house to talk, drink beer, sleep, watch cartoons or otherwise decompress after attending a zombie-themed rave elsewhere.
 Mr. Huff, an unemployed onetime pizza deliverer, had been invited to the house party by others at the rave. Without warning, he collected the guns from his truck parked nearby and swiftly killed four men and two teenage girls with gunshots to the head and chest, the King County Medical Examiner said Wednesday. 
 Confronted by a police officer, Mr. Huff committed suicide. The police have not determined his motive.
 To the mourners in Volunteer Park and to those who lingered at the house on Wednesday with their tents and trinkets, it was unbearable that Mr. Huff had brutalized the self-described ''family'' of music-loving slackers, students and young professionals who often exchange beaded bracelets, called candy, as a friendship gesture. 
 ''These are peaceful people,'' said Wally Hansen, 24, a rave promoter from Tukwila whose face was drawn and pale, with dark circles under his eyes. ''Why would he do this to people who accepted him, who welcomed him into their own home?''
 The victims, ages 14 to 32 and with rave nicknames like Sushi, Deacon and Chinadoll, were familiar faces at spirited parties attended by hundreds of people in the Puget Sound region. In warehouses, art spaces or nightclubs on Friday and Saturday nights, dressed in clothing that defines them into smaller cliques like candykids and juggalos, they dance energetically to musical genres like house, trance and jungle and stop to rest in ''chill rooms'' tuned with quieter ambient music.
 The dancing is powered by energy drinks, candy and snacks, although many ravers concede that alcohol, marijuana and Ecstasy are part of the scene. 
 The rave community here had been mostly invisible to people who were not part of it. After the killings, talk-show hosts and columnists, intent on finding lessons, have focused on the youngest victims, Melissa Moore, 14, a ninth grader from Milton, and Suzanne Thorne, 15, a 10th grader from Bellevue. 
 Many people have criticized what they see as lax gun-control laws, pointing out that Mr. Huff was convicted of a misdemeanor in 2000 after shooting a moose sculpture in his Montana hometown, Whitefish. He was allowed to keep the two guns used in the shooting here. 
 Other critics have faulted what they describe as permissive rave culture, lax parents or lenient laws that allow teenagers into clubs where alcohol is not served. 
 Kyle Moore, Ms. Moore's father, refused to blame anyone but the gunman. He said he and his daughter, nicknamed Chinadoll, trusted other ravers to protect her. 
 ''She just loved meeting the different people, seeing the different costumes, and she loved the music, the beat,'' Mr. Moore said in a telephone interview. ''She was brighter than the sun out there. I just would love to know why she felt that she couldn't call me to pick her up.''
 Most likely, the two teenagers were waiting for the county bus to restart its downtown route at 7 a.m., said Nicole Loerke, 17, of Everett, who, like other candykids at the park, had a peach-colored Care Bears backpack. Ms. Loerke started going to raves last year, she said, when she had no friends in high school. 
 ''They accept you as a person, the virtues and values you hold,'' she said of the ravers. 
 She said that she noticed Mr. Huff at the rave and that he stood against a wall with folded arms and did not mingle in a millieu where people greet one another as close friends within minutes of meeting.
 ''I asked him, 'Is there anything wrong?' and he turned his head,'' Ms. Loerke said. ''I said, 'If you need anyone to talk to, I'm here to listen.' He looked right at me, and said, 'Thank you.' He must have had some screws loose.''
 Outside the Republican Street house, the ravers pitched tents on the grass and stayed in shifts to protect a growing memorial of candles and candy bracelets strung with words like ''plur'' and ''luv all.'' The neighbors have given them hot chocolate and offered the use of bathrooms.
 Josh McPharlin, 24, a rave promoter, looked at the mementos on the sidewalk and said: ''I enjoyed these people. It's just unbelievable that I won't ever be able to spend time with them again.''

HEADLINE: A Nation of Immigrants Faces the Current Wave

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Underlying the push for legalizing undocumented workers in one way or another has always been the claim that ''Americans won't do those jobs.'' 
 If you can convince me, I might support a guest worker or temporary green card solution, or even the proposal to allow some people to earn entry onto the path to citizenship. 
 But to do that, two things must be done: 
 First, create a meaningful minimum wage that will apply across the board, from strawberry pickers to kitchen help (and I will gladly pay more, then, for berries and meals); and enforce existing laws against hiring undocumented workers, and let's just see what happens to our economy then!

HEADLINE: As the East Village Revives, a Church Withers

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO; Ann Farmer contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
From the outside, the Church of the Nativity hardly evokes feelings of the divine. Its boxy, cinder-block-and-brick aesthetic give it a drab institutional feel. Inside, the church is similarly lacking in flourish: bare white walls, oak pews and little else.
 ''Humble, we can claim that,'' said the Rev. Donald C. Gannon, a Jesuit priest who is the church's pastor. 
Yet the plain church on Second Avenue near Second Street inspired hope for many in the East Village during the neighborhood's worst of times -- the crime-ridden, drug-infested decades of the 1960's, 70's and 80's. Today, the neighborhood has rebounded. Paradoxically, however, that has helped pave the way for a once-thriving church's demise. 
 Nativity is on the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York's list of recommendations for closing. The list, released on Tuesday, included 31 parishes and 14 schools, making it the most vast reorganization in the archdiocese's history of more than 150 years. 
 The recommendations, according to Catholic officials, are spurred by a shortage of priests, along with changing demographics that have emptied parts of New York City of the Catholic faithful, many of whom have left for the suburbs. 
 Manhattan, the archdiocese's historic heart, is among the hardest hit in the recommendations. It has a quarter of all the churches in the archdiocese, which stretches to the Catskills in the north from Staten Island in the south, but only 17 percent of the average head count at weekend Masses. 
 Parishes that were created a century ago to serve booming immigrant neighborhoods now sit largely empty, while many, especially in the northern suburbs of the archdiocese, are overflowing.
 Nativity is a clear example of what has happened. According to the archdiocese's numbers, the church attracts fewer than 350 people for weekend Mass. The average crowd at a weekday Mass is five people, who worship in a tiny room that doubles as a chapel so the church does not have to heat the sanctuary. A staff of four has dwindled to one.
 ''Every year, I have more work and less help,'' Father Gannon said.
 Nativity's demise has long been on the horizon, with rising rents and gentrification inexorably leaving its imprint.
 ''It used to be full, basically,'' said Roberto Rodriguez, 31, whose family moved to the neighborhood from the Dominican Republic nearly two decades ago and started attending the church. ''Little by little the neighborhood kept changing and changing and the people kept disappearing.''
 Church officials said that their success had been limited in attracting the newer residents of the East Village.
 The parish was created in 1842 by the archdiocese to accommodate Irish immigrants pouring into the area. When the Jesuits took it over 90 years ago, they served a wave of Italian immigrants. 
 The 1950's brought another shift, with an influx of Puerto Ricans. Then came the Dominicans, and later a small but significant number of Mexicans. Today, the church is 70 percent Hispanic.
 The first parishioners worshiped in an ornate Greek Revival structure, built in 1832, that the archdiocese bought from a Presbyterian church.
 In the 1960's, however, that building was condemned. After some uncertainty, members of the parish rallied to build a new church, mostly with their own money. 
 ''We are not shopping for a Cadillac, but a building that is functional, economical and simple,'' the parish council wrote, according to a parish history that was published in 1971. ''It is being built solely for the religious and social needs of the people.'' 
 Parishioners eventually collected enough money to commission a bare-bones building that has served the church for 37 years. 
 The parish's main claim to fame today is that Dorothy Day, the writer and social worker who founded the Catholic Worker movement, worshiped there for decades. 
 ''I can remember coming to our Masses and being struck, there she was, an icon, just a few rows away from me,'' said the Rev. George M. Anderson, a Jesuit priest who lives in the church's rectory and is an associate editor for America magazine. 
 Over the last decade, it has become increasingly clear, he said, that the area was changing and that did not necessarily bode well for the church.
 ''Young people were moving in with good salaries,'' he said. ''Landlords began raising rents. We lost a lot of parishioners who were low income.''
 Father Gannon, who has been at the church for 14 years, said he began to get hints as early as 2001 from the archdiocese that the parish might be in danger. Over time, the hints grew more obvious.
 ''I have begun every year for four years convinced this was the last year,'' he said. 
 Last year, a group of parishioners began meeting to discuss what they might do about the church's fate. They wanted to avoid members being taken by surprise. 
 Some parishioners vowed to fight any decision to close their church. Others said they should simply pray and hope for the best. Still others wanted to be proactive and sought out developers who might buy the church but give the parishioners a small place to continue to meet. They were told by the archdiocese that they did not have the authority to negotiate with developers. 
 All the talk and venting has helped, Mr. Rodriguez said. ''We got ourselves ready.''
 Father Gannon began meeting with the pastor of Holy Redeemer, a nearby church where many of Nativity's members could wind up going if the church closes, to make a possible transition go smoothly.
 Even so, yesterday's news came as a shock to many. At the church's evening Mass, Father Gannon broke the news to six parishioners in the chapel. He said they should remember that God ''always accompanies us'' through hard times.
 Later, the parishioners prayed out loud. ''I pray that we can find signs of hope at this time,'' one said.
 Everyone in the room repeated the refrain: ''Lord, hear our prayer.''

HEADLINE: With Ink Not Yet Dry on Budget, Pataki Aides Assail the Legislature's Plan

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM; Jennifer Medina contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 29 

 BODY:
Setting off a fresh round of skirmishing over the budget on Wednesday, Gov. George E. Pataki's staff claimed that the Legislature's new budget understates spending by as much as $2.6 billion and would create deficits totaling at least $10 billion over the next two years.
 As if that were not enough, the governor's staff and the Legislature continue to squabble over whether the Legislature actually met the midnight Tuesday deadline for having their budget agreement printed in time for lawmakers to vote on it by Friday. 
But the Pataki administration's criticisms focused mainly on Medicaid, the program that has increasingly accounted for the state's growth in spending. 
 ''The Legislature's rejection of the governor's sensible reforms in Medicaid are driving much of the increase in both spending in the proposed budget and the increase in the out-year gaps,'' said John F. Cape, Mr. Pataki's budget director. 
 Legislative leaders have a dim view of Mr. Cape; the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican, said last week that the budget division ''ought to go back to kindergarten and learn how to count.''
 On Wednesday, Mr. Bruno's spokesman, John McArdle, said, ''This is the same budget division that has been wrong every year on its projections of the deficits and on its projections of revenue.''
 There are certainly wide differences in the $110.6 billion budget Mr. Pataki proposed in January and the budget that the Legislature agreed to on Tuesday night. For starters, the sides do not even agree on the math. The Legislature said its budget totaled $112.4 billion, but Mr. Cape said it was between $114 billion and $115 billion. 
 On Wednesday, some financial analysts were already groaning about the Legislature's budget, which would use a $2 billion to $4.5 billion surplus, and plenty of new debt, to ramp up spending and roll out $4.1 billion worth of tax cuts over the next two years. The plan would also authorize $11.2 billion, through complex bond deals, for construction of New York City schools.
 ''They're leaving the next governor with an exploding cigar,'' said E. J. McMahon, a budget expert at the conservative Manhattan Institute. 
 But Frank Mauro, executive director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a liberal watchdog group, said the Legislature was right ''not to accept the governor's cuts in programs for the neediest.'' He added, however, that nearly $1.8 billion worth of property tax cuts should be aimed at ''the people who are truly burdened.''
 Among the governor's major concerns, beyond the size of the Legislature's budget, is that the Republican-led Senate and the Democratic-controlled Assembly failed to reach a deal on the structure of a new Medicaid fraud office and are rejecting most of his cuts to Medicaid, which is by far the largest portion of the budget, at nearly $46 billion. 
 The governor's staff also expressed concern that the Legislature was rejecting Mr. Pataki's plan to increase cigarette taxes, which provide money for a variety of health care initiatives through the Health Care Reform Act, known as H.C.R.A. 
 That program would be ''completely underfinanced'' in the Legislature's proposal, said Michael Marr, a spokesman for the governor's budget division. ''The governor's budget put H.C.R.A. on a very firm fiscal foundation,'' Mr. Marr said. ''There were only one or two years between now and 2014 where H.C.R.A. would have run a deficit.'' 
 Mr. McArdle, the spokesman for Mr. Bruno, said ''there are plenty of other options besides new taxes to pay for health care.''
 One, he said, is the future conversion of public health insurers, like the Health Insurance Plan of New York, into profit-making companies. But the Legislature did not come to an agreement on the governor's plan to allow future conversions.
 Other significant issues include renegotiating the governor's proposal to exert broad control over the disbursement of federal money for needy families and for environmental protection. 
 The sides also have to negotiate their very different plans for school financing and their multibillion-dollar tax packages, though there are areas of agreement, including eliminating the so-called marriage penalty, which can make it expensive for couples living together to marry, and support of broad property tax relief. But the Legislature rejected the governor's plan to link a new child tax credit to education, an issue legislative aides expect to be a point of contention.
 Though the state's fiscal year ends on Friday, the two sides have a 10-day window to renegotiate in early April. The governor can veto individual budget items, and the Legislature can override any vetoes with a two-thirds vote.
 The budget agreement also included $33 million for the Atlantic Yards project in Brooklyn, and $60 million for Yonkers that can be used to help close a roughly $100 million budget gap. 
 Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, the Democrat who has a commanding lead in the polls to succeed Mr. Pataki as governor, said on Wednesday that he was ''wary about the degree to which spending is being increased at some levels, but I don't want to comment specifically until I see it.''
 Thomas R. Suozzi, the Nassau County executive, who is challenging Mr. Spitzer for the Democratic nomination for governor, had a less measured response. ''It is fiscally irresponsible to be advancing these agendas without commensurate cost reduction in Medicaid and other programs that are burdened by waste, fraud and abuse,'' he said.
 ''My opponent will not criticize this budget as strongly because he is part of the system that created it and he will not cross swords with the speaker of the Assembly and his other friends in Albany.''

HEADLINE: It's Porkball For Yankees And the Bronx

BYLINE: By JOYCE PURNICK. 
E-mail: purnick@nytimes.com

 BODY:
WELL into a City Council hearing this week on the proposal for a new Yankee Stadium, one of the lawmakers recalled why he and his colleagues were there in the first place. ''The name of this here issue is not black, not white, it's green,'' said the councilman, Thomas White Jr. of Queens.
 At least someone in that Council chamber got it right. For most of the afternoon on Tuesday, the long, emotional hearing resembled more of an encounter group than a legislative session. 
It got so heated that it was often hard to figure out exactly what Council critics of the team's plan really wanted, so avidly did they take advantage of the setting to rail at the Yankees.
 ''You're smiling as if you hit a home run, but from where I sit, it is a foul ball,'' Councilwoman Helen Diane Foster of the Bronx told Reggie Jackson, a special Yankees adviser who testified in support of the team's plan for a new $800 million stadium.
 Councilman Charles Barron of Brooklyn, the former Black Panther, dropped in long enough to deliver one of his familiar diatribes. ''This is not about baseball, this is about trust,'' Mr. Barron said, asking the team president, Randy Levine, how many ''people of color'' held decision-making jobs with the Yankees but cutting him off before he could fully answer.
 It kept on like that for hours -- pointed exchange after pointed exchange, with attempts at peacemaking mixed in. ''I'm for people of color, I'm a man of color,'' Mr. Jackson said, offering to help the Bronx community deal with the Yankees and its mercurial principal owner, George Steinbrenner. ''I'm at your service,'' he said, exchanging business cards with Ms. Foster.
 Shortly after that touching moment, Councilman White made his reference to greenery -- the financial kind, because this is a development project, after all. The Bloomberg administration and the Bronx borough president, Adolfo Carrion Jr., pronounce it a good deal, while Council critics -- probably not enough of them to stop the project in a vote next week -- disagree.
 Lawmakers could have examined basic issues on Tuesday, but emotions got in the way. At times, it seemed as if the baseball team had become the convenient target for anger and frustration about fundamental problems that still plague the Bronx.
 DESPITE improvements in recent years, the borough is still, as Bronx lawmakers kept saying, troubled by high rates of poverty, unemployment and poor health.
 Surely not even the harshest of the Yankees' detractors could think that a baseball team has the ability to eradicate poverty and urban disease, although the team is an oasis of wealth, celebrity and power, and Mr. Steinbrenner has a history of playing hard and fast with the city. The result is resentment.
 But there are some obvious concerns, though not examined in any depth. Council critics of the plan want the Metro-North station renovated to discourage driving and favor creating fewer parking spaces (though the stadium neighborhood is flooded with cars on game days right now). 
 They also want more parkland to compensate for the 22 acres that would go to the new stadium, and more job guarantees. The team has committed to making sure that at least a quarter of the plan's construction jobs and new permanent jobs go to Bronx residents.
 There is another avenue of suspicion, unexplored on Tuesday but discussed plenty around City Hall: the Yankee plan for community resources, specifically how they will be distributed, and to whom. 
 The team would provide, in each of 40 years, $700,000 in cash grants for community organizations, $100,000 for maintenance of parks in the stadium area, $100,000 worth of equipment for youth and sports groups, and 15,000 Yankee tickets for the community.
 A nonprofit group headed by a ''person of stature,'' as Mr. Levine put it, would determine who gets the team's largess. The group would be made up of people selected by the Yankees and Bronx elected officials. 
 To help sell the city on its stadium plan, the Yankees felt compelled to hire the lawyer for the Bronx Democratic organization, Stanley K. Schlein, and a consulting group headed by the former Bronx Democratic leader, Roberto Ramirez. So there is some understandable concern around town, not just in the Bronx -- about what would, if it were government money, be called pork.
 As the councilman said, the name of the issue is green, even if reduced to the inevitable black and white.

HEADLINE: China Is Told of U.S. Impatience on Trade

BYLINE: By DAVID LAGUE; Edmund L. Andrews contributed reporting from Washington for this article.

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 29 

 BODY:
The rise of protectionist sentiment in the United States over a $202 billion trade deficit with China could hurt the Chinese economy, Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez said Wednesday. 
 Mr. Gutierrez said at a business forum here that protectionist measures could lead to a decline in Chinese exports to the United States, its biggest international customer. 
That would hurt the United States, but be even more damaging for China, he said. 
 Mr. Gutierrez said China could help the Bush administration counter that threat with improved market access for United States products and stricter enforcement of intellectual property rights. 
 He acknowledged that Chinese tariffs had fallen since the country's entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001, but he said a wide array of barriers remained that restricted sales of products from companies in the United States and other foreign countries. 
 ''It is important for our colleagues in China to realize that the voices in the U.S. calling for protectionist policies are very real,'' he said. Mr. Gutierrez was on the last day of a four-day visit to China. 
 While Mr. Gutierrez was in Beijing for trade talks, one looming threat to its exports to the United States appeared to have eased. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, delayed plans for a bill that would have threatened steep tariffs on Chinese imports if Chinese leaders refused to let their currency, the yuan, rise in value against the dollar. 
 The senators said they had become more optimistic as a result of their trip to China last week when Chinese officials emphasized their willingness to let the yuan float more freely and to address other aspects of their country's growing trade deficit with the United States. 
 Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa and Senator Max Baucus of Montana, respectively the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, are pushing a separate bill that would focus more attention on currency policies but would stop short of threatening tariffs on imported goods. 
 Mr. Gutierrez, in earlier talks with senior Chinese officials, including Prime Minister Wen Jiabao; the vice prime minister, Wu Yi; and the commerce minister, Bo Xilai, urged China to accelerate moves to open its markets. 
 In a statement posted on the Web site of the Commerce Ministry, Mr. Bo said ''global economic trends,'' not Beijing, were to blame for the deficit. 
 He also said that United States consumers enjoyed the benefits of cheap high-quality goods from China. 
 The Bush administration is pushing China to make tangible progress on market access at the next meeting of the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade, to be held in Washington on April 11. 
 The outcome of the talks could set the tone for President Hu Jintao's visit to the United States later in April, according to United States and Chinese officials. 
 Mr. Gutierrez did not publicly raise concerns about the value of the yuan, in keeping with a longstanding policy that only Treasury officials deal with currency issues.

HEADLINE: Chief of Staff Is Expected To Shake Up 2 Key Teams 

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29 

 BODY:
Joshua B. Bolten, the incoming White House chief of staff, is expected to press President Bush to assemble new economic and Congressional relations teams and overhaul the management of the West Wing, Republicans close to the White House said Wednesday.
 A prominent Republican in Washington who consults often with the White House said Mr. Bolten, who is to assume his duties next month, wants Mr. Bush to replace the Treasury secretary, John W. Snow, with someone who can more forcefully communicate the administration's message that the economy is strong. This Republican was granted anonymity to discuss private deliberations within the administration. 
Speculation about Mr. Snow's departure has flared and receded periodically for more than a year, and it returned after Mr. Bush's announcement on Tuesday that Mr. Bolten, the White House budget director, would succeed Andrew H. Card Jr. as chief of staff.
 Names circulating in Republican circles as possible candidates for the Treasury post included Henry M. Paulson Jr., the chief executive of Goldman Sachs; John J. Mack, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley; and Richard D. Parsons, the chairman of Time Warner.
 It was unclear if any of the three would consider taking the job. Their names surfaced immediately after Mr. Bolten's appointment because Mr. Bolten, who once worked for Goldman Sachs, is friendly with Mr. Paulson and Mr. Mack. Karl Rove, the president's chief political adviser, is said to think highly of Mr. Parsons, who has worked with the White House on several issues, including its efforts to overhaul Social Security.
 Republicans said that if Mr. Bush turned to Wall Street for a new Treasury secretary, it could help reassure financial markets, which are increasingly worried about record-high budget and trade deficits.
 Mr. Snow's spokesman, Tony Fratto, declined to comment Wednesday night about the speculation, but said Mr. Snow was continuing with plans to be the host of a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of 7 industrialized democracies next month in Washington.
 Dan Bartlett, the White House counselor, also declined to comment on the speculation, but said Mr. Bolten had a free hand to make changes.
 ''The president has given Josh, as he would have any chief of staff, the authority to run the White House as he sees fit,'' Mr. Bartlett said.
 Nonetheless, Mr. Bartlett added: ''I don't think Josh is entering this transition period with firm judgments. He's going to take a fresh assessment and do what he thinks is right to accomplish his goals. While Josh and Andy are very close and have worked together, they're different people and have different management styles.''
 Republicans said Mr. Bolten was likely to change the White House Congressional relations team, which has been criticized on Capitol Hill as ineffective. Candida Wolff, the White House director of Congressional affairs, may well stay, they said, but a more senior person might be put in as a layer above her.
 Ms. Wolff is well liked at the White House, but one Republican said she had been undercut by Mr. Rove, Mr. Bartlett and Mr. Card, who were in effect all masters of their own Congressional relations.
 People mentioned as possibilities for such a liaison post included Bill Paxon, a former New York congressman who was a lieutenant to Newt Gingrich, the former House majority leader, in the 1990's, and Daniel R. Coats, a former Republican senator from Indiana and guide for Harriet E. Miers and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. through the Supreme Court confirmation process.
 The most immediate change, Republicans said, would be a budget director to replace Mr. Bolten. The leading possibilities included Joel Kaplan and Clay Johnson, Mr. Bolten's two deputies, as well as Allan Hubbard, the director of the National Economic Council.
 Republicans said Mr. Bush had not ruled out bringing in an experienced Washington hand to help calm Congressional Republicans who have complained with increasing boldness and exasperation that the White House staff is exhausted and adrift. While Mr. Bolten's appointment was generally well received by the party, many Republicans said on Wednesday that the staff changes did not go far enough.
 Mr. Bush was described as paying close heed to such advice.
 ''What I've been hearing for several weeks is that he was listening and he wasn't being impatient about it,'' said a Republican who speaks regularly to senior White House officials. ''You know how he is, somebody presents an idea; he says, 'No, not doing that, next question.' But he was not like that, so that means he was at least digesting some of the advice suggesting change.''

HEADLINE: Hastert Hints at Compromise on Immigration Bill

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29 

 BODY:
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert said Wednesday that he and other House Republicans recognized the need for a guest-worker program, opening the door to a possible compromise with the Senate on fiercely debated immigration legislation. 
 ''We're going to look at all alternatives,'' Mr. Hastert, an Illinois Republican, said at a news conference. ''We're not going to discount anything right now. Our first priority is to protect the border. And we also know there is a need in some sections of the economy for a guest-worker program.''
Many House Republicans and conservatives in the Senate still oppose any legislation that would grant citizenship to illegal immigrants, like the bill passed by the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday. And as the Senate began its debate on immigration on Wednesday, Republicans were deeply divided over the fate of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States. 
 Mr. Hastert's comments were the first public hint of an olive branch.
 Senator Arlen Specter, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said he was heartened by the remarks. He said they were a significant shift for the House, which defied President Bush's call for a temporary-worker program and passed a border security bill in December that would criminalize illegal immigrants.
 Since then, Mr. Bush and business groups have urged Republicans to support a temporary-worker program to help fulfill the economy's needs for labor.
 ''I'm very pleased that Speaker Hastert has demonstrated flexibility on that issue,'' Mr. Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican, said, adding that he was prepared to support a compromise that would not provide a path to citizenship for all illegal immigrants in an effort ''to present an even more balanced approach.''
 On Monday, before his committee voted, Mr. Specter proposed a compromise that would require illegal immigrants to return home briefly after spending six more years in this country. They could then participate in a temporary-worker program or move toward citizenship if they are highly skilled, hold supervisory positions or have a close relative who is a citizen or permanent resident. 
 Mr. Specter and his committee ultimately voted for the legislation that would grant all illegal immigrants the possibility of citizenship.

HEADLINE: Study Backs Equal Coverage For Mental Ills

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29 

 BODY:
Providing insurance coverage for mental illness equal to that for physical illness does not drive up the cost of mental health care as many insurers feared, a new study of health benefits for federal employees says.
 President Bill Clinton ordered such equal coverage for federal workers in 1999, and the changes took effect in 2001. Under the policy, known as parity, insurers were forbidden to charge higher co-payments or impose stricter limits on psychiatric care or treatment for alcohol and drug abuse.
 The new study of those changes, being published Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine, concludes that if mental health care is properly managed, expanding the coverage of it ''can improve insurance protection without increasing total costs'' beyond those paid by insurers that do not offer parity. 
 Providing equal coverage for treatment of mental disorders did not increase the use of mental health services under the federal employee program, the researchers said. But it did lead to ''significant reductions in out-of-pocket spending'' for many government workers and retirees.
 A co-author of the study, Richard G. Frank, professor of health economics at Harvard, said, ''The big winners, in terms of reduced out-of-pocket spending, were the sickest patients, including those who needed hospital care.''
 In the past, a federal employee often had to pay 30 percent to 40 percent of the cost of a hospital stay for a mental illness like major depression. With parity, the patient did not have to pay any of the cost, saving $300 to $400 a day in a hospital that charged $1,000 a day.
 Dr. Howard H. Goldman, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Maryland, who led the research team, said insurers had borne slightly more of the costs after the adoption of mental health parity. 
 The researchers said they did not know whether any of those costs had been passed on to subscribers, in the form of higher premiums. But ''even if the full cost of the new requirement was passed on to subscribers,'' he said, ''the impact on premiums would be very small, probably less than half a percentage point.''
 Psychiatrists, psychologists, patients and their advocates have tried for decades to eliminate disparities in insurance coverage for mental and physical illnesses. Under the change ordered by Mr. Clinton to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, coverage must be ''identical with regard to traditional medical care deductibles, coinsurance, co-payments'' and limits on hospital stays and doctor visits.
 The new study tried to measure the effect of Mr. Clinton's order by comparing the claims experience of seven health insurance plans within the federal program and several health plans offered by large private employers that did not provide parity. The researchers found increased use of mental health services, and increased spending for mental health care, under both types of insurance. The increase for federal employees was similar to that for the private-sector workers, and was not attributable to the requirement for parity, the study found.
 Amanda L. Austin of the National Federation of Independent Business, a trade group for small businesses, said the experience of the federal program was not necessarily relevant to them.
 Fewer than half the federation's 600,000 companies offer health insurance to their employees, and ''the No. 1 reason is cost,'' Ms. Austin said. ''The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, with a pool of nearly nine million members, is very different from the type of insurance plans available to a small business with three employees.''

HEADLINE: Nasdaq Reaches 5-Year High in a Broad Market Rally

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks staged a broad rebound yesterday, with gains in Google and Apple Computer leading a rally in tech shares that drove the Nasdaq to a five-year high. 
 All major industry sectors rose on the day. 
Blue chips were lifted by Boeing, which received a $2 billion jet order. 
 Yesterday's gains helped the market recover from losses incurred Tuesday after the Fed increased interest rates and suggested that more could be needed to stem inflation. 
 ''If the economy is as strong as the Fed is worried about, that's going to mean better corporate earnings,'' said John Augustine, chief investment strategist at Fifth Third Asset Management. 
 ''The driver is rotating from front-end consumer to back-end business spending. And business spending is being driven by the need to continually improve productivity, which brings in tech spending.'' 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 61.16 points, or 0.55 percent, to 11,215.70. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 9.66 points, or 0.75 percent, to 1,302.89. The Nasdaq composite index was up 33.32 points, or 1.45 percent, at 2,337.78. 
 Shares of Apple Computer gained 6.2 percent as its rival, Microsoft, faced new pressure from the European Union's top antitrust body, which is raising concerns about the company's new Windows operating system, Vista. Apple rose $3.62, to $62.33. 
 Shares in Google rose 4.7 percent as index fund managers scrambled to buy shares before it joins the S.& P. 500 after the close of trading on Friday. Google closed at $394.98, up $17.78. 
 Shares of Qualcomm also helped the Nasdaq. Cowen & Company gave outperform ratings to Qualcomm and other wireless technology companies, including Motorola, and said this year's outlook for the global handset market was positive. 
 Qualcomm rose $1.36, or 2.8 percent, to $50.72, on Nasdaq, while Motorola gained 83 cents, or 3.8 percent, to $22.77, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Boeing led the Dow's advance, helped by news that GE Commercial Aviation Services, one of the world's largest aircraft lessors, had agreed to buy 30 of Boeing's 737 passenger jets in an order worth about $2 billion. Boeing's shares climbed $1.67, or 2.2 percent, to $79.18. 
 Shares of 3M rose $1.26, or 1.7 percent, to $77.56. 
 Shares of Maytag rose after antitrust authorities in the United States said they had approved its acquisition by Whirlpool. Maytag surged $4.73, or 27.7 percent, to $21.81, while Whirlpool gained $6.38, or 7.1 percent, to $95.95. 
 The yield of the 10-year Treasury bill rose to 4.80 percent, from 4.78 percent yesterday. The price, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, declined 6/32, to 98 20/32.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of five-year Treasury bills:



 (000 omitted in dollar figures)	 	Price	99.845	High Yield	4.785	Low Yield	4.707	Median Yield	4.761	Total applied for	$35,055,123	Accepted	$17,500,211	Noncompetitive	$156,123	Interest set at	4.75	The five-year notes mature March 31, 2011.

Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 279-4200.

'THE THREEPENNY OPERA' Opens April 20. If any Broadway theater was made for a revival of Brecht's classic, it's the cabaret-style Studio 54, which will be host to an intriguing cast that includes Alan Cumming and Cyndi Lauper (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300.

'LESTAT' Opens April 25. Elton John and Bernie Taupin have a good track record making pop hits, but can they find success in the cursed genre of the vampire musical? Hugh Panaro stars (2:30). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, (212) 307-4100.

Broadway

'BAREFOOT IN THE PARK' For a work that celebrates the liberating force of spontaneity, this revival of Neil Simon's 1963 comedy doesn't have one scene that feels organic, let alone impromptu. Directed by Scott Elliott, and starring Patrick Wilson and a miscast Amanda Peet as newlyweds in Greenwich Village, this ''Barefoot'' has the robotic gait of Frankenstein's monster (2:20). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)

* 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)

'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this drama by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

* 'THE PAJAMA GAME' Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)

* 'RABBIT HOLE' Thanks to a certain former American president, it has become almost impossible to say that you feel someone else's pain without its sounding like a punch line. Yet the sad, sweet release of David Lindsay-Abaire's wrenching play, about the impact of the death of a small child, lies precisely in the access it allows to the pain of others, in its meticulously mapped empathy. With an emotionally transparent five-member cast led by Cynthia Nixon and Tyne Daly, directed by Daniel Sullivan, this anatomy of grief doesn't so much jerk tears as tap them (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'RING OF FIRE' The man in black turns sunshine yellow in a show that strings songs associated with Johnny Cash into a big, bright candy necklace of a musical revue, created and directed by Richard Maltby Jr. In the current bio-flick ''Walk the Line,'' Cash wrestles demons; ''Ring of Fire'' wrestles with a really bad case of the cutes (2:00). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

Off Broadway

* 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)

'BERNARDA ALBA' Michael John LaChiusa's musical adaptation of Federico Garcia Lorca's tragedy of sexual repression often feels wan and weary, though not for want of erotic imagery. The ominous, oppressive atmosphere that makes Lorca's play so much more than a potboiler is mostly missing in inaction. Graciela Daniele directs a game ensemble led by a miscast Phylicia Rashad (1:30). Mitzi Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'CONFESSIONS OF A MORMON BOY' Steven Fales, a sixth-generation Mormon, describes leaving his family and becoming a gay escort in this fairly conventional, although admittedly compelling, piece of confessional theater (1:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Jason Zinoman)

* 'CYCLONE' Some skilled actors have a fine time with Ron Fitzgerald's black comedy about a young man (Hamish Linklater) who is wandering around New Jersey, carrying his father's ashes. James Hendricks, playing his neighbor, has a second-act monologue that deserves some kind of award. (2:15) Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger)

'DEFIANCE' The second play in John Patrick Shanley's cycle of morality dramas that began with ''Doubt,'' this ambitious tale of racial relations and the military mindset on a North Carolina marine base feels both overcrowded and oddly diffuse. If ''Doubt'' has an elegant and energy-efficient sprinter's gait, ''Defiance'' progresses with a flustered air of distraction. The excellent Margaret Colin, as an officer's wife, provides a welcome shot of credibility (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)

'ENTERTAINING MR. SLOANE' Miscasting is the mother of invention. Or so it proves to be for Jan Maxwell, who retailors an ill-fitting part and makes it as snug as a glove in this underpowered revival of Joe Orton's scandalous 1964 comedy. Scott Ellis's production of Orton's great farce of sexual hypocrisy, which also stars Alec Baldwin, is breezy, often funny and rarely convincing. (2:00). Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)

'FAMILY SECRETS' Performing old jokes with meticulous detail, Sherry Glaser in her solo show brings to life three generations of a Jewish family (1:30). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Zinoman)

'FAHRENHEIT 451' A visceral version of Ray Bradbury's 1953 novel, staged by the Godlight Theater Company. No, firefighters don't burn books these days, but still you end up saying, ''Dang, that man had vision.'' (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Genzlinger)

'FRAGMENT' Pavol Liska directs this assemblage of fragments from the lost works of Sophocles and Euripides, an ambitious venture featuring fine performances from Zachary Oberzan, Tony Torn and Juliana Francis. (1:15). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 677-4210.(George Hunka)

'GEORGE M. COHAN TONIGHT!' The all-singing, all-dancing Jon Peterson summons the spirit of this legendary Broadway entertainer in this engaging one-man musical, devised and directed by Chip Deffaa (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Hunka)

'GREY GARDENS' As the socialite in limbo called ''Little'' Edie Beale, Christine Ebersole gives one of the most gorgeous performances ever to grace a musical. Unfortunately, she's a pearl of incalculable price in a show that is mostly costume jewelry. Adapted from the Maysles brothers' 1975 cult documentary movie, a camp favorite, and directed by Michael Greif, with the excellent Mary Louise Wilson as Edie's bedridden mother (2:40). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)

* 'I LOVE YOU BECAUSE' The plot line -- single New Yorkers in search of love -- couldn't be more familiar, but somehow this fluffy, funny musical makes it refreshing, helped along by an engaging six-member cast, with David A. Austin making a particularly hilarious impression. An impressive start for Ryan Cunningham (book and lyrics) and Joshua Salzman (music), both still in their 20's (2:00). Village Theater, 158 Bleecker Street, near Sullivan Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100. (Genzlinger)

'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best. (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

* 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'Living Room in Africa' Bathsheba Doran's play, presented by the Edge Theater, is the disturbing but somewhat simplistic story of an English couple's attempt to start an art gallery in a remote region in Africa -- only to discover that AIDS has gotten there first (1:45). Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Phoebe Hoban)

'MEASURE FOR MEASURE' A solid revival of one of Shakespeare's problem plays in which the director Beatrice Terry has opted to emphasize the humor, especially in the scenes of comic relief. A staging with handsome costumes and that for the most part boasts a fine cast, whose members have made some smart choices (2:30). Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Wilborn Hampton)

'mercy on the doorstep' Religious faith faces down the allied forces of alcoholism and cynicism in Gip Hoppe's drama. Laura Esterman is terrific as a gleefully unreformed libertine whose stepdaughter has found God and come to share the good news. The play itself is mostly bad news, unfortunately: meandering, repetitive and lacking in nuance (1:45). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood)

'THE PROPERTY KNOWN AS GARLAND' Adrienne Barbeau as Judy, backstage on the night of her last concert in Copenhagen. Billy Van Zandt's play is tawdry and dull, and Ms. Barbeau's performance offers neither the minor rewards of a decent impersonation nor the guilty pleasures of an indecent one. (1:30). The Actors Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'RED LIGHT WINTER' A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

* '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to the classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 353-0303. (Isherwood)

* 'TRANSATLANTIC LIAISON' A play fashioned from Simone de Beauvoir's love letters to the American novelist Nelson Algren and scenes from her novel ''The Mandarins'' (which tells the story of their affair). Wonderful performances by Elizabeth Rothan as de Beauvoir in love, and Matthew S. Tompkins as the emotional Algren (1:30). Harold Clurman Theater on Theater Row, 412 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Honor Moore)

'TRIAL BY WATER' Qui Nguyen, raising worthwhile questions about how to live a humane and moral life in the real world, has based his play on the experiences of a cousin who survived a voyage of Vietnamese refugees in the South China Sea that ended in murder and cannibalism. Though the actors are not able to surmount the play's unfortunate didacticism and melodrama, Clint Ramos's stunning wooden set does. (1:30). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Andrea Stevens)

'WALK THE MOUNTAIN' Jude Narita's one-woman show ''Walk the Mountain,'' about the hellish effects of the Vietnam War, offers nuanced accounts rather than a mere litany of horrors. (1:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200.(Laura Weinert)

Off Off Broadway

'BACK OF THE THROAT' An Arab-American playwright (Yussef El Guindi) addressing the harassment of Arab-Americans after 9/11? Interesting. But the play would have been even more interesting if the harassers were something other than cardboard characters out of the J. Edgar Hoover closet (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger)

'BURIED CHILD' Tom Herman's revival makes something known new by revealing how close Sam Shepard's play about a dysfunctional Midwest family is to tragic opera, speechlike arias included. The Michael Chekhov Theater Company is presenting 45 Shepard plays, and this first effort sounds a positive note. (2:30) Big Little Theater, 141 Ridge Street, near Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212) 868-4444. (Stevens)

'33 TO NOTHING' A band break up while playing break-up music in Grant James Varjas's comic, sometimes poignant play. Music performed by the actors. Argo Theater Company, at the Bottle Factory Theater, 195 East Third Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Gwen Orel)

* 'SHILOH RULES' An inventive play by Doris Baizley gets excellent treatment by the cast of six actresses. The story is set not at the Civil War Battle of Shiloh, but at a modern-day re-enactment, and by the time it's through, Ms. Baizley has served up a lot of humor and some drama, history and first-aid lessons as well. (2:05) Gene Frankel Theater, 24 Bond Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger)

* 'ZOMBOID! (FILM/PERFORMANCe PROJECT #1)' O, the heresy of it! Richard Foreman has introduced film into the realm of exquisitely artificial, abstract theater in which he has specialized for four decades. As it turns out, juxtaposing two art forms allows Mr. Foreman to underscore in resonant new ways what he has been saying for years: reality is, well, relative. And he continues to work in a style guaranteed to infect your perceptions for hours after (1:15). Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)

Long-Running Shows

* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)

'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

Last Chance

'CHRISTINE JORGENSON REVEALS' Bradford Louryk meticulously lip-syncs a fascinating hourlong interview about gender and sexuality with Ms. Jorgenson, whose sex-change operation in the 1950's was big news (1:00). The Studio Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closing Saturday. (Zinoman)

'SOLDIER'S WIFE' When this play first opened on Broadway, World War II was shuddering to a close, and those on the home front wanted to feel good. Despite flaws in the work, the Mint Theater Company's revival of Rose Franken's 1944 comedy is highly entertaining (2:00). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231; closing Sunday. (Moore)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

'AQUAMARINE' (PG, 109 minutes) In this sweet comedy for the crowd that has outgrown ''The Little Mermaid,'' two likable pals (Emma Roberts and Joanna Levesque, a k a the singer JoJo) try to help a mermaid (Sara Paxton) find love and learn how to use her feet properly.(Neil Genzlinger)

'Ask the Dust' (R, 117 minutes) A story about being young and hungry -- for fame, for women, for food -- in Los Angeles during the 1930's. Robert Towne wrote and directed this adaptation of the John Fante novel, and Colin Farrell and Salma Hayek star. (Manohla Dargis)

* 'THE BEAUTY ACADEMY OF KABUL' (No rating, 74 minutes, in English and Dari) In the summer of 2004, a group of volunteer American hairstylists arrived in Kabul to open a school. In ''The Beauty Academy of Kabul,'' the director Liz Mermin documents the hilarious, moving and sometimes fractious meeting of diametrically different cultures, one having suffered unimaginable horrors and the other believing a good perm is the answer to everything. (Jeannette Catsoulis)

* 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. (Mr. Lee won the Academy Award for best director.) Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Stephen Holden)

* 'CAPOTE' (R, 114 minutes) Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is a tour de force of psychological insight. (Mr. Hoffman won the Academy Award for best actor.) Following the novelist as he works on the magazine assignment that will become ''In Cold Blood,'' the film raises intriguing questions about the ethics of writing. (A. O. Scott)

'CRASH' (Academy Award, Best Picture) (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well intentioned, impressively acted but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott)

'DAVE CHAPPELLE'S BLOCK PARTY' (R, 103 minutes) The setup is blissfully simple: a free block party on a dead-end street in Bed-Stuy, with a lineup of musicians, some of whom, like Kanye West and Mos Def, have put in appearances on ''Chappelle's Show.'' The nominal idea, Mr. Chappelle explains on camera, was ''the concert I've always wanted to see.'' The result, which ping-pongs between Brooklyn and Mr. Chappelle's hometown in Ohio, is a tantalizing sketch-portrait of the artist amid an outpouring of hard beats and soul. (Dargis)

* 'DON'T COME KNOCKING' (R, 122 minutes) The visually majestic but dramatically inert reunion of Sam Shepard (who stars) and the director Wim Wenders, 22 years after their auspicious collaboration on ''Paris, Texas,'' might be described as a magnificent ruin. (Holden)

* 'FIND ME GUILTY' (R, 124 minutes) This gripping courtroom drama, directed by Sidney Lumet, now 81 and near the top of his game, is based on the 1987-88 trial of 20 members of the New Jersey-based Lucchese crime family on multiple counts. Vin Diesel turns in a sensational performance as Giacomo DiNorscio, better known as Jackie Dee, who broke from the ranks of his fellow defendants to be his own defense lawyer. (Holden)

* 'INSIDE MAN' (R, 128 minutes) The latest from Spike Lee takes a familiar setup -- in this case, a Wall Street bank heist that mutates into a hostage crisis -- and twists it ever so slightly and nicely. Among the film's most sustained pleasures are its holy trinity -- Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster -- and the best lineup of pusses and mugs outside ''The Sopranos.'' (Dargis)

'LARRY THE CABLE GUY: HEALTH INSPECTOR' (PG-13, 89 minutes) Making his feature film debut, the blue-collar comedian known as Larry the Cable Guy (real name: Daniel Whitney) plays an unorthodox health inspector who is dispatched to investigate a series of food poisonings at upscale restaurants. Unpleasant, uncouth and painfully unfunny, ''Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector'' pursues its flatulence-based goals with a relentlessness that makes ''Dumb and Dumber'' seem the epitome of sophistication. (Catsoulis)

* 'L'ENFANT (THE CHILD)' (R, 100 minutes, in French) The latest from the Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne involves a young thief (Jeremie Renier) who one day sells his newborn son for a fat envelope of cash. What interests the Dardennes -- what invests their work with such terrific urgency -- is not only how a man would sell a child as casually as a slab of beef, but also whether a man like this, having committed such a repellent offense, can find redemption. (Dargis)

'LONESOME JIM' (R, 91 minutes) Steve Buscemi directed this deadpan comedy about a depressed 27-year-old writer (Casey Affleck) who returns from New York in defeat to his childhood home in rural Indiana and takes a job in his parents' ladder factory. (Holden)

'MARDI GRAS: MADE IN CHINA' (No rating, 74 minutes, in English, Mandarin and Fujian) A startling look at both the effects of globalization and a dramatic cultural divide among youth, David Redmon's documentary contrasts the lives of indulgent Americans intent on having a good time in New Orleans and hard-working Chinese factory workers who slave away to manufacture those brightly colored beads so fundamental to the Mardi Gras festivities. (Laura Kern)

* 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career, and the most anguished. (Dargis)

* 'SHADOW: DEAD RIOT' (No rating, 90 minutes) An experimental women's prison is overrun by zombies in this berserk little B movie, the low-budget love child of ''The Evil Dead'' and ''Reform School Girls.'' (Nathan Lee)

'SHE'S THE MAN' (PG-13, 105 minutes) ''Twelfth Night'' is recast as a hysterically peppy romantic comedy about a she-jock penetrating the boys' soccer team. Because girls can do anything boys can do, although their ultimate ambition is to put on a nice dress and go steady with a stupid jock. (Lee)

'16 BLOCKS' (PG-13, 105 minutes) If Richard Donner's presence suggests that his new action flick, ''16 Blocks,'' is a throwback to the 1980's, so does one of the names holding pride of place above the title, Bruce Willis. Mr. Willis has always been an acquired taste, but for those who did acquire that taste, it's a pleasure to see him doing what comes naturally. Which means holding a gun and fending off bad guys with as few words as possible. (Dargis)

* 'SOPHIE SCHOLL: THE FINAL DAYS' (No rating, 117 minutes, in German) The gripping true story of Sophie Scholl, an anti-Nazi student activist in the 1940's, arrested and executed for distributing leaflets at Munich University, challenges you to gauge your own courage and strength of character should you find yourself in similar circumstances. (Holden)

'STAY ALIVE' (PG-13, 85 minutes) A computer game turns out to have the power to kill things, possibly including Frankie Muniz's post-''Malcolm in the Middle'' career. The high-tech premise can't hide the horror-film cliches. (Genzlinger)

'STONED' (No rating, 102 minutes) This docudrama follows the last weeks in the life of Brian Jones, a founding member of the Rolling Stones and an androgynous, drug-addled fop, who was found dead in his swimming pool in 1969. Hedonism on the screen has rarely looked so dull. (Holden)

'SUMMER STORM' (R, 98 minutes, in German) Yet another of those soft-core, simple-minded stories about a geeky young gay man struggling with his sexuality, this banal Bavarian import is a perfect storm of barely legal titillations and genre cliches. (Lee)

* 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott)

'Thank You for Smoking' (R, 92 minutes) The director Jason Reitman has made a glib and funny movie from Christopher Buckley's glib and funny novel about a Big Tobacco lobbyist, but the real attraction here is the hard-working star, Aaron Eckhart. (Dargis)

'TORO NEGRO' (No rating, 87 minutes, in Spanish) A disturbed young matador stabs animals, beats his wife and drinks himself to the edge of oblivion in this harrowing, deeply suspect documentary set in rural Mexico. (Lee)

* 'TRISTRAM SHANDY: A COCK AND BULL STORY' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom both confirms and refutes the assumption that Laurence Sterne's 18th-century masterpiece of digression could never be made into a movie by making a movie about the making of such a movie. Steve Coogan is wonderful as Tristram, Tristram's father and himself, though Rob Brydon steals more than a few of Mr. Coogan's scenes. (Scott)

'Tsotsi' (R, 94 minutes) (Academy Award winner for best foreign film.) Written and directed by Gavin Hood, from a novel by Athol Fugard, this South African film centers on a 19-year-old thug who steals a baby and finds redemption. You don't have to read crystal balls to see into Tsotsi's future; you just need to have watched a couple of Hollywood chestnuts. (Dargis)

'ULTRAVIOLET' (PG-13, 80 minutes) The latest in movies structured around eyewear and abdominals, ''Ultraviolet'' stars Milla Jovovich as a genetically modified human -- part vampire, part chameleon, all model -- and one of the many victims of a government experiment to improve on nature. Directed by Kurt Wimmer with a fine eye for the preferences of 12-year-old boys, ''Ultraviolet'' cleaves faithfully to its comic-book genealogy with a plot unobstructed by big words and images that rarely breach two dimensions. Ultrasilly. (Catsoulis)

'V for Vendetta' (R, 131 minutes) James McTeigue directs this D-for-dumb future-shock story about a masked avenger (Hugo Weaving) and his pipsqueak sidekick (Natalie Portman) at war against a totalitarian British regime. (Dargis)

* 'NEIL YOUNG: HEART OF GOLD' (PG, 103 minutes) Filled with country memories, bluesy regret and familiar and piercing sentiment, Jonathan Demme's concert film sounds like quintessential Neil Young, which, depending on your home catalog, will be either an enormous turn-on or a turnoff. (Dargis)

Film Series

ANNA MAY WONG (Through April 16) Wong, the first Chinese-American movie star, would have turned 100 last year. (She died in 1961.) The Museum of the Moving Image's extensive seven-week retrospective of her work continues this weekend with J. Elder Wills's ''Tiger Bay'' (1933), in which Wong plays a nightclub owner who protects a couple from a gang; and J. Walter Ruben's ''Java Head'' (1934), about a Chinese princess who marries an Englishman and follows him back to Bristol. 35th Avenue, at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Anita Gates)

Film Forum's four-week, 25-movie retrospective of his work continues this weekend with two movies about hit men: ''The Killers'' (1964), an adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's story, which features a villainous Ronald Reagan in his last film role, and ''The Lineup'' (1958), with Eli Wallach and Robert Keith skulking through San Francisco. Next week's films include ''Escape From Alcatraz'' (1979), with Clint Eastwood re-enacting the prison's only successful jailbreak; ''The Shootist'' (1976), about a dying gunfighter (John Wayne in his final performance); and ''The Duel at Silver Creek'' (1952), a western starring Audie Murphy and Stephen McNally. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10.

(Gates)

Pop

Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

BURT BACHARACH (Monday and Tuesday) Elvis Costello's 1998 collaboration helped reveal the strange melodic contours and bitter melancholy in songs by Burt Bacharach with Hal David's lyrics, spurring a rediscovery of the composer behind ''Walk on By,'' ''The Look of Love'' and ''Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head.'' On his own, Mr. Bacharach conceals his peculiarities behind a thick gauze of easy-listening arrangements. 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $75 to $150. (Jon Pareles)

PIERRE BENSUSAN (Tuesday) Pierre Bensusan, an Algerian guitarist who lives in France, is a virtuoso who sings and fingerpicks his way through his own hybrids of Celtic music with Middle Eastern music, jazz and whatever else strikes his ear. 9:30 p.m., Makor, 35 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 415-5500; $18. (Pareles)

BLACKALICIOUS (Tomorrow) Blackalicious are Bay Area rappers and associates of DJ Shadow who offer a socially conscious message with dense yet elastic flow over funky beats. The like-minded rappers Lifesavas and Fat Lip, of Pharcyde fame, open. 10:30 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $19.50 in advance, $22 at the door. (Laura Sinagra)

TONI BRAXTON (Sunday) Toni Braxton was a great R&B diva for the 90's, with her mix of preacher's-daughter naivete and a kind of wounded sensuality that found its apex in the hit ''Un-break My Heart.'' 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street; (212) 307-7171; $65 and $85. (Sinagra)

BURNING SPEAR (Wednesday) Winston Rodney, who calls himself Burning Spear, has been a voice of conscience for Jamaican reggae since the 1970's, singing about oppression and Rastafarian faith. Yet while his messages are serious, he's also one of reggae's most ebullient singers, and as he gets older, he hasn't slowed down. 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $32 in advance, $36 at the door. (Pareles)

NEKO CASE, MARTHA WAINWRIGHT (Thursday) The clarion voice that's best known to many as the transcendent secret weapon of the Canadian pop group New Pornographers belongs to the alt-country chanteuse Ms. Case, who performs her own songs here. The folk singer-songwriter Martha Wainwright, like her parents -- Kate McGarrigle and Loudon Wainwright III -- can be roundly sad or quippishly tart. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $20 in advance, $23 at the door. (Sinagra)

CORDERO (Tonight) Mixing the open atmospherics of the Southwest with the gritty feel of the Brooklyn art scene, the bilingual Ani Cordero (who has worked with Calexico and Giant Sand) and her band make guitar rock that gives urban brashness some borderland mystery. 8, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; $8. (Sinagra)

ALEJANDRO ESCOVEDO (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Escovedo's songs stare down loss and mortality with a mixture of unflinching memory and a rocker's defiance. Backed by a rock band merged with a trio of strings, his songs move from chamber-music delicacy to two-chord stomps, and they can be stubbornly cathartic. Tonight at 7 and 9:30., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; sold out. Tomorrow night at 7:30, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $15. (Pareles)

MELISSA FERRICK, ERIN MCKEOWN (Sunday) The singer-songwriter Melissa Ferrick is a folk force of nature, voicing her powerful plaints with shudder and shake. Erin McKeown has evolved since her days of spare, collegiate confessionals in the Ani DiFranco vein. Her newer material is more lushly produced, and her musing more universal. 7 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-211; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Sinagra)

THE FLAMING LIPS (Tonight and tomorrow night) The indomitable optimist and indie-rock showman Wayne Coyne and his band of Oklahoma boys continue to make good-trip psychedelia. They play here with the Pink Mountaintops. 6:30, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; both shows sold out. (Sinagra)

FOLK MUSIC OF AFGHANISTAN (Tonight) The Afghan singer Vaheed Kaacemy, the scion of a renowned musical family; the lutist Quraishi; and the dohl-player Chetram Sahni perform folk songs from the many traditions of their vast country. 8, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 545-7536; $30 and $40; children, $26 and $35; students, $15. (Sinagra)

JUAN GABRIEL (Tonight) One of Mexico's most flamboyant and crowd-pleasing singers, Mr. Gabriel writes extravagantly romantic ballads, along with songs expressing trenchant thoughts on immigration and globalization. He works with slick pop bands, mariachi groups and brass bands, sometimes all in the same marathon concert. 8, the Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $69.50 to $139.50. (Pareles)

DAVID GILMOUR (Tuesday and Wednesday) This erstwhile Pink Floyd lead guitarist has a rock-god following of his own, and as he tours here behind his solo album, ''On an Island'' (Columbia), written with his wife, expect some deep dives into the Floyd catalog. 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 632-4000; $64.50 to $154.60. (Sinagra)

Gorillaz: ''DEMON DAYS LIVE'' (Sunday though Thursday) Damon Albarn, the wizard behind the animated rock band Gorillaz, has organized a star-laden cast to help him perform the group's latest album, the eerie but elevating rock-hop ''Demon Days'' in its entirety. That cast includes De La Soul, Ike Turner, Shaun Ryder, Roots Manuva, Martina Topley-Bird, Neneh Cherry and the Pharcyde's Bootie Brown. 8 p.m., Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 531-5305; all shows sold out. (Sinagra)

HARD-FI (Tomorrow) Using dub tactics like ominous echoes and faraway sirens to add dimension to its paranoid but melodic punk sound, this British band creates a more cavernous and even cinematic space than most. 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $16. (Sinagra)

KID ROCK (Tonight) A couple of Sheryl Crow duets and a recent cameo in an unauthorized sex tape haven't done a whole heck of a lot to renew interest in the Kid or his Southern-fried, Rust Belt rap-boogie. But he still likes to have trashy fun in his tank top, and the tour bus rolls on. 7, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 564-4882; $50. (Sinagra)

GLENN KOTCHE, TEDDY THOMPSON (Tonight) The Wilco drummer Glenn Kotche's new solo CD, ''Mobile'' (Nonesuch), finds him exploring questing realms of melodic percussion while still keeping a firm grip on the musical math. The British folk-rocker Teddy Thompson looks to distinguish himself from his parents, Richard and Linda, while still honoring their legacy. His baritone voice sounds like his father's without the bite, not always a bad thing. 7, Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780; $17.50 (Sinagra)

SONDRE LERCHE (Thursday) Since making an indie cabaret-rock splash in 2002, this Norwegian guitarist and crooner's music has suggested life experience beyond his tender years. Lately he has taken a break from the baroque, applying his breathy yet urgent voice to a batch of lighthearted, stripped-down jazzy tunes. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $20. (Sinagra)

MASTERS OF INDIAN MUSIC (Tomorrow) The South Indian singer Sanjay Subramaniam began honing his intense voice as a young child, graduating early to the concert hall circuit. He will be accompanied by the violinist Nagai Muralidharan, the barrel drum percussionist Guruvayur Dorai and the tambourine player Neyveli Venkatesh. 8 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $26; $22 for children; $15 for students. (Sinagra)

THE ORB (Tomorrow) In the 90's, the Orb's ambient house music made it one of the most popular mind-warp rave soundtracks. 7:30 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780; $26. (Sinagra)

THE PRETENDERS (Tomorrow) Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders is certainly a foremother of tough-but-tender rock chicks like Eleanor Friedburger and Karen O. Her Akron via England attitude comes across forcefully on hits like ''Brass in Pocket'' and ''Middle of the Road.'' 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; sold out. (Sinagra)

RYE COALITION (Tonight and tomorrow) Rye Coalition began as an angular rock band in the style of Fugazi but now mixes in more elements of 70's hard rock. This weekend the group screens a DVD about its struggles before each performance. Tonight at 10, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $10. Tomorrow at 5:30 p.m., Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 420-1466; ticket price not available. (Sinagra)

SASHA and JOHN DIGWEED (Tonight) Sasha and Digweed have been the dominant D.J.'s in trance techno throughout its global rollout. They reunite tonight as a duo. 10, Crobar, 530 West 28th Street, Chelsea, (212) 629-9000; $40 to $60. (Sinagra)

SERENA MANEESH (Tomorrow) This Norwegian band takes a lighthearted approach to distorted, textured rock blare. Its alternately screeching and orchestral atmospherics are mismatched with its vocal purr and squawk. 8 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $10. (Sinagra)

SAVES THE DAY (Tonight) More in the Death Cab for Cutie vein of contemplative emo rock than in the glut of full-on ''screamo'' bands that followed it onto the scene, Saves the Day returns to claim its place. 8, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; sold out. (Sinagra)

SHE WANTS REVENGE, NIGHTMARE OF YOU (Tuesday) She Wants Revenge plays post-punk in the dark Interpol style. Chances are good the group will be upstaged by the opener, Nightmare of You, a lean and muscular group whose live show is more convincing than its recordings. 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; sold out. (Sinagra)

SOWETO GOSPEL CHOIR (Tomorrow and Sunday) Gospel music and traditional South African harmonies and rhythms have found common ground and hybrid possibilities since Christian missionaries arrived in South Africa in the 19th century. This 32-member choir carries the fusion toward jubilation, performing traditional songs (and ''Mbube,'' the Zulu song better known as ''The Lion Sleeps Tonight''), alongside gospel messages. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824; $45. Family concert on Sunday at 1 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $8. (Pareles)

THE STILLS (Tuesday and Wednesday) The Stills continue to sound like Strokes-era guitar rock, but they've gotten away from their initial dark new wave and moved in the direction of gutsy bar-band revelation. 9:45 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; sold out. (Sinagra)

GLENN TILBROOK (Tonight) Glenn Tilbrook, of the 80's melodic poppers Squeeze, continues his erstwhile band's quirky, hooky music, this time taking a crack at lyric-writing. 10, Coda, 34 East 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-3434; $20 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sinagra)

WHAT I LIKE ABOUT JEW (Thursday) The cabaret-rock comedians Sean Altman and Rob Tannenbaum might be giants of Jewish joke-pop, but you can also hear some Beatles in their risque borscht-belting. They play here with a full band, made up of members of Loser's Lounge. 7 and 9:30 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, SoHo, (212) 941-8100; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)

BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday) Even when swinging out, this Lady of a Thousand Songs remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. 2 p.m., Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $55, including brunch at noon. (Stephen Holden)

(Holden)

ANNIE ROSS (Wednesday) Cool, funny, swinging and indestructible, this 75-year-old singer and sometime actress exemplifies old-time hip in its most generous incarnation. 9:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $12 minimum. (Holden)

* KT Sullivan and Mark Nadler (Tonight and tomorrow night) In the words of Cole Porter, whose songs are performed here by a ripened Botticelli Venus and a reincarnation of Danny Kaye, ooh-la-la-la, c'est magnifique. 9 and 11:30, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $50 cover, with a $50 prix fixe dinner (required at the early shows), or a $20 minimum. (Holden)

Jazz

Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.

CANNONBALL ADDERLEY LEGACY BAND (Tuesday through April 9) Cannonball Adderley was an alto saxophonist who balanced bebop's harmonic precision with homegrown grit and soul. This tribute, led by his former drummer Louis Hayes, features Vincent Herring on alto saxophone, as well as the singer Paula West and the trumpeter Jeremy Pelt. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11 p.m. set Fridays and Saturdays, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (For NYC & Company discount, (212) 484-1222.) (Nate Chinen)

ANDY BEY (Tomorrow) Intimacy is a hallmark of Mr. Bey's vocal style, which alternates between a rich baritone and a burnished falsetto. He's also a fine pianist, as he'll surely demonstrate with his quartet here, on a concert stage in his old hometown. 7:30 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722, www.njpac.org; $37. (Chinen)

STEFANO BOLLANI TRIO/FRANCESCO CAFISO QUARTET (Tomorrow and Sunday) Mr. Bollani, a pianist with extensive pop credentials, recently gave a fine performance on an album with the trumpeter Enrico Rava and the drummer Paul Motian; Mr. Cafiso, a teenage alto saxophone prodigy, just released a self-assured album called ''Happy Time'' (Cam). Both artists perform here, each with his own working band. 8 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

JOE CHAMBERS BAND (Thursday and next Friday) Mr. Chambers, a veteran drummer with a gliding sense of swing, leads a hard-bop group featuring two good saxophonists -- Vincent Herring on alto and Javon Jackson on tenor -- as well as the versatile pianist Joanne Brackeen. 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

CARLA COOK (Tonight and tomorrow) A confident and vivacious jazz singer with a growing book of original tunes. 8 and 10 p.m. and midnight, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

DUDUKA DA FONSECA SEXTET (Through Sunday) On his new album, ''Samba Jazz in Black & White'' (Zoho), the percussionist Duduka Da Fonseca devises an ebullient small-group concept inspired by the sounds of his native Brazil. His ensemble includes the singer Maucha Adnet, the guitarist Vic Juris, and Paulo Levi or Anat Cohen on reeds. 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $27.50 to $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

JORRIT DIJKSTRA AND JOHN HOLLENBECK (Wednesday) Mr. Dijkstra, an alto saxophonist from Amsterdam, and Mr. Hollenbeck, a percussionist from upstate New York, have been working as a duet for years, with an emphasis on extraordinary textures and extended techniques. This electro-acoustic performance precedes the release of a new album, ''Sequence'' (Trytone). 8 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen)

ROY HARGROVE BIG BAND (Tuesday) Mr. Hargrove, the trumpeter, has been a paragon of small-group hard bop since the early 1990's. But he has also led a big band, on and off, for roughly the same span of time; he recently rekindled the format here, with powerful results. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $30. (Chinen)

HIGHLIGHTS IN JAZZ (Thursday) The longest-running jazz series in the city advances what it calls the Ultimate Jam Session, with David (Fathead) Newman and Ernie Andrews on saxophones, Steve Turre on trombone, Lew Soloff on trumpet, Mulgrew Miller on piano and Jimmy Cobb on drums. 8 p.m., TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, Borough of Manhattan Community College, 199 Chambers Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 220-1460; $30.00. (Chinen)

THE JAZZ PASSENGERS (Monday) Since being formed almost 20 years ago by the saxophonist Roy Nathanson and the trombonist Curtis Fowlkes, this ensemble has fashioned a colorful melange of retro pop, post-bop and ironic show-biz shtick. In addition to Mr. Nathanson and Mr. Fowlkes, the group includes Bill Ware on vibraphone, Sam Bardfeld on violin, Brad Jones on bass and E. J. Rodriguez on drums. 9:30 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen)

TONY MALABY TRIO (Tonight) Mr. Malaby, a versatile and increasingly prominent tenor saxophonist, convenes a promising exploratory trio with Marcus Rojas on tuba and John Hollenbeck on drums and percussion. 9 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village,(212) 989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)

DONNY McCASLIN GROUP (Tuesday) As he does on ''Soar'' (Sunnyside), a noteworthy new album, the tenor saxophonist Donny McCaslin applies his extroverted style to a Latin American-inspired contemporary fusion, benefiting greatly from the contributions of the guitarist Ben Monder, the bassist Scott Colley and the percussionists Antonio Sanchez and Pernell Saturnino. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20. (Chinen)

MEDESKI MARTIN & WOOD (Thursday) The pianist John Medeski, the drummer Billy Martin and the bassist Chris Wood make up this trio, which usually traffics in the kind of groove music once practiced by the Meters and Eddie Harris. This concert finds the group playing in an all-acoustic vein, the setting that most exposes their avant-garde proclivities. 8 p.m., the Concert Hall at the New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $35 to $40. (Chinen)

JASON MORAN AND THE BANDWAGON (Tonight) Mr. Moran is a bright pianist who favors a jagged and delirious sort of polyphony; his group, the Bandwagon, features the earthy yet slippery rhythm team of Tarus Mateen, bassist, and Nasheet Waits, drummer. 8, Kumble Theater for the Performing Arts, One University Place, Long Island University, Flatbush Avenue Extension and DeKalb Avenue, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4181, ext. 2229, or www.651arts.org; $25. (Chinen)

PAUL MOTIAN QUARTET (Tuesday through April 9) The teasingly suggestive drumming of Mr. Motian is just one of several enigmas posed by this ensemble, which is also distinguished by the tightly coiled alto saxophone scribbles of Greg Osby and the abstruse pianism of Masabumi Kikuchi. Larry Grenadier, on bass, serves a welcome clarifying purpose. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

* DAVID MURRAY QUARTET/ODEAN POPE SAXOPHONE CHOIR (Tuesday through April 9) In terms of sheer saxophone bluster, it would be tough to conjure a weightier double bill than this one, which pairs the avant-garde tenor titan David Murray (with Lafayette Gilchrist on piano, Jaribu Shahid on bass and Hamid Drake on drums) and the Odean Pope Saxophone Choir (nine saxophones, including Mr. Pope, and a rhythm section). 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $30 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)

KRESTEN OSGOOD TRIO (Thursday) Mr. Osgood, an energetic young Danish drummer, nominally leads this group with the guitarist Michael Gregory Jackson and the alto saxophonist Oliver Lake, but the power of Mr. Lake's instrumental voice may tip the scales in another direction. 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)

JEAN-MICHEL PILC TRIO (Wednesday) Mr. Pilc's piano playing has a joyous bounce, no matter how dark or furious the extemporization; he's at his best in the company of assertive partners like the electric bassist Richard Bona and the drummer Clarence Penn, who join him here. 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, near Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 929-9883; cover, $10. (Chinen)

BOB REYNOLDS QUINTET (Wednesday) Mr. Reynolds is a self-assured tenor saxophonist and an unassuming yet effective composer, as he proves on ''Can't Wait for Perfect'' (Fresh Sound New Talent), a sturdy new debut. He's joined here by some of the musicians on the album, including the pianist Aaron Goldberg, the guitarist Mike Moreno and the bassist Reuben Rogers. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20. (Chinen)

SCOTT ROBINSON (Tonight) Outer space and early swing are equal preoccupations for the multireedist Mr. Robinson, who is best known as a stalwart sideman. Here he applies his unique view of jazz repertory toward an expansive small-group performance. 7 p.m., Rubin Museum of Art, 150 West 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 620-5000, ext. 344, www.rmanyc.org; $15. (Chinen)

ELLIOT SHARP'S LIMBIC TRIO (Tomorrow) Mr. Sharp, a saxophonist and polyglot experimentalist, introduces an ensemble with Kevin Ray on bass and Donald McKenzie on drums. 9 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)

JAMES (BLOOD) ULMER (Tonight and tomorrow night) The guitarist and singer James (Blood) Ulmer fashions an oddly hypnotic combination of influences: Ornette Coleman's polytonality crossed with the psychedelic swagger of Jimi Hendrix. Here, as on a 2001 album called ''Memphis Blood: The Sun Sessions'' (Hyena), he focuses on the blues, in a seven-piece ensemble organized by a kindred spirit, the experimental rock guitarist Vernon Reid. 7:30, 9:30 and 11:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $30. (Chinen)

WHAT IS JAZZ? (Wednesday) This unanswerable question comes courtesy of Ropeadope Records, as do the stirrings of the funk-infused Christian McBride Band; the soul-inspired Charlie Hunter Trio; the cut-and-paste groove of DJ Logic; and the dynamic solo percussion of Bobby Previte. 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; cover, $20. (Chinen)

 Opera

'LA BOHEME' (Tomorrow and Thursday) James Robinson's production punts the Puccini favorite forward by some 80 years, placing the action in the opening months of World War I and lending an extra tug of pathos. At the first performance, Kelly Kaduce made an appealing Mimi, pairing her character's physical weakness with focused vocal strength. Gerard Powers sang Rodolfo with a solid top but a thinner middle range. For Thursday's performance, a new cast comes in with Yunah Lee (Mimi), Jennifer Black (Musetta) and Phillip Torre (Marcello). Steven White conducts tomorrow, David Wroe on Thursday. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $45 remaining tomorrow; $16 to $120 on Thursday. (Jeremy Eichler)

'DON GIOVANNI' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Amato's venerable recipe -- no rehearsals, changing casts at every performance -- should make for an unusual version of Mozart's classic dish, but at least the theater's small scale represents a kind of period fidelity. Tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 2:30, Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200; $30; $25 for students and 65+. (Anne Midgette)

'DON GIOVANNI' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) Neither objectionable nor particularly fresh or insightful, Harold Prince's 1989 staging of this great Mozart opera is a good, basic presentation of the work. The company's opening cast includes Christopher Schaldenbrand in the title role; Robert Gierlach as Leporello; Hanan Alattar as Zerlina; Orla Boylan as Donna Anna and Elizabeth Caballero as Donna Elvira. Steven Mosteller conducts. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $45 remaining tomorrow; $16 to $120 on Tuesday. (Allan Kozinn)

* 'DON PASQUALE' (Tonight and Monday) Why mount a new production of a frothy opera buffa? At the Met this weekend, the answer is: hot young stars. Anna Netrebko is the soprano of the moment; Juan Diego Florez, the best lyric tenor around; Mariusz Kwiecien, a fine baritone. They look good and they should sound great. Tonight at 8, Monday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $150 to $250 remaining tonight; sold out on Monday. (Midgette)

* 'FIDELIO' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) Jurgen Flimm's strikingly contemporary and deeply humane production of Beethoven's ''Fidelio,'' which opened at the Met in 2000, is back. So is the soprano Karita Mattila, who gives a courageous and vocally radiant portrayal of Leonore, opera's most valiant and devoted wife. The conductor Paul Nadler has taken over for James Levine, who has withdrawn for the rest of the season, and though Mr. Nadler is no Levine, he does honorable work. All in all, this production still delivers. And Ms. Mattila is astonishing. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Tuesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $220 remaining tomorrow; $26 to $175 on Tuesday. (Anthony Tommasini)

'LUISA MILLER' (Tomorrow) Because of illness, there have been more substitutions in this run of ''Luisa'' than in the ninth inning of a spring training baseball game. But Veronica Villarroel and Neil Shicoff, the original leads, are both scheduled to sing this final performance, along with the solid if uninflected baritone Carlos Alvarez and, in lieu of James Morris, the fine bass Vitalij Kowaljow. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $42 to $220. (Midgette)

'LYSISTRATA' (Tonight, Sunday and Wednesday) Mark Adamo's fantastical operatic adaptation of Aristophanes' antiwar comedy had its premiere last year at the Houston Grand Opera. That production is now at the New York City Opera. Mr. Adamo's score is bustling and hyper-rhythmic, but sometimes too dense. Still, he takes seriously the story of Athenian and Spartan women who join forces to refuse their husbands and lovers sex until the men stop waging a seemingly endless war. At its best, the opera becomes a somber meditation on the intertwining of passion and aggression. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 1:30 p.m., Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 731-6500; $16 to $120 tomorrow and Wednesday; $45 remaining on Sunday. (Tommasini)

'MANON' (Wednesday) The news is Renee Fleming, who returns to a signature role in the venerable but appealing production by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, along with the tenor Massimo Giordano, under the baton of Jesus Lopez-Cobos. Not news is the length of this grand opera; after hearing an opera by Massenet, a notable dramatic soprano is supposed to have said, ''And they say Wagner is long?'' 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out. (Midgette)

'LA TRAVIATA' (Thursday) The Met's re-energized production of this Verdi opera continues its long run with Hei-Kyung Hong as Violetta, Frank Lopardo as Alfredo and Dwayne Croft as Germont. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6200; sold out. (Bernard Holland)

Classical Music

SERGIO AND ODAIR ASSAD (Sunday) This Brazilian guitar duo touches on a wide variety of music, which ranges from Albeniz and Rodrigo to the contemporary Cuban composer Leo Brouwer to jazz-tinged works by Egberto Gismonti. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949; $40. (Kozinn)

JONATHAN BISS (Sunday) The Peoples' Symphony Concerts presents recitals by big-name artists and up-and-coming players for as little as the cost of a movie. This weekend, it's the young American pianist Jonathan Biss performing Janacek, Schumann and Beethoven, as well as a recent work by Lewis Spratlan called ''Wonderer.'' 2 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 586-4680; $9 and $11. (Eichler)

BROOKLYN PHILHARMONIC (Tomorrow) Michael Christie, the orchestra's new music director, has assembled a compelling slate of programs for his first season. The second of them looks at this year's two anniversary celebrants, Mozart and Shostakovich, both directly -- by way of Shostakovich's Symphony for Strings and Mozart's ''King Thamos'' -- as well as through the eyes of Alfred Schnittke, whose amusing ''Moz-Art a la Haydn'' opens the concert. 8 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100; $20 to $60; $10 for students. (Kozinn)

CHAMBER MUSIC AT THE Y (Tuesday and Wednesday) The baritone Nathaniel Webster performs Ned Rorem's ''Aftermath,'' written in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. Ravel's Violin Sonata and Brahms's G minor Piano Quartet fill out the program courtesy of Jaime Laredo, Cynthia Phelps, Sharon Robinson and Joseph Kalichstein. 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500; $35. (Eichler)

ALICE COOTE (Sunday) This British mezzo-soprano, best known for her performances and recordings of early music, makes her Met debut later this month as Cherubino in ''Le Nozze di Figaro.'' But those who want an early glimpse of Ms. Coote's artistry can hear her in a recital of songs by Mahler and Schubert. 2 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $48. (Tommasini)

JEROME L. GREENE CONCERT (Tonight) Daniel Beckwith conducts an ensemble of Juilliard students in an all-Handel program. 8, Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406; free, but tickets are required. (Eichler)

QUINN KELSEY (Sunday) This young Hawaiian-born baritone, who has been coming up through the young artist program at the Lyric Opera of Chicago, sings a recital as part of the ''On Wings of Song'' series, sponsored by the Marilyn Horne Foundation. His intriguingly titled program, ''Songs of Separation,'' offers works by Beethoven, Barber, Faure and Mussorgsky. 3 p.m., St. Bartholomew's Church, Park Avenue at 51st Street, (212) 378-0248; $20; $15 for 65+; free for students. (Tommasini)

* YUNDI LI (Monday) Murray Perahia was to have given a recital at Carnegie Hall on this night, but when he withdrew, Carnegie turned to this fantastic young Chinese pianist, who will play Mozart's Sonata in C, Schumann's ''Carnaval'' and the Liszt Sonata in B minor, a work he plays brilliantly on his first Deutsche Grammophon CD. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $28 to $97. (Kozinn)

* yO-YO MA (Wednesday) Mr. Ma plays three of Bach's six solo works for the cello. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; sold out. (Holland)

NATIONAL SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Thursday) It's nice when a major performer plays a new work; it's even nicer when he likes it enough to keep on playing it. The pianist Emanuel Ax has certainly taken to the concerto Melinda Wagner wrote for him, called ''Extremity of Sky,'' enough that he's played it a number of times since its first performance with the Chicago Symphony in 2003, and is now giving its first New York performance.

SKAMPA STRING QUARTET (Tonight) Having just played as part of the Peoples' Symphony Concerts, this busy ensemble of young musicians from Prague comes to Weill Recital Hall.

(Tommasini)

MASAAKI SUZUKI (Tomorrow) A prophet of period-instrument Bach in Japan, Mr. Suzuki led his Bach Collegium Japan in a concert earlier in the week, but tomorrow he has the stage to himself for what promises to be a revelatory harpsichord performance of Bach's ''Well-Tempered Clavier,'' Book II. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $38. (Kozinn)

(Midgette)

* WU MAN (Thursday) The pipa, a Chinese lute, has been finding a place in Western classical music in recent years, not only through the works of Chinese composers, but also at Bang on a Can marathons and in concerts by the Kronos Quartet. Often, in New York shows, the instrument is played by Wu Man, a virtuoso offering a concert as part of Kronos's series at Carnegie Hall. With an ensemble including a banjo, dulcimer, Ukrainian zither, African harp and percussion, Ms. Wu offers a program that includes Chinese traditional music, bluegrass tunes and new works by Eric Moe, Chen Yi and Julian Kytasty. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, (212) 247-7800; $28 to $35. (Kozinn)

YOUNG CONCERT ARTiSTS (Wednesday) Every year, as part of its benefit gala, this organization presents its talented young prizewinners in various concertos with a full orchestra. This year, a Chinese double-bassist named DaXun Zhang will perform, improbably enough, ''Carmen Fantasy,'' originally a violin showpiece. Lise de la Salle, a French pianist, will perform Liszt's Concerto No. 1, and Jose Franch-Ballester, a Spanish clarinetist, will play Copland's Clarinet Concerto. Keith Lockhart leads the Orchestra of St. Luke's. 7:30 p.m., Rose Theater, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 307-6656; $25 to $35. (Eichler)

TERE O'CONNOR DANCE (Tonight and tomorrow night) Audiences and reviewers tend to feel passionately about Mr. O'Connor's choreography, loving or hating it with equal intensity.

Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.

 Museums

* BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 14. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. Her works do not lend themselves to easy deciphering, but her magic with materials and her daring compositional imagination draw you in. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck)

* Brooklyn Museum: WILLIAM WEGMAN: 'FUNNEY/STRANGE,' through May 28. Descended from Marcel Duchamp and Buster Keaton, Mr. Wegman has straddled high and low for more than three decades, using his signature Weimaraners to make the art world's funniest videos, as well as television commercials, calendars and children's books. His popular success has tended to obscure his originality and influence, along with a multifarious production that includes wittily captioned drawings, wonderfully irreverent paintings and a host of nondog photographic work. This thorough and thoroughly entertaining retrospective highlights not only the accessibility of his richly human art, but also its dedication to the 1970's notion that art should not look like art. (See above.) (Roberta Smith)

* Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces that the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Holland Cotter)

* International Center of Photography: 'Snap Judgments: New Positions in Contemporary African Photography,' through May 28. If Martians tuned into our television news broadcasts, they'd have a miserable impression of life on Earth. War, disease, poverty, heartbreak and nothing else. That's exactly how most of the world sees Africa: filtered through images of calamity. The Nigerian-born curator Okwui Enwezor offers a bracing alternative view in this show of recent photography from Africa. He isn't interested in simply exchanging an upbeat Africa for a downbeat one, smiles for frowns, but in engineering a slow, complex, panoptical turn in perspective, one that takes in many moods and directions. The results are stimulating, astringent, brimming with life. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter)

Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Art of Medicine in Ancient Egypt,' through May 7. Egypt was no picnic 5,000 years ago. The average life span was about 40 years. Wild animals were ever-present. Childbirth was perilous. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness were shots in the dark. Doctors were priests. Medicine was a blend of science, religion and art. The 65 or so objects in this beautiful show functioned as all three. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Cotter)

Met: KARA WALKER AT THE MET: 'AFTER THE DELUGE,' through July 30. The Metropolitan Museum of Art's first foray into artist-organized shows is a small tour de force of curatorial creativity. Inspired partly by Hurricane Katrina, Ms. Walker has combined works from the Met with examples of her own art, connecting shared themes of race, poverty and water to illuminate contemporary art's inevitable dialogue with past art. The show has as many crosscurrents and undertows as a river. One of the most interesting concerns the genteel technique of cut-paper silhouette that is the basis of Ms. Walker's scathing take-no-prisoners exploration of slavery and its tragic legacy. (See above.) (Smith)

THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'EDVARD MUNCH: THE MODERN LIFE OF THE SOUL,' through May 8. This affecting, full-scale retrospective is the first survey of this Norwegian painter in an American museum in almost 30 years. Its more than 130 oils and works on paper cover Munch's entire career, from 1880 to 1944. It also includes a large selection of prints -- many ingeniously adapted from his oils -- that played an important role in his art. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Glueck)

THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'ON SITE: NEW ARCHITECTURE IN SPAIN,' through May 1. Since the early 1970's, when Spain began to awaken from the isolation of a four-decade dictatorship, Spanish architects have produced designs of unusual depth, often with a firm connection to the land, a sense of humility and a way of conveying continuity with the past while embracing the present. Packed with pretty images and elegant models, this exhibition lacks the scholarly depth you might have hoped for on such a mesmerizing subject. (See above.) (Nicolai Ouroussoff)

NEUE GALERIE: 'KLEE AND AMERICA,' through May 22. For a long time, the Swiss-born artist Paul Klee (1879-1940), regarded as a leading Modernist figure in Europe, didn't believe his delicate, chimerical work had much of a future in the United States. Yet, thanks to artists, collectors and dealers with close contacts in Germany who had begun to discover his work, by the early 1920's, Klee's impact began to be felt here. This show of more than 60 paintings and drawings assembled exclusively from American holdings covers the wide spectrum of Klee's work, from his dense, Cubist-style oil, ''When God Considered the Creation of the Plants'' (1913), to a beautifully stylized rendering of the jazz singer and dancer Josephine Baker (1927) to labyrinthine compositions like ''Or the Mocked Mocker'' (1930). 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck)

P.S. 1: Jessica Stockholder: 'Of Standing Float Roots in Thin Air,' through May 1. A soaring, cannily designed installation -- made of airborne plastic bins, electric lights, orange extension cords and an old armchair topping a wooden tower -- by a sculptor known for orchestrating productive collisions of formalism and consumerism. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Ken Johnson)

Whitney Museum of American Art: 'WHITNEY BIENNIAL 2006: DAY FOR NIGHT,' through May 28. This biennial will provoke much head-scratching by uninitiated visitors. A hermetic take on what has been making waves, it's packaged -- branded might be the better word -- as a show long on collaboration and open-endedness: several shows under one roof, including a revival of the 1960's ''Peace Tower,'' which rises like a Tinker Toy construction from the Whitney courtyard, with contributions by dozens of artists. As a counter to the image of the art world as rich, youth-besotted and obsessed with crafty little nothings, the ethos here is provisional, messy, half-baked, cantankerous, insular -- radical qualities art used to have when it could still call itself radical and wasn't like a barnacle clinging to the cruise ship of pop culture. That was back in the 1970's. And much of what's here (including works by bohemians and other senior eccentrics around then) harks back to that moment. Beauty is hard to come by. Check out, among other things, Paul Chan's digital animation of shadowy objects like cellphones and bicycles, floating upward, Wizard of Oz-like, while bodies tumble down, the work cast as if it were light from a tall window slanting onto the floor of a dark room. And also Pierre Huyghe's film, shot in Antarctica and Central Park. It's really gorgeous: crosscut between day and night, fiction and reality, it encapsulates the show's operative but ultimately airy metaphor about the slippery state of art now. (''Day for Night'' is the biennial's first-ever title, after the Francois Truffaut film.) 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639 or www.whitney.org. (Michael Kimmelman)

Galleries: Uptown

Tony Cragg: 'Five Bottles' In the early 1980's, this eminent English sculptor made flat, mosaiclike works out of found colored plastic objects and fragments. This show presents a set of five wall-works, each representing a different giant colored bottle composed of toys, combs, cigarette lighters and other pieces of ordinary commercial detritus. Vivian Horan, 35 East 67th Street, (212) 517-9410, through April 21. (Johnson)

Galleries: 57th Street

Darren Almond /Janice Kerbel: 'The Impossible Landscape' Nothing is obvious in this handsome show of works by two London-based Conceptualists. The connection is that both make visible things that are in different ways impossible. Ms. Kerbel's elegantly abstracted designs for gardens in an office, a Laundromat and other unlikely places are meant to be imagined but never actually built. Mr. Almond's sumptuous, subtly eerie landscape photographs were shot at night using long exposures, making visible what would be invisible to the naked eye. The Horticultural Society of New York, 128 West 58th Street, (212) 757-0915, through May 5. (Johnson)

Galleries: Chelsea

* MARK LECKeY: 'DRUNKEN BAKERS' This cinematically gifted British artist raises his game with a stop-action animation made by simply shooting a raunchy, well-drawn comic strip for adults in close-up, turning its speech balloons into spoken dialogue and adding realistic sound effects. Shown in an increasingly grubby white-on-white cube, the work is elegantly efficient, funny and dark, and adds another twist to the convoluted history of appropriation art. GBE@Passerby, 436 West 15th Street, (212) 627-5258, through April 22. (Smith)

Other Galleries

'Zoo Story' A clay gorilla by Daisy Youngblood, a bronze she-wolf by Kiki Smith, a flock of concrete sheep by Francoise-Xavier Lalanne and works about animals by more than 20 other artists, including John Baldessari, Katharina Fritsch, Ross Bleckner and Rebecca Horn, turn the first floor of this sleek, three-story private museum into a diverting menagerie. Fisher Landau Center for Art, 38-27 30th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-0727, through June 12. (Johnson)

Last Chance

* 'THE DOWNTOWN SHOW: THE NEW YORK ART SCENE, 1974-1984' It's a humongous time warp of more than 450 paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs, videos, posters, ephemera and things in between by artists, writers, performers, musicians and maestros of mixed media, from a photograph of the transvestite Candy Darling as she posed on her deathbed to a small, painted sculpture made of elephant dung by David Hammons. With so many clashing ideologies, points of view and attitudes toward art-making, this no-holds-barred hodgepodge generates the buzz and stridency of, say, Canal Street on payday. New York University, Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212) 998-6780; and Fales Library, 70 Washington Square South, (212) 988-2596, Greenwich Village; closes tomorrow. (Glueck)

* Anya Gallaccio: 'One Art' The viscerally poetic single work occupying Sculpture Center's spacious main gallery is a 50-foot weeping cherry tree that was cut up and reassembled in the gallery, where it is held in place by steel cables and bolts. Sculpture Center, 44-19 Purves Street, at Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750; closes Monday. (Johnson)

* DAVID HAMMONS: 'SELECTED WORKS' A rare exhibition of 11 objects and drawings highlights the robust tactility and sculptural intelligence in this elusive, influential artist's work. His use of eccentric discarded materials and found objects goes beyond Duchampian gesture to comment pointedly, but with elegance and wit, on poverty, deprivation and the ingenuity they can engender. Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677; closes tomorrow. (Smith)

JEWISH MUSEUM: 'SARAH BERNHARDT: THE ART OF HIGH DRAMA' This exhibition is devoted to the flamboyant 19th-century actress whose name was once invoked by mothers as a warning to melodramatic daughters: ''Who do you think you are, Sarah Bernhardt?'' Its almost overstuffed roster of items includes original Felix Nadar photos of Bernhardt at 20, the costumes she wore as Cleopatra and Joan of Arc, her own accomplished sculptures and relics of lovers and American tours. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200; closes Sunday.(Edward Rothstein)

* KEIZO KITAJIMA: 'NEW YORK' The New York debut of this Japanese photographer consists of more than three dozen pictures taken during a six-month sojourn in New York in 1981. His subjects include immigrants, drag queens and club kids, celebrities and nascent celebrities, all portrayed with a magnetic combination of glamour, grit and gravitas. Cohen Amador Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 759-6740; closes tomorrow. (Smith)

* MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines' Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, closes Sunday. (Kimmelman)

Rachel Whiteread: 'Bibliography' Cardboard boxes cast in plaster are displayed in monotonous profusion singly and in groups by this British sculptor who once made a concrete cast of the inside of a whole house. Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9100; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)

8 P.M. (11) SURVIVAL OF THE RICHEST -- Series premiere. Kat, who is the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's daughter, makes enemies right away. And some people don't care for Hunter, the Dutch aristocrat who brags about going to school with Prince William. Seven rich young people, most of whom have never worked a day in their lives (yet have a combined net worth of $3 billion), and seven poor young people, some unemployed and most in considerable debt, live together in a grand reality-show-style mansion and compete for $200,000. For the rich, it's a chance to prove to their families that they aren't completely worthless. For the poor, it's all about the prize money. Everybody's first task is waiting tables at a bustling Medieval Times restaurant.

HEADLINE: Shocks Seen In New Math For Pensions

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
The board that writes accounting rules for American business is proposing a new method of reporting pension obligations that is likely to show that many companies have a lot more debt than was obvious before.
 In some cases, particularly at old industrial companies like automakers, the newly disclosed obligations are likely to be so large that they will wipe out the net worth of the company.
The panel, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, said the new method, which it plans to issue today for public comment, would address a widespread complaint about the current pension accounting method: that it exposes shareholders and employees to billions of dollars in risks that they cannot easily see or evaluate. The new accounting rule would also apply to retirees' health plans and other benefits. 
 A member of the accounting board, George Batavick, said, ''We took on this project because the current accounting standards just don't provide complete information about these obligations.''
 The board is moving ahead with the proposed pension changes even as Congress remains bogged down on much broader revisions of the law that governs company pension plans. In fact, Representative John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio and the new House majority leader, who has been a driving force behind pension changes in Congress, said yesterday that he saw little chance of a finished bill before a deadline for corporate pension contributions in mid-April. 
 Congress is trying to tighten the rules that govern how much money companies are to set aside in advance to pay for benefits. The accounting board is working with a different set of rules that govern what companies tell investors about their retirement plans. 
 The new method proposed by the accounting board would require companies to take certain pension values they now report deep in the footnotes of their financial statements and move the information onto their balance sheets -- where all their assets and liabilities are reflected. The pension values that now appear on corporate balance sheets are almost universally derided as of little use in understanding the status of a company's retirement plan. 
 Mr. Batavick of the accounting board said the new rule would also require companies to measure their pension funds' values on the same date they measure all their other corporate obligations. Companies now have delays as long as three months between the time they calculate their pension values and when they measure everything else. That can yield misleading results as market fluctuations change the values. 
 ''Old industrial, old economy companies with heavily unionized work forces'' would be affected most sharply by the new rule, said Janet Pegg, an accounting analyst with Bear, Stearns. A recent report by Ms. Pegg and other Bear, Stearns analysts found that the companies with the biggest balance-sheet changes were likely to include General Motors, Ford, Verizon, BellSouth and General Electric.
 Using information in the footnotes of Ford's 2005 financial statements, Ms. Pegg said that if the new rule were already in effect, Ford's balance sheet would reflect about $20 billion more in obligations than it now does. The full recognition of health care promised to Ford's retirees accounts for most of the difference. Ford now reports a net worth of $14 billion. That would be wiped out under the new rule. Ford officials said they had not evaluated the effect of the new accounting rule and therefore could not comment.
 Applying the same method to General Motors' balance sheet suggests that if the accounting rule had been in effect at the end of 2005, there would be a swing of about $37 billion. At the end of 2005, the company reported a net worth of $14.6 billion. A G.M. spokesman declined to comment, noting that the new accounting rule had not yet been issued. 
 Many complaints about the way obligations are now reported revolve around the practice of spreading pension figures over many years. Calculating pensions involves making many assumptions about the future, and at the end of every year there are differences between the assumptions and what actually happened. Actuaries keep track of these differences in a running balance, and incorporate them into pension calculations slowly. 
 That practice means that many companies' pension disclosures do not yet show the full impact of the bear market of 2000-3, because they are easing the losses onto their books a little at a time. The new accounting rule will force them to bring the pension values up to date immediately, and use the adjusted numbers on their balance sheets. 
 Not all companies would be adversely affected by the new rule. A small number might even see improvement in their balance sheets. One appears to be Berkshire Hathaway. Even though its pension fund has a shortfall of $501 million, adjusting the numbers on its balance sheet means reducing an even larger shortfall of $528 million that the company recognized at the end of 2005. 
 Berkshire Hathaway's pension plan differs from that of many other companies because it is invested in assets that tend to be less volatile. Its assumptions about investment returns are also lower, and it will not have to make a big adjustment for earlier-year losses when the accounting rule takes effect. Berkshire also looks less indebted than other companies because it does not have retiree medical plans. 
 Mr. Batavick said he did not know what kind of public comments to expect, but hoped to have a final standard completed by the third quarter of the year. Companies would then be expected to use it for their 2006 annual reports. The rule will also apply to nonprofit institutions like universities and museums, as well as privately held companies. 
 The rule would not have any effect on corporate profits, only on the balance sheets. The accounting board plans to make additional pension accounting changes after this one takes effect. Those are expected to affect the bottom line and could easily be more contentious.

HEADLINE: The Chinese Vanguard Is Blazing Its Trails With Cameras

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
CHINESE contemporary art hit New York, en masse, eight years ago with a fireworks bang. The big news of this year's Asia Week is that, for the moment at least, the bang is back.
 Taking place today is Sotheby's first-ever auction of contemporary Asian art. Its preview exhibitions amounted to the largest local survey of vanguard Chinese material since the ''Inside Out: New Chinese Art'' shows at the Asia Society and P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center in 1998.
Two concurrent, longer-running shows in the city focus on types of work that Sotheby's slighted or ignored: the Max Protetch Gallery in Chelsea has a small, old-and-new selection of performance-based photography. More important, at P.S. 1 again, in Long Island City, there is a snappy roundup of recent video, a favored medium among young artists in a digitally savvy 21st-century China. 
 Although post-Tiananmen work filtered into New York throughout the 1990's, ''Inside Out'' was like an explosion. Suddenly, we were bombarded with a highly varied art of far-out ideas and vaguely familiar forms: abstract paintings made with gunpowder, hanging scrolls woven from hair, printed books the size of tents, calligraphy repeated to the point of obliteration and performance pieces that combined endurance tests, Dada and Chinese opera. 
 In short, Chinese art history was being put through a postmodern blender, from which it emerged transformed but still oddly intact. The results were smart, funny, clunky and scary, greater in breadth than in depth. The startup energy was tremendous, a high. After a while, though, the high wound down. We heard reports of prodigious activity in China itself, but little fresh art seemed to travel, and we ended up recycling second-hand stuff in too many group shows. 
 The situation may be changing. You would never guess it from the Sotheby's auction, but photography and video have long since replaced painting in the Chinese vanguard. We have been seeing a fair amount of both in New York, most recently in the impressive survey ''Between Past and Future: New Photography and Video From China'' at the International Center of Photography in 2004. 
 In a sense, the Protetch show, ''Great Performance: Contemporary Chinese Photography,'' is just a footnote to that survey. It adds a bit of history by updating the careers of Conceptualists -- Ma Liuming, Song Dong, Wang Jin, Zhao Bandi -- who gained notice in the 1990's. And it gives further exposure to a handful of bright artists from the show ''Between Past and Future'' who have yet to find galleries here. Liu Wei, with a ''classical'' mountains-in-mist landscape composed of bare legs and bent knees, is one. Zhang Dali, who has developed his own brand of urban graffiti in constantly demolished and rebuilt Beijing, is another. 
 The real find, though, is work by two women. Yin Xiuzhen, best known for her soft-sculpture cityscapes, has a beautiful photograph of an idyllic landscape strewn with pairs of empty shoes here. And the formidable young performance artist Chen Qiulin depicts herself sitting like a soot-besmirched moon goddess in a rubble-filled urban lot. 
 The increased visibility of women in China's art scene is confirmed by ''The Thirteen: Chinese Video Now'' at P.S. 1, where Cao Fei, born in 1975, has three pieces. In the most elaborate, ''Cosplayers'' (2004), teenagers dressed as Japanese anime characters turn the city of Guangzhou into a stage for epic dramas before sulkily returning home at dusk to have dinner with their parents.
 Ms. Cao, with a growing reputation and a New York solo show -- a disappointing one -- at Lombard-Freid Projects in Chelsea, is one of a handful of P.S. 1 artists who were also in the International Center of Photography survey. Cui Xiuwen is another, and her exotic, wall-filling image of lanterns swaying in the dark opens ''The Thirteen.'' The Shanghai-based Hu Jieming, with a rapid-fire video of architectural images cued to music, is a third.
 And then there is the 20-something artist-curator Xu Zhen, who helps fill the current show's bad-boy quotient. In the video titled ''Rainbow,'' the sound of flesh being slapped or whipped accompanies an image of a bare human back gradually reddening under assault from unseen hands.
 Mostly, however, ''The Thirteen'' is a showcase for New York debuts. Some of the newcomers work with political commentary. In Li Songhua's ''Keynote Speech,'' a child reads aloud from a government report on economics. The Beijing-based team called 8gg (Jiang Haiqing and Fu Yu) turns television newscasters into herky-jerky robots. 
 One of the show's older artists, Xu Tan, born in 1957, tours a part of Shanghai where the first Chinese Communist Party Congress met in 1921. The site is now a Western-style shopping strip of upscale cafes and boutiques. You could as easily be in Switzerland as in China.
 Although other work feels light and slight, like one-line jokes or music videos, I was very glad to encounter two brooding, mysterious pieces by Meng Jin, and to reacquaint myself with Lu Chunsheng, a nondebutante who has shown at the Museum of Modern Art. In his work, and in that of the highly accomplished Dong Wensheng, an old and a new China meet.
 Mr. Dong's seven-minute video ''Excited Insects'' is one of the best things here. It opens on a sunny spring day with a modishly dressed young man making his way through lush undergrowth to an old, almost bare tree. He climbs onto one of its branches and begins to adorn it with sprays of blossoms that he pulls from a satchel. He works slowly and to pretty effect. After he has completed the illusion of bringing the tree into flower, he drapes a sheer white scarf over the branch and abruptly hangs himself. 
 A strain of jumpy nihilism that runs through much new Chinese art -- you catch glimpses of it throughout the show -- is distilled here. It is a time-honored response of Chinese artists to the pressures of intense cultural change, of the kind China is undergoing now. And the response is as evident in painting from centuries ago as in video today. 
 We may have been only dimly aware of such connections eight years ago, but we are beginning to see them now. And we are likely to see them even more clearly with time, as one of the world's oldest and newest art traditions -- China's -- continues to land in our midst and to remain with us and become part of our lives, as, sooner or later, it certainly will. 

''Great Performance: Contemporary Chinese Photography'' runs through April 22 at the Max Protetch Gallery, 511 West 22nd Street, Chelsea; (212) 633-6999. ''The Thirteen: Chinese Video Now'' is at P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, through April 24; (718) 784-2084.

HEADLINE: New Strain on Duke's Ties With Durham

BYLINE: By RICK LYMAN

DATELINE: DURHAM, N.C., March 30 

 BODY:
Francis Conlin says that he is a pretty sound sleeper, but that his wife is often jarred awake by the raucous noise spilling from one of the frequent and teeming student parties in their neighborhood beside the East Campus of Duke University.
 ''Screaming at the top of their lungs at 2 in the morning, urinating on lawns, throwing beer cans around, driving fast, that sort of stuff,'' said Mr. Conlin, a mechanical engineer. ''Really, the last two years or so, these guys have been a pain in the neck.'' 
 Mr. Conlin's home is just across the alley from a rented house where some members of Duke's lacrosse team lived. In that house, on March 13, a black student from nearby North Carolina Central University was raped, beaten and called racist names, she says, by three white men during a team party at which she was hired to strip.
 The incident, straddling at once the quintessential social flashpoints of race, class and gender, has led community and university leaders to fear that the progress they have made in recent years in improving their relationship will be swept away in the storm.
 Almost every college community bears scorch marks from the inevitable friction between town and gown, but Durham has a particularly bad case. In its most recent survey of students from 361 colleges and universities, the Princeton Review ranked Duke fifth worst in the category of strained town-gown relations and sixth in having little interaction between students of different socioeconomic classes and racial groups.
 Community leaders and residents say this may be because Duke is an especially elite and privileged institution in a culturally diverse and economically struggling city that already carries the harsh history of race relations in the South. Duke is believed to be the model for the hard-partying college in Tom Wolfe's 2004 novel, ''I Am Charlotte Simmons.''
 Black enrollment at Duke, where tuition, fees, room and board currently run more than $41,000 a year, rose to 10.8 percent in 2004 from 5.1 percent in 1980, according to The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education, a significantly larger percentage-point jump than at other elite colleges like Harvard and Princeton.
 Nonetheless, Duke's home is a community of 210,000 that has almost as many black residents as white ones -- 44 percent to 45 percent, in the 2000 Census -- and a city where 15 percent of residents live below the poverty level, compared with 12.4 percent nationwide.
 ''This is not something that catches us by surprise,'' Donna Lisker, director of the Duke Women's Center, said. ''We have always had the simmering tensions of a city that is quite diverse -- that is, a working-class or lower-middle-class city with a quite affluent university right in the middle of it.''
 Mayor William V. Bell said that he was not sure how rankings like the Princeton Review's were compiled but that he was surprised to see that Duke had rated so low. Yes, Mr. Bell said, there have been inevitable town-gown clashes, usually over the rowdiness of off-campus parties, but he does not believe the lacrosse team accusation will set back progress.
 On Thursday morning, the mayor convened the first of a series of gatherings involving top leaders from local government, local universities and the city's black residents.
 Trinity Park, where the team party took place, is a neighborhood sandwiched between the East Campus and downtown Durham, a leafy grid of historic homes and trendy restaurants that is home to many professors and other professionals and to some rental properties for students.
 The neighborhood got its first taste of infamy in January of last year when the police raided a party that had attracted 200 students and found, in the basement, female students in bikinis wrestling in a blow-up pool full of baby oil while beer-swilling male students cheered them on.
 After the episode, city and university officials did try last year to crack down on rowdiness.
 In a coordinated weekend sting last August, city police officials filed 173 cases against Duke students, mostly for under-age drinking. Of the total, 138 cases resulted in sanctions, usually warnings, while four students were disciplined, two were sent to counseling, and just one was suspended from college.
 John Dagenhart, president of the Trinity Park Homeowners Association, said things became a little calmer after that.
 Since 1996, Duke has sponsored the Duke-Durham Neighborhood Partnership, an effort to bridge the town-gown gap by offering nearby impoverished neighborhoods help with medical care, affordable housing, mentoring and tutoring.
 ''We'll have to wait for the investigation to be concluded,'' said Michael Palmer, director of Duke's Office of Community Affairs, which oversees the partnership. ''But obviously, you have students misbehaving, acting out. At the same time, though, you have a lot of untold stories of Duke students out there, volunteering, tutoring, mentoring, and this gets no attention at all.''
 Venis Wilder is one of those students. As a freshman, she helped found a group called the Girls' Club, in which Duke students volunteer as mentors to middle-school girls in Durham's minority neighborhoods.
 Ms. Wilder, 21, from Plantation, Fla., said she believed that things were improving but was withholding judgment about whether Duke would do the right thing this time around.
 ''People in the community and on campus are both watching to see what disciplinary action, what stance the university is going to take,'' Ms. Wilder said. ''Is this going to be a team of rich white men who get away with assaulting a black woman? People are really watching to see how Duke is going to respond.''

HEADLINE: Cities That Lead the Way

 BODY:
Crippled by soaring corrections costs, states and municipalities are re-examining policies that drive ex-offenders right back to prison by barring them from employment. Locked out of the mainstream, ex-felons become burdens to their families, their communities and the nation as a whole. Three cities -- Boston, Chicago and San Francisco -- have taken groundbreaking steps aimed at de-emphasizing criminal histories for qualified applicants for city jobs, except in law enforcement, education and other sensitive areas where people with convictions are specifically barred by statute. 
 The Boston plan, which becomes effective this summer, deserves to be widely emulated. It covers not just city employees but also the companies that do business with the city. Those companies, which employ hundreds of thousands of workers, will be required to make their employment policies consistent with those put forth by the city.
Under the new policy, the city will not conduct a criminal record review at all, except in special circumstances or when it is required by law. Even then, the search will come near the end of the process, after the applicant has proved to be qualified and is about to be hired. If the city then changes its mind about the job offer, the applicant is entitled to a full explanation and a chance to rebut the criminal records reports, which sometimes contain errors. 
 Taken together, the recent developments in Boston, Chicago and San Francisco symbolize a step forward in terms of fairness for law-abiding ex-offenders, who are often barred from entire occupations because of youthful mistakes and minor crimes committed in the distant past. It should be clear to all of us by now that confining those people to the ranks of the unemployed makes it more likely that they will commit new crimes, return to prison and become a permanent burden to society.

HEADLINE: Harvard Extends Breaks for Low-Income Parents

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON

 BODY:
The quest by prestigious colleges to attract more low- and middle-income students is turning into a financial aid arms race.
 Harvard University, which two years ago focused attention on the paucity of low-income students in the Ivy League with its announcement that it would not ask parents who earned less than $40,000 a year to contribute money for their children's education, said yesterday that it would raise that ceiling to $60,000 for students entering this fall. 
The students themselves will still be expected to make some payments from jobs they hold. 
 Harvard's president, Lawrence H. Summers, said in a statement, ''There is no more important mission for Harvard and higher education than promoting equality of opportunity for all.'' 
 He said the financial aid increases ''send a clear signal to middle-class families who have all too often felt that Harvard and other leading universities are out of reach.''
 In 1998, Princeton, one of the colleges with the highest endowment per student, announced that it would replace loans with grants for students from families with annual incomes less than $46,500. Five years ago, it extended that policy to all undergraduates. That was a move that few colleges felt ready to match. 
 But since Harvard's announcement in 2004, there has been a succession of announcements of higher-aid programs by top-tier colleges. 
 Also in 2004, Brown said that a $100 million gift to the university would allow it to replace loans with grants for about 135 students. 
 Last year, Yale said it would eliminate the contribution required of parents earning less than $45,000, an plan similar to Harvard's.
 This month there has been a profusion of announcements. In early March, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said it would begin matching the federal Pell Grants that its low-income students got. Pell grants are currently $4,050 a year. 
 M.I.T., which will charge $43,550 for tuition, housing and meals, said that 16 percent of its undergraduates came from homes with incomes below $42,000, and that 90 percent of its undergraduates qualified for financial aid. 
 Stanford University said this month that it would eliminate the parental contribution for families with annual incomes below $45,000. Last week, the University of Pennsylvania said it would replace loans with grants for undergraduates from economically disadvantaged families with incomes of $50,000 or less.
 Some financial aid officials applauded the announcements.
 ''If you step back and forget my role as a financial aid director and focus on helping needy students, this is great,'' Michael D. Bartini, director of financial aid at Brown, said yesterday.

HEADLINE: The Road to Dubai

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
For now, at least, the immigration issue is mainly hurting the Republican Party, which is divided between those who want to expel immigrants and those who want to exploit them. The only thing the two factions seem to have in common is mean-spiritedness.
 But immigration remains a difficult issue for liberals. Let me say a bit more about the subject of my last column, the uncomfortable economics of immigration, then turn to what really worries me: the political implications of a large nonvoting work force. 
About the economics: the crucial divide isn't between legal and illegal immigration; it's between high-skilled and low-skilled immigrants. High-skilled immigrants -- say, software engineers from South Asia -- are, by any criterion I can think of, good for America. But the effects of low-skilled immigration are mixed at best.
 True, there are large benefits for the low-skilled migrants, who may find even a minimum-wage U.S. job a big step up. Immigration also raises the total income of native-born Americans, although reasonable estimates suggest that these gains amount to no more than a fraction of 1 percent.
 But low-skilled immigration depresses the wages of less-skilled native-born Americans. And immigrants increase the demand for public services, including health care and education. Estimates indicate that low-skilled immigrants don't pay enough in taxes to cover the cost of providing these services.
 All of these effects, except for the gains for the immigrants themselves, are fairly small. Some of my friends say that's the point I should stress: immigration is a wonderful thing for the immigrants, and claims that immigrants are undermining American workers and taxpayers are hugely overblown -- end of story.
 But it's important to be intellectually honest, even when it hurts. Moreover, what really worries me isn't the narrow economics -- it's the political economy, the effects of having a disenfranchised labor force.
 Imagine, for a moment, a future in which America becomes like Kuwait or Dubai, a country where a large fraction of the work force consists of illegal immigrants or foreigners on temporary visas -- and neither group has the right to vote. Surely this would be a betrayal of our democratic ideals, of government of the people, by the people. Moreover, a political system in which many workers don't count is likely to ignore workers' interests: it's likely to have a weak social safety net and to spend too little on services like health care and education. 
 This isn't idle speculation. Countries with high immigration tend, other things equal, to have less generous welfare states than those with low immigration. U.S. cities with ethnically diverse populations -- often the result of immigration -- tend to have worse public services than those with more homogeneous populations. 
 Of course, America isn't Dubai. But we're moving in that direction. As of 2002, according to the Urban Institute, 14 percent of U.S. workers, and 20 percent of low-wage workers, were immigrants. Only a third of these immigrant workers were naturalized citizens. So we already have a large disenfranchised work force, and it's growing rapidly. The goal of immigration reform should be to reverse that trend.
 So what do I think of the Senate Judiciary Committee's proposal, which is derived from a plan sponsored by John McCain and Ted Kennedy? I'm all in favor of one provision: offering those already here a possible route to permanent residency and citizenship. Since we aren't going to deport more than 10 million people, we need to integrate those people into our society. 
 But I'm puzzled by the plan to create a permanent guest-worker program, one that would admit 400,000 more workers a year (and you know that business interests would immediately start lobbying for an increase in that number). Isn't institutionalizing a disenfranchised work force a big step away from democracy?
 For a hard-line economic conservative like Mr. McCain, the advantages to employers of a cheap work force may be more important than the violation of democratic principles. But why would someone like Mr. Kennedy go along? Is the point to help potential immigrants, or is it to buy support from business interests?
 Either way, it's a dangerous route to go down. America's political system is already a lot less democratic in practice than it is on paper, and creating a permanent nonvoting working class would make things worse. The road to Dubai may be paved with good intentions.

HEADLINE: Water, Water Anywhere

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
THE temperate climate and abundant wildlife were what first drew Daysi and Jorge Morey to the somnolent coastal town of Palm Coast, Fla., a four-and-a-half-hour drive north from their Miami apartment. Now they have another reason for owning a vacation home there: rising property values.
 It was only about eight months ago that the Moreys paid just under $1 million for their four-bedroom, five-and-a-half-bath house in an amenity-rich resort community, a two-minute walk from the beach. If they sold it today, they said they were told, they could get at least $1.5 million.
''I think that's still pretty reasonable for something so close to the water,'' said Mrs. Morey, who runs a real estate business with her husband and has seen firsthand how prices in South Florida, where they specialize, have skyrocketed over the last few years. 
 But Florida is hardly the only hot spot for vacation properties. Even as the rest of the residential market is cooling, second-home sales in many parts of the country -- especially near the water -- continue to thrive, real estate specialists say. The reasons, they say, include still-low mortgage rates and continued demand from recreation-minded baby boomers, who are flush with cash or equity in their primary residences. Many are buying with retirement in mind, while others see real estate as a stable investment.
 Indeed, sales of recreational homes, which totaled 1.02 million in 2004 and 850,000 in 2003, reached record levels last year, said Walter Molony, a spokesman for the National Association of Realtors, citing preliminary results of a survey conducted last month by the association. A report with the final numbers is expected to be released next week, he said. ''The demographics are very bright for the second-home marketplace,'' said David Lereah, the group's chief economist. He predicts that second-home sales will continue to edge up this year, with rates on 30-year conventional mortgages expected to remain below 7 percent. But he also says he believes that prices will stabilize, particularly in those hot resort areas that have attracted speculative buying. 
 ''Those days of 20 percent price appreciation per year are probably over for most markets,'' he said, ''and I think that's a good thing.'' 
 FEW brokers and developers, though, say that they have seen much of a falloff so far this year (aside from the normal seasonal slowdown just after the holidays).
 And nowhere has the rise in second-home prices been more prevalent, they say, than with properties on or near water, where most people seem to want to be despite last year's hurricane disasters. 
 ''You're going to pay a 25 percent premium for a view and 50 percent to be on the water,'' said David Hehman, chief executive of EscapeHomes.com, an online marketplace for second homes and resort properties. He puts the nationwide average price of an oceanfront home at around $1 million, about 30 percent higher than last year. (By contrast, the average price of all homes sold by real estate agents that list on his site is $355,000, up from around $300,000, he said, though that encompasses everything from tiny cottages in the woods to multimillion-dollar spreads.)
 The priciest coastal areas, according to EscapeHomes.com, continue to be in California, South Florida, parts of the Northeast and Hawaii, with interest in the Big Island, in particular, growing this year. 
 For Diane Saatchi, a senior vice president of the Corcoran Group who specializes in the Hamptons, on Long Island, one of the hottest beach areas in the country, ''the activity is surprisingly strong on the buying side.''
 ''The feeling was that the increase in interest rates we had was going to make people more cautious about buying second homes, but so far that hasn't happened -- the market seems impervious,'' she said. ''I hear more regrets from people who have waited.'' 
 Indeed, home prices in the Hamptons are up 8 to 10 percent from last year, according to Ms. Saatchi, with the median price now at $800,000. And that actually might seem like a bargain given the ever-growing inventory of homes in the eight-digit price range there, including a nine-acre oceanfront spread in Southampton on the market now for $62.5 million. Not to be outdone, there's also a 60-acre estate in Bridgehampton for $75 million, complete with its own golf course. 
 Even less flashy beach communities, though, like South Padre Island, Tex. -- where buyers can still pick up a two-bedroom condominium with a water view for less than $300,000 -- have experienced price gains. ''The appreciation has been great down here, about 10 percent,'' said Nathan Konopka, an agent with Realty Executives, noting, too, a steady increase in luxury developments on South Padre, in the Gulf of Mexico, like the Sapphire South Padre, a 30-story condominium just breaking ground.
 Mr. Hehman and other real estate specialists say that sticker-shocked buyers have increasingly been heading to getaways in less upscale, though not necessarily less appealing, areas like South Padre Island. And while price certainly plays a role in deciding where to buy, Mr. Hehman said that ''the recent natural disasters have made some people go farther up north.''
 Some of the most sought-after second-home destinations on EscapeHomes.com, based on Web site searches, include areas far from the southern shorelines, like Bend, Ore., and the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, as well as locales just on the periphery of the so-called hot spots: Holden Beach, N.C., in the Outer Banks, about 50 miles north of Myrtle Beach, S.C.; Flagstaff, Ariz., 30 miles from Sedona; and Palm Bay, Fla., a two-hour drive north of Palm Beach. (Also on the list: perennial favorites like Tampa, Fla.; Myrtle Beach; and Park City, Utah, a ski resort.) 
 Diane L. Jackson, an independent broker in Flagstaff, said that people who buy second homes there, a two-and-a-half-hour drive north from Phoenix, come for the many year-round activities -- hiking, canoeing and elaborate biking and jogging trails -- as well as the stunning vistas, including that of the vast ponderosa pine forests of Coconino National Forest. Median home prices are also a lot lower than in nearby Sedona -- about $325,000 in Flagstaff, she said, which is roughly the Sedona entry price. Small condos and manufactured homes in Flagstaff can be found in the $200,000 range.
 But as word of the area's affordability gets out, finding a place there is becoming more challenging. ''Every house I looked at got sold out from underneath me,'' said David Hall, a geologist from Levittown, Pa., who with the help of Ms. Jackson bought a three-bedroom ranch-style house on 2.5 acres, for $220,000, three months ago. He and his wife, Evelyn, are planning to rent it out and hope eventually to retire there. 
 Another area getting attention lately is Palm Coast, Fla., about 25 miles north of Daytona Beach and where the Moreys have their vacation home. ''There's a different energy here,'' Mrs. Morey said. She and her husband like having the pools (there are eight) and golf course in their development, called Hammock Beach, but they are also enamored with the small-town ambience, the parks and the assorted wildlife. (Their children and grandchildren, frequent visitors to their three-story, 4,500-square-foot retreat, just love watching the dolphins swim, they say.)
 Though prices are still considerably less than those in many other parts of Florida, the area is steadily shifting to a market primarily of vacation or retirement homes, and the prices are starting to reflect the change, according to Jolita Barry, a local broker at By Appointment Only Realty. Two-bedroom oceanfront condos start at about $900,000, she said, though units by the Intracoastal Waterway start at about $300,000 and are as low as $120,000 farther inland. 
 (Mrs. Morey said that a comparable two-bedroom oceanfront condo in Miami Beach or Key Biscayne would start at $1.2 million to $1.7 million. Some real estate analysts, though, expect prices in South Florida, which has seen extensive growth in building, to level off.)
 THE trick, it seems, may be in finding those hidden gems. (Of course, there's no guarantee those areas will turn into the next Lake Tahoe or Myrtle Beach.) ''The emerging markets are the fun ones,'' Mr. Lereah said, ''because they haven't really been discovered.'' 
 At least not by many people from outside the area.
 South Padre Island, near the southernmost point of Texas, has always attracted a local clientele as well as college students on spring break, but only in the last year or so, brokers say, has it been discovered by outsiders looking for affordable beach homes. Similar bargains are also available a causeway away on the mainland, in Port Isabel.
 Buyers can still find two-bedroom, two-bathroom condos on the side of Laguna Madre Bay in the $200,000 range, according to Mr. Konopka of Realty Executives, though similarly-sized beachfront condos on the Gulf of Mexico cost at least double. Houses usually start at around $300,000, he added. 
 ''We've been getting people from all over the country, as well as in Canada, Mexico and the U.K.,'' Mr. Konopka said. ''It doesn't make any sense to pay a million when you can get the same thing for $430,000.''
 Robert Carnahan, an engineer from Bingen, Wash., certainly felt that way. Mr. Carnahan, who was drawn to South Padre Island for its good windsurfing and kite-boarding, said that in November he spent around $200,000 -- ''an absolute steal'' -- for a two-bedroom condo on the Gulf of Mexico in a 10-story building. He plans to use it part of the year and rent it out the rest.
 Other ''areas to keep an eye on,'' according to data provided by EscapeHomes.com, include Kings Bay, Ga., on the southeast coast; Mountain Home, Ark.; and Spirit Lake, Idaho. 
 Brokers in those communities say they are seeing a steady pickup in interest. For example, in Mountain Home (population 11,100), tucked deep into the Ozark Mountains, second homes made up only 10 percent of the market three to five years ago, but today it's 15 to 20 percent, said Rodney Wagner, the principal broker and owner of the Mountain Home Real Estate Company. A big attraction is the trout fishing on the White and Norfork Rivers, along with relatively low prices and low property taxes. 
 ''We just closed on a spectacular new house -- 1,855 square feet, three-bedroom, two-bath five miles west of Mountain Home -- for $140,000,'' Mr. Wagner said. 
 But prices shouldn't be the only criterion for buying, said Andrew Schiller, founder and president of Location Inc., a company that specializes in relocation software and runs the home search Web site NeighborhoodScout.com.
 ''When people purchase vacation homes they're investing in a location as well as a family retreat,'' Mr. Schiller said. ''It makes sense to invest in a community that has quality schools. Better quality schools will command higher values. In a lot of vacation places people do live there year-round, because of the way people telecommute with their jobs now.'' 
 Mr. Schiller has his own list of emerging-market favorites as well. They include: Blue Hill, Me.; Guilford, Conn.; Somers Point, N.J.; Carolina Beach, N.C.; Mount Pleasant, S.C.; Port St. Joe, Fla.; Oak Harbor, Wash.; Gold Beach, Ore.; and Arcata, Calif. 
 And then there are once-popular areas that are popular again, like the Poconos. In some areas you can buy property for less than $100,000, brokers say, although more places cost at least $300,000. ''Business is brisk,'' said Kathleen Caponigro, an agent with Wilkins & Associates Real Estate in Mount Pocono, Pa. ''The Poconos are a good alternative for people who are priced out of the Hamptons and the Jersey Shore.''
 Barbi Yellin of Merrick, N.Y., said that she and her husband, Reuven, who bought a four-bedroom lakefront house in the Lake in the Clouds community in the central part of the Poconos two months ago for $375,000, ''absolutely did not want the Hamptons.''
 ''It's too expensive and too much of a 'happening,' '' said Mrs. Yellin, a Hebrew teacher and one of Ms. Caponigro's clients. ''We wanted a neighborhood, not a scene.'' 
 Another of Ms. Caponigro's clients, Lisa Bloom, an anchor and commentator on Court TV, bought a chalet-style four-bedroom house near the Camelback ski resort about 16 months ago. 
 Ms. Bloom and her teenage son and daughter spend almost every weekend there -- it's just a 90-minute drive from their Manhattan condo -- swimming, hiking and horseback riding in the warmer months and skiing, snowboarding, sledding (and sometimes igloo building) in the winter. They also bring along plenty of guests but leave behind the P.C.'s, TV's and makeup. (Ms. Bloom says she rarely wears any out there.)
 ''All day long I have to talk about blood, guts and gore; it's wonderful to be able to get away from it all, and so quickly,'' she said. 
 Sometimes, of course, it's not always easy. Like the day she was scheduled to close the deal on her house. It was Nov. 12, 2004, and a jury had finally reached a guilty verdict in the Scott Peterson murder trial. ''I was literally dashing off the set,'' she said, ''trying to find all the closing papers.''

GETTTING WARMER
 Myrtle Beach? Not Yet
 LOOKING for the next Myrtle Beach or Lake Tahoe? Here are a few of the emerging markets for second homes, according to NeighborhoodScout.com and EscapeHomes.com.
 Arcata, Calif. -- It is on California's redwood coast, about 275 miles north of San Francisco and near Humboldt Bay. Attractions include the Arcata Community Forest, the Arcata Marsh and Wildlife Sanctuary and Humboldt State University. 
 Spirit Lake, Idaho. -- The lake, in northern Idaho, has a city park with a public beach and is surrounded by forests with hiking and biking trails, along with the Selkirk Mountains to the north and west. 
 Port St. Joe, Fla. -- On the north Gulf Coast of Florida between Panama City and Apalachicola, this historic community is known for its fishing tournaments and boating. Nearby are St. Joseph's State Park Beach and the St. Vincent National Wildlife Refuge, an entire island with long and empty beaches. 
 Gold Beach, Ore. -- At least eight major rivers and dozens of creeks run through this southern coastal town, just 50 miles north of the California border. The area is known for its fishing, hiking and kayaking. 
 Port Isabel, Tex. -- This coastal community in southeastern Texas has full-service boat yards and marinas, along with museums and the historic Point Isabel Lighthouse. 
 Somers Point, N.J. -- Seven miles west of Atlantic City, on the Great Egg Harbor River bayfront, it is in an area is known for its marinas and boating. 
 Louisa, Ky. -- This eastern Kentucky city, near the West Virginia border, is home to the Yakesville Lake State Park and is recognized as one of the state's best fishing sites for bass.
 Bluffton, S.C. -- Across the bridge from Hilton Head Island and near the Pinckney Island National Wildlife Refuge, Bluffton borders the May and Colleton Rivers. Antebellum homes and historic churches line its historic district. VIVIAN MARINO

HEADLINE: Blacks Turn to Internet Highway, And Digital Divide Starts to Close

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT

 BODY:
African-Americans are steadily gaining access to and ease with the Internet, signaling a remarkable closing of the ''digital divide'' that many experts had worried would be a crippling disadvantage in achieving success. 
 Civil rights leaders, educators and national policy makers warned for years that the Internet was bypassing blacks and some Hispanics as whites and Asian-Americans were rapidly increasing their use of it.
 But the falling price of laptops, more computers in public schools and libraries and the newest generation of cellphones and hand-held devices that connect to the Internet have all contributed to closing the divide, Internet experts say.
 Another powerful influence in attracting blacks and other minorities to the Internet has been the explosive evolution of the Internet itself, once mostly a tool used by researchers, which has become a cultural crossroad of work, play and social interaction. 
 Studies and mounting anecdotal evidence now suggest that blacks, even some of those at the lower end of the economic scale, are making significant gains. As a result, organizations that serve African-Americans, as well as companies seeking their business, are increasingly turning to the Internet to reach out to them.
 ''What digital divide?'' Magic Johnson, the basketball legend, asked rhetorically in an interview about his new Internet campaign deal with the Ford Motor Company's Lincoln Mercury division to use the Internet to promote cars to black prospective buyers.
 The sharpest growth in Internet access and use is among young people. But blacks and other members of minorities of various ages are also merging onto the digital information highway as never before. 
 According to a Pew national survey of people 18 and older, completed in February, 74 percent of whites go online, 61 percent of African-Americans do and 80 percent of English-speaking Hispanic-Americans report using the Internet. The survey did not look at non-English-speaking Hispanics, who some experts believe are not gaining access to the Internet in large numbers. 
 In a similar Pew survey in 1998, just 42 percent of white American adults said they used the Internet while only 23 percent of African-American adults did so. Forty percent of English-speaking Hispanic-Americans said they used the Internet. 
 Despite the dissolving gap, some groups like the Intel Computer Clubhouse Network, which introduces digital technologies to young people, say the digital divide is still vast in more subtle ways. Instant messaging and downloading music is one thing, said Marlon Orozco, program manager at the network's Boston clubhouse, but he would like to see black and Hispanic teenagers use the Internet in more challenging ways, like building virtual communities or promoting their businesses.
 Vicky Rideout, vice president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, which has studied Internet use by race, ethnicity and age, cautioned that a new dimension of the digital divide might be opening because groups that were newer to the Internet tended to use less-advanced hardware and had slower connection speeds.
 ''The type and meaningful quality of access is, in some ways, a more challenging divide that remains,'' Ms. Rideout said. ''This has an impact on things like homework.'' 
 In addition, Internet access solely at institutions can put students at a disadvantage. Schools and other institutions seldom operate round the clock, seven days a week, which is especially an issue for students, said Andy Carvin, coordinator for the Digital Divide Network, an international group that seeks to close the gap.
 But not everyone agrees that minorities tend toward less-advanced use of the Internet. Pippa Norris, a lecturer on comparative politics at Harvard who has written extensively about the digital divide, said members of minorities had been shown to use the Internet to search for jobs and to connect to a wide variety of educational opportunities.
 ''The simple assumption that the Internet is a luxury is being disputed by this group,'' Ms. Norris said.
 The divide was considered so dire a decade ago that scholars, philanthropists and even President Bill Clinton in his 1996 State of the Union address fretted over just what the gap would mean in lost educational and employment opportunities for young people who were not wired. 
 In an effort to help erase the divide, the federal government has provided low-cost connections for schools, libraries, hospitals and health clinics, allocated money to expand in-home access to computers and the Internet for low-income families and given tax incentives to companies donating computer and technical training and for sponsoring community learning centers. 
 As a result of such efforts, ''most kids, almost all kids, have a place in which they can go online and have gone online,'' said Ms. Rideout of the Kaiser foundation. 
 Jason Jordan of Boston is one of the young people closing the divide. Jason, 17, who is black, is getting a used computer from an older brother. He said he had wanted a computer for years, since ''I heard about a lot that I was missing.'' 
 Jason said he had access to the Internet at school, where he is pursuing a general equivalency diploma, but looked forward to having his own computer and Web access at his home in the Dorchester section of Boston. ''I can work in my own place and don't have to worry about the time I'm online,'' he said.
 Like Jason, almost 9 out of 10 of the 21 million Americans ages 12 to 17 use the Internet, according to a report issued in July by the Pew Internet and American Life Project. Of them, 87 percent of white teenagers say they use the Internet, while 77 percent of black teenagers and 89 percent of Hispanic teenagers say they have access to it, the report said. 
 The gap in access among young Americans is less pronounced than among their parents' generation, said Susannah Fox, associate director of the Pew project. ''Age continues to be a strong predictor for Internet use,'' Ms. Fox said.
 While, overall Internet use among blacks still significantly trails use among whites, the shrinking divide is most vividly reflected in the online experience of people like Billy and Barbara Johnson. Less than two years ago, the Johnsons, who are black, plugged into the Internet in their upscale suburban home near Atlanta for the first time. Mrs. Johnson, a 52-year-old mother of four and homemaker, said she felt she had little choice because her school-age children needed to use the Internet for research.
 And then there is e-mail. ''No one really wants to take the time anymore to pick up the phone and keep in touch,'' lamented Mrs. Johnson, who said that so much of the communications with her children's school was done through e-mail correspondence. ''I felt like I was pretty much forced into it.'' 
 Even so, Mrs. Johnson said her husband, an assistant coach for the Atlanta Falcons, still chided her when she neglected to check her e-mail at least every day. 
 Ms. Norris and other experts on Internet use see progress on the horizon. They note that the declining cost of laptop and other computers, and efforts, like those in Philadelphia, to provide low-cost wireless Internet access, are likely to increase online access for groups that have been slow to connect.
 Philanthropic efforts have also helped to give more people Internet access. For example, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has awarded $250 million since 1997 for American public libraries to create Internet access for the public. Martha Choe, the foundation's director of global libraries, said some 47,000 computers had been bought for 11,000 libraries. Today, Ms. Choe said, most libraries in the United States have public Internet access. 
 Education levels remain a major indicator of who is among the 137 million Americans using the Internet and who is not, said Ms. Fox. 
 There is also a strong correlation, experts say, between household income and Internet access. 
 With so many more members of minorities online, some Web sites are trying to capitalize on their new access. For example, the New York/New Jersey region of the State of the African American Male, a national initiative to improve conditions for black men, is encouraging men to use digital equipment to ''empower themselves'' to better their lives. The site, which includes studies, public policy reports and other information about issues related to black men, promotes using digital cameras, mobile phones and iPods, but mainly computers, to organize through the Internet, said Walter Fields, vice president for government relations for the Community Service Society, an antipoverty organization, and a coordinator of the black-male initiative. Users are encouraged to submit articles, write blogs and upload pertinent photographs and video clips.
 ''What we're doing is playing against the popular notion of a digital divide,'' Mr. Fields said. ''I always felt that it was a misnomer.''

HEADLINE: Rice Floats the Idea of U.N. Sanctions on Iran, but China and Russia Reject It

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY

DATELINE: BERLIN, March 30 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, meeting here on Thursday with representatives of the other four permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, raised the idea of imposing unspecified sanctions on Iran, but she received a decidedly cool reaction from China and Russia. 
 Her proposal came a day after the Security Council approved a statement criticizing the Iranian nuclear program that was a result of heavy compromise. Previously, she had said that sanctions were a possibility but that it was premature to discuss them. 
Her proposal was described to reporters in a briefing aboard her plane by a senior State Department official, and she did not comment directly on her proposal during a news conference after the three-and-a-half-hour meeting here on Thursday.
 But Dai Bingguo, China's vice minister of foreign affairs, rejected the idea of sanctions and offered a thinly veiled criticism of the war in Iraq when he said: ''The Chinese side feels there has already been enough turmoil in the Middle East. We don't need any more turmoil.''
 The Security Council approved the statement on Wednesday after three weeks of debate. Ms. Rice and her aides praised it on Thursday, even though it was far weaker than the one the United States had originally proposed. It calls on the International Atomic Energy Agency, the nuclear monitoring arm of the United Nations, to report within 30 days on Iran's progress toward curtailing its nuclear development work. The report then goes to the Security Council, giving it an opportunity to respond.
 After months of diplomacy, the United States persuaded a majority of the agency's board to report Iran to the Security Council last month. 
 Ms. Rice noted on Thursday that Russia had wanted to remove the language from the Security Council statement calling for a referral to the Security Council, which would have effectively returned the case to the atomic energy agency. Russia backed down from its demand, under American pressure.
 As it is, Russia and China bluntly declared on Thursday that they had no interest in imposing sanctions of any sort or in taking any further action against Iran, though both countries did express concern about the nuclear program. Russian and Chinese officials said they wanted to refer the issue back to the atomic energy agency.
 ''Russia believes that the sole solution for this problem will be based on the work of the I.A.E.A.,'' said the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov. 
 American officials say Iran is unlikely to budge from its confrontational position unless it is offered ''in addition to carrots some sticks,'' the senior official traveling with Ms. Rice said Thursday evening. ''Iran needs to know there will be consequences if it continues to hold out.''
 But the same opposition that forced the United States to accept a weaker Security Council statement than it had wanted seems likely to make it difficult to impose sanctions or other actions against Iran to persuade it to back down.
 Iran's foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, speaking at a disarmament conference in Geneva on Thursday, described the Security Council action as ''political maneuvering by some Western countries'' and ''an abuse of international mechanisms.''
 On her way here Wednesday night, Ms. Rice said the meeting was being held to begin discussions of ''the next steps'' to be taken against Iran, now that the Security Council statement had been approved. Later, after Russia's and China's public rebukes of the idea of taking further action, the senior administration official, briefing reporters, offered a different goal for the meeting, saying it had been an effort to keep together the coalition of nations opposed to Iran's nuclear program. 
 The official, who briefed reporters traveling with Ms. Rice under the ground rule that he not be identified by name, said several nations, presumably European countries, had supported the notion of unspecified sanctions after Ms. Rice proposed the idea. He would not name the nations. 
 Ms. Rice alluded to the sort of sanctions the United States would be likely to propose when, speaking to reporters on her way here, she said the United States and its allies would look at ''how a strong message can be sent to the Iranian regime that it's the regime that is isolated, not the Iranian people.''
 The senior official said Ms. Rice was referring to the idea of imposing travel bans on senior Iranian officials and freezing their foreign bank accounts, as the United States and Europe say they intend to do with regard to Belarus.

HEADLINE: Bush Reassures Mexico Leader Of His Backing For Immigrants 

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON and DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: CANCUN, Mexico, March 30 

 BODY:
President Bush, in an effort to reassure Mexicans and to defuse an intense debate in the United States, told President Vicente Fox of Mexico on Thursday that he supported proposals to legalize undocumented workers as long as they were not given any advantages over immigrants who entered the United States legally.
 ''I explained to the president my vision of the citizenship issue,'' Mr. Bush said, as Mr. Fox sat next to him during their summit meeting here. ''If they want to become a citizen, they can get in line, but not the head of the line.'' 
 In another comment aimed at critics within his Republican Party, Mr. Bush also talked about his support for guest-worker programs as part of an effort to open safe, legal and orderly channels for migrant workers into the United States. Opponents of the plans say they amount to opening floodgates to hundreds of thousands of workers who will cross the border from Mexico each year.
 Mr. Bush said he told had Mr. Fox that he was committed to signing a ''comprehensive immigration bill.''
 ''And by 'comprehensive,' I mean not only a bill that has border security in it,'' Mr. Bush said, ''but a bill that has a worker permit program in it. That's an important part of having a border that works.
 ''We don't want people sneaking into our country that are going to do jobs Americans won't do. We want them coming in in an orderly way, which will take pressure off of both our borders.''
 Changes in immigration law have been more fiercely debated in Congress since Monday, when the Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill that would provide legal status to an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants and allow 400,000 foreigners a year to enter the United States as guest workers. The proposals have bitterly divided the Republican Party between those who see immigrant labor as a pillar of the American economy, and those who view it as a burden, even a threat.
 The issue has dominated talks between Mr. Bush and Mr. Fox for most of their presidencies. Though the content of Thursday's talks was no different, the ambitions of the two leaders -- with Mr. Bush burdened by the lowest approval ratings of his presidency, and Mr. Fox deep into his final term-- was sharply diminished.
 Five years ago, a newly elected Mr. Fox, buoyed by his standing as the man who peacefully ended seven decades of authoritarian rule, stood on the White House lawn and challenged the United States to work with his government on proposals that would open the border to a freer flow of workers from Mexico. 
 On Thursday, speaking to reporters, Mr. Fox acknowledged that the fate of immigration law was out of his and President Bush's hands.
 ''It is not here, in these meetings, where a migration agreement is made,'' he said. ''It is now an issue for the Congress of the United States, and there, they will make the decision. It is no longer between President Bush and President Fox.'' 
 Mr. Fox addressed American critics who have accused Mexico of encouraging its people to migrate illegally. Mexico's economy depends heavily on the estimated $16 billion that the migrants send home annually. 
 Mr. Fox said that if Congress reorganized immigration, ''Mexico assumes its responsibilities to work with passion, with commitment, diligently, to develop opportunities for our people.''
 Earlier in the day, Mr. Bush visited the 1,500-year-old Mayan ruins at Chichen Itza, a rare moment of tourism for a president who usually has little patience for sightseeing. White House officials added the stop as a show of respect for Mexico's heritage. 
 Back in Cancun, Mr. Bush's motorcade sped past the ruined carcasses of hotels wiped out last year in Hurricane Wilma. He stayed at a small, luxurious resort protected by Navy vessels that bobbed offshore.
 Mr. Bush also met separately with Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada to discuss a long-running dispute over American imports of softwood lumber, which has grown more bitter as industries on both sides of the border have sought rulings in different international settings, starting in the Clinton administration. 
 Mr. Bush said of Mr. Harper, ''I appreciate his steely resolve to get something done.'' But he gave no indication of any change in American policy.

HEADLINE: Blue Chips Fall on Worries Of Extended Fed Rate Rises

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks ended lower yesterday after economic data created new concerns about inflation and pushed Treasury yields to their highest level in nearly two years.
 Before the market opened, the Commerce Department released data on fourth-quarter gross domestic product that showed a core inflation measure -- the price index for personal spending excluding food and energy -- was revised higher.
 Home builders, financial services companies and other interest-rate-sensitive stocks fell on fears that the Federal Reserve will have to extend its campaign of rate increases to keep inflation in check. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average declined 65 points, or 0.6 percent, to 11,150.70. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.64 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,300.25. The Nasdaq eked out a slim gain as fund managers sought to add technology shares to their portfolios before the quarter ends. It rose 3.04 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,340.82.
 3M gave back its gains from Wednesday's session, when it had risen on an upgrade. It closed at $76.52, down 1.3 percent, or $1.04.
 A jump in oil futures prices also weighed on stocks. Crude oil for May delivery gained 70 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $67.15 a barrel as Iran, a major oil exporter, said it would not comply with the United Nations Security Council's request to stop its uranium enrichment programs.
 Shares of Citigroup and Bank of America, the nation's two largest banks, declined. Citigroup fell 0.7 percent, or 35 cents, to $47.28, while Bank of America slipped 0.8 percent, or 36 cents, to $45.61. 
 Beazer Homes USA decreased 2 percent, or $1.32, to $65.84, while shares of Hovnanian Enterprises fell 2.3 percent, or $1.04, to $44.05. The Dow Jones home builders index was down 1.4 percent.
 Software makers buoyed the Nasdaq, with Symantec up $1.05, or 6.6 percent, to $17.05. Microsoft climbed 21 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $27.23. Shares of the video game maker Electronics Arts rose $1.59, or 3 percent, to $54.19.
 Google was the biggest drag on the Nasdaq after the Web search company said it would sell more shares worth $2 billion. Google shares fell 1.7 percent, or $6.54, to $388.44.
 Gold and silver, often used by investors as a hedge against inflation, both climbed. Gold for June delivery hit $592 an ounce -- the highest futures price since January 1981 -- in morning trading. It settled at $591.80 an ounce.
 The benchmark May silver contract reached a 23-year high, settling 54.5 cents higher at $11.66 an ounce.
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note declined 13/32, to a price of 97 13/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.86 percent from 4.80 percent on Wednesday.
 Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of 14-day cash management bills: 

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Price: 99.817

HEADLINE: 4th-Quarter Growth Put at 1.7%

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Energy costs now take up more than 6 percent of household spending in the United States, up from 4.2 percent just a few years ago, the Commerce Department reported yesterday as it released the final revision of economic growth statistics for the fourth quarter of last year. 
 Over all, the statistics showed, the economy grew at an annual pace of 1.7 percent in the quarter, up a bit from the previous estimate of 1.6 percent.
The core rate of inflation in personal consumption costs, excluding food and energy, came in at an annual rate of 2.4 percent, above the 2.1 percent previously reported. The Federal Reserve has sometimes pointed to the core rate in assessing inflationary risks in the economy.
 Another measure of economic health, final sales of domestic products, adjusted for inflation, fell in the quarter for the first time since the first three months of 2002, when the economy was suffering the effects of recession and reeling from the Sept. 11 attacks.
 The energy cost figures, while up, are far from unprecedented, which may help to explain why the economy has not been more severely affected by the rise in oil prices. Including both household utility costs for electricity and oil, and drivers' fuel costs, the share for energy use climbed to 6.2 percent of personal consumption expenses.
 That is the highest in 15 years, but it is far below the peak of 9.3 percent reached in the first quarter of 1981, during the second oil-price shock. In 1972, before the first oil supply cutoff caused lines at gasoline stations and sent prices soaring, energy costs were also 6.2 percent. 
 Since the 1970's, some vehicles have become more fuel-efficient, and other conservation measures have limited the amount of power needed to keep the economy growing.

HEADLINE: House, on Party Lines, Passes College Finance Bill

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30 

 BODY:
The House voted largely along party lines on Thursday to approve the main measure governing colleges and universities, adding provisions to expand student grants based on need and pressing colleges to control tuition. But the House rejected a Democratic proposal to halve the interest rate on student loans. 
 The $70 billion proposal, which would renew the law until 2012, sets the terms for loans and grants along with the limits for maximum aid. It was last renewed in 1998.
The floor debate showcased partisan differences over how to approach an era when increases in tuition routinely outpace inflation and the ability of many Americans to pay for college. Republicans, who are particularly striving to control a soaring budget deficit by avoiding new spending, said the bill would make college more affordable. 
 Democrats wanted to cut interest rates on student loans and enlarge Pell Grants, which had been frozen for several years.
 The average undergraduate now leaves college carrying nearly $18,000 in debt.
 In its final form, approved 221 to 199, the measure would simplify the financial aid application and make Pell Grants, the major grant that helps low- and middle-income students, available for summer study. The bill would also raise the spending cap on Pell Grants to $6,000, up from $5,800. The increase would be largely symbolic, however, as the maximum grant Congress appropriates has been frozen for four years at $4,050.
 The bill would require colleges and universities that raise tuition at more than twice the rate of inflation for three years in a row to explain the increases. But lawmakers abandoned a provision that would have set off audits by the Education Department in the event of increases. 
 The bill would set the interest rate for subsidized loans at 6.8 percent, regardless of whether commercial rates rise or fall. Republicans defeated an amendment introduced by Representative George Miller of California, the ranking Democrat on the Education and Workforce Committee, to halve the interest rate on student loans over the next year.
 In the floor debate over the last two days, the bill lost some of its most controversial proposals, programs that would have created a strong federal role in monitoring tuition increases and in reviewing the role of race in admissions decisions.

PERSON: John McGahern

HEADLINE: John McGahern, Chronicler of Irish Rural Life, Dies at 71

BYLINE: By JAMES F. CLARITY; Brian Lavery contributed reporting from Dublin for this obituary.

 BODY:
John McGahern, whose stark depiction of love and despair in repressive rural Ireland made him one of his country's most acclaimed fiction writers, died yesterday in Dublin. He was 71. 
 Mr. McGahern died of cancer at the Mater Private Hospital, where he had been admitted earlier in the day, his family said through a hospital spokeswoman.
 Mr. McGahern's six novels and three collections of short stories won prizes from the Irish literary establishment and accolades from his peers. To the novelist Colm Toibin, writing in ''The Penguin Book of Irish Fiction,'' Mr. McGahern had produced ''the most impressive body of work of any Irish writer in the second half of the century.'' 
 In recent years, Mr. McGahern (pronounced ma-GAH-ern) had become an elder statesmen of Irish letters. Word of his death led many broadcast news reports in Ireland on Thursday afternoon. 
 Most of his plots were set in his native Irish Midlands, where farmers scratched out a living and even rocks seemed to grow old. Always heavy and forbidding in the background was the hand of the powerful Roman Catholic Church.
 Because he was an Irish writer, Mr. McGahern was inevitably compared to James Joyce. Because his stories were set in the country, he was compared to Chekhov and Hardy. His style was terse. His novels moved deliberately through their agonies of love and misgiving, always with reference to the dominating Catholic culture and the rigors of wresting existence from the fields and the peat bogs. 
 There were no truly happy endings in his fiction. To the questions he posed about the meaning of life, he gave equivocal answers. Some characters stayed in the country and adjusted; others left. Most were nagged by doubt and guilt, caught between the lure of personal fulfillment in the outside world and the pull of family and home. Their Catholic faith often made them feel guilty about their sexuality. Critics said the themes gave his work a universal quality. 
 Although he lectured and gave readings of his work at universities in Britain and the United States, Mr. McGahern spent most of his time writing and dabbling at farming at his home in County Leitrim, an economically depressed and socially conservative corner of northwestern Ireland. And though his fiction was melancholy, he maintained a sharp sense of humor. He loved telling offbeat stories, often about other Irish writers, and he welcomed visitors who navigated the torturous country roads to the simple lakeside house that he shared with his wife, Madeline Green, an American.
 He gave few interviews, however. At a writing seminar in 1996 at the State University of New York at Albany, he said: ''Each of us has a private world, and the only difference between the reader and the writer is that the writer has the ability to describe and dramatize that private world. As a writer, I write to see. If I knew how it would end, I wouldn't write. It's a process of discovery.''
 He earned his widest recognition for his fifth novel, ''Amongst Women,'' published in 1990. It was on the short list for the Booker Prize and became the basis of a highly praised BBC miniseries in 1998. 
 ''Amongst Women'' tells the tale of Michael Moran, a former I.R.A. hero in the war against the British in 1919-21 that won independence for Ireland, leaving the north a British province. Moran finds that his celebrity fades when he becomes a simple farmer in the Midlands, near the town of Boyle. He isolates himself from his neighbors, devotes his life to his five children and marries a second wife, Rose. Again and again, Mr. McGahern has Daddy, as Moran is called, delving into gloomy existential doubt, even as he leads his family in reciting the rosary every night.
 He drives his oldest son, Luke, away with his household tyranny. He bullies a bright daughter into refusing a university scholarship. Still, his daughters feel that ''beneath all their differences was the belief that the whole house was essentially one.''
 ''Together they were one world and could take on the world. Deprived of this sense they were nothing, scattered, individual things. They would put up with anything in order to have this sense of belonging. They would never let it go. No one could be allowed to walk out easily.''
 As Moran dies, he asks his family harshly, ''Why aren't you praying?'' But when they kneel to pray, the last words of Moran's life are ''Shut up!'' 
 His mixed feelings of hope and despair echo those of another character, Elizabeth Reegan, in ''The Barracks'' (1962), Mr. McGahern's first novel and, in the view of some critics, his finest. Indeed, many critics regarded ''Amongst Women'' as his best work since ''The Barracks.'' Certainly there are parallels in characters and setting. 
 ''The Barracks'' drew on Mr. McGahern's boyhood, set in a live-in police station near Boyle. Mr. McGahern's own father, John, became a police officer after fighting with the I.R.A., and the family lived in police barracks for a time.
 On the novel's first page, the author used a device that became characteristic of his fiction: contrasting darkness and light in the surrounding fields and bog lands, depicting the bleakness of the outside world against the bright fires and shiny teacups of the home, the hopeful faces of children against the brooding tyranny of an unhappy father. 
 The stepmother in the household, Elizabeth Reegan, had been jilted by an intellectual dandy, then married an industrious but insensitive and embittered police sergeant. Between them there is affection, sometimes lovemaking, but no agreement on what the good life should be. They scorn the banality of rural existence even as they cling to the small routines and religious rituals of life at home with their children. 
 It is a livable life for Elizabeth, until she gets cancer. She despairs and wonders what kind of ''departure'' she will make. ''She'd be as blind with life, as ridiculously human as any other when it came her turn,'' Mr. McGahern writes. ''It was so fantastic, and so miraculous, that it could go in spite of having no known purpose, blind passion carrying it forward in spite of everything.'' 
 His second novel, ''The Dark'' (1965), brought Mr. McGahern celebrity and notoriety when it was banned by a conservative Irish government, influenced by the Catholic Church. The book describes a boy who agonizes over his masturbating because he also wants to become a priest. One scene suggests sexual advances by a priest. Mr. McGahern lost his elementary school teaching position as a result and went to live in Britain and later Paris. 
 Samuel Beckett, in Paris, and other Irish writers offered to campaign for the book, but Mr. McGahern declined, saying, ''When a book is published, it belongs to the reader, and the less the writer has to say about it, the better.'' 
 Afterward came ''The Leavetaking'' (1974), which portrays a teacher who is fired for marrying a divorced American woman. By then, Mr. McGahern had divorced and was married to Ms. Green, who survives him, as do four sisters. The couple had no children. 
 Another novel, ''The Pornographer'' (1979), told the story of a man who is dissatisfied with the casual sexuality of his life. Mr. McGahern's three books of short stories, dealing with the same themes as his novels, also pleased most critics; some compared the stories to Joyce's in ''Dubliners.'' 
 More than a decade after ''Amongst Women'' brought him international recognition, Mr. McGahern renewed his popularity in 2001 with his final novel, ''That They May Face the Rising Sun,'' published in the United States as ''By the Lake.'' Then came a critically acclaimed account of his life, published last year. Titled ''All Will Be Well: A Memoir,'' it rekindled appreciation for his clean, precise depictions of Irish rural life. 
 John McGahern, the eldest of seven children, was born on Nov. 12, 1934, in Dublin. His mother died when he was 10. Though his father and some of his characters were unhappy former I.R.A. guerrillas, he never praised the I.R.A. and said he ''hated nationalism'' of any stripe. Describing his boyhood in the Midlands, near Roscommon and Boyle, he wrote that there were few books in the house. But he discovered literature thanks to a pair of neighbors, whom he described as eccentric Protestant men living in a shabby mansion. He read Shakespeare but preferred ''Treasure Island'' and ''Robinson Crusoe.'' His favorite novelist was Jane Austen 
 Mr. McGahern said he was ''not a believer'' and did not go to church. Writing in the London newspaper The Independent in 1995, he said he had been put off by the ''almost total power'' the church held over Ireland of the 1940's and 50's. 
 ''The ordinary farming people had to conform to the strict observances,'' he wrote, ''and to pay their dues to the Church from small resources, but outside that they paid it little attention. They went about their sensible pagan lives as they had done for centuries, seeing it as just another of the fictions that they'd been forced to kowtow to, like all the others since the time of the Druids.''
 In one interview, noting Ireland's reputation as a birthplace of great writers, he said the Irish people ''write as badly as everywhere else.'' 
 ''I don't label myself as an Irish writer,'' he said, ''but there's nothing else I could be. A writer reflects his society by getting one's language right. My only concern is that I get the sentence right and describe my world clearly and deeply.''
 Acknowledging that many readers and critics found his work pessimistic, if not depressing, he offered a joke: ''My favorite optimist,'' he said, ''was an American who jumped off the Empire State Building, and as he passed the 42nd floor, the window washers heard him say, 'So far, so good.' ''

HEADLINE: Fewer Marshes + More Manmade Ponds = Increased Wetlands

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30 

 BODY:
In the bog of the federal regulatory code, a wetland is defined as a marshy area of saturated soils and plants whose roots spend part of their lives immersed in water. In the Interior Department's periodic national surveys, a wetland is defined, more or less, as wet. 
 Traditional tidal, coastal and upland marshes count, but so do golf course water hazards and other manmade ponds whose surface is less than 20 acres. 
 And so, even at a time of continued marsh depletion, pond inflation permitted Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton and Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns to announce proudly on Thursday the first net increase in wetlands since the Fish and Wildlife Service started measuring them in 1954. Wetlands acreage, measured largely by aerial surveys, totaled 107.7 million acres at the end of 2004, up by 191,800 acres from 1998. 
 The two cabinet secretaries hailed the apparent reversal in the long trend of wetland losses. ''I'm pleased to complete my term as secretary of interior by announcing some good news, said Ms. Norton, who will step down from her job Friday. 
 A net total of 523,500 acres of swamps and tidal marshes had been lost, but the Fish and Wildlife Service measured gains of 715,300 acres of shallow-water wetlands, or ponds. According to the report's author, Tom Dahl, those can be 20 to 30 feet deep.
 Almost two years ago, President Bush, under attack by environmental groups for loosening controls on development in wetlands, announced that one of his goals was to increase net wetland acreage. 
 For decades in the early and mid-20th century, draining and filling of wetlands by developers was widely accepted. But, as scientists and public officials recognized the importance of wetlands as nurseries for waterfowl, filters of pollution and barriers against storms, Congress passed protective laws.
 One multimillion-dollar project redirected parts of the Kissimmee River in central Florida out of the narrow 30-foot-deep channel constructed by the Army Corps of Engineers and allowed it once again to dampen the surrounding landscape. Another successful wetlands-restoration project in southwestern Indiana is undoing the work farmers did decades ago to drain their land.
 These projects helped hold down the net loss of marshland in Thursday's report. But the net gain noted in the report was fueled by an increase in pond acreage, which includes things like ornamental ponds in new developments and mine reclamation ponds.
 For instance, the mining of sand and clay for the construction of two major highways in South Carolina, Routes 22 and 31, left the Myrtle Beach area dotted with large, deep ponds that qualify as wetlands in the Interior Department's survey but do not provide the wildlife habitat or perform the filtering functions of tidal marshes or cypress swamps.
 ''For Route 22, there was nine million cubic yards of fill material needed,'' said Boyd Holt, a regional hydrogeologist for the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control. ''There were probably 30 or 40 ponds as a result of that activity since 1998.''
 At Thursday's news conference, federal officials said that the report measures the quantity -- not the quality -- of wetlands. Julie Sibbing, the leading wetlands expert at the National Wildlife Federation, called the mining-site ponds ''wet deserts.'' 
 ''The most stunning thing about this report,'' she said, ''is that we're losing diverse natural wetlands in this country and the administration tells us it's O.K. because we've increased the number of ponds.''
 The report, which covers 1998 to 2004, does not include the loss of 64,000 acres of coastal wetlands from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.

HEADLINE: Conflicts of Interest, or Right for the Job?

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
AT the outset, let's clear up one matter that will have a major impact on the steroid investigation that Commissioner Bud Selig announced yesterday. 
 The other day in this space, the assessment was offered that George J. Mitchell, the former Senate majority leader, was a diplomat but not an investigator. That's what happens when a man does so many notable things later in life. They cloud the things he did earlier in his life.
Harold Pachios, a lawyer in Portland, Me., and friend of Mitchell's, read what I had written and informed me, via an e-mail message, that Mitchell was ''for a long time a federal prosecutor who investigated scores of criminal cases and tried those criminal cases.'' 
 Before his work on the federal level, Pachios wrote, Mitchell was ''a state prosecutor who prosecuted criminals for years.'' He did all of that before he went into politics and became a United States senator from Maine.
 Mitchell cross-examined Oliver North in the Iran-contra affair and, more recently, led the United States Olympic Committee investigation of the Salt Lake City bribery scandal.
 In other words, the man is no stranger to the world of criminal investigation, which is good for the role Selig has asked him to perform. But Mitchell is also a director of the Boston Red Sox -- not an owner, but a director -- and the chairman of the Walt Disney Company.
 Those two positions have raised a question about a conflict of interest for Mitchell. Selig rejected the thought. ''He has impeccable credentials,'' Selig said yesterday in his office after the news conference.
 Mitchell also rejected the idea. ''If, in any way, anyone associated with the Red Sox is implicated, they will be treated just like everyone else,'' he said at the news conference. But he did not address his role with Disney.
 Mitchell's stewardship of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck may not present a conflict as he probes deeply into players' use of illegal performance-enhancing substances, but Disney owns ESPN, which has serious economic ties to Major League Baseball. 
 Mitchell, 72, was elected March 10 to a second term as Disney chairman. As of Feb. 21, his stock holdings included 65,234 shares, according to marketwatch.com. When the market closed yesterday, Disney was at $27.87, making Mitchell's holdings worth $1,818,071.
 Should Mitchell's investigation find that Jose Canseco was right in saying that a majority of players used steroids, will his report, which Selig said would be made public, reflect that finding, potentially harming the game by turning off fans and viewers? Such a result could be damaging for baseball and ESPN.
 We can only wait and see the report. When John Dowd, the Washington lawyer, investigated Pete Rose in 1989 for betting on baseball games, everything he found was published. The report and its exhibits became public because of a lawsuit, but this time we can expect full disclosure without the litigation.
 If we get less, we will have reason to question Mitchell's integrity, and baseball cannot afford to have fans or members of Congress or the news media conclude that the investigation was a sham. Selig said Mitchell's leadership of the investigation ensured that it would be ''thorough and fair.'' Mitchell said the investigation would be ''thorough, objective and fair.''
 Although Mitchell will head the investigation, he will have three lawyers assisting him, one from his law firm and two from the law firm of Bob DuPuy, baseball's president. If anyone has any idea about ignoring evidence of steroid use, the conspiracy will have to be vast for it to succeed.
 Neither Selig nor Mitchell uttered the name Barry Bonds yesterday, and both men made it clear that the investigation would command a far wider scope than the man who could be the new home run king. But Selig acknowledged that the ''specificity of the charges'' in the new book about Bonds, ''Game of Shadows,'' prompted him to go forward with an investigation. 
 Selig sidestepped a question about possible disciplinary action against players. When the investigation was finished, Selig said, ''that will be the time for me to make those kind of judgments.''
 Fay Vincent, Selig's predecessor as commissioner, said this shouldn't be about punishment.
 ''You have to separate the investigation from the results,'' Vincent said. ''The results aren't important. The investigation is important. Baseball has to get back on the moral high ground. Whether they punish anybody is not important. They have to set the record straight. That's what's important.''
 How long could the investigation take? No one has any idea. Dowd's investigation of Rose lasted six months. This one will be far more complex. And Selig said that he had given Mitchell permission to follow the evidence wherever it may lead.
 It is highly unlikely -- no matter what Mitchell's report shows -- that Selig would act to bar Bonds from holding the career home run record, which barring injury, he could attain this season or early next year. What Selig would count on, though, is the public perception of Bonds and the record if the investigation supports the evidence presented in the book.
 Before Mitchell and his crew of investigators are finished, in the eyes of the public, Roger Maris could have back his single-season home run record of 61.

HEADLINE: South Korea Raids Office of U.S. Firm 

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, March 30 

 BODY:
Prosecutors investigating allegations of tax evasion and embezzlement conducted a raid Thursday on the Seoul office of an American investment company, Lone Star Funds, which bought a controlling stake in a Korean bank three years ago. 
 The prosecutors said they planned to extradite the former country manager of the company, Steven Lee, who resigned and left South Korea last year after he was accused of tax evasion and embezzlement. His whereabouts is unknown but he is believed to be in the United States.
Prosecutors also raided the homes of the heads of Lone Star Advisers Korea and Hudson Advisers Korea, local units of Lone Star, and barred 10 unidentified people from leaving the country. 
 A spokesman for the prosecutors, Kang Chan Woo, said they were investigating ''tax evasion, embezzlement and other allegations'' against Lone Star, which is based in Dallas.
 Owen Blicksilver, a spokesman for Lone Star, said, ''Lone Star is cooperating fully and looks forward to the conclusion of the investigation,'' The Associated Press reported.
 Part of the investigation relates to Lone Star's $1.2 billion deal in August 2003 to buy a 50.5 percent stake in the Korea Exchange Bank. 
 Lawmakers and civic groups have asked whether government regulators and Korea Exchange executives altered financial statements and bent regulations to help Lone Star acquire the stake. 
 Lone Star said last week that it had agreed to sell its stake in Korea Exchange to Kookmin Bank, the largest bank in South Korea. Kookmin agreed to pay $6.6 billion for the stake held by Lone Star and for another 14.1 percent held by Commerzbank of Germany. 
 Public discontent about Lone Star was heightened because Lone Star has said that it will not have to pay Korean taxes on the sale, since the deal was conducted through a subsidiary in Belgium. Belgium has a tax treaty with South Korea that prevents both countries from imposing taxes on the same deal.
 The South Korean Parliament has been asked to enact a law in July that will require investors to pay withholding taxes, even on deals handled in some countries that have double-taxation treaties with South Korea.
 Lone Star hopes to sell Korea Exchange before July.
 Analysts had mixed opinions about whether the raid might influence Lone Star's plan to sell its controlling stake in the Korea Exchange Bank.
 ''I don't see this investigation having any immediate impact on the bank deal,'' said Lee Byong Gun, an analyst at Shinyoung Securities. ''But it does raise negative sentiment for investors.'' 
 Lee June Jae, an analyst at Korea Investment and Securities, said he was reluctant to predict what would happen to the deal because, he said, ''No one knows where this investigation will lead.''
 Foreign funds entered South Korea in the aftermath of the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis, snapping up distressed assets and later selling them for large profits as the country's economy rebounded. 
 Lone Star reaped a profit of 280 billion won ($290 million) through the sale of a Seoul office building last year.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Europe Say Tariff By China Is Discriminatory

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30 

 BODY:
The heat on China is not letting up. In a rare coordinated move, the United States and the European Union filed a complaint on Thursday with the World Trade Organization, accusing China of imposing discriminatory tariffs on foreign suppliers of auto parts.
 The action came 10 days before the beginning of a round of high-level trade talks between the United States and China, and less than three weeks before a visit to Washington by President Hu Jintao of China. 
Coming amid heightened concern over China's large and growing trade surpluses, the complaint was seen as part of a broader attempt to address the growing criticism resonating in Washington and Brussels against China's trade policies.
 ''We're seeing a closer scrutiny of problems and more diligence in using unfair trade laws to counter perceived problems with trade with China,'' said Jeffrey J. Schott, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics here. 
 The complaint is only the second brought against China since it joined the trade organization in 2001; the United States filed a complaint in 2004 over China's tax treatment of domestic and imported semiconductors. 
 Now, according to a statement by the European Commission, China is requiring that when imported parts make up more than 60 percent of the final value of a locally assembled car, the parts will be charged the tariff that applies to whole vehicles, which is much higher. This would force carmakers in China to find local sources for more parts. 
 Over the last few years, American and European manufacturers have flocked to China, where the car market is already one of the biggest in the world and still growing while other markets have stagnated. Many big parts suppliers have followed the manufacturers there. 
 Still, American auto parts makers export relatively little to China. According to the office of the United States trade representative, Rob Portman, auto parts exports to China grew by about 6 percent last year, to $645 million -- a small part of the overall market, which was $19 billion in 2004. They make up only a tiny slice of American manufactured exports to China, which grew more than 20 percent last year, to $32.5 billion.
 While the American auto parts industry supported the complaint, it hardly seemed exultant. ''It's important to have the rules right,'' said Brian Duggan, director of trade and commercial policy at the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association. ''China is a hugely important current and future market. We want them to proceed with the case.''
 Indeed, the complaint seemed to have a much bigger symbolic impact beyond the world of auto parts. ''This is a wonderful thing,'' said Franklin J. Vargo, vice president for international economic affairs at the National Association of Manufacturers. ''It is the first thing the administration has done to show it really means it when it says we have a new trade policy with China.''
 The action played well on Capitol Hill, where some Democrats and Republicans have ratcheted up attacks against China and its policy of keeping its currency, the yuan, tightly linked to the dollar. That peg, they argue, gives Chinese products an unfair edge over American rivals and contributes to America's $202 billion bilateral trade deficit.
 ''I support this action by Ambassador Portman and commend his leadership on securing our rights under our trade agreements,'' Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said in a statement. Two days ago, Mr. Grassley introduced a bill that would require the government to focus more attention on China's currency policies. 
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who on Tuesday decided to pull back from submitting a bill that would impose steep tariffs on imports from China if the yuan was not allowed to rise, said: ''The relationship, in an ironic way, is getting better. Instead of glossing over the problems each side is addressing them directly. In the past things were just swept under the rug.''
 Consultations are the first phase in a W.T.O. dispute. If no settlement is reached in 60 days, the issue can be referred to a dispute settlement panel. 
 This will not be the last time the United States complains against China at the W.T.O. It has other potentially bigger complaints. In February, Mr. Portman said that if the Chinese did not take additional steps to protect intellectual property rights, ''We are prepared to pursue legal options.'' 
 The United States won the 2004 semiconductor case when China agreed to end the preferential tax treatment for domestic manufacturers. If the W.T.O. comes to be perceived as the adequate forum to deal with China's perceived unfair trade practices, disputes might become less heated and more routine. 
 ''The fact that the United States trade representative is doing what the Congress has told him to do helps release some of the steam from the pressure cooker,'' said Mr. Schott, of the Institute of International Economics.

HEADLINE: A New Motivator for Governors Island 

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
An accomplished fund-raiser for New York City's public schools has been picked as the president of the corporation devoted to the reinvention of Governors Island, a $1 gift to the city and state whose future has been mulled over for three years with little to show for the effort.
 Leslie Koch, chief executive of the Fund for Public Schools, the Department of Education's fund-raising arm, was selected by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki. She awaits confirmation by the city-state partnership that is trying to redevelop the island, a 172-acre former military base 800 yards off the southern tip of Manhattan. That confirmation by the 12 directors of the Governors Island Preservation and Education Corporation is expected by today, City Hall officials say. 
Governors Island, a former Army and Coast Guard base with stunning wraparound views of Lower Manhattan and New York Harbor, was turned over to the city and state in 2003, spawning visions of a college campus, a place for concerts and athletic events, a hotel and conference center, or an amusement park. The city and state have poured in $10 million a year to maintain the buildings and ferry slips, but nothing grander has emerged.
 Robert Pirani, executive director of the Governors Island Alliance, a watchdog group affiliated with the Regional Plan Association, said government officials have been distracted by bigger, more controversial projects like the rebuilding of ground zero and a football stadium on the Far West Side of Manhattan. Others say development has been caught up in wariness between Governor Pataki's staff and that of Mr. Bloomberg and that those tensions contributed to the departure a year ago of the corporation's first president, James F. Lima. The post of president was temporarily filled by Paul Kelly, an assistant general counsel at the city's Economic Development Corporation. Filling the job is regarded as crucial to rekindling momentum to develop Governors Island.
 Ms. Koch, along with Caroline Kennedy, the vice chairman of the schools fund-raising group, attracted more than $150 million in gifts to create small schools, train principals and finance other initiatives from deep-pocketed philanthropists like Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft. Ms. Koch, 43, the daughter of a public-school teacher, was a marketing executive at Microsoft from 1989 to 1996.
 In an interview, Daniel L. Doctoroff, the mayor's development czar and chairman of the island corporation, said it was not so much Ms. Koch's fund-raising that led to her appointment as her experience with public-private undertakings and with ''the kind of entrepreneurs we hope will partner with us on the island.'' He described her as ''hard driving, leaves no stone unturned, very proactive, always looking for more interesting better solutions to issues.''
 Beyond the politics, the island has limitations: Getting there requires a six-minute ferry ride (though Mr. Bloomberg has proposed an aerial gondola like the one to Roosevelt Island), many buildings have landmark status and cannot be torn down, and the agreement with the federal government bars commercial development and housing.
 ''Until very recently it's been very unclear what the game plan was,'' Mr. Pirani said. ''The real challenge for whoever becomes the permanent president is that they be able to instill confidence in the private sector that the city and state meet responsibilities for taking care of the infrastructure and creating the parks and other amenities promised for that island.''
 As chairman for most of last year, Mr. Doctoroff revived attention on reshaping the island, and in February the city solicited proposals from developers. Those proposals will be compared starting in May. Joel I. Klein, the school system's chancellor, described Ms. Koch as ''disciplined and organized,'' someone who ''knows how to think outside the box'' and ''knows how to work across agencies.'' In raising money, he said, Ms. Koch had a talent for getting donors to appreciate the effects a project would have on enhancing schools.
 Ms. Koch, who was raised on the Upper West Side, graduated summa cum laude in history from Yale in 1984 and received a master's degree in management from the Yale School of Management. She lives in Boerum Hill in Brooklyn with her husband, Douglas Gray, a theater consultant and producer. The couple have been generous donors, giving more than $10,000 to the Seattle Library Foundation, for example. City Hall said she would not be available for an interview until confirmed.
 While the paralysis at ground zero and the defeat of the West Side stadium has prompted cynics to doubt that anything ambitious can ever be built in the city, Mr. Doctoroff ticked off projects that have started or are about to be started, including the reconstruction of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, the extension of the No. 7 subway line from Times Square to 11th Avenue and 34th Street, a new Yankee Stadium, and the Atlantic Yards development in Brooklyn whose centerpiece will be an arena for the Nets basketball team.

HEADLINE: Ground Zero Still in Limbo As Talks Fail

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI; Sewell Chan and Glenn Collins contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki's last-ditch effort to strike a deal with the developer Larry A. Silverstein to speed up the rebuilding at ground zero crashed yesterday, when he was unable to convince New Jersey or City Hall officials that it made financial sense.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and representatives of Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey vowed to work with Mr. Pataki to put together a new framework for rebuilding at the World Trade Center site, one that would be likely to diminish Mr. Silverstein's role.
The seemingly irreparable breakdown, coming after months of negotiations and with construction expected to start within days, is clearly a personal and political disappointment for the governor. 
 Over the last three years, Mr. Pataki tied his legacy, his reputation and perhaps his presidential ambitions to construction of the Freedom Tower and the restoration of the city's skyline after the devastating attack on Sept. 11. 
 After a furious series of meetings this week, the Pataki administration and Mr. Silverstein were inching back toward an agreement much like one that had been on the table when talks reached a dramatic late-night impasse on March 14. 
 But Mr. Pataki's solution was coming under increasing fire in public from Mayor Bloomberg and Governor Corzine. They said it would have enriched the developer at public expense, while putting the project itself in jeopardy.
 Mr. Pataki had hoped to present his proposal yesterday to the board of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the trade center site. His framework would have relieved Mr. Silverstein of financial responsibility for building the $2 billion Freedom Tower, the tallest, most symbolic and most troubled of the five towers planned for the 16-acre site. But the developer would have retained the right to build three towers on the most valuable parcels on Church Street.
 At the end of a 90-minute meeting yesterday morning at the authority's Park Avenue office, it was clear to the Pataki administration that neither Mayor Bloomberg nor Governor Corzine, who shares control of the authority with Mr. Pataki, were willing to go along.
 So, the New York governor's office was forced to notify authority commissioners that ground zero was off the agenda.
 ''Governor Pataki is insisting on moving forward,'' said Charles A. Gargano, the state's chief economic development official and vice chairman of the Port Authority. ''Our goal is to come to a framework agreement, to work out the structure to address many of these issues.''
 In public, officials from New York, New Jersey and City Hall were careful to avoid criticizing one another yesterday. Indeed, Mayor Bloomberg even said that Mr. Pataki had done a good job under difficult circumstances.
 But state officials who were granted anonymity so that they could speak with fewer political constraints defended the deal they had nearly signed with Mr. Silverstein. They said that it would have ensured the completion of all the buildings at ground zero at a quicker pace, while imposing strict deadlines on the developer.
 Further, they said, they had forced Mr. Silverstein to make concessions on his rent, the allocation of insurance proceeds and his share of infrastructure costs.
 Among the public officials, tension was clearly just below the surface yesterday. Mr. Gargano said that the framework the state had erected for a deal was still on the table. Yet city officials and Anthony R. Coscia, the authority's chairman and a New Jersey appointee, suggested that it was time to start over on an arrangement that all sides could embrace.
 If the turn of events was a blow to Mr. Pataki, it also hurt Mr. Silverstein, who leased the World Trade Center six weeks before it was destroyed. The developer has repeatedly vowed to start work on the Freedom Tower next month. But he may not want to start spending tens of millions of dollars without fully knowing what his role will be in the future when it comes to rebuilding the entire complex.
 Yesterday, Mr. Silverstein said that he had negotiated in good faith with Governor Pataki, making significant progress on all the critical issues, including rent and the allocation of $2.9 billion in insurance proceeds. Mr. Silverstein, who has been alternately applauded and vilified for his role, rejected any suggestion that he was at fault and blamed government ineptitude.
 ''We now find that the process has apparently gotten bogged down inside the Port Authority, which is as frustrating to me as I'm sure it is to New Yorkers,'' Mr. Silverstein said in a statement. ''We hope that the different leaders and branches of government will quickly come together so we can move past the uncertainty and get on with what is our paramount obligation -- rebuilding the World Trade Center.'' 
 But Mr. Coscia put the onus on Mr. Silverstein and brushed aside talk of a rift with Governor Pataki. He said the city and both states would now work together on a unified proposal to offer Mr. Silverstein.
 ''The issues we find with the Silverstein proposal are equally of concern to New York, New Jersey, Governor Pataki and Mayor Bloomberg,'' Mr. Coscia said. ''My expectation is that there is a growing unanimity of opinion among two governors and the mayor, and that is likely to enhance the chance of having an agreement.''
 The collapse of the talks is not the only trouble at ground zero. Work has begun on the Sept. 11 memorial, but that project is already over budget and fund-raising has been sluggish. There was a nasty public battle over a planned cultural center and continuing doubts about the economic viability of the Freedom Tower, which is widely considered to be too big, in the wrong place and nearly impossible to lease to corporate tenants, who view it as an obvious terrorist target.
 Some downtown executives and community leaders are also worried that the continuing uncertainty at ground zero will undermine the fragile recovery in Lower Manhattan. Although the office vacancy rate downtown is relatively high, they are hoping that rising rents and a tight Midtown market will once again make Lower Manhattan an attractive alternative.
 ''The business community is eager for a resolution at ground zero so Lower Manhattan can continue it's momentum toward a full recovery,'' said Eric Deutsch, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York.
 The latest crisis was prompted, in part, by the scheduled April groundbreaking for the Freedom Tower. Although Mr. Silverstein continues to insist that he has the money and the desire to do the job, state and city officials and authority executives have grown increasingly concerned that he could run out of money, default on his lease and walk away with tens of millions in profit after completing only two towers.
 To be fair, Governor Pataki championed the skyscraper as a symbol of New York's resilience and insisted that it be built first, over Mr. Silverstein's objections. The developer and government officials subsequently reached agreements in 2003 and 2004 on what would be built and when.
 Last December, Mr. Coscia of the Port Authority suggested that Mr. Silverstein surrender a major part of the World Trade Center site as a way of addressing the financial problems.
 Mayor Bloomberg, who had been largely focused on the redevelopment of the Far West Side in 2004 and 2005, became increasingly focused on Lower Manhattan, backing Mr. Coscia.
 The developer refused, not wanting to relinquish what he said were the most valuable parcels.
 The Pataki administration then began weeks of negotiations with Mr. Silverstein that left Mr. Coscia and Mayor Bloomberg without seats atthe bargaining table. Even after the impasse on March 14, Silverstein executives complained that they were making concessions to Mr. Pataki's negotiators, while reading in the newspapers about new demands by City Hall or New Jersey.
 Mr. Coscia said yesterday that two fundamentally different interests were in play.
 ''Silverstein Properties is pursuing their business interests to further the profitability of this effort,'' he said, ''and we have a responsibility to protect the public's interest.''
