30-Year Bond Falls to 6%, Its Lowest Level in 2 Years
 The yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond closed at 6 percent, the lowest closing level in two years. A bond-market rally entered its fourth day on economic data that pointed to weak growth and on optimism that a Federal budget agreement was attainable in Washington. The long bond climbed 15/32 of a point in price, pulling its yield down from 6.03 percent on Tuesday. 
 Stocks were mixed in thin trading, but were buoyed by the lower rates. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 16 points before ending down 4.34, at 5,105.92. [D6.]
 Staff members of the White House and Congressional Republicans resumed discussions on balancing the budget as Federal employees grew restive. [A1.]
 
Fannie Mae to Buy Back Stock
 Federal National Mortgage announced plans to buy back as much as 9 percent of its common stock in one of this year's largest buybacks. The company, widely known as Fannie Mae, also said that it would split its stock on a four-for-one basis and give three million shares to its charitable foundation. The shares rose $5.25, to $125. They have risen 72 percent this year. [D2.]
 
Cordis Shares Tumble 11%
 Cordis shares plunged 11 percent after Johnson & Johnson delayed its $1.8 billion buyout, but some analysts said they doubted that the deal was in danger. Much of the drop was attributed to speculators who were getting out because of uncertainty, however slim, that the deal might fall through. Both companies treat heart disease. [D2.]

Disarray in Mexico
 Economic disarray, official corruption and other problems have pushed Mexico into crisis. The man at the center of the storm is President Ernesto Zedillo, who departs from Mexico's tradition of a strong leader. He promises a transformation to democracy, but some others fear chaos. [A1.]
 
Asian Orders for Boeing

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains in Light Turnover As Traders Await Budget Action

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose slightly yesterday in light trading devoid of any major trend.
Many traders in the United States and Europe remained on holiday and those who were working were reluctant to make big moves ahead of developments in the Federal budget stalemate. 
 "The dollar is in a very tight range," said Augie Floro, a senior trader with Bank Austria in New York. "There is no information to trade on. Everyone is just waiting for the holidays to be over and for something on the budget impasse situation."
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.4335 German marks, up from 1.4330 marks on Tuesday. The dollar also rose to 102.84 Japanese yen, from 102.40 yen.
The British pound rose to $1.5594 in New York, from $1.5560 on Tuesday.
Some traders said the dollar might be benefiting from recent reports showing a sluggish economy, indicating that inflation remained under control. But others said the data could also point to a possible further decline in interest rates early next year, which might hurt the dollar's value by making dollar-denominated assets less attractive.
Sales of previously owned homes dropped 1.7 percent in November, the second straight decline, the National Association of Realtors said yesterday. And the Conference Board, a research group in New York, said its monthly barometer of consumer confidence fell in December.
On Tuesday, the Johnson Redbook Service, a prominent barometer of the retailing industry, reported a disappointing 3.9 percent rise in Christmas sales.
Still, some currency strategists dismissed the latest statistics, saying the foreign exchange market already expected further declines in American interest rates.
"The economic numbers didn't shake the market by any means," said Ken Nixon, a currency adviser with the Bank of Montreal.
There was little action to resolve the Federal budget impasse yesterday. President Clinton and Republicans in Congress remain stalemated in efforts to balance the budget in seven years.
In late New York trading, the dollar reached 1.1573 Swiss francs, up from 1.1521; 4.8980 French francs, down from 4.9050; 1,588.50 Italian lire, up from 1,585.75, and 1.3577 Canadian dollars, down from 1.3602.

HEADLINE: Mexico's 'Accidental' Chief Spurns Role of Strongman

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Dec. 27

 BODY:
The tall pines for which Mexico's presidential mansion is named filter the midday sunlight and cast gentle, dancing shadows. But such tranquillity is deceptive because inside Los Pinos a struggle is raging over the Mexican presidency and, in large part, Mexico itself.
Economic disarray, official corruption, an unresolved Indian uprising and several unsolved killings have pushed Mexico to what some here say is the brink of the most serious crisis of state since the 1910 revolution. 
 And all of it has passed through an airy second-floor office at a corner of Los Pinos where, often alone and wearing a well-used cardigan sweater, calmly sits the man at the center of the storm: President Ernesto Zedillo.
The economic and political decisions Mr. Zedillo has made in this office have affected all Mexicans and many Americans. But the one action likely to have the greatest long-term effect, both for Mexico and the United States, and the one that has put Mr. Zedillo in a quandary, is his effort to dismantle the imperial presidency he inherited.
Mr. Zedillo, who came to office as a kind of pinch-runner after his party's original candidate was assassinated in 1994, has refrained from using the almost unlimited powers his predecessors left for him and has tried to share control of the country with Congress, the courts, local governments, opposition political parties and the nearly 100 million people of Mexico in the form of honest elections.
Having just completed his first turbulent year in office, Mr. Zedillo, who turned 44 today, has not yet fully realized any of the goals he has outlined, and he may never do so. But the very process of trying to reach them has been wrenching.
Mr. Zedillo's style of leadership is so unsettling because it contrasts so greatly with Mexico's historic reliance on strongmen, or "caudillos," a tradition dating from the Emperor Montezuma and continuing through the past 66 years when Presidents have served a single nearly omnipotent six-year term and have had a virtual free hand in choosing their successors.
Previous Presidents have ruled over compliant congresses, dependent judiciaries and governors who had virtually no budget but what came from Los Pinos. A nod from the President was enough to launch a career, or end it, and the President and his family have been, until now, considered untouchable. Guards at Los Pinos would warn visitors to move quickly because "El Senor is arriving." "El Senor" refers to the President, and to God.
This is a country so used to having a strongma n lead that what Mr. Zedillo offers as leadership many see as weakness, what he thinks is democracy others see as drifting, what he promises will be a fundamental transformation they fear will become chaos.
 
Stability in Mexico Long a U.S. Goal
Keeping Mexico stable has long been the goal of American policy toward its southern neighbor. And since the powerful presidency has for most of this century meant the preservation of order, the unpredictability created by Mr. Zedillo's handling of his office is closely watched by Washington.
But it is on the streets and in the cities across Mexico that Mr. Zedillo's presidency is questioned most.
"He has the title of President but he's really not President," Emilio Espinoza Barrera, 52, a taxi driver from the central state of Guanajuato, said last month a few days after the Mexican stock exchange and the peso were badly battered because of unfounded rumors that the army had toppled the Zedillo Government.
Like many Mexicans, Mr. Espinoza Barrera has heard Mr. Zedillo pledge democracy and law and order, but he is hard pressed to believe that anything will happen.
"When I was a child in school and had to sing the national anthem, I always felt good about Mexico," he said. "But as an adult I lost that feeling. I realized that all the promises about democracy and fatherland are just a farce."
Others see Mr. Zedillo's odd style as far too lenient and laid back. Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, an independent congressman, said Mr. Zedillo was pulling apart the old system before Congress and the rest of Mexico's public institutions were ready to fill the power vacuum left behind.
"The President has sacrificed his leadership for a 'let it be' position and made himself prisoner of his own jail," Mr. Aguilar Zinser said in an interview on the floor of Congress.
Sweeping political reforms are now being hammered out by the three major political parties without the President's direct input. "Amidst all the tensions, Zedillo is sealing himself off in Los Pinos," Mr. Aguilar Zinser said.
 
Ex-Presidents Sniping From the Sidelines
The events of 1995 turned Mr. Zedillo's first year in office into a nightmare, but he has also had to deal with something no other Mexican President since the 1930's has faced -- interference from his predecessors.
Instead of retiring to raise tomatoes in their backyards, as they would have in years past, two former Presidents, Luis Echeverria and Carlos Salinas de Gortari, have made several critical statements and published openly hostile letters that have shaken the Government. Mr. Salinas even staged a bizarre hunger strike to put pressure on his successor, and is now involved in a corruption scandal with his brother Raul that Mr. Zedillo is having trouble handling.
Such open displays of infighting and scandal are seen by many here as a signal that the old political system by which one party has ruled Mexico for 66 years -- longer than any other single party still in power in the world -- is reaching its end.
Since 1929, the pendulum of power has swung from one sector of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) to the next without ever alternating to the opposition.
"The party was created as a catchall that counted on members to be united and unanimous," said Santiago Onate Laborde, PRI's president.
What kept the system functioning was Los Pinos and the power it represented. Mexican Presidents serve one six-year term, and are constitutionally barred from a second consecutive term. The Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa called this system "the perfect dictatorship" because it maintains power but limits the powerful.
Until March 1994, Mr. Zedillo was a rising member of the Mexican political caste, an economist with a doctorate from Yale University who was good with numbers but lacking in political fire.
After President Salinas chose Luis Donaldo Colosio as the PRI candidate in 1993, Mr. Colosio picked Mr. Zedillo to be his campaign manager, a move that seemed to insure that Mr. Zedillo would become treasury secretary after Mr. Colosio took office.
But two bullets fired after a campaign rally in Tijuana on March 23, 1994, ended Mr. Colosio's life and the PRI's orderly march to another presidential term.
After a fierce struggle with the party, Mr. Zedillo was chosen to fill in for Mr. Colosio, and he arrived at Los Pinos without having made the long list of compromises and commitments that Presidents from PRI usually carry to their office. His American education, and his upbringing in Mexicali, on the border with California, gave him a clear view of American democracy that many analysts think influences his view of how to govern.
In a land where symbols of power are flashed freely, he has shown a common touch, perhaps typified by his sweater and the Ironman plastic wristwatch he often wears.
At a recent concert in Mexico City, someone noticed him in the presidential box at intermission and started to applaud. In time, most of the well-heeled crowd was clapping. Confused and unsure about what to do, Mr. Zedillo just sat there. Finally he stood up and acknowledged the crowd.
"It is amazing to think that it has turned out to be this unprepared, accidental President who faces the greatest challenge in Mexico since the revolution," the Mexican writer Carlos Fuentes said. "All of us hope he is up to it."
 
A Leadership Style That Unsettles Many
Most Mexicans are simply not comfortable with Mr. Zedillo's style. "We are used to seeing a form of governing in which intimidation by the powerful counts for more than the convictions of the just," said Humberto Roque Villanueva, the PRI president of the lower house of congress. "A certain part of the political class hasn't yet gotten used to Ernesto Zedillo's concept of using the power of the presidency."
Reviewing how Mexico has changed in the last year, it is easy to understand the politicians' sense of estrangement. Take, for example, the advances made by the National Action Party (PAN), a perennial loser that for 50 years has played second fiddle to PRI.
When Mr. Zedillo first put on the red, white and green presidential sash on Dec. 1, 1994, PAN governed 3 states and 118 municipalities in which 13.2 million Mexicans lived -- 16.5 percent of the population. That excludes the 20 million people in Mexico City, who do not elect the Mayor; he is appointed by the President.
Mr. Zedillo vowed to hold fair elections, even though the economic crisis was likely to cost his party dearly. As he ended his first year in office, PAN controlled 4 states and 218 municipalities. That brings to 24.7 million the number of people governed by the opposition, nearly 31 percent of the population, again excluding Mexico City.
"Nobody knows better than the residents and officials of each state, each town, each community their own problems and needs as well as the best ways to tackle them and solve them," Mr. Zedillo said in a typical speech recently in Jalisco state, which in February was swept by the opposition for the first time.
 
An Election Passes Without Conflict
Such sharing of power has not been easy to take for a party used to controlling everything. But the election process itself is being transformed from conflictive brinkmanship based on pressure and compromise to an orderly, though still flawed, example of democracy. Elections in November in the state of Michoacan, the stronghold of the leftist opposition, passed without conflict even though PRI managed to win the governorship.
During Mr. Salinas's six years in office, elections in Michoacan and many other states were all marked by conflict that was resolved only with interference by Los Pinos.
That is not the only way Mr. Zedillo benefits from comparison to his predecessor. Recent disclosures of corruption and illicit enrichment by Mr. Salinas's brother Raul (officials have found more than $100 million in overseas accounts) have enraged Mexicans. But they have also provided a lighting rod that diverts public resentment away from Mr. Zedillo.
Mr. Zedillo has also given Congress a greater role to play. A mutliparty commission is handling peace negotiations with the Indian rebels in Chiapas. In a vote on social security reform that Mr. Zedillo considered critical, some 60 modifications were on the floor of Congress before the bill was approved.
Without a strong President, the rules of the political game in Mexico all change. Under Mr. Zedillo's concept of a new federalism, the traditionally subservient governors of Mexico's 31 states gain power and independence. But with that comes the danger that they may once again become the kind of local bosses that in the past ruled with iron fists.
Already, the Governor of Puebla has tried to ignore federal election laws and the Governor of Tabasco has used Mr. Zedillo's hands-off policy as a pretense for flouting party unity.
Mexico's difficult times are likely to continue into the next century. Social conflict and street demonstrations could increase, especially if the economy does not start to turn around next year. PRI could lose its congressional majority in the 1997 midterm elections. Mr. Zedillo has said he will break with the most fundamental part of the presidential system and not select his successor for the election in 2000.
It is not at all clear that he would be able to do so even if he wanted to. He has not placed potential candidates in his Cabinet, as has been the practice, creating conditions for a political struggle the likes of which Mexico has not seen for more than half a century.
 
A Wobbling System Raises U.S. Stakes
With an increasingly strong opposition, the decomposition of the governing party and the demolition of the presidency by Mr. Zedillo, the Mexican system is wobbling, and that raises the stakes for the United States, whose Mexico policy has long been to maintain stability at all costs.
"We will have to be sophisticated enough to differentiate between the painful process of establishing a real democracy," and the agitation of a society going through a transition, said James R. Jones, the United States Ambassador. "And we will have to be sensitive enough to be willing to zig and zag a little bit on economic policy," so Mexico can ease the social burden of the economic restructuring.
Mr. Onate, the president of PRI, said a Mexico with a democratic balance of power would probably not be as predictable as the old pyramid of power, with Los Pinos at the top. "The only honest answer is yes," there will be more for the United States to be uncomfortable about, he said, because "democracy is not certainty."

Philippine Airlines Gives Big Order to Boeing

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: MANILA, Dec. 27

 BODY:
The Boeing Company, continuing to win business in the quickly expanding Asian market, received an order from Philippine Airlines for eight 747's and is expected to win part of a $4 billion order to be placed by Malaysia's national carrier.
Jaime Bautista, chief financial officer for Philippine Airlines, said today that the airline planned to buy eight 747-400's, Boeing's largest long-distance aircraft, as part of a program to spend $2.7 billion to purchase 32 new aircraft from Boeing and Airbus Industrie in the next three years. 
 Mr. Bautista declined to say how much Boeing and Airbus would receive from the orders, which are expected to reach $3 billion when repairs and service are included. A 747-400, which can carry about 400 passengers, costs about $150 million.
The Philippine carrier will buy 4 of the A340-300's, 8 of the A330-300's and 12 of the A320's from Airbus, Mr. Bautista said.
A spokeswoman for Malaysian Airline System said today that the carrier would announce after the New Year the recipients of a $4 billion order for 25 new aircraft. The New Straits Times, a Malaysian newspaper, quoted aviation executives as saying that Boeing would receive more than $2 billion, mostly for 747-400's.
Boeing, based in Seattle, is the world's largest maker of commercial aircraft. The company has been competing with Airbus, which is a consortium of European companies, and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation of St. Louis to supply aircraft to carriers in Asia, where rapid economic growth has caused a boom in travel.
Singapore Airlines said last month that it would buy as many as 77 Boeing jets for up to $12.7 billion. China Airlines, Taiwan's top airline, said last week that it would purchase as many as 15 Boeing 737-800's for up to $750 million.
Airbus said last month that Cathay Pacific Airlines of Hong Kong had agreed to buy 2 more A330's, bringing to 11 the number of orders placed by the carrier for the planes, which sell for about $113 million apiece.
Philippine Airlines had been discussing an expansion and modernization of its fleet for some time. The resolution of a battle for control of the carrier last week cleared the way for the orders to Boeing and Airbus.
Government financial institutions agreed on Friday to let the carrier's chairman, Lucio Tan, a beer and tobacco magnate, obtain a majority stake in Philippine Airlines. An agreement with the financial institutions, which hold 48 percent of the airline, to reduce their ownership stakes must still be completed before the Boeing and Airbus orders can proceed, Mr. Bautista of Philippine Airlines said.

HEADLINE: Sales of Existing Homes Fall For 2d Consecutive Month

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 27

 BODY:
Sales of existing homes fell for a second consecutive month in November, an industry group said today, as a slowing economy reduced confidence about future job security.
The group, the National Association of Realtors, said resales of single-family homes dropped 1.7 percent in November, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.04 million units, despite lower mortgage rates. 
 Sales of previously owned homes declined a revised 1 percent in October, to an annual rate of 4.11 million; previously, October sales were reported to have fallen a steeper 1.9 percent. That followed five consecutive months of rising sales from May through September.
Analysts said that even after two months of declines, sales remained at a relatively healthy pace, in part because lower interest rates have made it easier for first-time homeowners to qualify for loans.
The realtors' group said the average interest rate for a 30-year mortgage loan in November was 7.38 percent. That was down from 7.48 percent in October and was well below the rate of 9.16 percent in November 1994.
November sales of existing homes were 9.5 percent above those in the corresponding month a year earlier, when they were running at an annual rate of 3.69 million.
But some buoyancy has clearly left the housing market, a development that was reflected in a separate survey yesterday by the Conference Board, a business research group based in New York.
The group said its consumer confidence index fell to 98.7 in December from a revised 101.6 in November. The index, based on a sample from 5,000 households, is calculated on a base of 100.
Edgar Fiedler, vice president and economic counselor at the Conference Board, noted that the index had hovered around the 100 mark throughout the year.
"The traditionally warm spirits of the holiday season, however, have not lifted the economic expectations of consumers above this moderately favorable level," he added.
After a strong third quarter in which the gross domestic product rose at a vigorous 4.2 percent annual rate, the economy has been on a slowing trend that is forecast to continue into 1996.
That is casting a shadow over future prospects, as shown in lackluster Christmas sales. The most recent figures for retail sales, published today by Mitsubishi Bank-Schroder Wertheim, showed a modest surge of 1.4 percent in sales at chain stores in the week that ended Dec. 23.
Although no official measure of fourth-quarter G.D.P. is available because of the continuing Government shutdown, most analysts anticipate an expansion of only about 2 percent.
"The crux of the matter at this point really is job insecurity," said Sung Won Sohn, an economist for the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis. "Consumers are not sure about their job prospects in 1996 and consequently they're not really willing to spend a lot of money."
Art Godi, president of the realtors' group, said, "The closing of the Federal Government, coupled with the onset of the holiday spending season, may have caused some reluctance among consumers to get into the housing market last month."
Separately, the Labor Department said it would be forced to delay reports on December prices and employment that were originally scheduled for release in early January.
"At this point those things have been delayed," said Bill Barron, deputy commissioner at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, citing the partial shutdown of the Government because of the budget impasse.
Although the data for the December economic reports were collected before the shutdown, the furlough of Government workers has led to delays in the processing of the information, Labor Department officials have said.
The December employment and unemployment data were originally scheduled for release on Jan. 5. The report on the Producer Price Index was to be released on Jan. 11 and the Consumer Price Index report was scheduled for Jan. 12.

HEADLINE: Canadian Agency Is Accused of Spying on Citizens and Allies

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH 

DATELINE: OTTAWA

 BODY:
It looks like any other nondescript Government building, in a city full of them, until you notice that the nine-foot-high fence surrounding it is topped with barbed wire and there is only one way to get in -- through what looks like a guardhouse.
The four-story Sir Leonard Tilley Building, named after an obscure 19th-century Canadian Finance Minister, houses Canada's most secretive intelligence agency, the Communications Security Establishment, a remnant of the dusky world of cold-war electronic espionage. 
 The agency, the branch of the Defense Department that gathers signal intelligence, used to attract little public notice. But now, after much unwanted publicity from disgruntled former employees who accuse it of spying on Canadian citizens and Canada's allies, the agency finds itself the focal point of debate about intelligence gathering in Canadian society.
Bill Seward, 50, the mechanic at Petro-Canada's Hoggs Back Service Center a couple of blocks away, gives vent to some of the new concern about the agency, which intercepts foreign phone, radio, fax and other communications. "I think they're overstepping their authority," he said, "and it would probably be better if they kept their hands off."
Jane Shorten, 38, worked for the agency as an intelligence analyst from 1986 to 1994, when she was laid off in a belt-tightening move.
Recently she touched off minor international incidents after disclosing in a television interview that Canada had spied on friendly countries like South Korea and Mexico.
One of her projects gathered economic, military and security intelligence on South Korea. With high-powered electronic listening devices, she eavesdropped on secret discussions among South Korean officials about purchasing nuclear reactors.
"Anything having to do with the South Korean diplomatic corps was of interest," she told the CTV television network. She also monitored communications from the Mexican Embassy during the negotiations that led to the North American Free Trade Agreement among Canada, Mexico and the United States.
The Mexican Government presented a diplomatic note to Canada expressing "surprise and concern." The South Korean Foreign Ministry said it would take "appropriate measures" after an investigation.
Although the Soviet Union and its allies were once the prime targets of surveillance, after the cold war the Communications Security Establishment has shifted its attention to economic espionage in friendly countries, Ms. Shorten said.
Ottawa says it will look into the new allegations. After reports this year that the United States Central Intelligence Agency had spied on the Japanese delegation during auto trade talks, Solicitor General Herbert Gray was asked whether Canada carried out similar operations.
"Countries like Canada have understandings that they don't carry out these activities against each other," he told Parliament in October.
Interception of private communications in Canada is illegal. The agency says it targets only foreign communications, but a gray area apparently exists with Canadians working for foreign embassies. Ms. Shorten expressed dismay at having to make it the Government's business to eavesdrop on one Canadian employee of a foreign embassy in discussions with her gynecologist.
Deputy Prime Minister Sheila Copps promised an official review of the Shorten allegation, adding, "If, in fact, there has been illegal activity going on, we'll want to deal with that in as public a way as possible."

HEADLINE: Pension Board to Pay $100 Million for Failed Plans

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 27

 BODY:
The Federal agency that guarantees many private pension plans settled the largest class-action lawsuit ever brought against it today, agreeing to pay nearly $100 million to 40,000 retirees who were covered by pension plans that failed.
Today's settlement by the agency, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, resolves cases involving 11,000 failed pension funds that imposed stricter rules than allowed by Federal law for the number of workers qualifying for benefits. The pension agency had previously made payments only to workers who met the very strict standards set by these pension funds. 
 But the agency has now agreed to make back payments with interest to workers who met the Federal standard but not their employers' rules.
The decision delighted Mary E. Collins, a 70-year-old retiree in Medford, Mass., who was a plaintiff in the lawsuit and stands to receive up to $50,000. "This is really a lifesaver," she said.
Martin Slate, the pension agency's executive director, accepted today's settlement. "It is our job to protect their pensions," he said in a statement.
But the settlement puts a further burden on the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. The agency already lies at the center of a political battle over the extent to which American companies should set aside money now for the eventual retirement of their workers, particularly workers in the baby boom generation.
The Republican budget bill would have allowed companies to remove billions of dollars from pension funds that hold at least 25 percent more money than their estimated future payments to retirees. President Clinton vetoed the budget bill, and White House and Congressional officials have not yet agreed on a new bill.
The pension agency had accumulated a deficit of $1.2 billion by the end of last year, the most recent figure available. Companies with defined-benefit pension plans support the agency by paying insurance premiums, but there have been growing worries in Congress that the Federal Government might someday have to bail out the agency if the economy enters another recession and many companies go bankrupt.
A defined-benefit pension plan makes fixed, regular payments to retirees, using money typically contributed by their employer and managed by professionals. By contrast, workers put their own money into defined-contribution pension plans like 401(k) plans, although companies may make matching contributions. The payout depends on how adeptly the employee manages the money over the years.
The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation insures most of the private sector defined-benefit pension plans in the United States.
Today's settlement is subject to approval by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, after which the pension agency would have 38 months to find the beneficiaries and pay them. Court approval in such cases is common but not assured.
The settlement results mainly from a change in Federal law that took effect at the beginning of 1976.
Until then, many companies' pension plans had rules requiring many years of service before employees qualified for benefits. The new law required the inclusion of employees who had worked for 10 or more years, a so-called vesting requirement that has since been reduced to five years.
Many companies and other employers were slow to change their rules after the new law took effect, and there were a variety of regulations in effect at the time that allowed them to do so in many cases. About 11,000 underfunded pension plans terminated from 1976 through 1981 without bringing their rules into compliance with the new law, and today's settlement covers these plans.
Stephen R. Bruce, one of the lawyers who brought the cases resulting in today's settlement, said that the settlement calls for the pension agency to make about $70 million in payments to the retirees. The pension agency will also spend up to $24 million to pay for commercial companies to track down the retirees, he said.
Retirees who think they may qualify for payments can check by calling (800) 316-8857, a number maintained by the lawyers who filed the case.
The settlement also calls for Mr. Bruce and the other lawyers on the case to receive various legal fees, which are still under discussion. Mr. Bruce predicted that the lawyers would ask for fees of up to 12.5 percent of the payments to retirees, or nearly $9 million. The pension agency will pay up to $2 million of these fees and the retirees will pay the rest, he said.
Ms. Collins said that her employer, the M&M Transportation Company, a trucking business in Cambridge, Mass., had filed for bankruptcy protection from its creditors in 1977. She was 52 years old then and had spent 33 years with the company, but did not receive a pension because the company did not award pensions to employees who left before the age of 55, she said tonight in an interview from her home.
Ms. Collins had accrued a monthly benefit of $309, and received none of it. Retirees with smaller monthly benefits, or who received partial payments, could get considerably less money than Ms. Collins, Mr. Bruce said.

HEADLINE: Party Leader May Signal Shift in Japan

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 27

 BODY:
Ichiro Ozawa, a highly unusual Japanese politician who calls for a virtual revolution in his nation's politics, economics, society and foreign policy, was elected leader of Japan's main opposition party today.
Mr. Ozawa, who would almost certainly put relations with the United States on a new footing, thus moves one step closer to the Prime Minister's office. 
 His platform calls for sweeping deregulation in almost every sector, a far-reaching restructuring of the educational system and much greater willingness to use military force.
Still, it is far from clear that Mr. Ozawa will become Prime Minister after the next general election is called. And even if he were to become Prime Minister, it is uncertain how much impact he would have.
In any case, though, his rise to lead the main opposition party, the New Frontier Party, underscores a generational transition toward politicians who aim to be leaders as well as Prime Ministers. Mr. Ozawa and others of his generation -- he is 53 -- are far more self-confident than those who have ruled Japan for 50 years.
"I will fight to my last breath, with all my power, for the New Frontier Party and for Japan," a beaming Mr. Ozawa told a victory celebration of supporters who cheered him with shouts of "Banzai!" meaning "10,000 years," or "long life."
If Mr. Ozawa were to become Prime Minister, there would inevitably be some strains in relations with Washington, for his vision is of Japan as a full partner of the United States rather than as its caddie. Yet Mr. Ozawa also favors the kind of broad deregulation in Japan that Americans have yearned for.
Moreover, Mr. Ozawa places enormous emphasis on military cooperation, and he would be far more willing than any other Japanese politician to back up United States forces in a conflict with North Korea or another country.
The election of Mr. Ozawa means that the next Prime Minister is likely to be either he or Ryutaro Hashimoto, the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, Japan's biggest political group. Mr. Hashimoto is also a new-style politician, unusually assertive and ready for Japan to exercise power, although he does not favor the same kind of sweeping changes.
Mr. Hashimoto today called Mr. Ozawa "a superb politician" and said, "I look forward to being able now to hold a fair and aboveboard debate on the issues."
That was a dig at Mr. Ozawa's reputation as a king-maker, forging back-room deals without stepping forward to engage in public debate. One reason Mr. Ozawa is not more popular is that he is widely seen as embodying precisely the tradition of behind-the-scenes machinations that he says he is determined to end.
The party election process broke new ground. Normally it is primarily members of Parliament who choose a party's leader. But the New Frontier Party allowed any Japanese over 18 to vote for a $10 contribution, and 1.7 million people voted.
A general election must be held by July 1997. Mr. Ozawa has a reputation as a brilliant campaign strategist -- he masterminded his party's stunningly good performance in July elections for the upper house of Parliament -- and the next election will be held under a new system of single-seat constituencies that make the outcome difficult to predict.
Mr. Ozawa faces two other obstacles: his health and his prickly personality. He has had heart problems, although it is not clear how severe they are now. What is clear is that he is a difficult person to work with, often as prone to pummel egos as to stroke them.
A broader challenge would be how to prevail over an entrenched bureaucracy. Two years ago another bold young politician, Morihiro Hosokawa, became Prime Minister and talked of far-reaching change. He lasted less than a year as Prime Minister and left little mark on the nation.

HEADLINE: Stocks Mixed in Slow Day Amid Hope for a Rate Cut

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
Stocks were mixed yesterday in thin trading, amid continuing expectations that the Federal Reserve would again reduce interest rates.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which at one point gained more than 16 points, ended down 4.34 points, at 5,105.92. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 1.24 points, to 1,048.13, but the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index inched up 0.23 point, to 614.53. 
 "It was a fairly directionless day," said Hugh A. Johnson, senior vice president of the First Albany Corporation. "The trading was largely tax driven."
Reports yesterday of declines in the Conference Board's consumer confidence index and in the National Association of Realtors's tally of home resales underlined the signs of economic slowdown in recent months. These announcements bolstered the bond market, where the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond jumped almost half of a percentage point in price and its yield fell to 6 percent.
"This was somewhat encouraging to the stock market," Mr. Johnson said. "The strength in bonds prevented stocks from going into a swoon."
Advancing issues outpaced declines on the New York Stock Exchange, by 1,328 to 985. Big Board volume climbed to 252.3 million shares from the unusually slow 217 million shares on Tuesday.
Some sectors, notably finance, rose on the anticipation of lower rates. When rates dip, lenders usually benefit from a greater spread between what they receive from their assets and pay for their liabilities.
Federal National Mortgage surged 5 1/4, to 125, after declaring a 4-for-1 stock split and saying that it will sell $1 billion of preferred to repurchase common shares. PNC advanced 1 3/8, to 31 1/2; Bankers Trust increased 1 1/4, to 67 1/2; and First Chicago rose 1 5/8, to 39 7/8.
Tobacco stocks, which typically move higher in a slowing economy, finished on the upside yesterday. Philip Morris closed at 90 3/4, up 1 1/4; UST Inc. closed at 34 3/4, up1/8, and American Brands closed at 44 3/4, up 1/8.
However, the drug stocks were led downward as traders rotated away from the group. Merck declined 1 3/4, to 64 7/8; Eli Lilly fell 1 1/4, to 55 1/4; and Schering-Plough dropped 5/8, to 54 7/8.
A broad range of economically sensitive technology stocks also moved lower. Included were semiconductor stocks like Intel, down 1/2, to 58 7/8, software companies like Microsoft, off 1 3/8, to 88 7/8, and computer systems like Compaq, down 1 1/8, to 48 3/4.
Aluminum stocks were weak, apparently because of worries that demand will fall in 1996. Alcoa slid 1 3/4, to 49 3/4 and Reynolds Metals lost 1, to 53.
Among the special situations, Cordis slumped 11 1/4, or 11 percent, to 95 1/4, after Johnson & Johnson extended the review period for its planned $1.8 billion acquisition of the company.
Safety First, which projected a fourth-quarter loss, dropped 4 1/8, to 15 1/8. And Ventritex declined 2, to 18 3/4, after J. P. Morgan Securites projected a loss for the company of $1.80 a share in the fiscal year ending next June.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Long-Bond Yield at 6%, A 2-Year Low

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The yield on the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond dipped briefly below 6 percent yesterday, then closed at an even 6 percent, its lowest in more than two years, as the market rallied for a fourth consecutive day on favorable economic data and investor optimism that a Federal budget agreement was attainable.
Some market participants have said that as long as President Clinton and Republican leaders are still talking, there is a chance that the deadlock will be resolved in the near term. The market's price rise was limited, however, by bouts of profit taking. 
 The 30-year bond rose 15/32 , to a price of 112. The yield of 6 percent was down from 6.03 percent on Tuesday and was the lowest since Oct. 29, 1993, when it was 5.97 percent.
Donald H. Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch & Company, said that he thought a budget agreement was coming but that he did not expect a breakthrough from the scheduled talks on Friday.
"The process has been ugly, but we remain confident that a deal is coming and will put the Government on a fundamentally more conservative fiscal path," he said. "That will be -- despite all the concern and questions -- good news for the debt and equity markets, good news for the dollar and good news for the economy."
Few economic statistics have been available from Washington since the start of the partial Government shutdown, but the market rose yesterday after a report from a private source. The National Association of Realtors said yesterday that existing-home sales fell for the second consecutive month in November, suggesting that declining mortgage rates have not been enough to overcome the concerns of potential buyers about the slowing economy.
Thomas E. Donne, vice president and a senior portfolio manager at the Banc One Investment Advisers Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, said that while recent economic news had been relatively positive for the bond market, he would not read too much into the gains yesterday, given the thin volume.
"Most everyone, including the fund managers running sizable amounts of money through the market, set their positions for the rest of the year almost a week ago," Mr. Donne said. "As a result, there was very little trading in the long maturities, with some buying and selling in the intermediate and shorter maturities.
"Getting below the 6 percent yield on the long bond is not something I think is sustainable," he added. "But I think that there is a sense in the market that the additional information it is looking for will not be long in coming. And the sooner the Government statisticians are back to work, the sooner we will get that information."
For now, Mr. Donne said, his trading position is "on the long side of neutral," meaning that he could make a modest commitment to invest in more government securities, depending on market conditions.
Bill Gamba, senior vice president in charge of the government trading desk at Cowen & Company, predicted that yields would fall further once there was a budget agreement. "The market is dying to do better, with the direction of interest rates headed down," he said.
"What we need now is a credible budget deal to bring about a comfort level to entice fresh buying," he added, "and that will give the market the ability to maintain levels under 6 percent in the long end."
In futures trading, the March Treasury bond contract hit 12031/32 , matching its Dec. 8 high, Mr. Gamba noted. The low was 12010/32 , but that was in overnight trading. At the close, the contract was 12023/32 , up 13/32 on the day.
"I think any decline in the market can now be used as a buying opportunity," he said.
Stewart Taylor, a fixed-income market analyst at Thomson Research of Boston, said last week's bond rally brought prices back to levels of early December. "I suspect that the rally is a retest of those early December highs, but I do not expect any significant activity until after the new year," he said.

HEADLINE: A Shaky House of Plastic With No Quick Fix in Sight

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Jeanne Hill has a good heart, but to her credit card companies, she's simply "a bad."
"When my dog came down with lymphoma, I maxed out two credit cards on chemotherapy trying to save her," said Ms. Hill, 54, who lives in San Francisco. 
 The dog didn't make it, but the $2,000 in veterinary bills pushed Ms. Hill's total debt to $12,000. When she lost her job as a legal secretary and developed knee problems, her $900 monthly card payment overwhelmed the $1,188 she was receiving from disability insurance.
Thus Jeanne Hill became, in the cruel language of the credit card industry, "a bad" -- someone who, for whatever reason, doesn't pay back what he or she borrowed.
The card companies have learned to assume they will have 2 or 3 bads for every 100 cards they issue -- more in a recession -- and they charge high enough interest rates to the 97 "goods" to cover their expected losses, as dutiful bill payers will gloomily note in the course of paying off holiday shopping charges.
But now the number of bads is on the rise -- along with credit card delinquency rates and personal bankruptcies -- even though the economy continues to expand.
The recent surge in credit card delinquencies -- in part because it is concentrated among relatively few people -- does not pose any immediate threat to the economic expansion. But experts warn that credit standards have become so lax in recent years that when the economy does get bad, losses for banks -- and the level of insurmountable debt for many consumers -- will be far more than ever before. Indeed, Lawrence B. Lindsay, a member of the Federal Reserve Board, recently warned that Americans' growing bad debt was already a "troubling" sign.
Credit card companies will send out nearly 2.7 billion pitches this year, with most households receiving three or four of them a month, according to Behavioral Analysis, a research firm in Tarrytown, N.Y. With response rates to these mailings falling rapidly, the companies are seeking customers who would have been seen as too risky before. And they are trying to steal each other's good customers with lower rates, higher credit limits and invitations to transfer balances to new cards -- offers that boomerang for the lender when they are accepted by someone who turns out to be a bad.
Consumers are taking advantage of the easy credit and low rates to borrow more than ever before. Americans ran up card balances by 19 percent this year, to $305 billion. That is after a 28 percent increase in card debt last year. For the first time this year, banks offered more gold cards, which carry a minimum $5,000 limit, than standard cards.
The sheer pace of this growth raises the question of whether credit card lending is following in the checkered tradition of loans to third world countries and speculative real estate developers.
"Over time, I've learned to look for the speculation, where people are feeling too good, because that's where the problems come," said Gary Gordon, a credit card company analyst at Paine Webber. "Unsecured credit card lending right now has the most activity and the fastest growth."
By that measure, the biggest question in the industry is the quality of the huge portfolios built by four specialized companies -- Advanta, Capital One, First USA and MBNA -- that have doubled their share of the credit card market to 20 percent in just three years. First USA will mail as many credit card offers this year as Citibank, long the industry leader.
In particular, Advanta, Capital One and First USA have won business by combining low teaser rates with sophisticated computer models intended to identify prospective good and bad customers, based not only on their credit history but hundreds of other factors such as the magazines they subscribe to and the cars they drive.
Richard Greenawalt, president of the Advanta Corporation, argues that the company's years of experience with these models will help protect Advanta from credit problems. Capital One and First USA executives declined to comment.
Mr. Greenawalt, echoing the concern of many bank stock analysts, wonders whether the regional banks that have more recently stepped up their credit card mailings without the extensive data bases may be more vulnerable.
"Not everyone knows what they are doing, and some people will get hurt," he said. "There are thousands of details in what we do that are hard to copy."
Yet even the specialized companies -- like their customers -- are living closer to the edge than ever before. They bolster profits from their relatively low-rate offers by using an unusually high amount of debt relative to their equity. This leverage could pose trouble if they are wrong about their computer models.
Even with the economy in its current state, which is far from a recession, credit counselors say the number of consumers asking for help with card bills has hit record highs.
"Normally, December is a slow month for us, because people want to make it through Christmas before facing their debts," said Joanne Budde, executive director of the Consumer Credit Counseling Service of San Francisco. "But we've been busier this December than any month this year. I'm increasing my staff by 40 percent to handle things when the Christmas bills come in."
Jeanne Hill was one of those who sought a hand this month from the service, which helped her negotiate lower interest rates and a payment schedule she could afford. Many other people in similar circumstances are simply choosing to declare bankruptcy, which accounts for nearly half of all bank credit card losses.
Personal bankruptcies are up sharply this year, and in the third quarter 4.2 percent of credit card balances were more than 30 days late. That is up from 2.9 percent a year ago.
To be sure, many credit card executives argue that the rise in delinquencies and bankruptcies is simply a return to normal. That would be expected, they say, after a period of brisk economic growth accompanied by low rates that allowed homeowners to ease their payment burdens by refinancing mortgages.
Yet some bankers see a new type of danger that is not evident in the statistics. With most card issuers mailing blank checks to consumers urging them to transfer balances from other cards, consumers are being encouraged to play a shell game with their debt. And the banks no longer have any early signal that customers are in trouble.
There is a sharp rise in what bankers call "straights," consumers who never missed a payment, then go straight to bankruptcy.
"It's like being hit with a nuclear weapon you didn't know had been launched," said Seamus McMahon, a credit card expert with the First Manhattan Consulting Group.
As a result, some banks, including Chase Manhattan, First Chicago and the Bank of New York, have tightened their credit standards. And Norwest, the huge Minneapolis banking company, completely abandoned offering credit cards in direct mail solicitations, after its losses shot up.
Bankers are split as to whether they should feel any responsibility for their customers' problems.
"There may be a group of people we are tipping over because we have been so aggressive in balance transfers," said Ronald N. Zebeck, head of the credit card unit at the Fingerhut catalogue company.
But Michael Auriemma, an industry consultant, is unmoved. "There are people who go to the supermarket and buy too much food and get fat," he argued. "It's not the supermarket's fault."
Still, there are signs that the card issuers may well have taken a strategy intended to avoid bad credit and pushed it too far.
When the specialized card companies like First USA began offering free gold cards with low teaser rates about five years ago, they stole millions of the best customers from big banks like Citibank, a unit of Citicorp, and Chase, which were so occupied by their real estate problems that they could not afford to lower their rates. But now, with low-rate offers common, many worry that the same strategy is getting a disproportionate number of the worst customers.
"The day you get fired is the day you accept every card offer you get," said Alan D. Shiffers, a former Citibank executive who is now a consultant.
It is a perilous environment in which to market. The most sophisticated companies use their data bases to divide prospects into hundreds of distinct segments, each offered a different combination of interest rate, credit line and marketing pitch. If any of these variables is wrong, the consequences could be a deluge of bads and not enough goods.
"If I offer a 10 percent rate, and all my competitors offer 9 percent, I will get killed on credit no matter how good my underwriting," said Aviad Broshi, the head of credit policy for Chase's credit card unit, because only those most in need will take the 10 percent card in addition to the 9 percent card. Similarly a test by Chase showed that in otherwise identical card offers, one that charged a fee had three times the number of bads as one that was free.
To get out of this trap, card companies are trying to cull the bads from their account rolls before the losses mount. This is difficult because for all the data in their computer models, the companies do not know whom many of their customers work for or how much they earn; since most cards come from "pre-approved" mailings, many customers never fill out applications.
The big card companies have started getting credit bureau reports on all of their customers every few months to look for people who have suddenly taken on a lot more debt or are missing payments to others.
To the annoyance of some of these customers, the companies are lowering credit lines, imposing fees or raising rates on those who appear to be risky.
These moves may cut some losses, but they will not erase mistakes of the past.
"If you didn't do something to tighten your credit last year, it's over," said John Ward, head of credit cards at Chase. "The tidal wave is forming, and if you aren't already on dry land, you are going to drown no matter how fast you swim."

HEADLINE: In New York, Local Management of Welfare Is Democratic

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a county executive and the president of the New York State Association of Counties, I must address your Dec. 19 editorial opposing Gov. George Pataki's block-grant proposal to grant counties and the City of New York more authority to manage welfare and Medicaid programs. 
 You argued that local governments, which are closest to the people served by these programs and cared for New York's neediest citizens long before the state government entered the social services arena, should not be entrusted with more responsibility. Such a view implies that local voters cannot be trusted to elect local officials with enough wisdom and compassion to meet the needs of their own residents, and that only bureaucrats in Albany and Washington can determine the appropriate level of welfare benefits for each community.
The Governor's proposals allow counties to begin crafting programs that fit specific local needs, including the need to make social services more cost-effective. This is not some "misguided reform principle." It is democracy at work. It is built on the fundamental assumption, borne out by experience, that local elected officials are responsive to the needs of their constituents.
The concern that "counties will be tempted to cut poverty programs, including Medicaid coverage, and pass along the savings . . . to businesses and families" is likewise misplaced. In New York we spend more than twice the national average on Medicaid. We also spend more than almost all other states on welfare. Given flexibility from state and Federal mandates, counties and New York City can reduce welfare and Medicaid spending while still meeting the needs of their residents.
Perhaps it is advisable to rein in excessive spending and direct more tax relief toward working middle-class families, and the businesses that employ them, so that they can afford to stay in New York. Shouldn't New York State and local governments both try to break out of the economic death spiral of ever higher taxes to pay for ever higher spending, which leads to more businesses and families fleeing our state, and places even more pressure on the few hardiest taxpayers who remain?
Governor Pataki, a former mayor whose roots are in local government, has grasped the essential principle that the best government derives its authority from those it governs. His trust in local government is well placed.

HEADLINE: Time Warner Seeks Action on Ameritech

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ohio, Dec. 27

 BODY:
Time Warner Inc. has asked Ohio regulators to intervene in its negotiations with the Ameritech Corporation over plans to offer a competing local telephone service.
Ameritech, the regional Bell company that provides local phone service for much of the Great Lakes area, is either unable or unwilling to reach an agreement to provide connections on calls from Time Warner's proposed network, Time Warner said Tuesday evening. 
 "While the parties have clearly reached agreements on all technical issues necessary for interconnection, the same cannot be said with respect to the economic aspects of interconnection," the company said in a letter to Craig Glazer, chairman of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio.
An Ameritech spokeswoman, Anne Bloomberg, said this morning that the company was surprised by Time Warner's complaint.
"We certainly thought the negotiations were going well," she said, noting that the sides met as recently as late last week. "We thought all issues were on the table. Suddenly, Time Warner raised some new ones."
Time Warner filed an application last year with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio to offer local telephone service in 37 of Ohio's 88 counties.
The company was granted a provisional certificate in August by the commission to proceed, but first it must reach interconnection agreements with Ameritech and other Ohio phone companies so customers can call anywhere, regardless of which company they use.

Even in the midst of the current mergers and acquisitions frenzy in corporate America, the Boston Scientific Corporation has raised eyebrows with its voracious appetite this last year and a half.
The company, a maker of medical devices, has swallowed five significant competitors since August 1994, in stock swaps totaling $2.08 billion. The hypergrowth strategy has caused revenues to more than double, from $450 million in 1994 to more than $1 billion this year; meanwhile, the company's work force has leaped from 1,800 a year ago to more than 7,000 by year's end. 
 But if Wall Street is worried that Boston Scientific has bitten off more than it can chew, it doesn't show it. [The company's stock has climbed steadily through the year from a low of $16.75 a share to $47.125 at Wednesday's close.] Earnings per share have jumped from 81 cents in 1994 to $1.24 this year.
From its start in 1979, Boston Scientific has been a bet on medical care evolving toward the sort of cost consciousness that has fully taken hold only in the last few years.
Most analysts rate the stock a strong buy, saying that Boston Scientific is building a powerhouse in its markets for minimally invasive medical devices -- catheters used for treatment of coronary, gastrointestinal and urological diseases.
The company's founders, Peter M. Nicholas and John Abele, expected that the high financial and physical cost of major surgery would lead the medical community to embrace tools for the least damaging and dangerous methods of diagnosis and care.
Viewing the human body as a series of "biologic cylinders" that could be explored, purged and otherwise repaired using catheter-based devices like balloons poked through the skin, Boston Scientific developed products that quickly became standards among physicians. The beauty of the products is, for example, in angioplasty, in which doctors insert a catheter with a balloon fitted to the end that is inflated and used to clear clogged arteries. An alternative treatment might require something as drastic as open heart surgery.
"Using these devices allowed a physician to perform intervention much earlier in the disease cycle, with lower cost and lower trauma," said Mr. Nicholas, the company's chairman, chief executive and president. "The alternative, which was further down the disease cycle, was major surgery, which was often worse than the disease itself."
With the company's sudden growth over the last year, Mr. Nicholas said his biggest worry was losing the "richness and crispness" of Boston Scientific's culture, a culture characterized by risk-taking highly devoted employees, many of whom hold large financial stakes in the company's future through generous stock options.
Mr. Nicholas is optimistic that the integration of the new companies will be smooth. And analysts, though wary, say if any company can pull it off, Boston Scientific can.
"It's a pretty daunting task," said Thomas Gunderson, a medical technology analyst with Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis. "Can they juggle five balls? Nobody has been able to do it yet. But they are one of the best managed companies I know of. They have a lot of capacity and are very attentive to details."
The kind of growth undertaken by Boston Scientific reflects what Mr. Nicholas believes will be required for a company to survive and thrive in health care. With the accelerating consolidation of hospitals and other health care providers, purchasers of medical devices suddenly have tremendous economic clout, he said.
And where the decision-maker was once the physician, today's buyer tends to be a corporate finance officer or purchasing executive.
"For us to be effective, we need to have the broadest product line within each of our businesses," Mr. Nicholas said. "We also need a leading share of the market; we have to be the low-cost, high-quality producer and we need access to and control of technology that will impact our business in the future."
In acquiring Scimed Life Systems Inc., Heart Technology, Cardiovascular Imaging Systems Inc., Meadox Medicals and EP Technologies, Boston Scientific calculated that it was, in effect, buying product lines rather than companies. Scimed, for example, sells a broad line of angioplasty catheters. Heart Technologies makes a catheter with a football-shaped burr at the end that spins like a router device, at 190,000 rotations a minute, to clear out plaque from arteries.
As hospitals merge or are swallowed up by chains, the pressure has increased for device manufacturers to consolidate as well, making it tougher for small players to compete. For example, Johnson & Johnson's initially hostile takeover of Cordis, another catheter maker, is likely to mean more aggressive pricing strategies in the industry. Companies like Seattle-based Heart Technologies, Mr. Nicholas said, had a single high-quality product line "which made them vulnerable; they couldn't survive alone, so now they become a product line in our company."
Attention to detail has characterized Boston Scientific's management. Frederick Wise, an analyst with Bear, Stearns, lauded Mr. Nicholas and Mr. Abele for their ability to work together: Mr. Nicholas commanding the strategic business and marketing side and Mr. Abele tending to the technical needs of the health care market.
"They are a very rare demonstration of a co-chairmanship that has worked for 16 years," Mr. Wise said.
Now, the pair will be tested beyond anything they have yet experienced.
"They're a good company but they are at a very critical stage, moving from a moderate-sized company to a big company," said Dr. Robert Z. Gussin, corporate vice president of science and technology at the rival Johnson & Johnson. "To assimilate all those businesses and move as quickly as they have in the past will be difficult. The jury is still out."
Moreover, a changing regulatory and business environment threatens Boston Scientific's continued commitment to risk-taking and leading- edge research, according to Dr. Jeffrey M. Isner, chief of cardiovascular research at St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Boston and a longtime customer.
"They have a lot of factors in health care reimbursement working against them," Dr. Isner said.
He cites the company's willingness to build catheters for cardiovascular human gene therapy. "They are the only ones willing to do that, so the risk-taking instincts are still alive there," Dr. Isner said. "But will the market allow them to do that a year or two from now?"
In its formative years, Boston Scientific earned a reputation In the medical community for forging close ties to physicians. Mr. Abele, whom many in the industry call a visionary, became a fixture at hospitals and medical gatherings, soaking up new ideas and seeking input from doctors. "John is a great tinkerer, constantly talking to anybody who had an idea," Dr. Isner said.
Boston Scientific had quietly remained private and richly profitable until 1992, when it reluctantly went public to pay off a 10-year-old financial obligation to Abbott Labs, which had bought 20 percent of the company in 1982.
Now, Boston Scientific is squarely on the Wall Street radar screen.
"Over the next 10 years, you won't see any field of medicine grow as fast as minimally invasive procedures," said Dean Kamen, president of Deka, a Manchester, N.H., medical products research and engineering firm. "Boston Scientific is very well positioned in all those areas."

Gingrich Won't Compromise On Reopening Government
The House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, on the eve of scheduled negotiations with President Clinton to balance the budget, said that until an accord was reached, Republicans would not agree to any temporary measures to reopen shuttered Government offices.
In another disagreement with the Democrats, Mr. Gingrich and Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader, expressed unhappiness with a proposal to overhaul communications laws, contending that several provisions amounted to a giveaway of a crucial part of the airwaves to broadcasters. Last week it appeared that the White House and Republican leaders were in accord on rewriting the 61-year-old laws. [Page A1.]
 
Compuserve Censors Access To Groups Violating German Law
Compuserve has blocked access by its subscribers around the world to more than 200 sexually explicit computer discussion groups and picture data bases, because a German Federal prosecutor in Munich said the material violated German pornography laws.
The action, the most far-reaching instance yet of Internet censorship, underscores the extent to which diverse national, cultural and political values are coming into conflict with the essentially borderless technology of the global Internet computer network. Compuserve, a unit of H & R Block, described its move as temporary while it studies its legal options. [A1.]
 
Rate on Long Bond Below 6%
The interest rate on 30-year Treasury bonds closed at less than 6 percent for the first time in more than two years, reflecting a growing view that the economy was much weaker than previously thought, and will remain slack into the Presidential election year. [A1.]
 
The price of the Treasury's bellwether long bond rose 11/32 , to 11211/32 , for a yield of 5.98 percent, down from 6 percent on Wednesday, the lowest since Oct. 29, 1993. [D13.]
 
Head of CBS News Is Leaving
Eric W. Ober confirmed that he was being replaced as president of CBS News, and would leave on Jan. 12, after five years in the job. His replacement was expected to be Andrew Heyward, the 45-year-old executive producer of the "CBS Evening News." [D4.]
 
Dean Witter and Paine Webber?
Wall Street brokers and bankers were chattering about the possibility that Dean Witter, Discover had its eye on the Paine Webber Group -- a merger that would create the largest retail brokerage house in the United States. But some analysts who follow the situation carefully gave it less than a 50 percent chance of happening. [D2.]
 
Cirrus Stock Tumbles 26%
Cirrus Logic shares fell $7, to $19.875, after the maker of audio and video chips said for the second time that earnings would not meet expectations. Investors feared that profit could be hurt for several quarters. [D3.]
 
Isis Ends Work on Genetic Drug
Isis Pharmaceuticals called off work on an unusual genetic drug that was the first of a new class of compounds, known as "antisense molecules," ever to be injected into humans. While holding promise, the molecules have proved difficult to turn into drugs. But Isis is continuing work on similar drugs, which are now in clinical trial. [D2.]
 
Echostar's Stock
Up With Satellite
Echostar Communications launched its first satellite, capping a nervous couple of months for the company's management. The satellite will offer customers 75 channels of entertainment by means of an 18-inch home satellite dish. Investors pushed Echostar's stock up $3.375, to $24. Market Place. [D6.]
 
Stocks Drift Lower
The stock market drifted lower in slow and somewhat aimless trading. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 10.12 points, to 5,095.80, with such big blue chips as I.B.M., Walt Disney and Philip Morris declining. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 5.91 points, to 1,042.22. [D6.]
 
Natural Gas Futures Slide
Surging natural gas futures prices reversed course, tumbling on forecasts for milder Northeastern weather. [D5.]

HEADLINE: Stocks Drift Lower in Another Slow Day

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
The stock market drifted lower yesterday in slow and somewhat aimless trading.
"The day was quiescent," said Edwin D. Walczak, chief investment officer of Vontobel U.S.A., describing the inactivity among traders. "You could call it a day of gestation in anticipation of vacation." 
 Even the bond market's rally did not have much of an impact on stocks. The yield of the 30-year Treasury bond, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, slipped to 5.98 percent, marking the first time it ended at les than 6 percent since October 1993.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 10.12 points, to 5,095.80, for its second consecutive decline. The major blue-chip losers were I.B.M., down 1 7/8, to 90 1/8; Walt Disney, down 7/8, to 59 3/8; and Philip Morris, down 7/8, to 89 7/8. Among the broader indicators, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index eased 0.41 point to 614.12 and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 5.91 points, to 1,042.22.
But advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the New York Stock Exchange by 1,249 to 1,088. Turnover on the Big Board amounted to 288.7 million shares, up from 252.3 million shares on Wednesday, but sharply below the three-month daily average of around 371 million shares.
Technology stocks stumbled yesterday, led by Cirrus Logic, which plunged 7, to 19 7/8. On Wednesday, the computer chip maker trimmed its profits forecast for the second time in two months because of reduced demand in the fiscal third quarter.
This warning depressed the stock prices of other semiconductor manufacturers and pulled other technology issues down as well. Intel fell 1 3/4, to 57 1/8; Motorola dropped 1/2, to 56 7/8, and Micron Technology lost 1 1/2, to 40 1/4.
Airline shares fell after major carriers announced a new round of fare reductions, and that weighed on the Dow Jones transportation average, which slumped 5.98 points to 1,953.49. UAL, the parent of United Airlines, fell 2 5/8, to 174 3/4; Delta lost 5/8, to 72 1/8; AMR, the parent of American Airlines, slipped 3/8, to 73 1/4, and USAir closed down 1/4, at 13 1/8.
After Michaels Stores said that it expected to report significantly lower profits for the quarter ending on Jan. 31, its shares dropped 5/8, to 14 3/8. Other retailers that ended the day at a lower level were Home Depot, off 1/2, to 47 1/4, and Fingerhut, off 1/4, to 14 3/8.
In contrast, some utilities advanced and the Dow Jones utilities average gained 0.70 points, to 224.57. American Water Works rose 1 1/8, to 38; Brooklyn Union added 1/8, to 28 3/4; and Duke Power increased 1/8, to 47 1/2.
Selected insurance stocks, considered defensive issues that perform well in periods of slow economic growth, also turned higher. Reliastar closed at 41 3/4, up 7/8; Lincoln National closed at 53 1/8, up 5/8; and Horace Mann closed at 30 5/8, up 1/2.
Wells Fargo, which has made an offer to acquire First Interstate, advanced 2 3/4, to 216 5/8. But Federal National Mortgage, which surged 5 1/4 on Wednesday, gave up 1 1/4, to close at 123 3/4 yesterday on profit-taking.

HEADLINE: ON WALL ST., SIGNS OF SLOW GROWTH FOR THE ECONOMY

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The interest rate on long-term Treasury bonds closed at less than 6 percent yesterday for the first time in more than two years, reflecting a growing view that the economy is much weaker than most experts thought just weeks ago and will remain slack into the Presidential election year.
What is notable is that no one is challenging this view of Wall Street's traders, who buy and sell huge quantities of securities, manipulating the nation's interest rates in the process. They contend that a budget deal will soon emerge that shrinks the deficit, and a smaller deficit, combined with mild inflation and data signaling weaker growth, all justify lower rates. 
 But almost no one is predicting a recession, which would be a huge obstacle to the re-election of President Clinton. So far, not even the most pessimistic of the 50 prominent forecasters polled each month by Blue Chip Economic Indicators see a recession in 1996.
The Administration's view, offered over the last two weeks by various officials, is essentially this: Economic growth is stronger in some quarters of the year than in others and right now we are going through one of the weaker periods. "But there is no fundamental weakness in this economy," an Administration official said yesterday. "Hopefully the economy will be a positive for the election campaign."
Certainly investors are bullish. With markets rising sharply in value, they put more money into mutual funds in November than in any month since January 1994, a trade group said yesterday. [Page D1.]
Then the economy was booming, largely in response to rates almost as low as they are today. Not since October 1993 has the 30-year Treasury bond's rate -- or more accurately the amount of money the bond earns, or yields, for investors -- slipped to less than 6 percent. The yield fell to 5.98 percent yesterday from 6 percent on Wednesday and 6.11 percent 10 days ago. [Page D13.]
Wall Street traders, economists, and officials at the Federal Reserve -- the other big player in setting interest rates -- all point to a different set of circumstances from that of two years ago to explain the steady decline in rates without a corresponding pickup in the economy.
Low rates on Treasury securities in 1993 translated into the lowest rates in years for mortgages and car loans. Many homeowners refinanced mortgages, freeing billions of dollars for consumer spending that otherwise would have gone into their house payments. Home construction and car sales, helped along by low rates, also recovered smartly from the 1990-91 recession. None of that is happening now.
"You have to get rates lower than they were two years ago in order to get the same response," Lawrence H. Meyer, an economist and consultant in St. Louis, said. "Most of the people who might have acted on rates at today's levels did so in 1993. You need to go down another one-half to one full percentage point to draw in people again and get the same sort of refinancing and spending."
Falling rates on Treasury securities -- and they have fallen this week all along the spectrum, from 90-day bills to 30-year bonds -- eventually show up as lower rates on home equity loans and commercial loans, as well as lower rates on mortgages and auto credit. All that is happening, and these consumer rates might in fact get lower than they were in 1993, led down by further declines in the rates for Treasury securities.
Since late September, the 30-year Treasury bond has been the only Treasury security trading above 6 percent. But that rate began to crack on Dec. 19 when the Federal Reserve decided to lower a key short-term rate that it controls -- the Federal funds rate -- by one-quarter of a percentage point. Bond traders interpreted that move as signaling the strong possibility of further cuts in the months ahead.
The Federal funds rate governs short-term loans that banks and other financial institutions make to each other. What they pay for money governs, in turn, what they charge for loans.
"Basically, the market is of the view that the Federal funds rate is going to continue to decline, and it is going to stay at a new lower level for a good while," said William Dudley, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs & Company.
Unexpectedly weak Christmas sales seemed to ratify the Fed's move, in the eyes of bond traders. So have big stockpiles of unsold merchandise, weakness in industrial production and capital spending, and a drop in inflation for November -- once again confirming a widely held view that inflation is not likely to pick up soon. All suggest that the economy needs less-expensive credit to stimulate spending. And Fed officials have done nothing to discourage this view.
"The most reasonable prediction is for near-term growth very close to trend," Alan Blinder, the Fed's vice chairman, said yesterday, suggesting optimistically that the Christmas season downswing in the economy was temporary and that economic growth would soon return to an annual rate of 2.5 percent, if it was not already there now. "But the risks," he warned, "are on the downside."
Deficit reduction appears to be playing a big role for the moment in encouraging bond traders to keep rates low, and thus avoid the risk of a recession. These traders are notorious for their swings in sentiment -- and sentiment has clearly swung to the view that the Administration and the Republican congressional leadership will reach an agreement that will shrink the deficit.
"One way or another, the deficit is going to be cut," said Peter L. Bernstein, an economist and market analyst in New York. "That is the reality; the argument is over the details, not the process."
Such thinking puts pressure on the budget negotiators to reach an agreement. If they fail, dashing the current expectations on Wall Street, interest rates could rise in response.
Bond traders are not usually optimistic about deficit reduction and the lower interest rates that smaller deficits encourage. Nor are they given to warning about weaknesses in the economy. Their interest lies much more in warning about strong growth and the increased inflation that such growth can engender. Their customers, the people who hold trillions of dollars in bonds, stand to lose money when inflation picks up. That reduces the buying power of the money these investors have locked up in bonds and similar Treasury securities. In anticipation of this danger, Wall Street traders soon demand higher interest rates to offset this loss.
Given this pressure, these traders rarely see weakness in the economy turning into a recession. Much more often than not, they say that the economy has hit a temporary lull and that strong growth lies ahead. This lull is no exception.
"When we get to midyear, the economy will turn out to be in good shape," said Stephen S. Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company, echoing a view that showed up in half a dozen interviews with traders and Wall Street economists. "As we get to midyear, wage pressures are going to start to rise and the inflation rate will begin to rise."

HEADLINE: BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET: THE DETAILS;
Showdown and Shutdown: The Basics Over the Budget

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 28

 BODY:
It seems irrational. Some Government offices are closed, but many more are open. Some Government workers have been furloughed, but they have been promised they will be paid for not working. Others are working at full pay. Still others are at work but will draw only half a paycheck this week.
Congress, meanwhile, is in recess. Many top Administration officials are on vacation. President Clinton is planning his annual New Year's weekend in South Carolina. Speaker Newt Gingrich says no break in the deadlock over the Federal budget is possible until the middle of next week at the earliest. 
 The plot is so convoluted, the developments are so incremental and the characters seem so agitated when they speak that even avid followers of the political script often have trouble figuring out what is going on and who is at fault. If you are confused and want to know the basics about the budget conflict, here they are:
 
 The Shutdown
Six annual spending bills have not been enacted -- that is, have not been passed by Congress and signed by the President, or have not been passed over his veto. They hold the money to operate nine Cabinet departments and many other Government agencies in the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1.
In the departments and agencies without funds, only employees designated essential are on the job, although in some offices that is all or most of the work force.
The White House and the Capitol are open, and their employees working because laws providing their funds have been enacted. The same is true of the Departments of Defense, the Treasury and Transportation.
Three bills that have not been enacted -- those for the District of Columbia, foreign operations and the Departments of Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services -- are stuck in Congress for one reason or another.
Three other annual spending bills have been vetoed by the President: one for the Departments of Commerce, Justice and State and the Federal judiciary, another for the Interior Department and the third for the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency that are not part of any Cabinet department.
The President has also vetoed the vast long-term bill that is the keystone of the Republican Congressional majority's plan to balance the budget in seven years. This legislation would limit spending for Medicare, end the 60-year-old Government guarantee of Federal assistance to the poor, turn over Medicaid and most other welfare programs to the states, scrap many existing farm programs and cut taxes for middle-income families with children and for investors.
The Republican majority in Congress is much too small to override the vetoes.
When annual spending bills have not become law by the beginning of the fiscal year, Congress routinely approves a temporary measure called a continuing resolution that keeps the departments and agencies functioning until legislation providing their funds can be enacted. That has already happened twice this fall.
But Republicans are using the current Government shutdown as leverage to pressure Mr. Clinton into signing their long-term budget bill. If the budget bill does not become law, much of their revolution will be thwarted: taxes will not be cut, and benefit programs like Medicare will continue without change.
For some Federal workers, the effect of the partial shutdown will be felt in paychecks on Friday. In offices without funds, even those who have been working cannot be paid for the days since the shutdown began. But because the shutdown started midway through many employees' pay period, these employees -- whether working or ordered not to work -- will draw one week's pay in what would normally be a two-week paycheck.
Congressional leaders promise that any pay lost during this period of turmoil will be restored once the impasse is eventually broken.
 
The Negotiations
Before the 1996 fiscal year began on Oct. 1, Congress passed and the President signed a continuing resolution extending the Government's spending authority through Nov. 13. When that measure expired, the first partial shutdown began. It lasted for six days until, on a Sunday night, negotiators from the White House and Congress struck a deal on a new temporary spending resolution, to last through Dec. 15.
The agreement that reopened the Government was intentionally ambiguous. Both sides agreed to work on legislation to balance the Federal budget by 2002 as measured by the calculations of the Congressional Budget Office. They also agreed to "provide adequate funding" for Medicare, Medicaid, education and other programs the Clinton Administration favors.
Since then, the two sides have done little but shadowbox. Republicans have argued that by not using the Congressional Budget Office's economic assumptions in drawing up his own latest plan to balance the budget in seven years, the President reneged on his part of the agreement. The President has blamed Republicans, declaring that they failed to offer enough money for programs like Medicare.
On Dec. 19, four days into the latest shutdown, President Clinton and the Congressional leaders -- Mr. Gingrich and Senator Bob Dole -- seemed to reach an accord to open the Government through the holidays.
But at a televised news conference, Vice President Al Gore appeared to contradict the Republican account of the accord, which was that the President had agreed to negotiate, by the end of the year, a balanced budget based on Congressional Budget Office calculations. It is not clear whether Mr. Gore misspoke or was intentionally trying to throw sand in the gears.
In any case, on Dec. 20 Republicans in the House scuttled the agreement reached the night before. They maintained that the Vice President's statement had made clear that the White House would not negotiate in good faith, although this may have been mostly an excuse to justify their hard line.
The President and the Republicans who control the Senate favor reopening the Government while the political dispute is being resolved, but they have been unable to do so because of the rigid position taken in the House.
Occasional talks have gone on at various levels since then, but nothing of substance has been accomplished. Congress is basically in recess until Jan. 3, and Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff and main Administration budget negotiator, has been on vacation.
The President and Congressional leaders are supposed to meet on Friday. But as best anyone on the outside can tell, they are no closer to resolving their differences than they were when the fiscal year began three months ago.
 
The Issues
The President insists on preserving Medicare for the elderly and the social safety net for the poor. Congressional leaders demand a balanced budget in seven years. If all that were at stake was the amount of money separating them, they could certainly split the difference and be done with it.
But beneath the political oratory, the impasse is grounded in one fundamental, possibly insurmountable disagreement. The Republicans want to diminish the importance of the Federal Government in American life. The President does not, and, in some instances, would expand the Government's role.
Thus, the Republicans want not only to restrain spending but to cut taxes as well. They want to convert Medicare eventually to a voucher system in which the Government would give retirees money with which to purchase their own health insurance. They would also give the states primary responsibility for Medicaid and cash assistance, limit Federal contributions to other programs for the poor like food stamps, cut spending for education, weaken a variety of environmental safeguards, permit much more commercial development and use of Government land, cut Government research programs and give the Government less say about what farmers produce.
President Clinton opposes all those policies. He favors only a modest tax cut. He would basically maintain Medicare and Medicaid as they are now, and he has promised to veto a welfare bill already approved by Congress. In the case of education, environmental protection and technological development, he supports a substantial expansion of the Federal Government's spending and influence.
Listing the basic disagreements understates the extent of the divide. In each area, there are dozens of specific policy differences between the two sides. In the case of Medicare, to take just one example, they range from major issues like how much premiums should be increased to relatively minor ones like the payment for administering blood-clotting factor to hemophiliacs.
The Politics
Politics is usually like a sporting event in which one team is ahead and the other is trying to catch up. The budget impasse is one of the rare instances when both sides believe they have the political edge.
Republicans, especially those in the House, believe they were elected into the majority last year because they had promised fundamental changes in the ways of Washington. They see compromise and deal-making as elements of the old ways that the public was fed up with. As long as they stand fast, they believe, they will come out ahead politically, not just in the long term but in next year's elections as well.
The President and his Democratic allies have returned to the well that has sustained the party for half a century. Most Republicans opposed Social Security in the 1930's and Medicare in the 1960's, and Democrats have never let them forget it. As they have countless times in the past, Democrats have positioned themselves this year squarely on the side of the elderly.
In next year's election campaign, expect each side not so much to defend its own stand as to attack the other's.
Republicans will describe Democrats as supporting ever higher taxes and opposing a balanced budget because they cannot control their appetite for profligate spending. Democrats will picture Republicans as calloused fat cats who want to gut Medicare for the elderly and the disabled to pay for tax cuts for the affluent.
The election results may well turn on which side can make the charge stick.
Public opinion polls show that the President's standing has improved as the budget war has dragged on. But poll results are notoriously ephemeral. The dominant public view in December 1995 could well change by January, to say nothing of November.
 
The Outlook
Here are three safe bets:
*The Government will stay partly closed at least until next Wednesday, when Congress returns from its holiday.
*Sooner or later, Government offices will reopen, furloughed workers will be paid for their days off, and those whose pay has been docked will be made whole.
*When that happens, each side will blame the other for the shutdown and the inconveniences it entailed.
Beyond that, little can be predicted with confidence.
Behind the scenes at the White House and in Congress, some strategists favor compromise to resolve the budget differences. Others, as in a game of chicken, favor sitting tight and waiting for the opposition to swerve.
Even if both sides decide that compromise is the best course, it could take weeks to sort out the myriad issues that divide them. The best that can probably be hoped for in the short run is that the White House and Congress will agree to a basic framework and use that as the basis for putting the Government back to work while the meat and the muscle are put on the skeleton.
For the long term, it is hard to imagine Republicans relenting on their demand for policies that can be shown on paper to lead to a balanced budget in seven years. It is equally difficult to imagine the President relinquishing his hole card: a basically unchanged Medicare system.
If neither side blinks, the President and Congress may be able to find some way for the Government to operate in 1996 while all the issues are fought out on the campaign trail. But how they can do that is anyone's guess.

HEADLINE: Foreigners Flock to Slopes to Work, Not Ski

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: SILVERTHORNE, Colo. Dec. 22

 BODY:
Snowshoes adorned the ski chalet wall, a snow-clad Rocky Mountain peak dominated the bay window, and Sidy Ba paused in his cleaning chores to talk about the mountains back home.
"In Mauritania, we have mountains, too, but it's the desert, the Sahara," the 32-year housekeeper said, his body lithe and his French precarious, since he rarely used his second language during a nomadic youth spent herding goats along the Senegal River in West Africa. 
 West Africans in the Rockies are part of the rapidly changing face of the ski resort work force as the classic American ski bum, immortalized in movies and magazine covers, becomes scarce. With American college students shunning low-status jobs, and high housing costs scaring away American blue-collar workers, hotels, resorts, and restaurants are increasingly trying to ease an acute labor shortage by hiring immigrants from Africa, Latin America, Europe, and the former Soviet Union.
The new ski resort worker is more likely to be looking for a long-term job that will pay enough to help support the family at home, employers say, and less likely to take up the standard resort offer of a free season pass for the ski slopes.
"Ski?" asked Fatou Toure, a 20-year-old Ivory Coast woman and a charter member of a new group, The Association of Africans in Colorado. "I'm here for a precise goal: to make money. I see all those people slipping around; that's not for me."
Yet even with the influx of immigrant labor, as winter embraces the nation's most popular skiing state, Colorado's mountain resorts are still struggling to fill openings for chambermaids, janitors, sales clerks and other low-status jobs.
Scarce and expensive housing in the resort areas may be partially to blame. But some employers say the problem is caused by the confluence of long-term trends: Jobs in the ski industry have increased while there are about the same number of American college students, who have traditionally filled those jobs.
Also, employers say, those students have lost interest in these jobs, even if the perks include free skiing time. The limited number of students who do want to work in resorts find they can nearly always choose from among better paying, cleaner jobs.
"Generally, the American college kid doesn't want to write home and say he is cleaning toilets," said John W. Reilly, personnel manager for Ralston Resorts Inc.
So employers are looking to workers like Sidy Ba to fill the gap.
"In the 1970's, the labor market was Denver, in the 1980's, it was national, and in the 1990's, it went international," said Jim Felton, a spokesman for Ralston, whose resorts include Arapahoe Basin, Breckenridge and Keystone. Mr. Felton estimated that almost 10 percent of the workers at those areas were foreigners, including European ski instructors, Australian parking attendants and Costa Rican maids.
Gregorievich Harut, a 49-year-old former judo trainer from southern Russia, works in the laundry at the Hampton Inn here.
"We're from Russia, Belarus, Lithuania, Ukraine," Mr. Harut said. "We're all educated people -- a psychologist, a teacher, an economist, a lawyer."
In recent years, the United States Department of Labor has certified local shortages of ski instructors and motel janitors, allowing Colorado resorts to import workers on temporary visas. This season, for the first time, one Colorado resort won permission to import nannies, lift attendants and restaurant workers.
Because of the shortage of workers, mountain resorts have taken to a variety of tactics to court those looking for jobs.
"The Best Place to Work!" one ski area, Copper Mountain, implores from one of three pages of help-wanted advertisements in today's Summit Daily News, a newspaper here. Breckenridge, a competitor, woos prospective workers with a list of "incredible benefits" that includes "a free ski pass for eight mountains (that's 4,144 acres) of world class skiing." And the 7-Eleven chain offers workers at their store here and in Vail "a $1/hr. bonus for employees who work the entire ski season."
"Applicants interview us," groaned Barbara LeRoy, who largely hires Eastern European housekeepers at the Hampton Inn here.
Despite a month of job fairs and heavy fall advertising in college newspapers, the ski season has started with about 10 percent of Colorado's 86,000 ski industry jobs unfilled, said John Frew, president of Colorado Ski Country USA, a resort group. "All the resorts are looking for employees," he said.
In Colorado ski towns, wages generally start at $7 an hour, almost double the national minimum wage of $4.25. In Idaho, another major skiing state, one resort has raised all salaries by 35 percent in four years.
But Lalo Delgado, a counselor in Denver for Mexican immigrant workers, said, "The problem in the resort areas is not the salaries -- it's that there are no houses."
Describing the housing outside Aspen for Mexican workers, Sheriff Bob Braudis of Pitkin County said, "We have visited trailers that are wall-to-wall mattresses.
"People tell me, 'Bob, you've got to clean up the valley.' I tell them: 'Who cooked your breakfast this morning? Who cleaned your toilet?' "
In Silverthorne, one classified advertisement for a ski shop worker starts simply: "Housing available."
To ease the housing shortage, the Roman Catholic diocese has built low-income housing and has urged resorts to house their own employees. Here in Silverthorne, for example, Keystone and Arapahoe provide housing for 1,100 employees -- about one-third of their combined peak season total.
Some Coloradans say greed has created a situation in which workers cannot afford to live in the communities they serve.
"Before they search overseas for new janitors, ski resorts first should mop up their own mess at home," Mark Obmascik, The Denver Post's environmental columnist, wrote recently. "Resorts created a problem when they sold million-dollar trophy homes around the base of their ski slopes but neglected to provide basic shelter for the laborers who actually make the resorts run."
A casualty of these economic forces has been the growing shortage of American college students interested in skiing, parties and work, usually in that order.
"For the standard ski bum, skiing is top of the list -- 'four or more, and out the door,' " said Mr. Reilly of the Ralston Resorts, repeating the adage about ski resort workers who vanish after four inches of new snow blankets the slopes.
In contrast, the new workers from Africa and other southern climates spurn free ski lessons for a second job.
"We have a lot of relatives in Africa who don't have anything," said Mr. Ba, who cleans rooms at Keystone during the day, then moonlights at a Wendy's restaurant. "We can't live the life of America. We can't go to nightclubs, go to restaurants, go to basketball games. We eat together. We send money home."
All the West Africans and Eastern Europeans who were interviewed said that they had legal documentation to work in the United States.
But the Denver office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates that the number of illegal aliens in Colorado has grown to about 22,000 today, from 17,500 three years ago. The Federal agency has 17 field agents to control illegal immigration in this state.
California's recent moves to strip illegal aliens of social service benefits have diverted some Mexicans to labor-short Colorado, said Joe Greene, district director of the Denver office of the Immigration Service. The number of Mexican workers in the resort towns increases by thousands yearly, according to social service workers.
Facing an influx of illegal workers, the agency last summer conducted a workshop in Vail to teach mountain employers about forgeries of Social Security cards and about the fines of up to $10,000 they can face for knowingly hiring illegal aliens.
Earlier this month, the agency followed up on its word, conducting raids throughout Vail and Aspen. Forty-five illegal workers were detained at 12 businesses, largely construction companies and restaurants. The workers, all Mexicans, were deported.
"This will not be the only visit we make up there this season," Mr. Greene promised from Denver.
Meanwhile, in the lee of the 12,777-foot-high peak of Buffalo Mountain, Silverthorne's fledgling community of about 50 West Africans is gingerly coming to grips with winter sports. Fofana Bakary, a one-time member of the Ivory Coast Olympic boxing team, ventured out recently on a snow board.
"The first time I did, I fell, and it hurt all over," the 29-year-old said in French, before dissolving into Dioula, a West African trading language, to crack jokes with Miss Toure.
Turning to the English he has picked up at the Sav-O-Mat gasoline station here, he said, with the confidence of a proven athlete, "Now, I want to buy a board -- and go fast."

HEADLINE: Answering the March's Call;
More Community Involvement by Black Men

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
After the march, one man was so moved that he joined a church in Harlem and committed himself to helping its young members. Another decided to organize a group of men to adopt a high school in the Bronx, to instill images of successful black men in students' minds. A teen-ager, shy beforehand, was emboldened to set his sights on becoming an actor.
More than two months have passed since a group of 51 men boarded a chartered Tour Kings bus outside Wells Restaurant in Harlem in the predawn chill of Oct. 16 to attend the Million Man March in Washington. And now that the huge crowd, the passionate speeches and the feeling of camaraderie are just memories, many of the men who rode together on that bus say they are answering, in their own ways, the march's call for black men to take more responsibility for their communities. 
 That single bus contained some laureled men: the columnist Earl Caldwell and Billy E. Jones, the former head of the city's public hospital system, for example. It also carried men of no particular renown, including teachers, government workers, salesmen and students. There was one homeless man.
But interviews with nearly two dozen of the men suggest that they have one thing in common: they have been profoundly affected by their experience on that October day in ways big and small.
"There has been a marked difference in my life," said Jacques A. DeGraff, a 46-year-old head of a Manhattan construction and development company, who chartered the bus. "It has renewed my commitment to some of my existing activities and has led me to take on new challenges."
Specifically, Mr. DeGraff said, he has worked on a program, scheduled to begin in February, under which members of One Hundred Black Men, a civic group he belongs to, will volunteer to serve as mentors for students at Roosevelt High School in the Bronx.
Mr. DeGraff also said he has set up a meeting for January with leaders of One Hundred Black Men and representatives of other black civic and fraternal groups to discuss the need for black foster parents.
"We will introduce everyone to the problems of going through the bureaucracy of becoming foster parents," Mr. DeGraff said. "We want to make sure that we follow up on the commitments we made at the march."
Michael J. Garner, a 35-year-old manager in a city agency, said he was moved by the calls at the march for black men to support black civic and fraternal organizations. In just the last month, he joined the N.A.A.C.P. and began spending three hours each Saturday morning helping high school students in Harlem prepare to take the Scholastic Assessment Test.
"I left there thinking I had to do something more than I was doing,"said Mr. Garner, a former basketball player at the State University in Buffalo.
While it is impossible to say whether the responses of the men on the bus from Harlem reflect the impact the rally made on the rest of the hundreds of thousands who attended, anecdotal evidence suggests that many others also felt changed by the experience.
Leaders of several black fraternities in New York say that since the rally, their members have been clamoring to establish new programs for young people, especially those that would help develop the skills of black teen-age boys. The Urban League in New York reports record numbers of new volunteers, particularly for a program involving juvenile offenders.
The march has been the topic of seminars in high schools throughout the area, and many black churches have sought to channel the energy of the marchers by encouraging men to join their congregations or participate in church volunteer programs.
At the time it took place, the Million Man March was the focus of intense controversy and some criticism because one of the main organizers was Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, who has often been assailed for his anti-Semitic comments. But none of the members of the Harlem group who were interviewed belonged to the Nation of Islam before the march, they said, adding that the rally had not persuaded them to join. Officials of the Nation of Islam in Harlem and Chicago, where the group is based, did not return phone calls to discuss how the event had affected their organization.
On the trip back from Washington to Harlem, many men on the chartered Tour Kings bus said their journey had been an eye-opening pilgrimage. One by one, they stood at the front of the bus, clutched the microphone and testified to others about their feelings of renewal.
Many also admitted later that they had silently wondered how long those feelings would last, and of course it is impossible to say what the long-term effects of the march will be. But leaders of a number of civic, fraternal and community organizations say the effect so far is clear.
"I think the march has had impact on segments of the population who want to give something back but who were too busy in their professional lives to take the time," said Dennis Walcott, president of the New York Urban League. "We have been getting a record number of calls from people who have wanted to be volunteers since the march. We believe that it's because of the Million Man March."
There have also been numerous follow-up meetings of men who attended the march throughout the country and in every sector of New York City.
"That march really had an impact on me," said David F. Reeves, a 55-year-old businessman who owns D & J Bookstore in Laurelton, Queens, who has attended follow-up meetings in his area. After returning from the march, Mr. Reeves decided to build a community center in the basement of his store that could be used for job-training programs for unemployed neighborhood men.
"We are building a community center here to house 300 people to develop study groups and job-skills groups," he said. "After the march, I felt a renewed sense of hope. Now, I'm trying to do my part."
Some of the men on the Harlem bus, however, have not joined groups or participated in any new initiatives. Rather, they said, the impact of the march was more deeply personal, affecting their outlook and behavior.
"When I got back, it seemed that I took on a different attitude," said Arthur I. Golden, a 69-year-old resident of St. Albans, Queens, who runs an insurance agency with his wife. Mr. Golden said he had not made up his mind to make the trip to Washington until a few hours before the bus left.
"I've never done anything of that nature in my life," said Mr. Golden, the father of a museum curator and a systems analyst. "My children were proud of me."
But, he added: "Going to that march gave me a different perspective on life. I see a difference in my demeanor."
He said he was so impressed that "there were a million men out there with not a marijuana cigarette or whiskey bottle in sight. It reaffirmed my confidence in the goodness of people. I think I'm a lot calmer. I look at people with more respect."
Anthony D. Montgomery, a sophomore at Hackensack High School in New Jersey, said that he was moved not only by the march, but by the encouragement he got from the men he talked to on the long bus ride. "I got a chance to talk with some people who showed a real interest in me," he said.
"When I thought about all the things these men had accomplished, it made me think seriously about what I wanted to do with my life," he added. "So I decided to become an actor, which is not an easy thing to do. But after the march, I believe that anything is possible if you set a goal and work to achieve it."
Donald Hodo, a 48-year-old accountant who lives in the Bronx, said: "Since the march, I've been affected in a number of ways that are small, but still important. For some reason I now find myself speaking to other black men that pass on the street or at work.
"The march made me feel much more of a sense of unity with others. That may seem small to some, but to me, it's important."

HEADLINE: Russia Warms Up an Old Romance

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
Stung by perceived humiliations in its relationship with Washington, Russia is pushing a more energetic Asian policy, deepening relations with China, its onetime ally and longtime rival.
Russian officials deny that any kind of joint policy is in the making against the United States, as in the 1950's. They say such a policy now would contradict Moscow's foreign-policy aims and Beijing's vow to avoid new alliances. 
 But China's relations with the United States are much worse than Russia's, and Beijing is using its improving ties with Moscow to strengthen its overall international position, a senior official said. "It's already a fact of life," he said.
For two years now, there has been a growing nationalist, anti-Western mood in Moscow. In the first years after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, said Grigory Loginov, head of the Foreign Ministry's First Asia Department, "Russian diplomacy was accused of leaning too much toward the West." He added, "Now there is an objective balancing."
Yevgeny Bazhanov, deputy director of the Foreign Ministry's academy for training diplomats, thinks China's effort to combine market reform with ideological purity and authoritarianism will produce conflicts with its southern neighbors and with the United States.
"It will naturally push Beijing to seek out strategic partners, the most logical of which is Russia," he wrote recently. China also remains a natural market for Russian technology, machinery and arms.
But Russia's push for warmer ties with China, senior Russian officials say, also stems from deep worries about instability after the death of Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader, who is 91. They regard China as an uneasy, prickly neighbor with superpower ambitions.
Russia is an Asian power as much as it is a European one, and if Russian officials are pushed to identify any serious external threat in this confused, post-Soviet period, it is from a China that spins out of control or splits apart.
Faced with predicting whether China will experience a period of stability or chaos after Mr. Deng, a senior Russian Foreign Ministry official said, "It's hard to choose the most probable."
"An unstable China is bad for Russia, of course," the Kremlin official said. But if China lashes out "at some external enemy to try to consolidate the country, we hope it isn't Russia, and we expect it toward the south, in the South China Sea, rather than north."
Unlike the United States, with which China has badly strained relations over issues ranging from trade and Taiwan to human rights and the spread of weapons, Russian and Chinese officials describe their current relationship as good and becoming better.
Beijing thinks Washington wants to stop China from becoming a superpower, the Russians say. Russia takes a more pragmatic position toward Beijing, careful not to interfere in China's internal affairs.
When President Boris N. Yeltsin was hospitalized on Oct. 26, a meeting in Beijing between Mr. Yeltsin and the Chinese President, Jiang Zemin, was postponed, and with it the signing of a treaty setting out the two countries' new relationship.
The meeting was to be the culmination of a series of meetings between senior officials of the two countries that began when Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the last Soviet President, broke the ice in 1989, even as pro-democracy demonstrators occupied Tiananmen Square in Beijing.
Mr. Yeltsin was to have signed, along with Central Asian and Chinese leaders, a major agreement on political relations and nonaggression; to conclude negotiations on mutual troop reductions and pullbacks along the 2,700-mile Chinese-Russian border, and to continue to elaborate detailed confidence-building measures, including better mutual communication, to try to reduce border incidents and tensions.
By September, the two countries agreed to stop aiming nuclear weapons at one another. On Dec. 1, the last border questions were resolved, with Russia ceding about 3,700 acres in the Far East.
A senior diplomat from a Southeast Asian country is more anxious about Russia's temptations. "In the face of NATO expansion, Russia is looking for allies, and that won't be Japan," he said, noting that the Russian Defense Minister, Gen. Pavel Grachev, talks of "allies to the east."
Strong rivalries and suspicions remain between the two countries. But there are also strong economic and domestic reasons for improved relations. As many as 500,000 Chinese live illegally in Russia, despite recent efforts to organize the border with passport and customs controls. Two-way trade, which had reached $8 billion in 1993, dropped to some $5 billion in 1994 as the border market, never very big, became saturated with cheaper Chinese goods. But this year, trade is up again.
China is one of the four biggest markets for Russian arms. The Russians have sold three diesel-powered submarines, 24 SU-27 fighter-bombers and the S-300 antimissile defense system to Beijing.
"There has been no transfer of technology," a senior Russian official said. "We are quite aware that we should be careful, considering all the possibilities for the future."

Long Bond's Yield Falls Below 6%

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The yield on the Treasury's bellwether long bond fell below 6 percent for the first time in 26 months yesterday as Treasury securities gained in thin holiday trading.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 11/32 of a percentage point, to 112 11/32 ; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 5.98 percent, down from 6 percent on Wednesday. Yesterday's yield was the lowest since Oct. 29, 1993, when it was at 5.97 percent. It was quite a feat considering that most dealers and investors elected to stay on the sidelines ahead of the year's end. 
 Traders said the non-Government economic data released yesterday had only a mild impact on the market. Trader sentiment was mainly supported by the dollar, which gained against most European currencies on optimism that the Administration and Congress would agree on a budget plan, and by weaker commodity prices.
Some traders are concerned about what they see as an overbought condition of the market and by the inability of the long bond to move below 6 percent in a much more forceful manner. Because so many participants were not actively trading, few players dared bet against the bullish sentiment by shorting the market.
Short sales involve selling borrowed securities, hoping to buy them back later at lower prices, thereby pocketing the difference. But if prices are rising instead of falling, there is little chance of making a profit.
The budget stalemate in Washington has frustrated market participants in recent days, but with talks scheduled for today, cautious optimism has returned. Analysts said, however, that the market remained vulnerable until a deal was done.
Some of the privately generated reports yesterday included the regional business conditions index of the New York arm of the National Purchasing Management's; the index stood at 52.8 in December, down from 55.4 in November. Also, the Conference Board released its November help-wanted advertising index, which fell to 127, from 131 in October.
Conference Board data pointed to growing concern that the economy might slow enough to spark fresh layoffs. It also reported weakness in the industrial core of the American economy.
The impasse between the Administration and Republican leaders over reducing the country's budget deficit has caused a partial shutdown in Government operations. Yesterday was the 13th day of the partial shutdown, and the closings will delay release of several economic indicators of interest to the market, including jobless data and producer and consumer prices.
The Commerce Department has also said that its data on November construction spending, single-family home sales and factory orders will be delayed.
Joseph Battipaglia, managing director of Sterling Advisers, a New York money management firm, said the lack of Government information had led people to make their own forecasts that the economy was limping along. "So when the Government does get back to releasing economic data on a regular basis," he said, "the bond market will have a better sense of where the economy stands. And perhaps it will not be as bad as feared."
Trading was thin early yesterday and lightened further as investors headed toward the end of a holiday-shortened week into today's early close before another three-day weekend.
"The possibility of good news from a balanced-budget program has certainly been priced in," said Mr. Battipaglia, who added that recent signs of slow growth and low inflation had been good news for bonds prices, coupled with the recurring notion that foreign investors will find United States Government securities more attractive than the debt securities of other countries.
"The new year will hopefully start with the release of new economic data," Mr. Battipaglia said. "And the Fed, I believe, is prepared to cut short-term interest rates further." He predicted that during the first half of next year the yield on the long bond could fall as low as 5.5 percent.
James Hale, a fixed-income analyst with MMS International in San Francisco, said, "The best explanation for the steady rise in Treasury prices today, and for that matter, all week, is that no one wants to be the fool who sells right before a budget accord is consummated, in which case they might miss the easiest 6 to 7 points of their trading career."

HEADLINE: In America;
Firing Their Customers

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
The miserable retail sales figures from the holiday season should be taken as an S O S, a distress signal from American consumers who are loaded with debt and deeply insecure about employment.
The quintessential symbol of corporate profits in the 90's is the pink slip. The number of announced layoffs since 1989 will reach three million by New Year's Eve, according to the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. 
 "Downsizing has become the standard operating procedure for many companies today," said John A. Challenger, the firm's executive vice president. "You can no longer count on a job lasting for a long time."
With consumers maxed out on credit, and with many millions unemployed or underemployed, there is a danger that the nation's collective consumer buying power has been seriously compromised. Simply stated, there are dangerously high numbers of Americans with little or no money to spend.
This is a structural problem, not a cyclical one like a recession. It harbors the potential for an economic disaster.
"What these companies have been doing since the mid-1980's is firing their customers," said Eric Greenberg, director of management studies for the American Management Association. He noted that a consumer-driven expansion cannot be sustained when even high-salaried personnel -- professionals, middle managers and technicians -- are being thrown out of work.
Mr. Greenberg's comments echoed those of Henry Ford, who was hardly a champion of the rights of workers but realized that at the very least they had to earn enough to buy his cars.
Jeremy Rifkin, the author of "The End of Work," sees disturbing, even eerie parallels between today's economic situation and that of the 1920's, another period in which enormous numbers of workers were let go because of productivity gains that resulted from improvements in technology. To make up for that loss of buying power, those who remained employed in the so-called Roaring 20's were urged to spend far beyond their means by plunging into the wonderful new world of easy credit.
In the 20's, as now, said Mr. Rifkin, corporate leaders remained blind to the need to share productivity gains with working people. Instead, profits were pocketed and disaster loomed.
Mr. Rifkin, who heads the Foundation on Economic Trends, said business leaders were becoming increasingly concerned about the implications of their wage and employment policies but felt handicapped by the bottom-line needs of their individual corporations.
"They can see, at the macro level, the loss of purchasing power," he said. "But nevertheless, at the micro level, they are rewarded for reducing labor, for putting in the technology and the automatic processes, for improving the bottom line."
Thus the downsizing goes on, with no serious companion strategy (in the corporate world or in government) for creating the kinds of new employment opportunities necessary to maintain the levels of affluence to which so many Americans have become accustomed.
It's not that tough times are ahead; they are already here. The wages, salaries and benefits of American workers rose just 2.7 percent in the year that ended Sept. 30. It was the smallest increase on record and below the rate of inflation. The amount of family income going to creditors is approaching record levels. Credit-card delinquencies are up. Personal bankruptcies are up. And all of this is occurring as the economy, technically, is expanding. What will happen when, inevitably, a recession rolls in?
The bleak Christmas holiday season for retailers was part of a much bigger, much bleaker reality for the retail industry as a whole. At least eight major retailers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection this year. That is a huge number, and more are expected in 1996.
The economic warnings are coming from many directions, loud, insistent and increasingly dire.
We can heed them now by encouraging business, government and civic leaders to get their act together, to roll up their sleeves and engage these problems seriously, in a spirit of mutual cooperation and responsibility for the common good.
We can do that, which would be extremely tough.
Or we can wait.

What New Yorkers Wore When (The Wealthier Ones, Anyway)

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH 

 BODY:
It is always rewarding when one of New York City's lower-profile museums pulls out all the stops, startling the public with a renewed sense of its hidden treasures. Such is the start provided by the Museum of the City of New York with its fashion-as-history exhibition, "Uncommon Threads: 300 Years of New York Style." Call it an extravaganza on a shoestring.
This crowded, unpredictable, almost mind-bogglingly rich show presents the tip of the iceberg, if not the creme de la creme of the museum's extensive costume collection. It ranges through garments of all description: sumptuous evening dresses, handsome costumes for opera and theater, and everyday clothing from pre-Revolutionary to post-hippie times. (Thus, for example, among the exhibition's opening cluster of mannequins, a Quaker dress from the 1840's nearly rubs shoulders with a pair of bell-bottom pants topped by a T-shirt printed with tattoo designs.) 
 Among the show's countless accessories are all manner of hat and shoe, as well as fans, purses, canes and jewelry. And its sundry bits and pieces of memorabilia include nearly 50 portraits, most of them of the ersatz, but nonetheless telling, society variety. These portraits allow for some wonderful juxtapositions of object and image. A feathered, bejeweled casque once owned by Anita Loos is gazed upon by Charles Baskerville's 1934 portrait of the writer. An evening dress in white net with cambric roses that Ethel Barrymore wore in the 1901 production of "Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines" is displayed near a Sargentesque portrait of the actress in the selfsame garment by Sigismond De Ivanowski.
All told, this exhibition gives a scattered yet often remarkable accounting of nearly three centuries' fashion trends in one of the world's great cities while also touching on New York's cultural, political and economic history, at least as far as the rich and famous are concerned. The exhibition's progress is somewhat jumbled, and reading the many labels is highly recommended. They provide a modicum of order as well as the show's subtext, for they state not only who designed each garment, but also who wore it (and when and where) and who donated it to the museum.
Although highly diverse, the displays are nonetheless consistent in their luxuriousness; hence the exhibition's title. After all, the survival rate of common threads -- say, those of newsboys, scullery maids and Bowery bums -- is a lot lower than that of expensive, special-occasion items. Thus, among the highlights of "Uncommon Threads" are the lavishly embroidered velvet jacket and knee pants worn by John Gerard Coster to George Washington's inaugural ball in 1789, as well as the costumes, based on 18th-century French court styles, in which Mr. and Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt 2d welcomed guests to the first ball at their freshly completed Fifth Avenue mansion nearly 100 years later. Among such highlights, the show-stopper is surely a white satin fancy dress costume worn by Miss Kate Brice to a ball at the Waldorf in 1897. Broad of bustle, profuse of sleeve and banded in galon d'argent, it is a remarkably accurate replica of the dresses worn by the Spanish Infanta Margarita when she was painted by Velazquez.
In purely stylistic terms, the show traces the shift from the narrow lines of the Neo-Classical empire dresses of the early 1800's to the increasingly small-waisted, large-skirted affairs of the century's second half, circling back to the slimmer, straighter, freer shapes of Paul Poiret and his successors, including a wool jersey dress by Claire McCardell and a suit possibly by Chanel. Repeatedly, one can measure the rage among successive generations for gowns by Worth of Paris, Paquin and Poiret, not to mention the expenditures. Sometimes the evidence is loosely assembled, but the point is made, as when, for example, a metallic-lace evening blouse from Hermes that once belonged to Mrs. Harrison Williams is displayed against a many-itemed bill in her name, from Balenciaga. (A 1928 portrait of Mrs. Williams, one of the best-dressed women of her time, hangs nearby.)
This show is freighted with information and trivia that maybe only a New Yorker could love: for starters, a tweed sport jacket that Edward I. Koch so treasured that he had it relined not once but twice; the threadbare white gabardine suit worn by Ezio Pinza in the original production of "South Pacific," and the olive drab wool uniform of James Jarrett Jr., better known as Buster, the longtime doorman at Henri Bendel during the store's 57th Street prime.
But for the most part, the garments justify themselves visually as well as historically, as with the splendid banyan robe in brocaded silk taffeta of John Cruger Jr., the Mayor of New York from 1757 to 1766, and the frothy white lace gown worn by Helen Hayes in "Victoria Regina."
Perhaps the most unexpected confluence of art, craft, culture and politics is to be found in an extraordinary waistcoat once owned by the theater critic Alexander Woollcott. Skillfully embroidered by Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt Jr. in 1939 according to designs by her son Quentin, it is dotted with bloody severed heads and corpses. Whether these motifs represent the victims of Woollcott's pen is for historians of the theater to decide. In the meantime, this horrific garment is one of the most startlingly beautiful things in a largely startling and beautiful show.

 "Uncommon Threads: 300 Years of New York Style" is at the Museum of the City of New York, 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103d Street, through Feb. 11.

Gifts to Museums
Retailers aren't the only ones for whom a successful Christmas depends on the economy. Museums, too, are in this category, since year-end gifts are more than simply a matter of beneficence. Tax laws and fluctuations in the stock market are among the factors that can seriously affect how much (and whether) patrons give.
The picture changes seasonally. "I don't think there's a tax reason people are giving, but there is certainly a profit reason," said Ashton Hawkins, executive vice president and counsel to the trustees at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. "People have made a lot of money this year, and they want to offset their gains." 
 Museums aren't reporting the last-minute rush of gifts they did in 1991, when a so-called tax "window" allowed donors of major gifts to nonprofit organizations to deduct the property's current market value, rather than its original purchase price, as a charitable contribution. Since that window has stayed open under President Clinton's 1993 tax bill, all gifts of appreciated property can be fully deducted at fair market value any time of the year.
"Now what people choose to give to museums has to do with the vagaries of life," Mr. Hawkins said. This season, besides donations of art or objects, people are also making cash gifts (instead of stock) because they anticipate a change in the law to lower tax rates on capital gains.
Museums like the Metropolitan have received both art and cash. Mr. Hawkins said it received a total of $35 million worth of gifts from 133 donors this year. George Repaire, a San Francisco-based gun dealer, and his wife, Butonne, gave the museum a Colt revolver engraved and inlaid with gold and decorated with patriotic imagery. It is believed to have been presented by the inventor Samuel Colt to the Sultan of Turkey in 1854.
Walter H. Annenberg, a longtime trustee and one of the museum's most biggest donors, has given the Metropolitan a half-interest in van Gogh's "Women Picking Olives" (1889-90). This isn't the first time Mr. Annenberg has donated half a painting. The arrangement enables him to keep it in his home in Rancho Mirage, Calif., half the year and at the museum the other half.
Paul and Bunny Mellon, also well-known museum benefactors, gave 3 paintings, 18 drawings and 2 sculptures to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond. Vuillard's "Young Woman Trying on a Hat" (circa 1900) is perhaps the most coveted work in the group. The gift also included works by van Gogh, Corot, Delacroix, Gauguin, Matisse and Picasso. In Toronto, the Art Gallery of Ontario received 16 Old Master paintings from Joey and Toby Tanenbaum, museum board members. It is the museum's largest gift of Old Master paintings. Among the works are examples of French, Italian, Spanish, Flemish and Dutch pictures dating from the 15th to the early 18th century by artists including Giordano, Ribera and Verhaecht. While the museum would not disclose the value of the paintings, experts say they are worth about $3 million.
Under Canadian tax law, a gift must be appraised by the Canadian Cultural Property Export Review Board to certify its value, and the board then determines the donor's tax credit. (The credit is calculated as 29 percent of fair market value and can apply to as much as 100 percent of a family's net income. Any benefit from increased value of the art is exempt from capital gains.)
Cash and securities, not art, made the Art Institute of Chicago happy this season. Larry Ter Molen, vice president for development and public affairs, said that while there was no increase in the amount of artwork the museum received, it was given significantly more stocks. "People are paying off commitments from our capital campaign drive," he said, "and year-end is a popular time to do it."

 
 
Castle Howard
 More art and objects from Castle Howard keep finding their way to auction. The Palladian-style home in Yorkshire, England, known to television viewers as the place where "Brideshead Revisited" was filmed, has a wealth of Old Master paintings, English and French furniture, and decorative objects. Until recently it also had an exceptional collection of Ballets Russes costumes, but they have just been sold at Sotheby's in London. Simon Howard, who inherited the castle from his father, Lord Howard of Henderskelfe, in 1984, needs cash to maintain the stately home and to insure that it stays open to the public.
In 1991, Sotheby's sold the contents of the castle's attic and storerooms in a three-day sale that brought $3.5 million. This month, Sotheby's in London sold Gentileschi's "Finding of Moses" (circa 1633) to a dealer for $7.7 million. Mr. Howard also sold Guercino's "Rinaldo and Armida" privately to the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif., reportedly for $7 million.
The costumes, collected by Mr. Howard's father and sold as property of his estate, were bought primarily by museums. The sale totaled $445,166 and included designs by Matisse, Braque and Picasso. "Any one of these pieces can stand alone as a work of art," said Carol Krute, the curator of costumes and textiles at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, one of the biggest buyers. It spent $66,125 on 27 costumes.

 The end of the year is traditionally a time of change, and this month these three well-known art-world personalities resigned:
*Phillip M. Johnston is leaving as director of the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, where he has been for 13 years. Mr. Johnston said he was not sure what his next move would be.
*Renato Danese resigned from C&M Arts, the Upper East Side gallery where he had been a partner for a year and a half. He is starting his own contemporary-art gallery with Sasha Newman, former Seymour Knox Curator of European and Contemporary Art at the Yale University Art Gallery. Mr. Danese said his gallery would represent living contemporary artists.
*Bill Arning, who has been director of White Columns for 11 years, is leaving that alternative space in the West Village. He will be replaced by Paul Ha, who has been its associate director. "I've made about 11,000 studio visits," Mr. Arning said. "I definitely think it's time to do something else, probably more outside curating."

HEADLINE: Federal Shutdown Hits Hard In Area Around Yellowstone

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: WEST YELLOWSTONE, Mont., Dec. 28

 BODY:
A high mountain sun burned brightly, a fresh snowpack crunched underfoot, and, outside the office of Yellowstone Adventures, a row of new snowmobiles beckoned with the latest conveniences -- from foot warmers to heated handlebars.
"This time last year, all 130 snowmobiles were out every day," fretted Ken Takata, manager of the rental agency. "This week, we are averaging 40 to 50." 
 The Federal Government's partial shutdown, which has closed Yellowstone National Park, is choking this village of its livelihood at the holiday peak of its winter tourism season. Business leaders calculate that since the Dec. 18 closing of Yellowstone, whose 2.2 million acres make it by far the largest of the 39 national parks in the 48 contiguous states, this community of 990 people, just outside the park's western entrance, has been losing $1 million a day.
To any American inclined to see the deadlock over the Federal budget as only a paper problem in faraway Washington, Yellowstone's closing should serve as "the poster child of the shutdown," as one national parks official put it the other day.
"Our hotels are running at 50 percent occupancy, when normally they are at 100 percent at this time of year," said Leif M. Johnson, president of the West Yellowstone Chamber of Commerce.
Inside the park, the two hotels that are usually open in the winter have lost $800,000 so far. With no end to the Federal shutdown in sight, the concessions company that owns the hotels has stopped paying salaries there, providing nothing more than room and board to the hotels' 300 employees, who are now the only lodgers.
"This has been devastating to us -- we were completely sold out," said Jim McCaleb, executive director of the hotels' owner, TW Recreational Services Inc. "We are losing better than a third of our total winter season."
Summer has always been the peak season for Yellowstone. Still, this town, the center for snowmobile tours of the park, helped to build winter tourism there to 140,000 visitors last year, a 40 percent increase over the 1990 level. Until the shutdown, Yellowstone was headed toward record annual attendance, having attracted 3.12 million visitors through Nov. 30. Montana as a whole has come to rely on tourism as its second-largest industry, after agriculture.
But now, of a park staff of 400, only 70 employees designated essential are working. And of Yellowstone's network of 370 miles of roads, only 70 miles are open. These are two stretches that connect towns bordering the park. Visitors who travel these roads may stop to take a picture or two, but nothing more.
The effect on this region has been unkind to business and labor alike. Here in West Yellowstone, as in towns at the park's four other entrances, layoffs have spread fast as sales have plummeted.
On Thursday, tempers boiled in subfreezing temperatures as about 150 people on foot, on snowmobiles and in snowcoaches -- vans that move on tracks -- converged on a thin green line of park rangers guarding the park's western entrance here.
"Public lands belong to the people, not the political parties," proclaimed one protest banner. Another, referring to President Clinton's vacation at Yellowstone in August, asked, "Is vacationing in the park just for the Clintons?"
Inside a red snowcoach, David A. Ritchey, a manager of the Yellowstone Alpen Guides Company, complained: "Usually we have taken 300 to 400 people into the park by now. So far we have taken in zero. This week alone, we refunded $21,000."
Ted Kuhlenschmidt, a tourist from Indiana who had gone ahead with plans for his family's vacation here, largely because he had been unable to get a refund on airline tickets bought in October, stamped his feet in the cold and said he had hoped that someone in government would "do something."
West Yellowstone's Mayor, Glen Loomis, echoed Mr. Kuhlenschmidt. "They need to resolve the problem between the Republicans and Democrats," Mr. Loomis said, "and not on the backs of a few."
Some protesters jeered the rangers, noting that all Federal employees had been promised that any pay lost to the shutdown would be restored once the budget impasse was broken, but that business people and their employees would have no way of making up their own holiday-season losses.
Still, financial frustration was evident among the rangers as well, whose next paychecks, like those of many other Federal workers, will be only half as large as usual and who will not be paid at all after that until there is an end to the stalemate in Washington. "I just applied today for unemployment compensation," said one ranger, Ann Marie Chytra.
Keeping out of sight to avoid inflaming the protesters' passions, Dan R. Sholly, the chief ranger, sat in the back office of a gatehouse and explained to a reporter why he could not use Yellowstone's own income to reopen the park.
During the winter holiday season, some 2,000 people a day pay $4 each to enter the park. About $15,000 more is earned daily from a 25 percent tax on receipts of the two hotels.
But Yellowstone is not legally empowered to run on its own income. It sends its earnings to Washington, then depends on Congress to send money back. Because the annual appropriations bill for the national parks' parent, the Interior Department, has not been enacted, Yellowstone is financially marooned.
"It would be illegal for us to be operating," Mr. Sholly said.
Of activity permitted along the two stretches of road that remain open, he said: "We are trying to be reasonable. People can stop and take a picture. But they can't stop and have a picnic or take out their cross-country skis."
Many people in Montana and in Wyoming, the state where most of the park lies, had hoped that their Governors would follow the lead of a couple of other Western states, which are using state money to keep Federal parks there open.
In Arizona, Gov. Fife Symington has used a special state parks appropriation to pay $17,625 a day in ranger salaries to the Interior Department to keep the Grand Canyon partly open. Arizona has also assumed all insurance liability for accidents at that park. But state money is now running out, and Governor Symington is appealing for private donations.
New Mexico is using a similar state-private alliance to keep open parts of its largest Federal tourist attraction, Carlsbad Caverns National Park. The state has been able to obtain private insurance.
In contrast, the Montana-Wyoming negotiations with the Federal Government over Yellowstone broke down last week, in part because of the steep payments demanded by the Interior Department: almost $50,000 a day, a sum largely reflecting the necessity to maintain roads for snowmobilers along Yellowstone's vast stretches.
Another sticking point in the talks was the problem of dealing with accident liability.
"Every year we get 60 to 100 tort claims, from a few hundred dollars to $10 million," said Mr. Sholly, the chief ranger at Yellowstone. "Right now we are in the middle of a $3.5 million claim" for an injury that a moose inflicted on a tourist.
The Federal Government refused to accept the two states' proposal for a system in which visitors would have signed liability waivers before entering the park. A search for private insurance led nowhere.
Montana's Republican Governor, Marc Racicot, complained in a telephone interview that Washington's demands had become "a moving target."
"We just kept running into one obstacle after another," Mr. Racicot said.
As the frustration mounts, tourists continue to arrive at the park's entrance here, assuming that America's oldest national park is not truly closed.
"I wanted to see the geyser, Old Faithful," said Benyamen Nico Supit, an Indonesian postgraduate student visiting from California, expressively waving his parka-padded arms in the air. Noting that he and his family would move back to Jakarta next summer, he concluded glumly, "This is my first chance to see Yellowstone, and maybe my last chance."

HEADLINE: A Drought In Spanish Olive Oil;
Old-Style Producer Tilts at Modernity

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH 

DATELINE: JAEN, Spain

 BODY:
Shoppers looking for extra-virgin olive oil may not think they have much in common with Juan Antonio Armentero Ruiz.
Mr. Armentero, 75, wears a dirty black beret and has a shiny pink face and a mouth with only a few teeth, one of which is gold. And he is convinced that the United States is exploding nuclear bombs under the nearby Andalusian hills here in southern Spain. 
 But whatever his politics, his problems may soon converge with those of the upscale consumers who have spurred a worldwide boom in olive-oil consumption.
On the first harvest day in the hills around Jaen, 185 miles south of Madrid and the biggest olive-producing region in the world, four men on Mr. Armentero's crew thrash the branches with sticks, sending olives falling into plastic nets below. Two women, on their knees, pick up what misses the nets.
But the crew is small. The trees "look like they've already been picked," Mr. Armentero said. "Fact is, they just don't have any olives. We're living through a disaster."
Though farmers in Spain, as elsewhere, are known to overstate their troubles, and Mr. Armentero certainly enjoys hyperbole, that is not much of an exaggeration. Spain -- normally the world's largest olive-oil producer -- is in its fifth year of drought, and the 1995 olive harvest is about a third of normal, with many farmers in this region saying that their harvest will be more like 10 percent.
The shortage catches the Spanish olive business in the cleft between the inefficiencies of peasant European agriculture and a struggle to modernize. Farmers in recent years have invested in more modern equipment, hoping to make their share of the olive-oil boom commensurate with the high quality of Spanish produce. But their efforts are foundering on that most basic of reasons, the cruelty of the elements.
And since agriculture accounts for a hefty part of Spain's economy, the growers' woes help leave the country with one foot in modern Europe and the other firmly in the past.
For the world's consumers -- who spend more than $5 billion a year for olive oil, because of its flavor and a variety of health claims -- the Spanish drought assures higher prices.
Industry officials say that global production will fall 25 percent short of demand this year. Italy and Greece, the No. 2 and No. 3 producers after Spain, are enjoying plentiful harvests. But Tunisia, No. 4, has also been parched by drought and has lost half its crop.
Importers in the United States say that prices, already up 40 percent this year, could rise a further 30 percent or more early in 1996. "It's the worst Spanish crop I have ever seen," said Richard Sullivan, president of the North American Olive Oil Association in Matawan, N.J.
Though American customers will pay higher prices -- some, no doubt, griping about laying out $5 for a half-liter of oil -- the consequences are more biting for the Spanish growers. The drought spells deeper poverty in a region that is already among this country's poorest.
"The money I get from my olives is what I usually use to make sure I eat well during the winter," said Jose Carlos Oro Perez, 76, as he walked his white donkey down a country road. He estimated that his crop would be about 8 percent of normal. "So I guess it will be hard this year."
To be sure, donkeys are not the common form of transportation for olive farmers. That happens to be dusty, rusting Land Rovers that are 15 to 20 years old, towing small, crude trailers. But the image of a donkey is not far off for an industry whose technology has changed little.
For thousands of years, olives have been harvested by beating the branches with poles. Only recently has new equipment been introduced -- hydraulic tractor arms that grip a limb and shake the tree violently to make the fruit drop. And few farmers can afford such machinery.
Modern irrigation hardly exists. Farmers hook narrow plastic tubes to buckets of water, stick the other, sharpened end into the bark of an olive limb, and hope that this drop-by-drop transfusion will help.
Over the last few years, cooperatives have invested millions of dollars in new plants that press the olives. They have begun marketing efforts to increase the visibility of Spanish oil in worldwide markets. But with the drought, it is one step forward and another back. Now they find themselves deep in debt -- a drag, for the present, on the broad Spanish economy.
And that, too, has some qualities of anachronism. "Spain clearly combines aspects of a developed society and aspects of a relatively undeveloped society," said Jose Luis Alzola, a Salomon Brothers economist in London.
But while the country's problems seldom reverberate beyond the Iberian peninsula, its olive troubles are certain to.
Since the early 1980's, olive consumption in the United States has risen fourfold, to almost 130,000 tons in 1994 from 30,000 tons in 1983. Many consumers found olive oil more flavorful than corn oil -- this while the popularity of Italian, Greek and other Mediterranean cuisines heavy in olive oil has grown greatly.
The oil also got a lift from concern about fat and cholesterol, since its fat is a type often associated with a lower risk of heart disease.
But its price has always made it economically vulnerable. In Spain, the cost of producing olive oil is five times that of sunflower oil. On the grocery shelf, it is often three times the price of vegetable oil.
A year ago, Mr. Sullivan of the olive-oil trade group said, extra-virgin oil was selling for as little as $2.99 a half-liter. Today, it is $4.59. This has put a dent in consumption, he says, even before any 1996 price increases. In the last six months, grocery purchases have fallen 14 percent, and in the last 12 weeks, they are down 22 percent from the comparable period a year before.
The biggest worry for farmers here is that prices will rise so high that consumers will permanently switch to cheaper vegetable or seed oils. In part, the olive farmers are cushioned by big subsidies from the European Union, but if there is scant demand for their oil and their trees wither, there is little other work in this region for them.
Scanning the fields around Jaen, one can look to the horizon and see nothing but row after row of olive trees carpeting the countryside.
"It's hard to find anyone in the area who does not have olives," said Jose Carlos Marzal Fernandez, head of the Foundation for the Development and Promotion of the Olive and Olive Oil. The foundation estimates that olives account for almost half this area's economic activity, or about $1 billion.
In a normal year, Spain produces about 600,000 tons of oil, but output is likely to be no more than 200,000 tons this year. Some say that even those figures are exaggerated to qualify for greater European subsidies.
Moreover, for the first time in memory, the effects are being seen on trees. Few have shriveled up entirely, since olive trees are able to withstand even the cruelest of climates. But five years of drought are taking their toll, with many losing their deep green color and taking on a burnt yellow-green look.
Perhaps most striking is to see almost no one in the fields at the peak of harvest, with thousands of trees bearing no olives at all. Processing plants in small towns, where lines of tractors normally wait to unload olives, are almost deserted.
Hope for a change is hard to find. Rain began to fall in the middle of November, making some predict better days ahead. But farmers are doubtful, warning that even with good rain, the trees cannot quickly recover from so long a drought.
Farmers who are members of one local cooperative have a hard time believing in the name of their processing plant -- the Cooperativa de Aceites Nueva Esperanza, part of which means "new hope."
"We've had a third of the rain in the last three months that we had in the year before, so don't tell me things are going to improve," said Juan Contreras Martinez, the cooperative's manager. "Don't believe what they tell you that the worst is over."

GRAPHIC: Photos: In both lean and plentiful harvests, the Spanish olive is prized, and in normal years, Spaniards produce more olive oil than their rivals in Italy and Greece.

HEADLINE: 7 Are Charged With Conspiracy in Illegal Gun Trade

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
A gun-running ring that acquired hundreds of pistols from a dealer in Alabama and brought them to New York City for sale to street criminals has been smashed with the indictment of seven men, including two convicted felons from Brooklyn, on firearms conspiracy charges, Federal officials said yesterday.
During a 16-month period in 1992 and 1993, the officials said, the conspirators, who included sellers, secret buyers and middlemen, acquired 366 handguns in Birmingham for as little as $100 apiece, and conveyed them to New York, where they were illegally resold for as much as $500 each. 
 Many of the weapons were later seized in the arrest of criminals, and the authorities said that the huge arsenal of automatics and revolvers may have been used in thousands of muggings, drug shootings and other violent crimes. The ring was broken, they said, by tracing recovered weapons back to Alabama.
"This was a black market in firearms," James M. Cavanaugh, the special agent in charge of the Birmingham office of the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said. "The object was to sell guns on the streets of New York, where the value was higher because of stricter state gun laws."
The two-year investigation came to light yesterday with an announcement by Caryl P. Privett, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama, that a grand jury had indicted seven men on charges of conspiracy, illegal possession of firearms and making false statements on firearms records. The charges carry penalties of up to five years in prison and fines of $250,000.
The defendants were listed as Gerard C. Greco 3d, 52, of Cottondale, Ala., the former owner of Traders Two, a now-defunct Birmingham gun shop; Christopher Dollar, a former employee; Mathew Hunt, 28, and Charles Wills, 27, both of Brooklyn, and three Birmingham-area men, James E. Martin, 35, Victor L. Peake, 26, and Frank B. Lewis, 24.
John Magaw, director of the firearms bureau, a division of the Treasury Department, said that by tracing the serial numbers of guns seized in crimes in New York City to their manufacturers and original sellers, agents discovered a pattern that led to Traders Two in 1993.
After months of surveillance by A.T.F. agents, the authorities obtained a Federal search warrant, raided Traders Two and obtained records of transactions that they said led to the other suspects and exposed a black market in firearms.
A statement from the United States Attorney's office read: "The indictment alleges that between August 1992 and December 1993, approximately 366 firearms were illegally sold at Traders Two by means of 'straw purchase' transactions, whereby one defendant signed required firearms records for another defendant who was ineligible to purchase the firearms directly."
While handguns are difficult to obtain legally in New York, a resident of Alabama with a driver's license and other ordinary identification may purchase them easily at licensed local gun shops, which are required to keep accurate records of all transactions.
The authorities said Mr. Greco and Mr. Dollar sold guns to Mr. Martin, Mr. Peake and Mr. Lewis, but were aware that the actual buyers were Mr. Hunt and Mr. Wills, who lived in Brooklyn and were ineligible purchasers because both were convicted felons.
Mr. Cavanaugh said Mr. Hunt and Mr. Wills were currently being held in jail in Birmingham on unrelated charges. Mr. Wills is charged with attempted murder, and Mr. Hunt is awaiting extradition to New Jersey on an unspecified felony charge. Mr. Martin was arrested in New York yesterday; the other defendants have agreed to surrender shortly in Birmingham, Mr. Cavanaugh said.
"This was a very important investigation," Mr. Cavanaugh said. "We think these guns contributed to a great deal of violent crime."

HEADLINE: Telecom Bill: Another Day, Another Rift

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 29

 BODY:
Supporters of a sweeping telecommunications bill scrambled today to smooth over yet another apparent rift among Republican lawmakers, this one over a provision that the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, attacked as a multibillion-dollar "giveaway" to broadcasters.
Senator Dole's comment was just a brief reference in a news conference Thursday on the broader budget battle in Washington. But it threatened to reopen a policy battle of Bosnian complexity, which at least one Republican senator feared could scuttle the entire communications bill. 
 At issue is a provision, sought particularly by House Republicans, that would essentially reserve a valuable part of the crowded radio spectrum for television stations to roll out new digital services like high-definition television.
Television broadcasters, powerful lobbyists and big political campaign contributors, argue that the frequencies are crucial to the very future of free over-the-air television.
But a growing number of Republicans and White House officials believe the broadcasters are getting a deal that is too sweet. Government officials estimate the licenses would be worth anywhere from $11 billion to $70 billion, if the Government auctioned them in the way it is doing for licenses to operate new wireless phone services.
Senator Dole singled out this provision as a "giveaway" on Thursday, describing it as one of "three or four or five provisions" in the bill that Republican leaders should re-examine.
That prompted a plea from Senator Larry Pressler, Republican of South Dakota and chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, to steer away.
"If we get into a controversy over the spectrum again, the bill is going to die," said Mr. Pressler in a telephone interview from Florida. "I would like to see auctions," he added. "But I think we can settle that issue in a separate bill."
Top lawmakers on a House-Senate conference committee reached agreement on the overall bill last week, only to have many House Republicans complain that G.O.P. negotiators had given away too much to Senate Democrats. Lawmakers are now circulating the 281-page bill among all members of the conference committee. Mr. Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich said they might review the bill next week, but it is unclear if the bill will reach the House or Senate floors before February.
The dispute over spectrum for digital television strikes at the economic heart of broadcasting, from small-town stations to the big networks, and it presents problems for Republicans and Democrats alike, especially at a time of intense budget negotiations.
The agreement reached between House and Senate negotiators determined that if the Federal Communications Commission assigned licenses for advanced television services, it should limit eligibility to existing television station owners. But separately, an omnibus budget bill, which remains embroiled in a fight with the White House, contains a provision that would require the F.C.C. to carry out a study on auctioning licenses before giving them away.
Television broadcasters have fought tenaciously for these frequencies and say they are essential if over-the-air television is to enter the digital era. Because it is impossible to transmit conventional television signals on the same frequencies as digital signals, broadcasters argue that every station needs a "transition" channel so it can serve people with both old sets and new ones.
At some ill-defined point, broadcasting executives say they would give back their existing channels and carry out all their programming over digital channels.
The Clinton Administration has come up with its own proposal, which it continued to press in budget negotiations this week. Under that plan, broadcasters would get the new frequencies but the Government would auction off their old channels after only seven years and force television stations to actually give them up by the year 2005.
But that idea could prove enormously disruptive for tens of millions of viewers, who would either have to buy new digital sets or converters to use the older ones.
To remedy that problem, White House officials have proposed using part of the money from selling off the old television licenses to pay for "vouchers" that people could use to buy converter boxes.
One White House official said today that only 20 percent of homes would actually need a converter by the year 2005, because many people will be getting digital television signals from cable television and direct-broadcast satellite services.
White House officials say the converters would cost about $100, and the vouchers would cover $50 of that cost.
But House Republican staff people involved in these negotiations say the White House plan would amount to catastrophic meddling, and that the Government should not define a particular time for television stations to give back their licenses.
"That's a billion-dollar entitlement program," one senior staff member said. "Our view is to let the market decide when and if that should happen. What could be a worse example of Government getting in there and making decisions without having any information?"

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Tumultuous Year By Rising Against Japanese Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar finished a tumultuous year yesterday by rising against the Japanese yen but weakening against most other major currencies in a pre-holiday session of light volume and technically oriented trading.
On the final trading day of 1995, market participants focused mostly on wrapping up transactions and putting their portfolios in order before heading home early for the three-day New Year's weekend. By midafternoon, most of the day's activity was complete. 
 "The only good action today over all is in the yen," Roger Volz, director of technical analysis at Pegasus Econometric Group, said yesterday.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 103.40 Japanese yen, up from 102.67 yen late Thursday and up nearly 23 percent from an all-time low of just under 80 yen reached April 19.
That left the dollar up about 4 percent against the yen from a year ago, when it finished 1994 at an exchange rate of 99.58 yen.
Against other currencies, particularly the German mark, the dollar moved lower. Concerns about the possibility of a further reduction in American interest rates weighed on the currency.
The dollar was changing hands in New York at 1.4366 German marks, down from 1.4380 marks late Thursday. That left the dollar 7 percent weaker than its exchange rate of 1.5495 marks at year-end 1994.
The British pound was quoted at $1.5510, up from $1.5460 Thursday and down less than 1 percent from $1.5647 at the end of 1994.
The dollar's roller-coaster behavior against the yen this year has been capped by a relative period of stability for the last five weeks. Mr. Volz said much of the final advance yesterday came from technical trading strategies involving other currencies. The dollar moved steadily higher against the yen throughout the session.
"There was not honestly a lot of volume in the marketplace today, so a lot of things were being exaggerated," Hillel Waxman, chief foreign exchange dealer at the Bank Leumi Trust Company, said yesterday.
He warned against reading too much into the dollar's progress yesterday, except as it highlights the dollar's improvement against the yen since its record low in the spring.

HEADLINE: Treasury Prices Rise Despite Economic Report

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Going into the final session of the year, prices of Treasury securities rallied hard in thin volume, as market perceptions of a weak economy and optimism over budget talks overshadowed a surprisingly strong report on the economy from a non-Government source.
Some profit taking emerged after the Chicago Purchasing Managers index came in at a stronger-than-expected 57.6 for December, up from 49.9 in November, but optimism on the budget talks, which resume today, still overshadowed the report. Early-morning talks between lower-level aides were expected to lead to a meeting between President Clinton, Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole. 
 The Public Security Association had recommended an early close for the bond market, and yesterday's abbreviated session ended at 2 P.M., with the 30-year bond up 18/32 to a price of 11229/32 to yield 5.94 percent -- the lowest since Oct. 28, 1993, when it was 5.95 percent.
Gary Thayer, senior economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis, said that the thin trading volume of the last few days had caused unusual volatility in prices. "Today the market started strong, but a stronger-than-expected Chicago P.M.I. report caused some profit taking," he said.
But the market came back, partly because of year-end buying, known as window dressing, by some portfolio managers who want to show they have been in the market. "Even though the Chicago P.M.I. wasn't necessarily good news for the market this morning," Mr. Thayer said, "it was good news about the economy."
Eugene J. Sherman, director of research for M. A. Shapiro & Company, also noted that trading was thin, but in the range of normal year-end volume.
He said he was not particularly impressed with the private-sector data that the market had come to rely on in the absence of Government reports that have been delayed or postponed by the partial shutdown.
"The private-sector data is not sufficiently sweeping or accurate for economic analysis," he said. "And yet the market has responded to these figures in the absence of Government data." He said that the weekly retail figures from Johnson Redbook and Mitsubishi-Schroder Wertheim have consistently underperformed the Government retail sales, and retail sales figures have underperformed personal consumption, representing two-thirds of the economy.
"I won't give great credence to today's large increase in the Chicago P.M.I.," Mr. Sherman said. "Those figures represent a scattering of some trend. And from month to month you don't know how wide the scatter is." He predicted the number for gross domestic product in the fourth quarter would be one that suggests a potential for sustainable growth.
Donald H. Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, agreed that in the absence of any Government data on the economy, market participants are forming their own conclusions from anecdotal evidence and "regurgitating views passed around informally." But he said he thought the market had it right.
These conclusions, he said, include a softening economy, benign inflation, more cuts in interest rates, low rates overseas making United States Government securities more attractive to foreign investors, and a balanced- budget deal that is market friendly.

HEADLINE: Feed the Hungry in North Korea

 BODY:
Grave food shortages worsened by floods have put millions of North Koreans at risk of severe malnutrition. That could lead to violent political unrest, disruption of a hard-won agreement to contain North Korea's nuclear program and a tide of refugees streaming into South Korea and China.
What the Kim regime has done already is startling. Abandoning the cult of self-reliance that has defined Communist North Korea since its creation, the regime asked the world for emergency food assistance. The United Nations estimates that three million tons of grain are needed. 
 The response so far has been disappointing. Denmark and Finland contributed a total of $200,000 through the U.N.'s World Food Program. Japan, which once ruled Korea as a colony, has begun its own program of food-aid shipments.
But three other countries with a big stake in avoiding a violent upheaval in North Korea -- South Korea, China and the United States -- have held back. Seoul and Beijing are using food as a weapon to extort diplomatic concessions. The Clinton Administration, which on the nuclear issue has wisely pursued a policy of coaxing North Korea out of its isolation, has offered only $25,000 in official food aid plus $200,000 channeled through private relief organizations and Unicef. It hesitates to go further, given Congressional hostility to North Korea.
Opponents of feeding hungry North Koreans should remember that America has an admirable, bipartisan tradition of ignoring ideological issues in the face of starvation. A decade ago the Reagan Administration sent substantial food aid to famine-stricken Ethiopia, even though it was ruled by a repellent Marxist dictator. Sixty years earlier, Herbert Hoover led a vast American relief effort to combat starvation in Lenin's Russia.
 North Korea's regime, which specializes in sneering rhetoric and the seizure of foreign nationals, is easy to dislike. But it is not the regime's coddled cadres who are going hungry. Ordinary Koreans pay the price for faulty economic policies, diplomatic provocations and, now, natural disasters. Humanitarianism as well as national interests call for a more generous American response to the plight of North Korea's hungry millions.

HEADLINE: A Medicaid Compromise

 BODY:
The White House and Republican leaders say they are making progress toward reopening Government offices. But they must overcome scores of other disagreements if they are to complete the often promised seven-year deficit reduction package. Many of the disputes will be resolved by splitting differences over money. But in a few instances, most notably Medicaid, the two sides are battling over principles. These ideological fissures cannot be entirely closed. But with enough good will and flexibility, they can be bridged.
Under current Medicaid rules, Washington pays at least half the cost of providing health insurance to the poor. In return states must agree to provide an enumerated set of benefits, like coverage of hospital and nursing-home bills, to specific groups of poor individuals, including children, pregnant women, the elderly and the disabled. 
 Republicans oppose the current Medicaid programs because along with the Federal money come numbingly detailed and costly rules. The Republicans want to change the programs so that Washington would provide fixed annual amounts, called block grants, but states would set the rules. The White House, to its credit, rejects the Republican plan.
Eliminating Federal mandates is a bad idea because they protect the poor. States would be tempted to reduce their benefits in order to cut taxes on households and businesses that might otherwise flee to neighboring states. Block grants are also bad policy because they would provide no additional Federal relief when recession hits and state welfare rolls soar.
Medicaid cannot be both state-controlled and federally controlled. Yet there might be ways to find compromise. President Clinton has already pointed to one possibility by proposing to control costs by capping Federal outlays per recipient. That way, Washington would not underwrite wasteful state programs but Federal assistance would increase during recessions when needs rise. The Republicans are cold to Mr. Clinton's plan, in part because they fear it would continue excessively intrusive Federal rules.
To address that objection, Mr. Clinton could agree to waive layers of costly rules. He has already proposed wiping out Federal rules that tell states how much they must pay hospitals. He could go further and eliminate rules that tell states how much they must pay rural health centers and other Medicaid providers. States also object to rules that force them to beg Washington's permission before they change local Medicaid programs. Mr. Clinton could address this problem by agreeing to let states do pretty much as they please -- as long as periodic reviews by Washington show that they have truly provided the federally mandated benefits to the federally designated categories of poor families.
President Clinton cannot simultaneously satisfy his need to preserve Federal poverty programs and the G.O.P.'s compulsion to end them. But rather than risk a budgetary showdown and the loss of any Federal presence, he could propose paring Washington's presence to its essence. Neither side wins everything. But the states gain control, and the poor remain at least minimally protected. That appears to be the best Mr. Clinton can do.

HEADLINE: U.S. Workers Resent Status as Political Pawns

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As an employee of the Social Security Administration, I am one of the political pawns caught in the midst of the battle over the balanced budget. A partial Government shutdown is political blackmail being used by both parties. 
 Without some compromise in the near future, the impact on Federal employees could be devastating. (Never mind the backlogs of work that is not getting done by those out on furlough.)
We Social Security employees are in a unique position in that we are working -- but under circumstances that are very stressful. Anyone with a previously approved leave for the holidays had that leave canceled. Mothers with children may be forced to take them to work. Anyone who is sick or is out because of a family emergency is in furlough status, and may not get paid.
I asked what would happen if there were a death in the family. The response: Sorry, you're in furlough status. A co-worker was in a quandary over whether to report to jury duty or to the job. If he didn't report to jury duty he was subject to a $500 fine.
Even our pay is affected. We were told our next paycheck will be for only one week's worth of work, through Dec. 15. I did work the week before Christmas, but there's no budget to pay me.
If this continues, what happens next pay period? Will Congress take money out of its own pockets and pay my bills? Highly unlikely. Moreover, we cannot collect unemployment compensation, as we have been ordered back to work.
The furloughed workers are not on any paid vacation, as some might think. There is no guarantee they will be paid, and unemployment compensation is not sufficient recompense for the anguish and worry on how to meet financial obligations.
I hope Congress enjoys its holiday vacation -- paid, of course. The Federal work force is not as lucky.

HEADLINE: THE CONTENDERS: Fifth article of a series;
For Dornan, Keyes and Taylor, Low Polls Can't Dash High Hopes

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

 BODY:
Every American Presidential campaign draws a handful of candidates whose odds of reaching the White House are too absurdly long to calculate.
But whatever impels these politically impractical hopefuls to dream the impossible dream, they often turn out to be the light ingredient that saves Presidential contests from turning into endlessly bland heavy cake. 
 So it is in the 1996 campaign with the three Republicans who seem to face the longest odds: Representative Robert K. Dornan of California, former Ambassador Alan Keyes of Maryland and Morry Taylor, a Michigan industrialist.
From the start, most polls have had each man dragging along the statistical bottom, with the support of just 1 percent or 2 percent of the voters. Day after day, they struggle not only for votes but also for name recognition, with the best parts of their campaign messages often co-opted by the stronger candidates, leaving them mostly insignificant participants in the larger debate.
Yet, for reasons sufficient unto each, and thanks to participation in open-to-all, nationally televised debates and to the sustaining lift from matching Federal campaign money (and great personal wealth in one case), each man presses on, insisting earnestly, but without discernable supporting evidence, that his is a campaign destined to succeed.
That may be blind faith in one's self. But, given the soporific drone emanating so often from the other, shorter-odds candidates, it is also a refreshing relief, especially since each of the three long-odds contenders brings a special campaign style and political touch to the race.
No other candidate in the contest can match the sharp-tongued, super-heated, hard-right patriotism of Mr. Dornan, political incorrectness incarnate.
No other candidate makes more of the abortion issue than Mr. Keyes, an outspoken opponent of abortion, and certainly none does it with more vigor, whether pro or con.
And when it comes to financing a campaign with a personal fortune, other candidates or would-be candidates may have more money, but none is a happy spender like Mr. Taylor, who proposes to set the United States right by running it like a big business for four years, then retiring to some sunny isle.
In alphabetical order, then, here is a look at the campaigns and blind political faith of the three longest-odds candidates of 1996, beginning with Mr. Dornan, black-belt master of the verbal rabbit punch and world-class conservative from California's Republican heartland, Orange County.
 
For 'B-1 Bob,' It's Bombs Away
Mr. Dornan has almost no campaign money, no campaign organization, no campaign advertisements and no campaign schedule. In fact, his most recent campaign financial report shows debts totaling close to $180,000, while his current roster of campaign directors and workers lists mainly family members. His latest schedule shows him seldom venturing beyond the Beltway.
Worst of all, the other candidates treat him as though he does not exist, which, politically, the polls come close to confirming.
Still, when it comes to waving Old Glory, praising the American fighting man and defending motherhood, truth, justice and the American way -- his campaign themes -- Mr. Dornan has a knack for grabbing a headline and serving notice, just before he slips entirely off the political scope, that he exists, is still running and is still out there somewhere.
In Mr. Dornan's bombastic, in-your-face view of the 1996 Presidential contest, President Clinton is not just "a flawed human being" but is also "the most corrupt man to ever sit in the Oval Office," a "draft-dodging adulterer not fit to lace the boots" of the military men and women he commands.
The nation is "culturally poisoning" itself, the Congressman asserts. But if voters put him in the Oval Office, he promises, the national moral decay will end, along with "holocaust" abortions, "pro-active" homosexuality and personal "irresponsibility."
"We are destroying this God-blessed nation," he says, "and I'm going to carry that message: Faith. Family. Freedom."
Mr. Dornan, who represents the Garden Grove section of Orange County, the 46th Congressional District of California, is 62 and has been in Congress for nine invective-strewn terms. He has been welcomed by other conservatives for his vote but is otherwise mostly a marginal player on Capitol Hill, too hot a partisan for most colleagues to touch.
One of his most remembered achievements: getting himself banned from the House floor for a day last January for overstepping the bounds of verbal good taste. In a debate, he asserted that Mr. Clinton had not only dodged the draft in the Vietnam War but in so doing had also given "aid and comfort to the enemy."
"I say what I believe," Mr. Dornan offered to explain his nothing-held-back assertion. "People who say I'm out of control mistake passion for temper."
But he has a temper, too.
A few years ago, while arguing about the draft and military matters with a Long Island Democrat, then-Representative Thomas J. Downey, he suddenly grabbed Mr. Downey by his necktie, gave it a yank and called him "a draft-dodging wimp."
Why?
"Because he is a draft-dodging wimp," the unapologetic Mr. Dornan replied.
Before he was a Congressman, Mr. Dornan was a news broadcaster and talk show host. Before that, he was an Air Force fighter pilot after the Korean War armistice, which may explain his high-octane passion for the military and, some say, his obsession for talking about combat, though he himself was a peacetime pilot.
Indeed, in the House he has been such an outspoken proponent of American military might, including the development of the B-1 bomber, that colleagues refer to him as "B-1 Bob."
Although the Dornan Presidential campaign seems to be going nowhere, at least in conventional terms, the Congressman insists that he will campaign through the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. At that point, he predicts, he will begin to move up in the polls.
If he does not, he says, he will reassess his campaign and, if he concludes that he cannot win, will run again for Congress. He may not be much when it comes to raising money for a Presidential campaign, but he has been a formidable money-raiser in his previous Congressional contests.
One way or another, Mr. Dornan vows, he will stay in the political pit, delivering his verbal blitzes to the liberals and "pointy-heads" he blames for causing a "moral meltdown" in the United States -- a meltdown he says he could stop cold, if only the American people would give him the chance.
 
For Alan Keyes, It's the Message
The country's moral meltdown, particularly the decline of the family and the rise of the "abortion culture," is also a campaign theme for former Ambassador Alan Keyes, believed to be the first black Republican to seek the Presidency and a man every bit as verbally nimble as Mr. Dornan -- but without the vitriol.
Mr. Keyes, who was Ambassador to the United Nations Economic and Social Council and later a State Department official in the Reagan Administration, is, like Mr. Dornan, a former talk show host. And, also like Mr. Dornan, he is running a shoestring campaign, in and out of red ink, staffed almost entirely by unpaid volunteers and without the benefit of expensive television and radio advertisements.
But there the similarity with the Dornan campaign ends because, unlike Mr. Dornan, Mr. Keyes, who is 45, spends most of his time on the campaign trail, returning to his home, Darnestown, Md., only one day a week. And, unlike Mr. Dornan, he draws enthusiastic, if modest, audiences, mainly packed with opponents of abortion.
In a thunderous voice, inflected with churchly cadences and moral certitude, Mr. Keyes, a Roman Catholic, not only denounces abortion but also contends that its practice "epitomizes the corruption that is eating away at the moral heart and spirit of American life."
From there he goes on to render a classic hard-right conservative condemnation of affirmative action, state-run welfare and other liberal orthodoxy -- but with a Keyes twist, honed in years of broadcasting, lecturing and writing.
In his view, big government, among other things, has been more damaging to the black family than slavery itself, overriding individual merit and trapping many blacks in what Mr. Keyes describes as "a quagmire of perpetual supplication."
Whatever can be said for or against this Keyes message, which the leading Republican candidates generally ignore -- much as they ignore the Dornan message -- there is no real dispute that Mr. Keyes, when it comes to stump performance, is the going-away winner of the 1996 candidate oratory contest. His audiences spend much of the time on their feet, cheering him on, particularly when he swings into one of his arm-pumping, full-volume attacks on abortion.
Still, most polls show little or no movement in his campaign. And though he expects to collect about $500,000 in Federal matching funds in January, there is hardly any likelihood that the money, once $250,000 in campaign debts are paid, will give him the lift he needs to come out of Iowa and New Hampshire with saving political momentum.
Not to worry, Mr. Keyes insists, arguing that his is a "message" campaign and that his message is helping to define the 1996 Presidential debate. Even if his prospects for winning are dim, he says, he nevertheless intends to stay the course to the end to guarantee his influence. And because he travels light, he contends, he will have enough campaign dollars to do that.
His critics have another take on his campaign. They maintain that it is more mercenary than political, designed essentially to increase his name recognition with the general public so he can resume his talk show by the end of the election year, lecturing and writing with the possibility of bigger earnings. That is exactly what he did in 1992, they say, after the second of two unsuccessful runs in Maryland for a seat in the United States Senate. The first run was in 1988.
True or not, in the 1992 contest Mr. Keyes did, in fact, use campaign money to pay himself a monthly salary of $8,500 -- technically legal, but politically questionable. His explanation: He needed the money because he was "not a wealthy man"; thus, the issue was "practical" rather than "moral." But Mr. Keyes insists that the issue this time is totally moral for him -- the salvation of America -- with practicality and personal finances given no consideration.
"I can't promise you that Alan Keyes will be the next President of the United States," he says. "But I can promise that we're going to raise the standard high in this country, and we're going to make it so clear and so unequivocal that we will be like a lightning flash across the landscape of American depravity. And we will show the way back home."
 
For Morry Taylor, It's Perot Redux
The Morry Taylor campaign bears not the slightest resemblance to the Dornan and Keyes campaigns, except in one respect: It is not making any significant political headway, either.
Mr. Taylor, a multimillionaire rim and wheel manufacturer from Grosse Point Farms, Mich., is making a Ross Perot-style run for the White House -- financing the campaign with $15 million from his personal fortune of $40 million or so, disparaging professional politicians and the inside-the-Beltway culture and promising, if elected, to run the Federal Government the same tough way he runs his company, Titan Wheel International.
All that is missing is the Texas twang.
"If you voted for Ross Perot, you'll love Morry Taylor," he says. "I despise politics. I'm a businessman."
If elected, he says as he tours the country in a fleet of $75,000 Airstream Land Yachts, he will balance the Federal budget within 18 months, starting with the wholesale dismissal of one-third of the bureaucrats. The names of the unlucky ones will be picked at random by computer.
"Sure, there'll be some chaos for a few months," Mr. Taylor concedes. "But things'll settle down. It's real simple."
After that, he promises, he will go after the lobbyists, Congressional pensions, political action committees and as many other special interests as he can find.
He also promises, if elected, to dismantle the Internal Revenue Service and levy a flat 17 percent tax on incomes above $35,000.
The State Department?
"Dynamite it."
The Voice of America?
"Put it on top of a mountain, or something."
Law and order?
"Bring back the whip."
If that seems a blunt, gruff approach to government, it is, nevertheless, vintage Morry Taylor.
A 51-year-old self-made millionaire who started out as a welder in a tool and die shop and ended up as the nation's biggest manufacturer of industrial wheels and rims, Mr. Taylor is known for running no-frills shops, with his eye always on the bottom line.
Employees who fail to meet his standards are quickly shown the door -- too quickly, some say. He counters that he wants only respect and a good profit margin, not love.
On the shop floor, the workers call him "the Grizz," as in grizzly bear. In fact, his workers were the first to urge him to run for President, telling him, tongues not entirely in cheek, that with his no-nonsense way of getting things done he would probably get himself elected and, if so, could maybe bring some managerial sense to Washington.
Thus far, Mr. Taylor has spent more than $5 million on his campaign, much of it on a staff of 40 professionals and on a series of professionally prepared television advertisements running in Iowa and New Hampshire. But unlike Steve Forbes, the multimillionaire publisher who is also running and financing his own campaign -- and making some progress in the polls -- Mr. Taylor has very little to show in the way of returns on his investment, to use his kind of businessman's analogy.
He is still on the bottom in the polls, with Mr. Dornan and Mr. Keyes, trying to crack 3 percent. Perhaps worse, for a man who claims to hate politics but nevertheless has a politician-size ego, the candidates leading the pack are paying him no mind.
In January, Mr. Taylor plans to put on a new advertising blitz in Iowa and New Hampshire to break him loose from the bottom of the pack. If that fails, he plans to reassess his candidacy, and perhaps quit.
"If I don't win," he tells those who already see him as doomed, "then I'm $15 million poorer and I head for warmer climes and enjoy the rest of my money. I don't see this as a second career."

In Their Own Words
 
Dornan
"We have a polluted public marketplace. We have a debased culture in Hollywood that ridicules and assaults religion, tears valor and hope and virtue out of our country. We have a cultural meltdown." -- Announcement speech, Washington, April 13, 1995
"Freedom. It's not just freedom for this country. We have an obligation to extend liberty and freedom where we can, where we are able, even at some loss of life to our young men and women. We must extend democracy, freedom and virtue wherever we can around the world." -- Announcement speech, Washington, April 13.1
 "I would make my White House closer to Andy Jackson, without the bravado and the booze, to John F. Kennedy, without squandering precious hours chasing women." -- Interview, June 27, 1995.
 
Keyes
"Today civil rights groups defend affirmative action by arguing that it cures past discrimination. They do not see that no one can cure a past injustice with another injustice, and that it patronizes American blacks because it presumes that blacks cannot succeed on their own. When there is such an acute moral crisis in this country, defending affirmative action is a waste of time and energy." -- News conference, Chicago, April 12, 1995.
"Gun-ban advocates substitute things for people. But it doesn't wash. It is the human moral will that saves us from violence, not the presence or absence of weapons. Do you know how you control violence? You root it out of the human heart. End the violence in the abortion clinics. Purify the heart, and you won't have to worry about the weapons." -- Statement, Oct. 23, 1995
 
Taylor
"Our government is the largest business in the world. We can't count on politicians to mind our business. ... If you want change in Washington, send someone who is not a member of the club." -- Interview, Aug. 10, 1995.
"The professional politicians talk about balancing the budget in 7 years or 10 years. I'd do it in 18 months. Government and business are the same when it comes to managing people." -- Interview, Oct. 11, 1995.
"We have bad management every place. In business you fail. But you can't let the government fail." -- Interview, Dec. 17.

HEADLINE: DEMOCRATS REJECT A PLAN TO RETURN FEDERAL WORKERS

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 29

 BODY:
When high-level negotiations on a balanced budget resumed today with President Clinton at the table, Republican leaders offered a plan that would put all 260,000 furloughed Federal employees back to work immediately without pay. But the plan fell apart as quickly as others have in the past month as Senate Democrats instantly slammed the door on it.
Arriving at the White House this afternoon, Speaker Newt Gingrich said he was considering supporting legislation proposed in the Senate last week that would declare all furloughed Federal employees "essential" and require them to return to their jobs. The Senate bill would not reopen the Government officially. But it does include a formal, legal guarantee of the back pay that Congress and the White House have promised the workers will receive after a deal is reached. 
 The Republicans had wanted the legislation only if it could be passed unanimously on a voice vote. But Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic minority leader, balked at the plan today because the legislation had a provision that would limit the Democrats' ability to amend the budget during the eventual floor debate.
The two sides met for nearly four hours in the Cabinet Room of the White House and finished about 7:30 this evening, with none of the participants commenting. Aides said the talks would resume at 10:30 A.M. on Saturday at the White House.
"They spent time working through a set of issues," Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary, said without elaborating.
After the meeting, Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, went to Capitol Hill to continue talks with the Republican budget committee chairmen, Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico and Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio. Mr. Dole also returned to the Hill and convened a brief session of the Senate. While he attempted to introduce the Republican plan to bring back the workers, the Democrats, as they had threatened, refused to give him the unanimous consent.
Despite the new attempt to resolve the budget dispute, lawyers for the largest independent Federal employees union, the National Treasury Employees Union, went into Federal Court in Washington today to seek an injunction that would prohibit the Government from requiring employees to work without pay.
"We filed this motion for a temporary restraining order in response to the complete disregard of the political branches for their responsibilities," said Robert M. Tobias, the union president. "It is outrageous that hundreds of thousands of Federal workers are being ordered to work without any guarantee that they will ever be paid."
Gregory O'Duden, the lawyer for the union, said the union had 150,000 members nationwide, including employees of the Internal Revenue Service, the Social Security Administration, the Customs Service and the Department of Health and Human Services.
"The ultimate intent is to get the President and the Congress to end the budget impasse," he said. "Maybe without the workers on the job, it will force them to reach a deal quicker."
Part of the Republicans' strategy in the budget fight with President Clinton has been to use the furloughed workers as leverage against the White House. But polls continue to indicate that a majority of the public blames the Republicans for the impasse.
Mr. Clinton said: "I think the people ought to be back to work, and I think they ought to be paid. And I think if we don't do it, we're going to see some very serious consequences that neither the public, nor the public employee, should have to endure."
But Mr. Gingrich said: "All the Federal employees ought to be back at work. We know they want to be, and it's not fair to them. And we also feel strongly we ought to try to find some way to get everyone paid."
The two-week shutdown of parts of the Federal Government is the longest in history, and it has caused widespread public anger and frustration. The Republicans' effort to put all the Federal workers back on the job was intended to dampen much of that public anger.
By offering legal guarantees of back pay, the legislators hoped to relieve some of the financial pressure on the workers from creditors. And with a return of a full work force, the Government could resume some of the services whose absence has incensed the public -- perhaps reopening parks, museums and national monuments. Under such an arrangement, the Government could also start issuing passports again, but if the current supply of the documents was used up, officials would not be able to buy more until a budget was in place.
Today's meeting was the third attempt in five weeks by Mr. Clinton, Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Dole to sit down together to try to settle political differences over balancing the Federal budget by 2002. The sticking points have been over Medicare, Medicaid, tax cuts and education.
The current round of talks began on Wednesday with meetings on Capitol Hill involving low-level staff aides. Officials said those meetings went well and today's negotiations at the White House opened on an equally positive note.
"I believe we're proceeding in good faith and I think we're making progress," Mr. Clinton told reporters before starting the private talks with the Republicans. "I'm prepared to spend whatever time it takes to move as quickly as we can move. But some of these issues are quite complicated in terms of their impact on the American people."
The political leaders expect to meet again on Saturday. And although they did not set a deadline, Mr. Gingrich said he hoped to have a deal by at least next Wednesday morning, the end of the first session of the 104th Congress.
"I agree with the President," Mr. Gingrich said. "I think there are reasons to be cautiously optimistic. I wouldn't exaggerate them, but I think we've made some progress over the last few days."
Despite the optimistic talk from both sides, there were other signs that neither side expected a quick resolution. The Administration and Congressional leaders each took steps to try to ease the financial burden on 760,000 Federal workers who received only partial pay today because of the Government shutdown.
Canteens at the 172 Veterans Administration hospitals began stocking grocery items and were allowing employees to pay for them with personal checks dated Jan. 17. Officials said the canteens generated their own income and were not operated with Federal money.
On Capitol Hill, Representative Jim Leach, who is the chairman of the House Banking Committee and a Republican of Iowa, and Representative Rick A. Lazio, who is the chairman of the Housing Subcommittee and a Republican from Suffolk County, appealed to the two Government-sponsored mortgage financing agencies, the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, to be lenient with furloughed Federal workers who are unable to pay their mortgages.
"Although I sincerely hope this budget impasse can be resolved quickly, I appreciate any assistance you can provide to make sure Federal employees are protected from unintended consequences of this budget impasse," each Congressman said in letters to the chairmen of the two mortgage agencies.
The Labor Department said today that 28 states had depleted Federal money for unemployment benefits for workers who lost their jobs because of imports, and that five more states would run out of money by the end of next week. Officials said most states would be able to cover the payments using their own money, but at least 17, including New York, New Jersey, California, Michigan and Illinois, will not.
A Labor Department spokesman, Carl A. Fillichio, said that there were 8,000 displaced workers in those 17 states who receive the Federal unemployment assistance, which is known as Trade Readjustment Assistance Benefits.
Because of the shutdown, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin withheld an interest payment of $14.5 billion to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund that was due today.
Mr. Rubin had advised Mr. Gingrich on Thursday that he could not legally make the interest payment without breaking the debt ceiling.
"There would be no need for this action, or any other action by me to avoid default, had Congress itself taken timely steps to pass a clean debt limit increase," Mr. Rubin wrote. "The need for an increase in the debt limit is unrelated to the debate over the budget."
The Interior Department announced today that it had reached an agreement with the City of Philadelphia to reopen Independence Hall, the site of the signing of the Declaration of Independence and one of the nation's most famous and popular landmarks.
It was closed two weeks ago at the start of the budget impasse. But under the agreement, Independence Hall and the nearby Liberty Bell pavilion will reopen on Saturday with the city paying the full costs of operating the landmarks, but with National Park Service employees still in charge.
 Since the shutdown, private benefactors or state or local governments have stepped in to reopen parts of the Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona, Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico, the National Air and Space Museum in Washington and an exhibition of paintings by the Dutch master Vermeer at the National Gallery of Art in Washington.

Goodbye To All That

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
Maybe it's because I first took in the sizzling lights of the block on the eve of puberty. Maybe it's because the boozy televised pageantry of a Times Square New Year's Eve countdown was drilled into my brain from birth. Like everyone else in the country, if not the world, I have never thought of 42d Street -- naughty, bawdy 42d Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue, that is -- without thinking of sex. Until now.
Forget about the new high-tech, strobe-lit glitterball that will welcome 1996 in tomorrow's replay of the annual ritual. The real news from Times Square is in the shadows just beyond the camera's view, where the new, redeveloped 42d Street is no longer a fantasy but a done deal. And it will be a 42d Street unlike any that most of us have known -- a de-sexed, partially Disneyfied 42d Street designed to reverse our most ingrained cultural idea of what constitutes the neon heart of the American Century's signature metropolis. 
 It was eerie to walk the mostly shuttered Deuce (as it will no longer be called) this week. At the western end of the block the last few peep-show parlors still offer their wares ("Live! Girls!") for an alleged quarter. At the eastern end the first of the new 42d Street renovations -- the New Victory Theater, an extraordinarily beautiful restoration of the playhouse Oscar Hammerstein built at the turn of the century -- is open for business. The New Victory is a sophisticated theater for young people -- the new 42d Street incarnate. Across the street, Disney's restoration of that glorious Ziegfeld palace, the New Amsterdam, into a home for musical spectaculars is just stirring. Soon to follow are a Disney store, a Madame Tussaud's urban theme park, a 25-screen multiplex, another grand musical theater and a glitzy hotel.
It's impossible to overstate what an achievement the new 42d Street is. Though those with short memories assume the street skidded into sleaze in the 60's -- "Midnight Cowboy" was released in 1968 -- its downfall in fact began in the 1930's, as the Depression and talkies decimated the Broadway theater.
By 1933 -- the same year the Warner Brothers movie musical "42d Street" apotheosized the block as a theatrical showplace -- most of the 42d Street houses had already forsaken plays and musicals for burlesque and second-run movies. Likening the street to Coney Island, one English visitor, Cecil Beaton, wrote in 1938 of arcade attractions like "Nude Kisses" and "After the Bath," as well as of "furtive sellers of booklets and sealed packages bearing suggestive titles." While Mayor La Guardia shut down the striptease shows during the war, the decline continued. Planners have been cooking up 42d Street redevelopment schemes at least as far back as 1962.
The one that is finally falling into place might not have become reality without Disney, whose embrace of the New Amsterdam has helped create a gold-rush atmosphere in the entire Times Square neighborhood. The coming boon to the city's economy is incalculable. But for all that, it's still possible for a die-hard urbanite to feel a twinge of loss and apprehension.
I won't miss the grungy sex establishments, and I look forward to watching the other haunted old 42d Street theaters return to life. But I also worry that the family-safe block will lack the heterogeneity that was the byproduct of its seedy old saloons, its greasy non-chain restaurants, its antiquated pinball parlors, its cheesy emporiums and flophouses. The mix of Broadway glamour and grime, of the G- and X-rated, is what made 42d Street the crossroads of the world, for all kinds of people of every class. That hurly-burly is itself erotic; it's what turns us on as we watch those crowds in Times Square each New Year's.
To their eternal credit, the planners of the new 42d Street are doing everything possible to insure a flashy, idiosyncratic carny urban scape and a demographic mix of entertainment fare. They don't want another 57th Street, where theme restaurants are rapidly transforming a colorful city thoroughfare into a sanitized stage set for tourists on leave from the mall.
We won't know for years whether 42d Street will escape that fate. But as this New Year's arrives, it's sobering to realize that the future of this one ghostly block, hanging as much in the air as the Times Square ball, will shape the 21st century's idea of New York as surely as its raucous past has defined our own.

HEADLINE: Nation's Costly Defense Strategy Doesn't Make Military Sense

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Rethink the Army National Guard" (editorial, Dec. 27) raised valid questions that have been deferred too long. As egregious as the waste of national treasure may be in the Guard, it is a side issue compared with the need for a thorough public debate about the 1993 national defense strategy. 
 The guiding principle of defense budgeting is that strategy drives planning and tactics, while planning and tactics drive acquisition (of manpower and equipment).
With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, plus the continuing demise of the Russian military, the 1948 Soviet containment strategy became obsolete. In 1993 the Pentagon did a "bottom-up review" of the foreseeable military threat against the United States. The resultant strategy calls for us to be prepared to fight two major regional wars, simultaneously and without allies.
That strategy requires about $260 billion in 1996, but does it make sense? Other than invading a weak Mexico in 1845, we have never since 1775 gone into a regional war without allies, let alone two such wars simultaneously.
Throughout a wrenching Congressional debate in 1995, defense (and its underlying strategy) has been off the table for review and possible cuts. All proposed reductions are non-defense.
If the 1993 strategy is unjustified on military grounds, but bought by Congress as a militarized "civilian jobs program," this is short-term thinking.
Defense cities may benefit, but tax expenditures wasted through civilians producing military goods that end up stored in bunkers are a loss to the civilian capital base and our future economic strength, the real source of military power.
Right-sizing the Guard without reassessing the 1993 strategy is akin to rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.

HEADLINE: The Lives They Lived: JAMES RESTON; Scooped, Again 

BYLINE: By Max Frankel. 
Max Frankel, former Executive Editor of The Times, writes the Magazine's Word & Image column.

 BODY:
HERE'S HOW JAMES RESTON could exploit a young reporter's dream of becoming James Reston. I rushed into his Washington bureau one night with the scoop that Bobby Kennedy was flying to Indonesia. "Hmm. Let's think about that," Scotty said -- always said. "Why would the President waste his brother's time on a tinhorn like Sukarno while he's toe to toe with Khrushchev in Berlin?" "Yeah," I finally allowed. "Indonesia could be a feint to cover a secret stopover in Moscow." Scotty picked up the phone, and to my amazement, the Attorney General took the call. "Can't give him time to deny it," Scotty whispered. "Good evening, General. What on earth do you think you can accomplish in Moscow?" Kennedy's shocked silence confirmed our guess; we now knew his mission no matter what else was said. My back-page paragraph was suddenly front-page news -- which caused the Moscow side trip to be canceled. 
 Fast of foot and always thinking, Scotty Reston was the best reporter of his time because he knew what he didn't know and he knew how to make smart people tell him. What's more, he fortified their best ideas with crisp and witty prose. He forced the editors of The Times to value his facts, even if he failed to name his sources, and to welcome his prose, even if it broke every rule in the stylebook. 
 Scotty was convinced that great men -- but not yet women -- made history. When he spotted one, he picked his brain relentlessly. And when he ran out of great men, he persuaded merely large men that they faced momentous challenges and could best secure their place in history by first talking with him. 
 When the men around Harry Truman decided that only huge sums of American money could rebuild Western Europe and rescue it from Communism, it was to Scotty that they confided their $18 billion plan, hoping to drum up public interest and Congressional support. The news appeared in The Times on a Sunday morning, and by 10 o'clock Senator Vandenberg of Michigan, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, called Reston at home and said: "You must be out of your senses. No Administration would dare to come to the Senate with a proposal like that." 
 Of course it was Truman's sanity that Vandenberg was questioning. But it was through Reston -- and his influential readers -- that Presidents and Senators often negotiated in those days. Indeed, Vandenberg, a windbag of modest intellect, had attained the great influence with which he ultimately secured passage of the Marshall Plan through a prior Reston encounter. 
 One day soon after the end of World War II, the Senator proudly let a few reporters review a speech proposing to denounce Stalin for shackling the nations of Eastern Europe. Scotty said it was a fine speech as far as it went but showed no understanding of Soviet fears of invasion. Wouldn't it be better to offer Stalin an alliance against any future German threat? The speech, given with the Reston ploy added, evoked a sensational response and overnight established an ever grateful Vandenberg as the leading internationalist in a still-isolationist Republican party. Thus did Scotty Reston harvest his scoops, stalking the disaffected to slip him political secrets, like the Yalta papers and American plans for the United Nations. The scoops made him, and The Times, compulsory reading by all the best people in all the best places. 
 But the biggest story of all, Reston always insisted, was change itself. He kept reminding readers of America's emergence as a superpower, the collapse of empires, the wild growth of populations and the revolutions in weaponry, transportation, communication and journalism. First in his own columns, but also in the work of the hundreds of colleagues he inspired, Scotty championed the reporting of ideas and the thoughtful explanation of the news. 
 "We are no longer in the transmitting business," he would say, "but in the education business. . . . Things don't have to 'happen' to be news. They can just be going on quietly, like the unemployment in Pittsburgh or the boom in Houston." 
 As one of Scotty's privileged acolytes, I tried as editor of The Times to press on in the same enlightened direction, insisting that the "hard" news of crimes and plane crashes was rarely more important than the "soft" news of what's been happening in families, between the sexes, among the races and nations. Not till the day Scotty died, when I reread his columns and his memoir, "Deadline," did I discover the source of all my best slogans and ideas. Scooped again, by the master.

HEADLINE: The Lives They Lived: Martin Bucksbaum and Max H. Karl;
Settling the Surburban Frontier

BYLINE: By Paul Goldberger; Paul Goldberger is the chief cultural correspondent for The Times.

 BODY:
ARCHITECTS LIKE TO think they control the future of the landscape. Martin Bucksbaum and Max Karl knew better. Each had an impact on the American landscape that was more transforming, in its way, than that of nearly any architect or city planner practicing today. Focusing on the aspirations of the middle class, Bucksbaum and Karl helped to shape the world of suburbia -- changing the nature of the American town and proving that the physical form communities take does not just happen but is brought into being by conscious decisions.
It's not quite right to say that Martin Bucksbaum invented suburban sprawl, either in his native Iowa or anywhere else. But when Martin and his brothers, Matthew and Maurice, decided in the early 1950's that, instead of putting their family's fourth supermarket in someone else's building, they would become landlords themselves, it marked a turning point in the growth and development of the Middle West. The Bucksbaums' first shopping center, the Town and Country, opened in Cedar Rapids in 1956, and they went on from there to become one of the largest builders of shopping malls in the United States. They shed their family's grocery business before the Cedar Rapids center even opened, decisively staking their future on erecting what Matthew Bucksbaum would later call "the new downtowns." 
 The Bucksbaums built dozens of shopping centers all around the Middle West, believing that, as Matthew Bucksbaum recalled, "people did not want to go downtown and fight traffic and parking ramps." About the alternative he and his brother provided -- the open "strip center" with its parking lot and entrance on the two-lane -- he commented: "We sometimes had some misgivings -- you felt sorry for the downtown merchants and the downtown landlords. But they had had their way for many years, and many of them didn't reinvest in their properties. They just didn't keep up with the times."
Martin Bucksbaum proceeded with no kind of all-encompassing vision of the city. What he had was a sense of pragmatic good will: he saw himself as providing an innovative service, which was convenient shopping for an increasingly automobile-oriented society. The times were making the old-fashioned pedestrian city obsolete, and he had no more desire to stand in the way of this kind of progress than he would have wanted his family's grocery business to stay small. To him, change was a given: it was not his role to question it, to ponder whether it was good or bad for society, but only to ask how he could build a successful business within this new world.
By all accounts, he was a thoughtful man and a fair-minded one; he was definitely modest, operating out of a small, messy office in Des Moines. He had neither the bearing nor the accouterments of a real-estate pasha: he had the sensibility of the middle-class consumers for whom he built.
Not a single Bucksbaum shopping center could be called an event of architectural distinction. Bucksbaum talked to his architects about things like square footage and the optimum distance between parking and store entrances. These are not the sorts of ingredients from which esthetic statements are made.
In the 1960's, when the trend moved toward large, enclosed shopping malls, the Bucksbaums didn't miss a beat. They gave up building strip centers and picked up on the new style as easily as they had moved on from the grocery store. Thus was the American postwar landscape created: not as part of a grand, utopian plan, but bit by bit, town by town, as Martin Bucksbaum moved across the plains, a Pied Piper of ease and convenience.
AX KARL HAD MORE of a vision. He knew that this country was full of people who wanted to buy houses in the suburbs and couldn't quite afford them, largely because banks, wary of too much risk, generally refused to lend more than 75 to 80 percent of the cost of a house. Buyers who couldn't come up with 20 or 25 percent down payments -- and there were plenty of them in the 1950's, as postwar prosperity spread its promise and expectations soared faster than the economy could deliver -- were frozen out of the market. Subsidized loans from the Federal Housing Administration helped some, but many were ineligible for the F.H.A.'s favorable rates and, even with steady jobs and modest incomes, couldn't make the threshold for conventional borrowing. Then, in 1957, Karl, a real-estate attorney in Milwaukee, had what Forbes magazine described as "one of those elegantly simple ideas that make businessmen rich" -- to create an insurance company that would insure 20 to 25 percent of private mortgages, thus reducing the risk banks would have to take and making them willing to lend home buyers more money.
The rest, as they say in the mortgage business, is history. Karl's Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation burst upon America like a revelation: suddenly the suburban dream truly was open to all, not just to veterans or people with large savings accounts. It is not for nothing that M.G.I.C., as the company was known, was soon given the nickname "magic," for it appeared to have worked some kind of financial wizardry, expanding the universe of home buyers by leaps and bounds, bringing the purchase of a house within reach of people who had as little as 5 percent to offer as a down payment.
It was not Karl's irritation with the inherent conservatism of 1950's bankers that was original but the way in which he figured out how to do an end run around them. Like Martin Bucksbaum, Karl took reality as it came; instead of denouncing the bankers, he devised a system that let them have their aversion to risk but still justified lending money to the new, growing middle class. The impact was tremendous and led eventually to such things as mortage-backed securities -- the packages of mortgages sold to investors, which have made the private-home mortgage in effect a commodity, not a simple contract between a borrower and a local bank.
Of course, the most profound impact of Karl's invention was not in the financial vehicles it created but in the landscape itself. As home buying became accessible to more people, more and more suburban tract developments were built, taking away more and more fields and farms and meadows. A nation that had once consisted primarily of cities, separate villages and towns and open countryside began to amalgamate. City emptied into suburb, suburb sprawled into country, village was eaten up by the spread of the whole thing.
Neither Bucksbaum nor Karl was a flashy type; they were both, as real-estate people go, on the earnest side of the ledger. Each in his own way saw himself as creating a device, a system, for making life easier for the nation's rapidly growing middle class. Max Karl gave them a house and Martin Bucksbaum, a Main Street. That the system they were doing so much to create would have the unintended consequence of fostering an exodus of both jobs and people from the city is something neither man, it would seem, was much troubled by. Both men were ardent philanthropists and would have been aghast at any thought that their hard work might eventually contribute to the decline of urban America. Their real social consciences simply did not make a connection between the development of their commercial and financial innovations and the changes in the postwar American landscape. Men whose outlooks were shaped by Depression childhoods were not likely to challenge the larger forces of the Zeitgeist.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In: Lenox Hill;
Fast-Paced, Often Noisy, Young at Heart

BYLINE: By JENNIFER KINGSON BLOOM 

 BODY:
TO most New Yorkers, the Upper East Side's reputation is more stodgy than lively. But you won't find many fur-clad matrons walking Scotties in hand-knit coats in Lenox Hill. The neighborhood, east of Park Avenue in the 60's and 70's, tends to attract youthful residents and youthful spirits to its brownstones and high-rise buildings.
The area is one of the most densely populated in the city, and it is also thick with bars, restaurants, boutiques and retail shops. 
 Though some residents complain about the noise and unruliness of the weekend crowds who crawl from pub to pub on First, Second and Third Avenues, their complaints are muted by the fact that most of the bar patrons live in the neighborhood.
"It's yuppie heaven over there," said Clark P. Halstead, founder and principal of the Halstead Property Company. "It's where you rent an apartment or buy a starter apartment when you're living the carefree single life in New York."
The original Lenox Hill was part of a farm that ran from what is now 68th Street to 74th Streets east of Fifth Avenue, and for that reason, the recently published "Encyclopedia of New York City" (Kenneth T. Jackson, editor; Yale University Press) places the neighborhood's boundaries from 60th to 77th Streets and from Lexington to Fifth Avenues.
But most residents view the modern boundaries differently: because Lenox Hill's post office and its service-oriented retailers lie east of Lexington Avenue, people who live near them have come to think of themselves as part of Lenox Hill.
Like the rest of the Upper East Side, the neighborhood is largely white, Republican and affluent. With its relatively low crime rate, abundance of schools and broad range of service-oriented shops, Lenox Hill is a magnet for young families.
On summer weekends, the playground at John Jay Park at 77th Street and the East River is mobbed with children and parents. In other seasons, the scene switches to the schools (P.S. 158, an elementary school with one of the finest reputations in the city, is a block away from John Jay Park) and to the playrooms of the luxury buildings.
The housing stock is a mixture of architectural gems and functional modern buildings. The side streets are studded with 19th-century brownstones, some of which remain single-family homes but most of which have been carved into apartments. The high-rise red- and white-brick buildings that punctuate the street corners are largely composed of pricey one- and two-bedroom apartments. Most of them are rentals and cooperatives; there are relatively few condominiums.
THE rental market is quite tight, despite high turnover rates. At Glenwood Management, which handles such large, luxury rental buildings as the Pavillion, at 77th Street and York Avenue, and the Fairfield, at 75th Street and Second Avenue, rental agents say that apartments tend to be snapped up as they become available.
Rents and sales prices were depressed for a while but have been rising steadily in recent years.
"Lenox Hill fared worse in the recent recession than the area closer to Fifth Avenue, and property values are just getting back up to where they were before the market crash," Mr. Halstead said.
As a rule, the farther you get from Park Avenue, the lower the residential real estate prices. The same holds true among the area's retail tenants and restaurants: while Lexington Avenue is characterized by antiques stores, boutiques, and fashionable restaurants like Mortimer's and Sette Mezzo, First Avenue is largely a strip of delis, dry cleaners and bars.
The neighborhood retains its share of elderly residents -- many of them longtime low-income immigrants -- and of jet-setters who live in showpiece apartments. "I think there are a lot of people who can live on Park Avenue but choose not to, and this is an area that they would choose," said Stephen L. James, director of sales at Douglas Elliman, a real estate brokerage.
Just as many residents have remained loyal to the neighborhood, many of the retail institutions have remained stable, too. "The fact is that a lot of these shops and restaurants have been there as long as I've been in New York, which is since the early 70's, and you can't say that about many neighborhoods," Mr. James said.
Among the stalwarts are restaurants like Jim McMullin's and Churchill's, and stores like Paul Mole hairdressers, the La Terrine pottery shop and the Paper House party goods store. Grace's Marketplace, a gourmet store, is also a neighborhood amenity.
Restaurants seem to sprout every day. The latest include La Galleria, a French bistro on Second Avenue near 75th Street, and Orienta, on 75th between Second and Third, a trendy spot for nouvelle Vietnamese food.
N EW to Lexington Avenue and 73d Street are the Willow restaurant and the Lenox Hill Bookstore, which opened two doors down from one another on the same day in October.
Lenny Golay, an owner of the bookstore, said she and her husband, who have owned the Corner Bookstore uptown in the Carnegie Hill section for almost two decades, chose the location for their second store quite deliberately.
"Outside of the Carnegie Hill area, I don't know of any other small neighborhood in New York City with such a strong sense of neighborhood identity," Ms. Golay said. "For example, Greenwich Village is a bit too sprawling now, and so is Chelsea. Lenox Hill is a rather specific area on the East Side, a very residential kind of area where you see families with children."
Ms. Golay and her husband, Ray Sherman, believed so much in the vibrancy of the locale that they persuaded their neighbors, who own the Table d'Hote restaurant in Carnegie Hill, to open the Willow, as well. Lauri Gibson and Vivek Bandhu, the husband-and-wife team who own both restaurants, say they have been impressed by the tightness of the Lenox Hill community.
"It's amazing how many people know one another in this neighborhood," Ms. Gibson said. "I find in the restaurant that people are always recognizing friends -- it's almost like a large cocktail party."
The neighborhood is named for a Scottish immigrant, Robert Lenox, who farmed 30 acres in the 1830's, centered roughly on what is now 70th Street. While the western side of Mr. Lenox's farm were gradually developed into mansions, the eastern portion remained humble. "The East River was the major area for commerce in the 19th century, so the housing up to Third Avenue and almost to Lexington was basically worker housing," said Richard Benenson, who serves on Community Board 8 and owns a real estate brokerage in the neighborhood.
A T the beginning of the century, the land near the East River was lined with cigar plants, tanneries and breweries. In the 1950's, the removal of the elevated train on Third Avenue brought a spurt of development and the beginning of gentrification.
In the early 1960's, a change in city zoning laws prompted developers to build high-rise apartment buildings. A second wave of development took place in the 1980's, when even taller buildings were built.
The shift in the housing stock from smaller buildings to larger ones continues today: the neighborhood's latest residential monolith is under construction at the southeast corner of 72d Street and Second Avenue. Another notable phenomenon is the emergence of Third Avenue as a regional shopping mall, lined with stores like Ann Taylor and Foot Locker. The area's largest employers are two hospitals, Lenox Hill Hospital and New York Hospital.
Some of the older immigrants remain in the neighborhood, in rent-stabilized apartments or in an elderly housing complex at 70th and First Avenue. And foreigners from varied backgrounds continue to move into the neighborhood, where an estimated 20 percent of residents are foreign-born.
"This is not a homogeneous, all-white, all-rich neighborhood," said Nancy Wackstein, executive director of the Lenox Hill Neighborhood House, the area's leading social service agency. "Certainly, this is an affluent community district -- probably one of the most affluent in the nation -- but there's a different reality here as well. I call it the other Upper East Side."
Ms. Wackstein said the agency served 80 children in its Head Start program, with many more on a waiting list.
Though the primary mission of the agency is to help needy residents, it has been trying to turn its historic building on 70th Street into a broader resource and offers health and fitness classes to attract young professionals.
"I draw a line down Lexington Avenue," Ms. Wackstein said. "Most of our donors live west, and most of our clients live east."

HEADLINE: Q and A

 BODY:

Collecting A Rent Refund
 
Q After a 10-year review of a complaint I submitted to the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal in 1985, I finally received a judgment in my favor on May 25, 1995. The complaint concerned an apartment that was "renovated" by a landlord so that he could increase the rent. I demonstrated that the rent increase was unjustified. The D.H.C.R. found I was owed a refund of $12,171.06. 
 I requested a copy of the certified order from the division so I might proceed with the collection of the refund. As of Aug. 25, 1995, the division had no record of a Petition for Administrative Review filed by the owner of the property. What is my next step? Should I initiate court proceedings? Do I need to hire a lawyer? . . . Spencer Sullivan Fontenay, Manhattan.
 
A Sam Himmelstein, a Manhattan lawyer who specializes in landlord-tenant law, said that the first thing to do is to go to the division's offices in person and request a copy of the order and a certification that the order has been entered and that no appeal of the decision has been filed. (Petitions for Administrative Review of district rent office decisions must be filed within 35 days.)
Once the order and certification have been obtained, Mr. Himmelstein said, the order can be taken to the County Clerk's office and docketed the same way a judgment from a court would be docketed.
"So, there's no need to actually bring a lawsuit," he said.
The docketed judgment, Mr. Himmelstein said, can then be taken to a sheriff who can execute, or collect, on the judgment. The sheriff, however, can only seize assets he knows about and does not have to conduct an investigation to locate assets. It is at that point, Mr. Himmelstein said, that the services of a lawyer could be helpful.
 
A Complaint Against A Landlord
 
Q My mother has lived in a rent-controlled apartment in Manhattan for more than 50 years. The landlord rebuilt the apartment three floors above my mother, putting two bathrooms in place of one.
Now, when someone flushes the toilet upstairs, water explodes out of my mother's toilet. We have brought this unsanitary condition to the attention of the landlord for a year, but he has done nothing to rectify it.
Who do we contact to get this unsanitary and uncomfortable condition repaired? . . . Jenny Michael, Teaneck, N.J.
 
A Alan Kucker, a Manhattan lawyer who specializes in landlord-tenant law, said that various options were available.
The tenant can file a Housing Part complaint against the landlord and the Department of Housing Preservation and Development to obtain an order compelling the work to be done; or, she can withhold a portion of her rent, thereby forcing the landlord either to make the repairs or take the tenant to court and risk having to explain why the repairs have not been made.
The tenant can also advise the landlord, in writing, that unless the landlord makes the necessary repairs within a reasonable time the tenant will hire her own contractor to make the repairs and then deduct the contractor's charges from the rent; or, the tenant can file a complaint for lack of services with the Division of Housing and Community Renewal.
"A D.H.C.R. complaint is probably the quickest and the easiest way for the tenant to get the repairs made," Mr. Kucker said.
The complaint can be filed by mail with the local office of the division, he said. If the landlord doesn't answer or if he contests the complaint, the division will then send an inspector to check the condition of the apartment.
If the inspector finds that the complaint is justified, D.H.C.R. can enter an order reducing the tenant's rent. In addition, the division will likely take action against the landlord to compel him to make the necessary repairs.
"Once the D.H.C.R. gets involved, most landlords will get the repairs done," Mr. Kucker said.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Top 10 Deals;
New York City Holds Its Own Against the Suburbs

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
IN one sense, it is just a list, nothing more, nothing less: The 10 biggest deals of 1995. Not necessarily the most complicated or the most lucrative; not even necessarily indicative of anything other than the square footage leased, or important to anyone other than the parties involved and those with a Lettermanesque addiction to Top 10 lists.
But in another sense, the deals yield insights about how the city fared in the year that ends today. They show a city that, at worst, successfully treaded water, and held its own against tenant-hungry suburbs and nearby states. As Carol Nelson, executive vice president of the Edward S. Gordon real estate firm, put it, "The exodus of companies out of New York finally stopped, and in that sense we gained a lot more than we lost this year." 
 First, a word about the list itself. It is tenant oriented -- that is, it is looking at where some of the biggest space users decided to locate in 1995.
Deals that involved new owners, albeit not yet new occupiers, for entire buildings -- say, Donald J. Trump's purchase of the 70-story 40 Wall Street in early December -- are not included, even if they involved larger square footages than those that made the cut. Also missing are cases where buildings changed hands but tenants stayed put. For example, the list ignores New York Life's sale of 63 Madison Avenue, at 27th Street, to George Comfort & Sons, since New York Life immediately leased back the space it had occupied all along.
Now, what it all means.
T HE list depicts a year of mixed blessings. On the down side, newcomers to the city are conspicuously absent from the top deals.
For the most part, the list is made up of companies that are renewing leases or expanding slightly. Their deals yielded big winners and losers in the landlord community, but they netted out fairly evenly for the local economy.
After all sorts of off-again, on-again negotiations and 11th-hour panics, the New York State Dormitory Authority finally completed the deal to buy 550,000 square feet of condominium space in 361 Fifth Avenue, the old B. Altman building on 34th Street. The building will be the new home of the City University of New York's Graduate Center.
That deal, which ranked as the year's third largest, led directly to the list's sixth-ranked deal. The Graduate Center currently occupies the state-owned building at 33 West 42d Street, and the B. Altman deal would not have made fiscal sense if the move would have left that space vacant. The best way to make the numbers work was to move the optometry college from 315 Park Avenue South, the 24th Street building that for two decades had been its home, into the Graduate Center's space.
The problem is that this leaves a gaping hole in 315 Park Avenue South, where the optometry school's lease was supposed to run another eight years. Not surprisingly, the building's owners are suing the state, but few people expect that to stop the move.
O THER top-10 deals were less controversial but also fell short of providing new revenues for the city or reasons for optimism for the real estate industry. CS First Boston's move to 11 Madison is a vote of confidence for Midtown South, but as far as New York is concerned, all it did was free up space at 55 East 52d Street, the Park Avenue Plaza that had been its home.
Similarly, Equitable Life may have sopped up a lot of excess space at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, but it is leaving a huge chunk of emptiness at 787 Seventh Avenue, the headquarters it built for itself just 10 years ago. (At least part of that chunk will soon be filled: Willkie Farr & Gallagher, the law firm that jumped into the news when Mario M. Cuomo joined it earlier this year, is moving in.)
Still, cheery tidbits and perhaps even trendlets emerged from the biggest-deals list, too. Two of the companies in the Top 10 list expanded significantly. Viacom's new lease brings it to well beyond 500,000 square feet at its Times Square headquarters. And Depository Trust added about 180,000 square feet to the 500,000 square feet it already occupied at 55 Water Street. That was the sort of help that downtown Manhattan, an area still mired in vacancies, sorely needed.
And as for the other companies on the list, even though some of them took cheaper space, or even less space, at least they stayed in Manhattan. That fact alone yielded heartfelt we-can-finally-breathe-out-now reactions among city boosters. Many of them, after all, were still shellshocked from 1994, when Swiss Bank announced it would move its headquarters to Stamford, Conn., and when Mastercard's new chief reversed his predecessor's decision to stay in New York and moved the financial services organization to less expensive space in Westchester.
This year, the big companies that threatened to leave the city -- either seriously or as a bargaining chip -- decided to stay.
Colgate-Palmolive, which owns undeveloped land in New Jersey, nonetheless renewed for nearly 520,000 square feet at the Park Avenue building that bears its name. Avon Products, whose oh-so-expensive lease was running out at 9 West 57th Street, had looked quite closely in Stamford and in Westchester. Instead, the company took 226,200 square feet of low-floor space at the former Exxon Building.
(Interesting sidelight: In a smaller but still noteworthy deal that tallied in as 23d largest for the year, Avon's top brass are moving to about 121,000 square feet of tower space at 1345 Avenue of the Americas -- the 55th Street building that Mastercard was planning to move to before its 11th-hour change of heart.)
But the averted defection that had the most far-reaching implications for the city, if not for the real estate industry, was that of the United Nations Development Program (not to be confused with the United Nations Development Corporation, the quasi-governmental group that handles United Nations real estate). The big United Nations agency was a hotly wooed tenant, with suitors from as close as New Rochelle, N.Y., and as far away as Bonn. Many politicians and local business people worried that the departure of a huge United Nations agency would have dealt a mortal blow to the city's reputation as the premier international center.
The agency is staying, in condominium space that the development corporation purchased at 633 Third.
All those deals sound like discrete incidents. But, look a bit further down the biggest-deals list and a picture begins to emerge of how mutually interdependent many of 1995's biggest deals were.
Take Viacom's expansion in 1515 Broadway. To do that, the big entertainment company had to take over space that had long been occupied by the New York State Urban Development Corporation. The corporation was willing to vacate that space, provided it could strike a good deal elsewhere.
This year the corporation bought some 154,000 square feet of space at 633 Third -- a transaction large enough to rank as No. 16 on the biggest-deals list. And that, in turn, made the United Nations deal a lot more palatable.
In its own transaction, the United Nation's real estate arm had agreed to buy the space that New York State was considering, if the Urban Development Corporation's deal fell through. The United Nations Development Corporation then would have had to find another United Nations tenant to put into the space.
Thomas Appleby, the development corporation's president, never seemed to find that prospect daunting.
"We could certainly find other U.N. agencies to take that space," he said last year, when the U.D.C.'s plans were still in question.
Probably so -- but then, where would those other agencies be moving from? If the pieces had not fallen into place, the musical space chairs game could well have been extended into 1996.

Baby Boomers Hit 50. Now What?

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
THE roughly 76 million baby boomers, raised to expect lives of unlimited possibilities, start turning 50 tomorrow. And as their future becomes their now, the older boomers are beginning to gray and wrinkle, to wear bifocal contact lenses, to marvel at how young the police are -- and to discover that while many of them will live long, few will prosper.
As a group, boomers earn so much that whole industries -- cars being the most expensive example -- made themselves over to win their business. But as individuals, most boomers struggle from paycheck to paycheck, even when there are two breadwinners. 
 Two out of five owe more than they own. Even most of those in the black could not go 90 days without a job. And as many jobs are down-sized, right-sized and re-engineered out of existence, not only are the days of steadily rising pay behind them, their jobs may be, too.
So, while they're living longer, they cannot count on working as long as their forebears did -- though, to pay the bills, they may have to.
Not every boomer struggles. More than half attended college, and half of those graduated. About 2 percent of boomers -- about 1.5 million of them -- are worth $1 million or more (beyond home equity), according to a Merrill Lynch survey to be released soon. An additional 17 percent have $100,000 to $1 million.
Dr. Alan Manevitz, 36, a psychiatrist at New York Hospital, said opportunities for boomers "are not in the future, they are in the now."
So what, if anything, can aging boomers do to resolve the economic dissonance between what they have and what they're told they need to retire?
Here are issues that some older boomers, and experts who study their attitudes and actions, suggest are worth pondering:
WORK Benefits experts and financial planners say boomers should not assume that their jobs will last beyond age 58. That means the roughly 3.4 million boomers turning 50 this year, who had envisioned having 15 years or so to save for their golden years, may have about half that.
"Look at I.B.M.," said Judy Lau, a certified financial planner in Wilmington, Del. In trimming its work force, I.B.M. made retirement available earlier, "so 55 became the magic age instead of 65."
"People really are looking at how to make it between 55 and 65," she said.
Edward M. Goldman, who turns 50 in July, feels comfortable these days as general manager of WBZ in Boston, one of the nation's largest radio stations. He has been salting away money since he became a father at age 29, and when he got a big promotion a decade ago, he decided to save more, not spend more. Now, even if he suddenly could not work, he said, "I would not be destitute."
But he also knows his hard-earned comfort could vanish in a heartbeat.
"When you are an employee, even at a senior level," Mr. Goldman said, "who comes in over you, or what the company is going to buy or sell, or whether you strike somebody the wrong way can mean it's suddenly over."
Few boomers, though, are in his enviable position of being prepared financially.
"People have this resignation, as I do, that it is what it is," Mr. Goldman said. "I do the best I can to maintain my health -- I exercise, run, lift weights" -- because he may need to work for a long time.
But that work may not be there. So in addition to putting money in tax-deferred retirement accounts, boomers should also be building up nest eggs they can crack open before age 59 1/2 (the age at which retirement accounts can be tapped without penalty).
SOCIAL SECURITY Don't count on it for much, even though people pay a fortune for it, roughly a seventh of pay when the matching amount charged to employers is added in. Already the law requires all boomers to reach 66 or 67 to collect in full, and some may have to work until 70, or even 72.
B. Douglas Bernheim, a Stanford University economist, says the better-off boomers should expect nothing from Social Security. "We will see means testing before most of the boomers retire," he said. "A lot of people will be means tested out of the program."
RETIREMENT Don't count on any company pension to be enough. Those jobs that people held in their 20's probably did not qualify them for a pension, and the pension from jobs they left after a dozen years at 40 will be paid in dollars that will not be adjusted for inflation.
The experts say that while the first career may end at 58, boomers should expect to work into their 70's, even if it is part time.
Many who lived through the Depression and World War II looked on old age as a time not to work. But boomers may be different.
The experts all say boomers need to be saving 10 percent or more of gross earnings for retirement. Merrill Lynch's retirement index shows the boomers need to save at about three times their current rate of about 4 percent. The most pessimistic model -- developed by Mr. Bernheim -- suggests that boomers need to save at 9 times their current rate, which would mean socking away a third of take-home pay. "One of the most disturbing findings," Mr. Bernheim said, "is that the boomers are not accelerating their rate of savings as they get older."
"Their retirement years will be much more focused on work, and less on leisure," said J. Walker Smith, a managing partner at Yankelovich Partners who studies boomers.
But that work may be on their terms. Mr. Smith points to casual dress policies on Fridays at some button-down corporations as a small but symbolic indicator of how, as boomers acquire power, they remake institutions to fit their values.
"The boomers have changed the rules every time they have entered a new time of their lives," Mr. Smith said. He expects boomers to press for more flexible hours and more working from home.
"Boomers are going to confront retirement in a very different way than their parents, confront it more as a work style than a life style," Mr. Smith predicted.
One thing's for sure. They'll regret it later if they don't take full advantage of a retirement plan like a 401(k) -- at the very least, to the point where a company matches part of what is put in.
And people should think of ways to make some money in their 60's and 70's, and look at retirement as they would death, something to be put off as long as possible.
INHERITANCE Don't count on it. Chances are two in three that parents will die leaving debts or so little money it won't pay for a vacation to Disney World. That $10 trillion that will pass from one generation to the next is highly concentrated in what Donald Trump calls "the lucky sperm club."
ESTATE PLANNING Even those with modest means need a will, especially if they have children, said Carlyn S. McCaffrey, a lawyer who specializes in estate planning for wealthy clients of Weil, Gotshal & Manges.
For those who have put off a will, fearing that the mere thought will bring them closer to their head stone, Mrs. McCaffrey offered some chilling thoughts on what happens when people die without wills.
"If there are still young children, courts will end up supervising assets," she said, and money that could have sent the kids to college may end up paying legal fees.
So get to a lawyer, or at least get a boilerplate will, available on paper or computer shareware at many stationery stores.
RESPONSIBILITIES Some boomers worry that they will become the sandwich generation, pressed between demands to support parents who have outlived their retirement savings and superannuated children who won't leave the nest. It will be worse than that for some boomers, who will have to care for grandparents. And some boomer grandparents may have to step in and raise grandchildren.
Dee Lee, a financial planner in Harvard, Mass., runs retirement seminars for government agencies and corporations, and she has a small but steady stream of men and women in their 50's who want advice about careers and grandchildren.
"Their kids have screwed up through drugs or alcohol or a bad marriage, and the grandparents have to raise the kids," Ms. Lee said. "People think this is an issue only for welfare mothers. It's not.
"I personally have seen this in two instances, where women in their mid- to late 50's quit their jobs to care of their grandchildren. Not smart. Better to keep working and pay for child care."
If people want to make a gift to a grandchild, but don't trust a grown child to keep hands off the money, do it through the Uniform Gift to Minors Act and make yourself or someone you trust the custodian.
INSURANCE Boomers in their 50's whose children are grown may need little or no life insurance. But those who started late, or started a second family, need to provide for their dependents. And even though many boomers will live long lives, insurance costs a lot, because 10 percent of men at age 50 will be gone by 65, according to actuaries at William M. Mercer Inc.
The appropriate amount of life insurance varies with family circumstances. Those with grown children would do better to build an investment portfolio than to pay insurance premiums. But for families that need insurance, the right amount depends not just on savings and debts, but also on the support that could be expected from relatives and the ability of survivors to adapt.
Whatever the need, prices of term insurance -- which has no investment feature -- have never been lower.
RELATIONSHIPS Breaking up is hard to do, but when you're older it's expensive, too. Older boomers often have houses, pensions, 401(k) accounts, not to mention picture albums and other treasures.
Linda P. Giering, 48, earned a doctorate in physical organic chemistry while having two children, and for years has traveled the world as a marketer for Du Pont Merck. Then her husband of 26 years left.
Now she has a 6,600-square-foot house in Harvard, Mass., two grown children and a lot of time on her hands, but still she can't face up to the daunting task of dealing with the mechanics of divorce.
"Getting the divorce final and settling who gets the retirement money and the house and whatnot has not been a priority, partly because it costs a lot," Ms. Giering said.
As the major breadwinner in her marriage, Ms. Giering expects to make it fine. But typically women in divorces find their assets and income slashed.
Just as divorce can wreak havoc with the best-laid financial plans, making marriage endure can avoid ripping a big hole in the wallet.
STRESS Most boomers are doing fine psychologically, but the stresses that afflict many of them will worsen with time, predicted Mr. Smith of Yankelovich Partners.
"Boomers started their careers when the future had a very optimistic view to it," Mr. Smith said. "They felt it was more or less their birthright to spend a lot of time in creative leisure pursuits, to focus on self-fulfillment and self-experience, an attitude very different from their parents and their children and, it turned out, very different from their experience in the economy in the 70's and 80's."
After that, "many boomers developed a real sense of defeatism," he said.
Harold Hodgkinson, director of the Center for Demographic Policy in Washington, says some boomers will decide, beginning in their late 50's, that they just cannot cope and will decide to check out.
"A statistically significant rise in suicides is not unreasonable," Mr. Smith said, "and the issue for these boomers will be whether they can deal with the stresses in their lives.
"Reported stress levels, concerns for personal security, for economic security and trust in every institution -- religious, economic, political, media, you name it -- are at all-time lows."
Barbara Steif, 41, a clinical psychologist at Provident Medical Center in Portland, Ore., said: "Many boomers have not had life experiences which bring suffering into their lives. It may be a surprise when they hit 40, 45 or 50 that everything is not in their control.
"We see a number of people here who come in suicidally depressed," she said, with causes including bankruptcy, college bills or health care problems.
She said boomers need to think about "whether competing with your peers for the right house, the right car and the right Cuisinart makes sense."
SPENDING Credit cards and cash machines are a major reason that boomers do not save more, said Jack Blankenship of Blankenship & Foster, financial planners in Del Mar, Calif.
"You can easily spend 20 percent of your money just in cash taken $100 or $150 at a time from a teller machine," Mr. Blankenship said.
He tries to persuade new clients to carry a notebook and record every cash expenditure. Then he has clients put the data into their Quicken or other personal finance software so they can see where their money goes.
"Once people reach age 50, when they start thinking about mortality and how are they going to pay for retirement, they start coming in our door looking for help," he said.
PERSONAL GOALS Looking back, boomers should ask themselves if they're satisfied with what they've done with their lives so far, and if not, whether it's really too late to make big changes.
For some, the years ahead may be the last chance to, say, be a Big Sister or Big Brother, being a mentor to someone who really needs one, to plant flowers in a neglected neighborhood park, to try a new adventure.
Even if the money is limited, the possibilities aren't. "Being 50," Dr. Steif said, "is a lot younger than it used to be."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
In a Soaring Market, Looking for Good Luck at Low Altitudes

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
AFTER a year of dizzying new heights for the market, investors may despair of finding any good stocks left. One natural strategy for these worried rummagers is to look among the year's most disappointing equities.
And, despite the stellar market, there were disappointing stocks in 1995, and they included many large and well-known companies. According to an analysis done by Standard & Poor's last week, the 15 worst performers in the S.& P. 500-stock index this year lost between 28 percent and 57 percent of their value. Among them are Stride Rite and Tandem Computers, which disappointed shareholders with sharply lower earnings; Advanced Micro Devices and Reebok International, which failed to introduce the right products, and Inland Steel and Navistar International, which seemed to run smack into slowing demand for their goods. 
 Though it seems improbable, investors who examine these and other ugly ducklings may discover a swan or two. Take Sears, Roebuck. In 1994, it was down in the dumps with lower profits and a falling stock price. Investors who had faith in its big plan to reinvent itself, however, watched the stock climb 66 percent this year, when the S.& P. 500 sprinted 34 percent.
But beware: a broad-gauge approach does not work in this chancy area of investing. Collectively, the year's worst performers "don't necessarily give you a group of stocks you want to own," said Robert Stovall, president of Stovall/21st Advisors in New York. Most of last year's dismal stocks are unlikely to have more success this year, simply because they will be unable to fix what was broken: high costs, unappealing products or a misguided strategy.
In fact, buying a basket of market laggards is "the worst-performing strategy there is," contended Jim O'Shaughnessy, who heads his own money-management firm in Greenwich, Conn. According to Mr. O'Shaughnessy's study of more than 40 years of data, investors who bought $10,000 of the worst performers among large-company stocks every year since 1951 would have ended up with less than half the amount they would have earned investing in the S.& P. 500 during that time.
Of course, investors must examine price-earnings and price-book ratios and other standard data for these companies before plunking down any money. But it is even more important to analyze the companies' current difficulties and any corrective efforts. Here are some questions to help determine if recovery is in the cards.
* Is the company in a viable business?
The Handleman Company, well-known as a wholesaler of music products that still comprise half its revenue, also supplies retailers with videotapes, books and software. But this is a business in which it is becoming harder to make money. "They are very specialized middlemen. That puts them in a kind of dangerous niche," said Ron Petrie, an analyst with Roney & Company. One giant customer, Wal-Mart, is beginning to order directly from manufacturers, and other retailers are squeezing Handleman more to improve their own profits. "It's a business where the margins have disappeared," Mr. Petrie said.
Investors who expect a recession in 1997 -- as some forecasters, like Standard & Poor's, do -- might also want to avoid companies that are too dependent on the overall economy, noted Joseph Tigue, managing editor of Standard & Poor's Outlook. Despite bigger market share and higher profit, Navistar International may be no bargain, for example. The company is already predicting that demand for its heavy-duty engines and trucks will sharply decline over the coming year.
* Is there a new management team?
Investors might think twice about a company run by the same people who got it into its current mess. Reebok's chairman, Paul Fireman, has been greatly criticized about his company's woes, for example, but few observers expect him to step down.
And at places where there are new managers, like Stride Rite, Kmart and Charming Shoppes, investors should look for signs of success. At Charming Shoppes, the new president and chief executive is Dorrit J. Bern, who was credited with improving the women's apparel division at Sears.
"I think she's very capable," said Harry A. Ikenson, a senior director at Rodman & Renshaw, a brokerage firm. She has cut costs and made the retailer more fashion-conscious, and Mr. Ikenson thinks a result will be profitability sometime next year. "All the ingredients for a turnaround are there," he said.
* Are the company's products compelling?
Companies need sales, or the prospect of them. Because Advanced Micro failed to develop a chip to compete with Intel's new Pentium, it has lost market share and seen sales of its older chip plummet. "It's a classic example of a technology company missing a product cycle," said Raj Rajaratnam, an analyst at Needham & Company, a brokerage firm. While Advanced Micro has said its new chip is still on the way, investors won't find out whether the company succeeds for at least six to nine months.
Lack of a strong seller has also hurt Reebok, while Nike, its rival, can't keep its pricey shoes on the shelves. Investors might want to stay away from Reebok until they are convinced that the company can come up with a shoe that will dazzle consumers. "They're not leading-edge," said Jennifer Black Groves of Black & Company, a research firm in Portland, Ore. "It hasn't been the cool shoe to wear."
* Is the company likely to go bankrupt or go out of business?
The good news here is that most companies offer investors plenty of warning of impending demise, said Lewis Altfest, a financial planner in New York. Two red flags are debt-laden balance sheets and repeated annual losses. The exception are retailers, which can file for bankruptcy quickly if their suppliers start to panic. "Nobody thought Caldor was a goner," he said, alluding to the discounter which filed for Chapter 11 protection this year.
Kmart, however, shows the uncertainties that can make rummaging among losers occasionally lucrative. While there are many rumors of a looming Chapter 11 filing, others judge the talk unfounded. "The stock has gotten way oversold," said Mr. Petrie, who belongs in the latter camp. "Take away the rumors, and the stock would be selling at three times its current level."
* Most important, is the problem fixed?
Few companies that do poorly do nothing about it. The Brown Group, maker of Buster Brown shoes, is shutting down plants and boarding up retail stores. Navistar plans to slash costs by $112 million in 1996. Advanced Micro Devices has made a key acquisition.
For the bottom-fishing investor, therefore, the big nail-biter is: Will the changes be enough to turn a company around?

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Casinos May Find Adversity A Boon

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

 BODY:
By the end of this year, it seemed appropriate that the most powerful company in one of the wealthiest industries in the country -- gambling -- was called Mirage Resorts.
After gambling grew rapidly in the early 1990's, the industry's success started to vaporize in 1995. The spread of casinos to new towns screeched to a halt because of popular resistance, Congress threatened new regulations, gambling stocks got clobbered and the Harrah's Jazz Company, which was building a big new casino in New Orleans, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November. The stock market seemed like the only place left for an honest wager. 
 But those who study the proclivities of gamblers, at the slots as well as in the market, say the odds for 1996 look good. Considering that this is an industry with a stock market capitalization of more than $30 billion, that is important news for investors, whether or not they buy casino shares.
In a way, analysts see the political environment -- in which some conservative politicians, including several Presidential candidates, have called for a halt to the spread of casinos -- as a blessing in disguise.
The growth of gambling in the last five years has created enormous competition along the Mississippi River, on Native American tribal lands and in small towns across the country. The costs of running casinos have risen sharply and management at the companies has been stretched thin. A lull in the opening of new jurisdictions will allow the better-managed companies to improve existing operations, particularly in Las Vegas, Nev., and Atlantic City.
Even threats to throw casinos out of some of the newly opened areas -- some expect Louisiana to consider a prohibition because of corruption scandals -- do not worry some analysts.
"The healthy part is that this will be the time to regroup," said Lee Isgur, an analyst at Jeffries & Company. "In the major markets -- Las Vegas, Atlantic City and Mississippi -- there are few regulations and a good operating environment. They won't be affected by a rollback."
Salomon Brothers estimates that gambling revenues at casinos will rise to $18 billion next year, from $16.1 billion in 1995 and $14.1 billion in 1994.
But most analysts predict that because of the peculiar economics of the business, the more moderate growth will help only the biggest companies, not the dozens of smaller gambling concerns that have gone public in recent years. Gamblers need a new thrill, and so the companies will have to erect ever larger casinos, even at the old gambling sites, to increase the crowds.
That, in fact, will be happening in Las Vegas. In the next year, three new casino-hotels, costing nearly $1 billion, are scheduled for completion: the Monte Carlo, the Stratosphere and New York-New York, which will bring a faux Manhattan skyline to the desert. But only the wealthiest companies can make such hefty investments.
"There'll be a real tiering in 1996," said David Wolfe, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. "The companies have got to put up new projects to grow, and not that many companies have the ability to finance new projects."
In other words, the iron rule of gambling will hold: the house, in the form of the biggest casino operations, will win.
"Nineteen ninety-six," said Scott M. Renner, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, "is going to be the year when the rich get richer."

HEADLINE: THE YEAR IN BUSINESS.;
Hail to the Pet Taxi and the Deli Poets

 BODY:
WE sculpt alloy in SoHo lofts and scour the streets for edgy Nikon images and fill sleek galleries with retro, po-mo P.C. TV installations. But the true art of New York is more prosaic. It lies in making a buck.
Like most art, a business scheme is an alchemy of varied elements. Think of the refrajo, a drink that mixes champagne sodas and beer and is carefully marketed to the Latin American population of Queens. Or the cybercafes, blending Silicon Valley with Seattle grunge to attract Flatiron 'Net surfers. Or the Korean deli that has poetry nights. Or the Indian restaurant that goes kosher. 
 The city is a gridiron of tiny entrepreneurial skirmishes, furtive forays into vacant niches, with grand plans to fill, or create, demand. One move affects another, creating new forms, like the caterpillar of an office supply store transforming into a butterfly of a supply store-boutique-espresso bar.
On the principle that business reveals the city more than politics -- for example, immigrants enter the economic mainstream well before the political -- we bring you highlights of the entrepreneurial world of 1995.
 
THE PET TAXI Lawrence Reilly started Pet Taxi because it's tough to get a taxi in the city if you're carrying a cat or a dog. He decorated a yellow minivan like an old Checker cab. One client moved a 15-pound turtle and some baby sharks.
 "I have a hard time finding a regular taxi willing to stop," said a customer, Nikki Alvarez. "I have to trick them and have someone hold the dog while I flag down the cab; then they complain that they don't want to take us."
 
THE MEGADELI The Penn Plaza Deli opened, taking up a full city block between 33d and 34th Streets on Eighth Avenue, with pizza, fried plantains, sushi and Mongolian barbecue and multiple serving stations, piped-in music, large television sets and a blocklong counter with stools.
Chung Hoon Shin, the manager, described the concept: "Have the best food and the biggest place. We have everything, so you don't have to go to a lot of different places."
 
THE PEDICAB George Bliss, an actor, started Pedicabs of New York. For 50 cents a minute, you get a ride in a 200-pound fiberglass vehicle attached to a tricycle. It took him two years to find liability insurance.
"This is the transportation of the future," Mr. Bliss said. "It isn't just a tourist attraction."

BALDIES WITH ATTITUDE Lorraine Lagalla of Ridgewood, Queens, hired ex-street criminals to sculpture hair for blowouts, Jersey fades baldies, and intricate hair designs. Found them the most qualified.
 "I'm going to jail," said a barber, Harvey Garcia, who had been arrested on a gun charge. "I got one to three years. I'm not happy about it."
 
KASHRUT KEBABS Pradeep Shinde, owner of Madras Mahal, specialized in kosher Indian food to stand out in the heated lunch competition in Curry Hill, around Lexington Avenue in the 20's.
 "Quite a few restaurants have gone out of business around here," Mr. Shinde said, "but I can pay my bills sometimes because of the Jewish community."
 
THE EDGE IN GRAFFITI TATS Cru, three South Bronx graffiti artists named Bio, Nicer and BG 183, were hired by Coca-Cola to do mural-style ads in inner-city areas.
"These kids, they don't go to museums," Bio said of neighborhood youths. "This is their art. They come to see the walls on the streets."
 
IAMBIC PENTA-METER Marc Anthony Butcher, a cabby, sold a book of his poems to his passengers.
"I have a rotating captive audience," he said.
 
THE LITTLE MIXER BOY A 4-year-old disk jockey, 43-inch-tall Justin Spaulding of Southeast Queens, commanded hundreds of dollars at playground basketball tournaments and birthday parties.
He spins two hours a night, in between sessions with Barney and the Power Rangers.
 
TWO NATIONS Avenue A entrepreneurs decided that the best use of a space was to split its functions -- a coffee bar during the day, a plain old bar at night.
"If we had opened a bar during the day, we would have gotten hard-core drunkards," said Graham Winton, a part-owner.
 
LOCAL APPEAL Wendy's installed a piece of artwork to smooth over hard feelings with anti-commercialism locals at Broadway and Bleecker.
"Sure, I have mixed feelings about showing at Wendy's," said Bill Rabinovitch, a figurative expressionist painter. "But if no one ever sees your work, what's the point of being an artist?"
 
UPSCALE PUBS The dark, secretive Irish bars of the 1980's that served as entry points and job centers for illegal immigrants went upscale as the clientele assimilated. You were as likely to see a patron sipping a warm tulip glass of Irish coffee as a pint glass of dark beer.
"When you came here, you took an apartment the bartender gave you because you needed it," said Mary Collins of Sunnyside, Queens. "We're not illegal anymore. We don't have to hide."
 
CAFE LOS NEGROES An editor, a currency trader, a techie and an independent film maker joined to create a Web site for underground minority artists.
"We recognized that this is a divided society," said Charlotte Burley, the film maker. "People who know computers and people who don't."
 
POEMS, POTATOES Lynn Gerber, a poetry devotee, did a deal with Hee Min Kwon, owner of Picnic Place, a deli and salad bar on Fifth Avenue near 36th Street. The deli became the site of weekly poetry readings. Everyone pays $6 and gets a $2 Picnic Place voucher.
One reader, Patricia Chao, found the site unintimidating: "Once you get to the deli level, it's pretty democratic."
 
NEW AGE FITNESS The gym wars intensified with the opening of the cavernous Reebok facility near Lincoln Center. Some gyms expanded to include reflexology, hypnosis, rolfing (manipulation of muscle sheaths), and acupucture. Other New Age perks: gym pyschologists, gym personal shoppers and gym barbers.
"Fitness has always been perceived as a vanity," said Pat Manocchio, when he was about to open La Palestra on West 67th Street. "We see it as something more medical."
 
BIg vs. Little
 
THE megastores kept moving in, creating a culture of adjustment among the established smaller businesses.
 
TO ADJUST OR NOT TO ADJUST A beloved and defining Upper West Side landmark, Shakespeare and Company, counterpunched the whalelike Barnes & Noble. It moved into used, rare and antique books and specially ordered out-of-print books. It introduced author appearances and readings. It even took the offensive, deciding to start a mini-chain and open a new store at 69th and Lexington.
"If bookstores were movie critics," said Lee Minoff, a book shopper on Upper Broadway,. "Shakespeare would be Pauline Kael and Barnes & Noble would be Siskel and Ebert.," said Lee Minoff, a bookshopper on Upper Broadway.
 
DARWIN AND LATTE Starbucks, the Seattle-based coffee chain, opened on Columbus Avenue and 67th Street. The nearby smaller cafes, which had been invaders themselves only a short time before, had to scurry.
Timothy's posted a daily trivia question; the first 10 people who answered correctly won a free eight-ounce coffee. New World boasted of two espresso shots in its tall latte compared with one at Starbucks. Cooper's offered half-price happy-hour granitas ( coffee-flavored slushies).
 "We all benefit in a sense," said Andrew Resnick, vice president of Timothy's, which is based in Toronto. "Competition makes you better. We need to be sharper, cleaner, nicer."
 
MIXED USE King's, at 14 East 33d Street, was a traditional family-owned office supply store, facing intense competition from Staples, the large national chain.
So it installed a coffee bar, and began selling boutique items like ties, gifts and scarves. Soon it will open 24 hours a day.
"We were under siege," said King's president, Howard Pilmar. "With the advent of superstores we had to retool."
 
The Year in Hustling
 
SCALPER STRESS Responding to a police crackdown outside Madison Square Garden, older, established scalpers paid a hardier, more brazen breed of youthful scalpers to work the street.
"They keep coming over here and selling," said Officer John Vasquez. "They're bold. I guess they're desperate."
 
TRANSFER STATION In a rush-hour ritual at the Hub at 149th Street and Third Avenue in the Bronx, peddlers rummaged through trash bins, found bus transfers and then sold them to subway riders for 50 cents each, whispering "for the bus, for the bus" and "transfers, transfers."
"We provide a community service," said a peddler named John, who gave only his first name. "Many people here are on tight budgets. The police may not see it that way, but our customers do."
 
PRODUCT UPGRADE In Manhattan Valley, the police said they saw a resurgence in heroin use as cocaine dealers in brownstones and housing developments from 100th to 110th Streets began to diversify. Prices went down; quality went up.
"We're definitely getting more calls about it, and we're seeing more of it ourselves," said Tamar Lynn, an assistant of the West Side Crime Prevention Program, in March. "Heroin users have this glazed, haunted look, as opposed to crack users, who are kind of jumping around."
 
WALL STREET CONNECTION Cabbies looking for Wall Street fares queued up on East 79th Street and York Avenue, piling groups of riders in for a fare of $3.50 each. When the passengers asked to be taken somewhere else, the drivers refused, and the scene occasionally became violent.
"Are you kidding? There's a hassle out there every day," said Edward J. Kloos, a co-owner of the nearby Suburban Meats.
 
METER FEEDERS On Arthur Avenue in the Bronx, a ragtag group of men and women made a living feeding quarters, for a small fee, into expiring meters in lots and curbsides. Despite the illegality, they became a valuable resource for many shoppers and merchants.
"These guys are great," said Sharon Henderson, of Parkchester, clutching a couple of sagging shopping bags from Randazzo's Fish Market. "Very good service at a cheap price. It beats kicking the meter."
 
OFF and Off Off Broadway companies reverted to a time-honored tradition to sell tickets: the gimmick. Free food was popular. (One offered fine cuisine, another pizza.) Being quick and funny also helped. Here's a sampling:
 
"TOO MUCH LIGHT MAKES THE BABY GO BLIND"
Here, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street.
Still running.
 
 The Neo Futurists, a troupe from Chicago, performed 30 plays in a hour. The audience picked the plays from a menu of 2,000 mini-dramas.
Admission price was determined by a roll of the dice, and the company bought the entire audience pizza in the event of a sellout.
 
"POMP DUCK & CIRCUMSTANCE"
DeWitt Clinton Park, 11th Avenue and 53d Street
Still running.
 
 A surreal theater experience served up with gourmet soup, pasta and, of course, duck. An international company of acrobats, jugglers, musicians and clowns provided the Bauhaus atmosphere while the audience digested.
 
"GRANDMA SYLVIA'S FUNERAL"
Playhouse on Vandam, 15 Vandam Street.
Still running.
 
 A comic wake was staged on the streets of SoHo. The audience got to play the mourners. Fights between characters looked so genuine that the police intervened and local diners emptied restaurants to watch.
 
"O. J. WHODUNNIT MURDER MYSTERY"
The Ibis Club, 327 West 44th Street.
 
 Riding the wave of O.J.-mania, the playwright Larry Wolfe Horwitz created a constantly updated parody of the trial of the century. The audience played jury members for another mythical murder and picked a verdict. The show closed when the trial did.
 
"THE COMPLEAT WORKS OF WLLM SHKSPR (Abridged)"
Westside Theater, 407 West 43d Street

 This production presented all of Shakespeare's 37 plays and 154 sonnets in under two hours. This meant shrinkage: a 20-minute "Romeo and Juliet," and 16 plays stuffed into something called "The Love Boat Goes to Verona." The cast of three played 25 characters apiece.

An Economic Messiah for Harlem?

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
Skeptics could be forgiven for having little faith in the Federal Empowerment Zone; it has been kicked around as a concept since a group of conservatives introduced enterprise zones during the Reagan Administration. Since then, it has apparently amounted to little more than a political football -- alternately embraced and abandoned by each party -- and some studies have raised questions about its potential efficacy.
Now, after a year of planning, $300 million in Federal, state and city funds is about to be directed toward Upper Manhattan and a sliver of the South Bronx over the next 10 years. What difference this will make in a particularly impoverished swath of the city is still unclear. But the political benefits are clear: minority politicians can appear proactive and white Republicans like Mayor Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki can trumpet concern for the inner city while promoting free enterprise. 
 But in the absence of other bright spots, the zone has been embraced as at least a concrete hope.
"Is Harlem going to become a flowering oasis overnight?" said Richard D. Parsons, the president of Time Warner, who is chairman of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone Corporation. "Are you going to be able to overcome 60 years of decline? No. But are we going to be able to build some investments that give the community more capacity to deal with its own economic destiny? Yes."
The empowerment funding is not a lot of money, Mr. Parsons said, but it is intended only to jump-start the renewal process. "We're talking about small local businesses," he explained. "Nobody's going to build a G.M. plant up there."
Proponents hope that the initial infusion of money and tax breaks will generate private capital. They say several banks and companies have expressed interest in investing in Harlem, but the hard part will be to teach local businesses how to attract and maintain such interest.
After some philosophical wrangling over the zone's emphasis, public officials now say that it strikes the right balance between stimulating private investment and strengthening social services. Public officials will have veto power over economic proposals and can demand accountability from businesses.
The zone arrives at a sensitive moment in the neighborhood's economic history. In the last year alone, controversy plagued the city's approval of a Pathmark supermarket in East Harlem, and Governor Pataki withdrew $64 million in Port Authority funds for the long-stymied Harlem International Trade Center, which was to be a zone centerpiece. Earlier this month, a clothing store on 125th Street was convulsed by racially charged arson in which eight people died.
It is time, said the Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d, pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, to seize new opportunities, not nurse old wounds. "Let's not curse the darkness now," he said. "Let's run after this candle and see what we can do." ROBIN POGREBIN

The Year in Venting: Why It's Good to Blow Off Steam

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
YOU live in a city where the Mayor has the courage to raise his own salary while cutting services to the barely coping. The least you can do in return is stand up for quality of life amid quantity of despair, as he does. Resolve in the new year to be one of Rudy's Rangers. Get out and be a monitor in your own nabe.
I will continue my own meager efforts, waving delivery bikers off the sidewalks and barking at dog owners who let their furry toys run loose or do not clean up behind them. I have been sustained in this mission by a trickle of whiny, defensive letters and calls accusing me of being misguided, stupid, hateful, racist, specie-ist and, worst of all, cranky. Like Rudy the Role Model, I gain strength from such criticism, especially since I believe that being cranky is a virtue in this city. 
 There is something assertive and consistent about being cranky; the alternative too often seems to be that passive-aggressive mode in which we sit and take far too much (We're New Yorkers! Suffering is cool and nonsuburban!), then overreact in often hideous ways. There are too many predictable explosions in the city. While we obviously need much more intervention and mediation, until funds are available a little crankiness, a daily venting, helps.
Just to be sure I was as right as I thought I was, I decided to poll Coping's Board of Advisers, which includes, among others, my family, friends, spiritual mentors (Father Vincent J. Termine, Dharma Mittra, Chief Oren Lyons), business consultants (Andrew Rasiej, Cindy Hawkins, Jong Chung), arts aides (Brother Rick Curry, Brendan Canny, Gene Howard, Johnny Colon), wise heads (Ruth K. Goldberg, Eleanor Papa, Al Weaver), inspirations (Beverly Kidd, David Klot, Ed Gallagher), legal counsel (Tonya Frichner, Arthur Schwartz, Judge Leslie Crocker Snyder), shrinks (Kathy Conway, Ilana Reich), Pet Patrollers (Carol Chesler, Peggy Smith, Sandy Rindner) and the Icons of the Nabe (Danny Meyer, three-legged Boots and Anton Dvorak, whose statue will soon be in, not near, Stuyvesant Square Park).
And then I decided not to poll them after all; what if they disagree and I have to fire them?
In any case, I had shaky scientific evidence on my side. My friend John Exel, cabinetmaker and chef, recently returned from a postcardiac stressbuster class and described how blood turns to sludge in times of fear and anxiety; this was in the Original Plan so you wouldn't bleed out after being bitten by a pterodactyl. I asked Mr. Exel if the same sludge effect couldn't result from being scared by a large unleashed dog, or a biker delivering takeout from Zen Palate. Who knows? answered Mr. Exel, which was good enough for me.
Fingering Zen Palate is easy because its riders wear the restaurant's name on their backs. They are not the only food pedalers on my local sidewalks. Then again, I have eaten there and found the food overwrought and overpriced (if you truly love vegetables, why disguise them as hamburgers?). Also, the riders become notably unsocial when I stand my concrete.
The worst offenders among walkers of dogs seem to be, at least in my nabe, those youngish men who look like the kind of yuppies who would order slaughtered baby corn from Zen Palate. Because their unleashed dogs seem to be extensions of their master macho, they tend to yell at my suggestions that they tie up or clean up. It seems that part of their pathetic pose is pretending absolute and exclusive control of their dogs, which is why they walk them loose.
Since I once rode for Western Union, one would think I would have more compassion for the delivery riders, if not the dog boys. But I don't, especially when I see how they all make little old ladies jump and tremble.
Mayor Giuliani must agree with me on that. As I understand his quality-of-life stand, allowing simple, streetside order to get out of hand is to invite a climate of chaos. Everyday people will feel defeated and become passive, and criminals will flourish. I can buy that as a start. But will the Mayor agree that we can't wait for the police -- or for him -- to maintain simple, streetside order unless we force them to, until we make that first move to clear our sidewalks of ice, litter, dog droppings, illegal bikers (if you are over 12, it is illegal to ride on the sidewalk), illegal vendors, prostitutes, menacing bums, zombies and their drug dealers and anything else that threatens our quality of life.
Small victories inevitably lead to the sense that larger victories are possible, that everyday people sweeping their own sidewalks can take political and economic control of their own neighborhoods, hospitals, schools, social services.
If the Mayor agrees with that, then Happy New Year to him as well as to you.

The Year in Sex Zones

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
To judge from the relative ease with which the new sex-zone regulations sailed through the Council this fall, one might think that the city had undergone some kind of puritanical transformation.
But critics of the new zoning, which restricts sex-related businesses to certain neighborhoods, say that the success of the legislation is more reflective of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's political mastery than the public's personal morality. 
 "This is clearly the Mayor's agenda," said Councilwoman Joan Griffin McCabe of Brooklyn, who voted against the regulations. "It's a very easy way for the Mayor to project that he is concerned about neighborhoods and family. This is an easy way to point the finger."
Under the new regulations, sex-related businesses will be restricted to manufacturing areas and commercial zones and will not be allowed to operate within 500 feet of residences, schools and houses of worship, or within 500 feet of each other. Businesses that violate these rules must close within the year, which could leave as few as 15 establishments, down from 177 citywide.
Not so fast, civil libertarians are saying. They are about to file a lawsuit on behalf of consumers and business owners that challenges the legislation as unconstitutional.
Norman Siegel of the New York Civil Liberties Union said the city had failed to prove that adult entertainment businesses have adverse effects, like a rise in crime or a decrease in property values, and to prove that consumers will maintain reasonable access to such establishments. "There is a chill in the air coming out of City Hall," Mr. Siegel said. "It is antithetical to the rich history of New York City's commitment to an open and robust freedom of expression."
Others object to the regulations on the grounds that they disproportionately affect certain neighborhoods, and that they threaten to shut down sex-related businesses that are important to the gay and lesbian community in areas like Greenwich Village. "It's very easy to beat up on erotica, but that doesn't mean that we should stomp it out," said Bill K. Dobbs, a gay advocate who has led much of the fight against the zoning. "This is the sweeping sterilization of New York City."
City officials who support the zoning, however, say it reflects residents' interests more accurately than its critics suggest. "It says that people are tired of a constantly eroding quality of life," said Charles Millard, who spearheaded the zoning regulations as a Council representative from the Upper East Side and who is now president of the city's Economic Development Corporation.
"I think New York City has always had greater middle-class sensibilities than the liberal Democratic ruling class has understood," Mr. Millard continued. "There are not that many parents who don't care about having their 11-year-old son or daughter walk past some of these stores."
Despite the still-simmering debate and upcoming court challenges, the city seems to feel confident that its new regulations will hold. "We are confident that the zoning meets all legal standards," said Joseph B. Rose, the chairman of the City Planning Commission. "Every community is more protected under these regulations."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: LOOKING BACK, LOOKING AHEAD;
Brooklyn's Small Plants Filling Industrial Gap

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
The shutdowns of big businesses in Brooklyn this year were well publicized: A. & S., Pechter Field's bakery, KB Electronics, each gone, along with hundreds of jobs. The economic base of Brooklyn, it seemed, was draining away fast.
But behind the headlines is a bit of hope. 
 As large companies continue to close, analysts say, they are being replaced by a host of smaller ones that produce specialty goods like food, clothing and furniture. The hundreds of small manufacturers that operate in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, the Bush Terminal in Gowanus and the Brooklyn Army Terminal in Sunset Park are slowing the rate at which Brooklyn is losing manufacturing jobs.
"Brooklyn has a vast industrial plant which has recently seen a transformation from big manufacturing to small manufacturers," said Mitchell L. Moss, the director of New York University's Urban Research Center. "It tends to be driven by immigrants, and they're making high-value goods, niche goods."
The overall industrial statistics are still sobering. Brooklyn, which had 115,900 manufacturing jobs in 1978, had 51,848 at the start of 1995, according to the State Department of Labor. And more large manufacturers shut down during the year.
Take Pechter Field's. In August, 400 workers lost their jobs when the giant Bedford-Stuyvesant bakery closed after months in bankruptcy. Potential buyers said they were scared off by the high price of doing business in the city.
The same concern led KB Electronics Inc. -- a 135-person outfit in East New York that manufactured motor-speed controls for treadmills, printing presses and pizza ovens -- to pack up and move to Coral Springs, Fla. Gilbert Knauer, the company's president, said that his electric bills are now 40 percent lower, his real estate taxes are halved and his employees do not need to pay state income tax. And he said there is no crime. "Moving was a no-brainer," he said.
But while Brooklyn continued to experience a net loss of manufacturing jobs -- it had 2.4 percent fewer at the beginning of 1995 than it did in the beginning of 1994 -- the rate of loss slowed because of the small companies. "I would argue that it is stable," Professor Moss said, "because so much is off the books anyway."
In addition, former industrial areas are being adapted for businesses outside the manufacturing field. Stretches of Williamsburg, Red Hook and the area dubbed Dumbo -- Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass -- now appeal as much to artists as entrepreneurs.
Typical of Brooklyn's changing industrial scene is the return of a microbrewery to a borough that was once a beer capital. The Rheingold brewery, which once employed 4,000 workers, moved out in 1976 along with Brooklyn's other remaining brewery, F. & M. Schaefer.
Now the Brooklyn Brewery, which makes niche beers like Brooklyn Lager, is building a 25-barrel microbrewery on North 11th Street in Williamsburg. The new plant, scheduled to open by the spring, will have only about 10 employees at the outset, but its owners hope it will grow. "It makes sense to produce the beer here, because New York City is our main market," said Garrett Oliver, its brewmaster. "We can roll directly out of here."
The microbrewery's building itself tells the story of Brooklyn's manufacturing history: in previous incarnations, it was an ironworks, a warehouse and a matzoh bakery.

HEADLINE: New York's Medicaid Cuts Will Cost Working Families More

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re Edwin S. Rubenstein's "More Medicaid Myths" (Op-Ed, Dec. 26): 
 Gov. George E. Pataki's proposed $2.9 billion health care cuts would devastate the system that New York's working people, their children, the elderly and the disabled depend on. These cuts will come on top of previous heavy reductions and additional cuts by Medicare and managed-care payers.
If Mr. Rubenstein hasn't seen serious damage yet, it's partly because the State Legislature has blocked the most severe cuts. As the economics analyst for National Review, he seems unaware of the health problems of ordinary New Yorkers.
Hospitals and clinics have been cutting staffs and services. Even the wealthiest patient arriving with a heart attack will face a longer wait and reduced services. Some people will die who could have lived. Their families probably won't realize they are sharing the burden of those cuts.
New York spends more on Medicaid than other states, but for several good reasons.
* In New York, Medicaid pays hospitals almost the same rates that Blue Cross does. Other states cheat their hospitals out of fair payment, forcing them to shift the cost to other payers, which raises the price of health insurance.
* We pay for much more home care than other states, which means family members can work instead of staying home to care for elderly parents.
* We include many items in our Medicaid definition that most states pay for through other programs, such as a large part of our mental health budget, partial payments to hospitals for care for the uninsured and support for public hospitals.
Our Medicaid costs have grown no faster than health care inflation generally in recent years.
Two-thirds of our Medicaid dollar pays for care for the elderly or disabled. But they are not "middle class," as Mr. Rubenstein calls them -- although some were before they started spending $40,000 or more a year for a nursing home bed. There are some who have "hidden" assets, but that is a minuscule piece of the pie.
Mr. Rubenstein says we should cut what we pay to hospitals. But New York State has for years tightly regulated hospital prices. Adjusted for wages and case severity, New York hospital prices are the third lowest in the country already.
If Governor Pataki's Medicaid cuts go through, health care providers will have to cut services. Working people and their families can't afford to pay extra to make up for those cuts.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Once Upon a Time, a Budget Surplus

BYLINE: By HAROLD FABER 

 BODY:
EVEN if Congress and the President actually balance the budget in seven years, the Government will still owe $4.3 trillion in outstanding public debt, according to the Congressional Budget Office. But suppose that in succeeding years, the national debt were paid off and the Government even ran a surplus.
This wildly improbable scenario happened once, and only once, in American history. From 1835 to 1837, the United States was not only free of debt, it actually had a surplus in the Treasury. 
 How did it happen and what did Congress do with the money?
The United States started out in 1789 with a debt of $75 million, a large sum for those days, which was incurred during the Revolutionary War. (For 1793, the first year for which complete figures are available, economists have calculated the ratio of debt to gross domestic product as 31 percent, as against today's ratio of 52 percent).
Year by year, the Government paid off the debt until the last installment -- a total of $57,000 -- was paid in 1835. President Andrew Jackson reported to Congress that "all that remains of the public debt has been redeemed," and then he revealed that the Treasury actually had a surplus of $19 million.
Where did the money come from?
In those simple days, before income and corporate taxes, the United States got its money from two major sources: customs duties and the sale of public lands. And there were only five categories of expenses: the Army, the Navy, pensions, payments to Indians and miscellaneous.
In 1836, the first year of a debt-free nation, Washington's income jumped to $50.8 million, mainly because of increased land sales in the West. Expenses rose somewhat, to $30.8 million, leaving $20 million more unspent.
 
Take the Money, Please
 The mounting surplus caused a problem in Congress. There was no easy solution as there might be today, for there were no taxes to cut. After several proposals were considered and discarded, Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky had what seemed to be the best compromise -- distributing the money to the states to use as they pleased, or, in other words, giving out block grants.
But there was a serious problem -- the Constitution. Disposing of surplus money was not one of the powers enumerated for Congress in the Constitution, and, in those days when the Constitution was taken far more literally than it is now, that was a major obstacle.
A proposal to amend the Constitution was discarded in favor of a simpler, more ingenious solution. Congress decided to deposit the nation's money in the states and announced that those deposits would be subject to recall in case of need.
It was a subterfuge recognized by all. "It is in name a deposit, in form a loan, in essential design a distribution," said Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri at the time. "All of this verbiage about a deposit is nothing but a device and contrivance by those who have been for years endeavoring to distribute the revenue."
How much money was involved? On Jan. 1, 1837, after $5 million had been deducted as a reserve fund, there remained $37,468,859 (the accumulated surpluses from 1835 and 1836) to be distributed among the 26 states that then existed. The money was allocated in proportion to each state's electoral vote, in four equal installments throughout the year.
After the third payment, though, the euphoric bubble burst. In late 1837, President Martin Van Buren, who had succeeded Jackson, confronted a financial panic and the prospect of deficits and debt once again.
The panic was another legacy of Andrew Jackson. Before he left office, he had issued his famous specie circular, which required that public lands be purchased with gold and silver instead of paper. In 1836, the land sales brought in a revenue of $25 million; in 1837, $7 million.
 
Deep Pockets Depleted
 That sharp decrease led to problems for the banks that had been lending money for land purchases. Chaos ensued in the nation's financial system and finally the country suffered its first severe depression. By 1837, gross Federal revenue had dropped to $25 million, half of what it had been the year before, and a deficit of $12 million replaced a $20 million surplus.
As a result, Congress stopped the fourth installment of the surplus distribution. But by that time the states had already received a total of over $28 million.
New York, which had the largest population at the time, received the largest amount, $4 million. Pennsylvania got $2.9 million; Virginia, $2.2 million; Ohio, $2 million; North Carolina, Tennessee and Kentucky, each $1.4 million; Massachusetts, $1.3 million; Georgia, $1 million, and the other states lesser amounts.
And what did they do with the bonus money?
Maine distributed it to its citizens on a per capita basis (about $2.02 for each free person, at a time when a dollar a day was a good wage). Two states, North Carolina and Maryland, used the money to help pay off state debts; three states, Alabama, Georgia and Virginia, poured it into state banks; eight states, Arkansas, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, Rhode Island and South Carolina, used the funds to pay state or county expenses, and 12 states Connecticut, Delaware, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Vermont, used most of the money for schools.
As predicted at the time, the Federal Government never did ask for the return of any of the money, though it was deep in debt by 1838. And never since then has the nation faced the delightful problem of having more money than it could use.

HEADLINE: No Free Rides;
Generational Push Has Not Come to Shove

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WAS 1995 the first skirmish in the great generational war? If so, many analysts suggest, Americans have little stomach for it.
For years now, an influential group of academics and political theorists has been predicting this clash: As a great wave of baby boomers begins to retire in the next 15 years, generational tensions will come to drive American politics just as race and class and ethnicity have in eras past. 
 It is a chilling vision of a not-so-distant future, as the first boomers, born in 1946, begin to turn 50 tomorrow: The elderly and soon-to-be-elderly angrily protecting their benefit programs; the young increasingly resentful as programs for the elderly take a greater share of Federal resources; the whole system growing more precarious as the population gets older, putting more and more of a burden on the people still in the work force.
To many on Capitol Hill, the interests of the old and the young already seem at odds in the Federal budget. The Congressional Budget Office, for example, projects that Medicare will grow about 10 percent a year, consuming more than 17 percent of the budget by the year 2005, up from about 12 percent in 1996.
Devotees of "generational accounting," like Lawrence Kotlikoff, an economist at Boston University, warn that even the Republican proposal to balance the budget and trim these benefit programs was far too little and much too late.
Yet the 1995 budget battle, which was dominated by Republican plans to squeeze $270 billion from Medicare, underscored what politicians have long suspected. Policy analysts may see the old and the young locked in an ugly struggle -- epitomized in a Newsweek cover this year showing a weary young man with an old woman in a wheelchair on his back -- but voters generally do not. Behind those nasty, budget-busting benefit programs are the parents and grandparents of the young (a sort of 1990's version of "Don't shoot, we are your children").
Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster, said: "I think what we've learned about generational warfare is that it's largely a myth. Everything we've seen in our polling is that younger people are just as concerned about protecting Medicare and Social Security as their parents."
Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster and adviser to the House Republican leadership, agreed that there was little evidence of true generational conflict in 1995. "I don't think it's a skirmish because I don't think the younger generation is fighting back," he said.
There are some obvious reasons for this: For all the talk about the breakdown of the extended family, some scholars say, the bonds between the generations remain surprisingly strong. True, the Waltons are no longer the norm: In 1952, 38 percent of the people over 65 were living with their children; 35 years later, that figure had dropped to 20 percent, according to the American Association of Retired Persons (in part, because of Government programs that encouraged independence among the old). But the distance is often only physical; 70 percent of respondents talked to their mothers at least once a week in one recent survey, for example. And the political interests are often shared.
Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska and a leader in the effort to overhaul benefit programs, describes the attitude of the young toward the elderly this way: "They want them to be secure. They want them to have quality health care. And they don't want them to be dependent on them."
As Mr. Kerrey suggests, there is self-interest at work; curtailing Government benefits for the elderly can translate, quickly and directly, into added burdens -- or at least added worries -- for their families. "Families are already pretty much doing what they can," said Vern L. Bengtson, a gerontologist at the University of Southern California who has studied intergenerational patterns. "Eighty-five percent of all care that is given to dependent older people is from family members."
Mr. Mellman added: "The middle-aged group feels they're part of a sandwich generation. They're caught between parents who need help and kids who need help. They don't want to see programs for either cut."
 
Greedy Geezer? Who Says?
 There are also broader, cultural attitudes that protect the elderly in any struggle over Federal resources. Much of the debate over generational warfare centers on the image of the "greedy geezer," living an affluent lifestyle in some balmy clime, heedless of the generations to come. But Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster who has specialized in Medicare, said this is not the image that emerges from his research with voters.
"When you look at the data about self-described financial security, and who has and does not have money, in the aggregate people over 65 are doing pretty well," Mr. McInturff said. "But the perception in focus groups is that these are people who have paid their dues, paid their taxes, and they're owed. And that they continue to be vulnerable. There is an enormous empathy in this country with wanting to do right by seniors."
All of these attitudes came to bear in the 1995 budget battle, which showed just how subtle and dangerous generational politics can be.
Republicans declared they wanted to balance the budget for the sake of the country's children and grandchildren, warning that deficit spending and out-of-control benefit programs will be crippling to the young. They desperately tried to play down the other part of the generational message: That it was time for old people to sacrifice for the sake of future generations.
 
Political Gains for Democrats
 Republicans took Social Security off the table at the very start, and presented their Medicare restructuring as an attempt to "preserve, protect and improve" the 30-year-old program.
But the interests of the various generations could not be neatly disentangled. Middle-aged parents may have worried about the deficit and its effect on their children, but they also feared what curtailments in Medicare and Medicaid would mean to their parents. The Democrats quickly cast themselves as the guardians of the elderly against a predatory Republican Party, and prospered in the polls with young and old alike.
Pundits and partisans denounced the Democratic campaign as demagogic and argued that Republicans deserved credit for at least tackling the issue of spending on benefit programs. Yet the Republicans' case was weakened because their budget was not a simple intergenerational transfer between the comfortable old and the needy young.
Nor was it simply about insuring the long-term stability of Medicare. Critics argued that the Republican plan would, in fact, curtail many of the existing programs for children and shift new resources, through a tax cut, to the rich.
By year's end, politicians like Mr. Kerrey were still puzzling over how to rally the public on these issues. Because, of course, simple demographics dictate that the issues will not go away. Before the baby boomers begin to hit the retirement rolls in force, most analysts say that Medicare and Social Security will have to be re-examined and, ultimately, substantially restructured.
"I don't think we can afford the contract we now have on the table for the baby boom generation," said Mr. Kerrey, who has proposed legislation that would gradually raise the retirement age to 70 and limit the cost-of-living adjustments. In other words, in the absence of any action, Americans may not be able to avoid an out-and-out generational conflict -- not over their parents and grandparents' benefits, but over their own.
They are hardly in denial about these long-range problems; many are worried that these programs simply won't exist by the time they retire. Mr. Luntz cites a statistic from one of his surveys: 46 percent of 18- to-34-year-olds believe in the existence of U.F.O.'s; only 28 percent believe that Social Security will still be around when they need it.
Yet given Americans' sensitivity to the old, it will require a special kind of politics to carry voters through major changes in these programs, many analysts say. Bipartisanship, of course, always helps. Dividing the nation on generational lines, judging from the evidence so far, will be far less effective in the nation's living rooms than it is in the nation's think tanks.
For all the talk about the fraying of American values, some endure. As former Senator Russell B. Long, Democrat of Louisiana, said 30 years ago, programs like Medicare were created in a powerful and ancient spirit -- the biblical injunction to "honor the face of an old man."

HEADLINE: Buchanan, in Unfamiliar Role, Is Under Fire as a Left-Winger

SERIES: THE CONTENDERS: Sixth article of a series.

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: BATON ROUGE, La.

 BODY:
Those who support Patrick Joseph Buchanan for President find themselves warding off unloved labels these days: "protectionist," "isolationist" and some that are a lot more unexpected.
"I'm no socialist, God knows," said Roy Luxemburg, a former supporter of Ross Perot, explaining that he had nevertheless relished listening to Mr. Buchanan rip into big business during a holiday gathering of Republican voters at an antebellum-style mansion here recently. 
 Something very strange is happening in Republican politics, and Mr. Buchanan's bare-knuckles campaign for the Presidential nomination is at the center of it. Within the party, the debate over economic policy has passed far enough through the looking glass that Mr. Buchanan, whose reviling of liberals built him a career as a Presidential speechwriter and a commentator, has been branded a left-winger by some of his increasingly peeved Republican critics.
To that attack, Mr. Buchanan is unyielding. "The policies I would put into place would attract Democrats and working people by the millions," he said in an interview. "Let me tell you, the group that would be alienated would be some of the financial community and some of the folks heading up the big corporations. They're the people that would be in the back of our bus."
Mr. Buchanan, who as a protest candidate ran unsuccessfully for the 1992 nomination against President George Bush, was expected this time around to vanish in a field jammed with seemingly like-minded conservatives.
Instead, he has mixed his calls for tax cuts and his bedrock social conservatism with a fierce economic nationalism that is rattling not only the Presidential campaign. With his dire warnings of a spreading "new world order," he is widening post-cold-war cracks among Main Street and Wall Street Republicans over foreign and economic policy.
"These fellows are committed to a quasi-religious free-trade ideology that is colliding with reality," Mr. Buchanan said of global-trade advocates, acknowledging that he once shared their view. "What's good for General Motors is not good for America if General Motors has become a transnational corporation that sees its future in low-wage countries and in abandoning its American factories. It's a new world -- a new world economically, a new world in foreign policy."
 
The First Battleground Will Be Louisiana
With his zest for harsh language and a record of infuriating Republican moderates, Mr. Buchanan is still alienating more voters than he is attracting, according to polls. But he has placed second in some polls in New Hampshire and has concocted a message and a strategy, keyed to Louisiana's first-in-the-nation caucuses on Feb. 6, that are causing headaches for his better-organized and better-financed opponents, in particular Senator Phil Gramm.
Mr. Buchanan is betting that a surprisingly strong showing in this economically distressed and increasingly Republican state -- where, he tells voters, he intends to "feed Phil Gramm to the alligators" -- will make him the only viable alternative to the right of the front-runner for the nomination, Senator Bob Dole.
As Mr. Buchanan travels early primary and caucus states like Louisiana, Georgia, Iowa and New Hampshire, he assures voters that Mr. Dole and Mr. Gramm are his friends. Then, ignoring the rest of the field, he proceeds to shred the two Senators with the take-no-prisoners style he honed on the CNN political talk show "Crossfire."
"Bob Dole is our Walter Mondale," Mr. Buchanan told voters in Georgia recently. "He's the weakest front-runner I've seen in a long time."
Although born and reared in Washington, and employed there almost his entire adult life, the 57-year-old Mr. Buchanan mocks Mr. Dole and Mr. Gramm alike as Washington insiders. And, noting his onetime job as "communications director for the Great Communicator," President Ronald Reagan, he offers himself as "the authentic conservative" in the race, planting suspicions that his opponents are closet moderates.
"Pat Buchanan was conservative before Phil Gramm ever said he was conservative, before conservative was cool," said Bryan Joy, a finance major at the University of Georgia who is chairman of that state's College Republicans.
 
The Spoiler of '92 Adds to His Message
Mr. Bush's campaign strategists partly blame Mr. Buchanan for costing them the 1992 election, first by distracting the President in the primaries, then by alienating moderates in rallying the party to a religious and cultural "war" during a prime-time speech at the Republican National Convention.
While he dwells more on economics these days, Mr. Buchanan has not softened his positions or language on social issues. At the Bethel Assembly of God Church in Lafayette, La., recently, he took the stage after a Christmas musical to denounce "the tragedy and atrocity of the systematic slaughter of the life of unborn children across America."
Surrounded by a living Nativity scene -- scores of people dressed as shepherds, wise men or the holy family -- Mr. Buchanan karate-chopped the air with each hand, a trademark gesture, as he mocked bureaucrats "in sandals and beads" at the Department of Education. He accused intellectuals, whom he did not otherwise identify, of replacing the Bible with Playboy magazine in public schools.
"They want the children of America to despise this country's past and its history, the way they despise America's past and its history," he told the crowd of about 1,000, which punctuated his attacks with cries of "Amen, brother!"
"We're going to put back into its rightful place the true God of the Bible," he continued, "and we will drive out of our public institutions the false gods of secular humanism."
He has also repeatedly promised Louisiana voters that he will push the Republican Party to retain its plank opposing abortion and to adopt one against gambling, which he calls "a pact with the Devil."
Mr. Buchanan's language has occasionally landed him in deep trouble over the years: critics from both the left and the right have accused him of anti-Semitism and homophobia. He has repeatedly dimissed the accusations, and his campaign aides say that only a handful of protesters and an occasional reporter have raised the issue this year.
 
Judicial Term Limits And Maybe Trade War
With more time on the trail during this campaign than he spent in 1992, Mr. Buchanan has filled in ideas that he barely touched on then. He would impose term limits on Federal judges, with reconfirmation required of Supreme Court justices every eight years. He would declare a five-year moratorium on all new Federal regulations, while requiring that all existing rules be either formally renewed after five years or dropped. He would also halt legal immigration for five years. And he would require that all federally financed institutions like the Smithsonian "manifest a respect for America's history and values."
Along with cultural war, Mr. Buchanan is now talking trade war. He has seized on his opposition to two accords -- the North American Free Trade Agreement and last year's broadening of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- to woo blue-collar voters who backed Mr. Perot in the 1992 campaign. The agreements are a weapon with which he attacks Mr. Gramm and Mr. Dole, who supported both, on two fronts.
The first is political nationalism. Mr. Buchanan declares that international agreements have resulted in "the continued surrender of American sovereignty to the institutions of what I call the new world order," whose members he has identified at various times as the World Trade Organization, the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations and the United Nations.
The second front is economic nationalism. Mr. Buchanan says the trade agreements are costing jobs. "It is immoral and it is un-American to force American textile workers who make $9 an hour to compete with Chinese workers who make 25 cents an hour," he declared at one rally. "Neither party up there seems to be concerned about the working people."
Mr. Buchanan would impose steep tariffs on some of the nation's biggest trading partners, including Japan, which he accused at a meeting in Georgia of having "targeted American industries as well as they targeted Pearl Harbor."
That message can be jarring to Republicans accustomed to hearing their leaders extol free trade. Indeed, it is perhaps a sign of how unconventional Mr. Buchanan's economic views have become that he felt compelled to declare to a supper club of Rush Limbaugh listeners in Shreveport, La.: "I believe in capitalism."
If so, he nonetheless has fundamental qualms about free markets, misgivings that he acknowledges can be traced to his schooling by Jesuit priests at Gonzaga High School in Washington.
"There's no doubt there is an inherent contradiction between conservatism and unfettered capitalism," he said in the interview. "Conservatives ought to be worshiping at a higher altar than the bottom line on a balance sheet. What in heaven's name is it that we conservatives want to conserve if not social stability and family unity?"
Because of free-trade advocacy, he said, such values "are being thrown up on the altar."
"For what?" he continued. "So that I can get 37 varieties of shirts? I mean, what is it all about?"
It is talk like this that led the conservative Weekly Standard to call Mr. Buchanan "America's last leftist."
"Buchanan has moved to the left of President Clinton," declared the article, by the conservative writer David Frum. "He has turned his back on the fundamental convictions that have defined American conservatism for 40 years."
Mr. Buchanan scoffs, noting that even his campaign opponents have not been defending the trade agreements. "If that's their philosophy, why don't they come out and defend it?" he said. "When you've got somebody who no longer defends his position or articulates it, the high ground's been conceded, and eventually you take it."
Indeed, Kevin Phillips, the publisher of The American Political Report, said that within the Republican Party "we've seen the commitment to free trade unravel."
"People just don't believe that's job-creating anymore," Mr. Phillips said. The party would have moved in such a direction without Mr. Buchanan, he added, but "Pat crystallized it."
Republican analysts say Mr. Buchanan is aiming for three core but sometimes conflicting constituencies: blue-collar voters who supported Mr. Perot, libertarians and social conservatives.
But Mr. Buchanan sees the potential for a much broader coalition, arguing that as many as three-fourths of Republicans would prefer a nominee other than Mr. Dole. The problem is that these dissatisfied voters are divided among several candidates. "Chop-chop-chop-chop-chop," he said. "That vote is chopped up five or six ways, and one of us has got to emerge early if we're going to beat Bob Dole."
That is why Mr. Buchanan has seized on Louisiana. This state stole a march on Iowa earlier this year, switching from a Presidential primary in March to caucuses a week before Iowa's, long the nation's earliest. Under pressure from Iowa Republicans, almost all the candidates promised not to campaign here, where Mr. Gramm, of neighboring Texas, is assumed to have locked up Louisiana's 21 delegates.
But Mr. Buchanan, as he gleefully tells voters here, refused to sign the pledge. And now he has what he thinks his campaign needs to catch fire: a head-to-head matchup with Mr. Gramm. "I can't fight him with eight guys there," he said, but now "we've at least got a place to fight."
Mr. Buchanan has all but ruled out an independent candidacy if he does not win the nomination. "I've always supported the Republican nominee, and I intend to this time," he said. Then he paused, grinned and appended an escape clause: "I intend to be him."

HEADLINE: For Black Women, a Movie Stirs Breathless Excitement

BYLINE: By KAREN De WITT 

 BODY:
"Waiting to Exhale," the movie, is rapidly proving to be "Waiting to Exhale," the event, as African-American women across the country pour into theaters to see the film about the lives of four black professional women.
In a year when events like the O. J. Simpson trial and the Million Man March have focused attention on black men, along comes a movie that centers on black women. The film, the moviegoers say, celebrates the trials and triumphs of black career women -- a much-missed reflection of their lives, their concerns and their desires -- and offers a loving portrait that has nothing to do with racism, interactions with whites, or ghetto life. 
 Groups of women, largely black but including many whites, are buying tickets in blocs and holding sessions to talk about what they have seen. In the theaters, meanwhile, audiences have talked to the screen, with many women shouting "Amen" to the actresses' lines.
"This is our 'Million Man March,' " said Linda Tucker, a speech pathologist at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in Newark. She saw the movie about four contemporary women living in Phoenix last week with a small group and plans a larger outing in the next couple of weeks.
The movie, she added, "is based on a theme around which women can rally and find commonality."
Based on the best-selling novel by Terry McMillan, the 20th Century Fox movie stars Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon and Loretta Devine and is the first feature directed by the actor Forest Whitaker. It opened last weekend as No. 1 one at the box office, grossing more than $14.1 million and was expected to do well again this week. The novel, which made the number three spot on the The New York Times hard-cover bestseller list in 1992, is back this week as number three on the paperback list.
"I thought I'd get five or six women, but each time I'd think I had a final count, someone else would call," said Patricia Wheeler-Holmes, 44, a Howard University adjunct professor who issued an invitation to friends in the Washington area to see the movie together.
"I ended up buying tickets and arranging dinner for 41 women," she said.
In New York, a group of 25 black and Hispanic women, including several wives of New York Knicks players, joined an outing organized by Lisa Nkonoki, president of Nkonoki George Entertainment, and Gayle King, a Hartford, Conn., television personality.
Afterward the group went to Ms. King's house for dinner.
"We ate, talked about relationships and danced just like they did in the movie," said Deborah Williams, wife of the Knicks player Herb Williams. "The movie had a universal theme. It was about friendship and bonding and dealing with relationships."
Even though the movie is about black women, Sheila Harper, wife of point-guard Derek Harper, said: "The issues in the movie went beyond socio-economic status and race."
Tom Sherak, executive vice president for 20th Century Fox distribution, said the movie was drawing audiences that were 70 percent female. "It's attracting women 18 to 65, crossing over, up and down, with 65 percent African-American and 35 percent Caucasian audiences" he said.
"But what is amazing is that we're finding that people are buying blocks of tickets and getting together to talk about the movie," he said.
In Houston, Tony Null, manager of the Meyer Park AMC Theater, said one patron bought the whole theater for one screening, 300 tickets, at full price.
"We're doing phenomenal business," Mr. Null said. "We're selling out every performance every day. That's very unusual."
The story picks up a theme about the strained relations between black men and women that was explored in Alice Walker's 1983 novel, "The Color Purple" and Ntozake Shange's 1975 choreopoem, "For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow is Enuf." But "Waiting" has provoked far less outcry from men than the two earlier works, which were hard-luck tales of women struggling to assert themselves versus the cads who would hold them down.
The witty, solidly middle-class heroines of "Waiting" seem less victims than shrewd professionals who can be faulted almost as much as their men for doing dumb things for love.
From New York to San Francisco, sororities and church groups, social clubs and book clubs, mothers, daughters, siblings and just plain girlfiends have marshalled themselves into groups, crowding urban movie theaters and filling suburban multiplexes, to see what one woman called "the first black-chick flick."
In Oakland, Calif., Tracy Smith and her mother, Joanna Johnson, who own Tente's Hair N' All beauty salon, went to the movie with 16 of the shop's clients.
"We'd talked about the novel in the shop so we just made it a salon outing because everyone wanted to see that movie," Ms. Smith said.
In Fairfax, Va., a dozen members of the alumni chapter of Delta Sigma Theta wore their crimson and cream sorority colors as a show of support for Ms. McMillan, the movie and "a realistic portrayal of African-American women," said Darlene Faltz, the organizer of the outing.
"We stood around afterward outside for a hour talking about it," said Crystal Dozier, 30. "There were little groups all around the theater doing the same thing."
In fact, some see the movie as a counter to the stereotypical portrayal of black women on the screen -- once described by Sheryl Lee Ralph, a black actress, as "the Fat Mama on the Couch syndrome or the Sassy Sister on the Corner syndrome."
In theaters across the country, women have engaged in a call and response with their cinematic girlfriends. When Savannah (Ms. Houston) tells her mother that she does not need a man to complete her life, several in one audience shouted "Amen to that" and "Tell her, girl." Whoops of delight erupted when Bernadine (Ms. Bassett) wreaked incendiary revenge on the belongings of a husband who dumped her for his very blond secretary. Groans ensued when vulnerable Robin (Ms. Rochon) went for the blandishments of yet another loser. And, at one screening, the audience chanted "Go, Glo. Go, Glo. Go, Glo" when zaftig single mother, Gloria (Loretta Devine) found Mr. Right right across the street.
Linda Burstyn, a former "Nightline" producer who is white, said she enjoyed the interplay between the audience and the movie.
"Having been to black churches, I know there is a real participatory culture so that was part of the fun of seeing the movie," said Ms. Burstyn, 33, who was a fan of the novel. "No movie could live up to my expectations, but it was fun to see, especially the parts of the movie that women reacted to strongest, usually where the women dis the men."
Ms. McMillan, who co-wrote the script with Ronald Bass, said: "Women have been hungry to see themselves accurately portrayed -- that's what it boils down to. But in addition to seeing ourselves on the screen, it's also about fun and entertainment."
Entertainment value is what makes movies successes at the box office, and 20th Century Fox is optimistic that "Waiting" will cross over, as did the book, attracting a white audience as well.
Diane Burr, a real estate broker in Washington, who is white and was with Mrs. Wheeler-Holmes' group, said the film appealed to her, particularly Savannah's declaration of independence from her mother's expectations.
"It's so relatable," Ms. Burr said.
The movie is hardly flawless, but many black women excused inconsistencies like Bernadine, who had an M.B.A. and helped her husband start his business but who remained totally ignorant that their holdings were in his name only.
"It was Arizona with lovely ladies in a gorgeous setting," said Emily Bernard, 28, an associate with the Faith Childs Literary Agency in New York. "The audience just left the movie uplifted. It was refreshing. It was not one extreme or the other.
"It was not Spike Lee, where it's racism, racism, racism," Ms. Bernard said.
Black men who have seen the movie in groups found it entertaining even as they criticized it, comparing it most often to Mr. Lee's "She's Gotta Have It."
Antonio Roberson, a graphics designer in Washington, said he found the depiction of some of the male Mr. Wrongs was all too accurate, but laid the blame at the feet of the women as much as the men. Mr. Roberson saw the movie twice with a group of male friends.
"If you're going out with a married man, that's trouble right there," he said. "I liked the movie, but the women's faults are glossed over."
"I went with an open mind," said Joseph Taylor, an architect who was waiting to get his hair cut at the Industrial Barbers Shop in Washington. "I saw men who were foolish and women who were foolish, doing the dating game. And both getting what they deserved. It was a good movie."
After viewing the film, Mrs. Wheeler-Holmes' group went to an early dinner at a nearby restaurant.
"I would have liked to see the growth of the men as you see with the women at the end of the film," said Saundra Barrett, a manager for a technology company.
Her friend, Valetta Evans, a social worker who had traveled from Richmond, agreed, but said: "I'll see it again, buy the video, because it will probably be another 10 years before there's a movie that has this much of a realistic portrayal of African-Americans."
Back at the theater, another screening of "Waiting" was about to let out. Several ushers readying for the crowd were cautioned by another usher to take off one of two buttons he was wearing that advertised the film.
"These women love this movie and they'll take it off you if they see you've got two," he said. "One woman offered me $25 for mine, but I've promised it to my girlfriend."

HEADLINE: Budget Crisis Emptying Idled Workers' Pockets

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: HYATTSVILLE, Md., Dec. 29

 BODY:
 There were fewer gifts under Gloria Miles's Christmas tree this year, and her family did without some of their usual Yuletide treats. Now, Ms. Miles is watching New Year's Day approach with little sense of celebration.
That is when the next mortgage payment on her small, red-brick house is due, and Ms. Miles, one of more than a quarter-million Federal workers who have been furloughed in the partial shutdown of the Government, has not seen a paycheck since Dec. 18 and has no idea when she will get another full one. 
 Her gas and electric bills are due as well, and she does not have the money to pay them either. Unless Ms. Miles, 48, is paid soon she also will not have enough in her account to cover checks already sent to pay the telephone bill, credit cards and the tuition for her grandson's martial arts school.
"They're going to bounce," she said, sitting on her living room sofa this week, while her other grandson, James, 5, played with a Spiderman toy. "Insufficient funds."
Congressional leaders have promised that workers will be compensated for their time off. But that pledge does not make up for the cash crunch many are facing.
To many in the country, the wrangling between the Democratic President and the Republican-controlled Congress that produced the partial closure of the Government may seem like a great ideological debate. To others it is political theater. But for furloughed workers like Ms. Miles, it is more tangible and has more immediate consequences.
"I'm a real person with a real situation and this is not a stage," she said, her airy voice belying her anger and frustration. "There is no curtain going up or standing ovation at the end. This is our livelihood. This is something that can be very stressful."
Even at agencies that have been closed, many of the higher-level, and higher-paid, employees have continued to work as emergency employees. The brunt of the two shutdowns is falling on those who can least afford it.
Ms. Miles is particularly incensed by reports that members of Congress, who have continued to be paid, are taking at least 25 foreign trips in the next three weeks.
"This is ludicrous and self-centered," she said. "I can't believe it. While we're sitting back here, stressed out, wondering where our next paycheck is coming from and how we're going to pay the bills, they have the unmitigated gall to want to get out and take a trip to other countries?"
When the Government was first shut down for four days in November, many Federal workers took their unplanned paid days off with nonchalance. But now, as the second shutdown heads into its second week, the mood among many Federal workers has shifted to worry over finances, anger at being made pawns in a political struggle and anxiety about what it all bodes for the future of the Federal work force.
Some fear that the shutdown is a prologue to large-scale layoffs. Others have begun to question their commitment to Government jobs, once considered some of the most secure in the country, and their own self-worth.
"Washington is a city dominated by workaholics," said the Rev. Amitiyah Elayne Hyman, a minister at the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church, which has been providing counseling and referrals to laid-off Federal workers. "So to furlough people is a threat to the core of how they see themselves as beings."
The paycheck Ms. Miles is expecting on Tuesday will cover the week before the shutdown, for which she will be paid, as well as the first week of the shutdown, for which she will not. But because the Government's payroll machinery is geared to two-week paychecks and cannot easily be altered, her regular deductions will be subtracted. She's not sure quite how much will be left, but does not expect that it will be much.
There are already signs that the financial woes of many more Federal workers are intensifying.
Today, officials of the Federal Employee Education and Assistance Fund, a private charity that helps Government workers in emergencies, said the fund was about to run out of money. The fund, which is financed by contributions from Federal workers, has a cash reserve of about $100,000. But it has been overwhelmed by demands for low-interest loans.
For Ms. Miles, life in normal times is already one of a precarious financial balance.
She declined to reveal her salary, but as a document control technician for the Federal Communications Commission in Washington with a GS-7 Civil Service classification she earns $24,441 to $31,770 a year. But she is the primary breadwinner in a household that has seen its share of struggles over the years.
She shares her home, in this suburb just northeast of Washington, with a daughter, Charnika, 26, a single mother, who was laid off last year from her job with a local bank and is now working part time as a nurse's assistant in a nursing home. Also living there is Ms. Miles daughter-in-law Rowena, 26, who was also laid off from her job at United Parcel Service and is attending cosmetology school. The household includes Charnika's son, Jerrell, 9 and Rowena's little boy, James, 5.
Charnika kicks in part of her salary and Rowena's ex-husband pays child support. But without Ms. Miles's paycheck, the family's delicately balanced house of financial cards is in danger of toppling. "I operate from paycheck to paycheck," she said. "There is no savings account to supplement my check. I don't get a check, I can't operate."
Coping in the short term has meant scaling back in Christmas giving. Ms. Miles bought presents for only her two grandsons, and even they did not get much. She bought the two boys a keyboard for the computer they share. She gave Jerrell a Monopoly game, a stretch toy and a basketball and James a puzzle and the Spiderman toy.
And while other relatives including the boy's mothers gave them a few clothes and other gifts, the space under the tree seemed empty. Ms. Miles even dug out a game, Operation, that she gave the boys last year but that they did not really use, and placed it under the tree to make the pile of presents look higher.
Beyond getting through the Christmas season, though, Ms. Miles's plans are less formed. "I guess, number one, I'll make contact with all my creditors and let them know what's going on," she said. "I'll probably apply for unemployment."
She paused and thought, but could not come up with any other way of getting through her predicament.
"I've just not got beyond that," she said, "because I'm hoping it doesn't come to that."

HEADLINE: Bare Pantries In New York, As Cuts Loom

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

 BODY:
The demand for free food at soup kitchens and food pantries across New York City has surged in the last year, forcing centers to turn away the hungry even as proposed cuts in Federal and state aid further threaten the insufficient supplies.
The independent food bank that supplies the city has faced an escalating demand for emergency food since the middle of 1994, supplying 28 percent more food to the 789 city pantries, kitchens and shelters, food bank officials say. 
 But that has not been enough. The pantries and soup kitchens have been turning away tens of thousands of hungry people a month, local and national surveys show.
And, if budgets under consideration in Washington and Albany are approved, local food agencies expect to lose a quarter of their Federal money and about 40 percent of their state money. This would force many programs to shrink and some smaller ones to consider closing.
"Bottom line, it means that people are going to go hungry and there's a tremendous indifference to all of this," said Judith Walker, executive director of the New York City Coalition Against Hunger, an advocacy group that is to meet next week with representatives of the city's emergency food providers.
Across the nation, in places like Trenton, Denver and San Francisco, officials are reporting increases in the demand for free food. According to a national survey of 29 cities released by the United States Conference of Mayors this month, requests for emergency meals increased by an average of 9 percent between 1994 and 1995, with the biggest growth centered in urban communities.
New York City was not surveyed in the most recent study. But the previous Conference of Mayors report showed that the city's demand for emergency meals jumped by 42 percent between 1993 and 1994, the largest increase reported in the country. And experts say it continues to grow here as elsewhere, fueled by continuing unemployment, homelessness, shrinking welfare checks and cutbacks in government assistance.
"If you are cutting back on general assistance and other welfare programs, you're going to see an increased use of soup kitchens," said Douglas Besharov, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington research organization.
In communities with healthy economies, Mr. Besharov said, some of those people would find jobs. But in places like New York, where people continue to apply for food stamps in growing numbers, soup kitchens are likely to face heavier demand.
Emergency food providers across the city say they are already feeling the pinch.
In Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, the St. John's Bread and Life soup kitchen says it now serves 1,100 people a day, 15 percent more than eight months ago. In West Harlem, the Community Kitchen says it serves about 650 meals a day, a 23 percent increase over the same time period. In Manhattan, God's Love We Deliver says it serves 950 meals a day, 36 percent more than in September.
And surveys conducted by the Conference of Mayors and local advocacy groups report that anywhere from 33,000 to 50,000 people are turned away from New York City soup kitchens and free food outlets each month.
"We might have to turn away people too," said Hossein Saadat, executive director of St. John's Bread and Life, describing the possible consequences of government cuts in both welfare and food programs. "That's the fear we have."
The soup kitchens, which rely on government funds and private contributions, order supplies almost exclusively from the Food for Survival food bank in Hunts Point, the Bronx, whose sources are Federal and corporate. They receive some food free; the rest they buy wholesale. Their clients include homeless people, the elderly and single parents with children, who wait in line for hot meals at soup kitchens or groceries at food pantries.
This year, New York's agencies served about 90,000 meals a day, and some 30,000 of them went to children.
"Mama doesn't have any food," explained 8-year-old Rachel Goodson, as she tasted vegetable soup at the Love Gospel Assembly soup kitchen in the Bronx.
The family's food ran out last Saturday, and now, she said, only a bag of sugar sits in the refrigerator.
"This is life, honey," said her 38-year-old mother, Theresa, who supports her two daughters with $686 a month in welfare and food stamps. "A week before our checks come, we're broke. I got no food at all."
"This place," she added, "the kids love it, I love it." Ms. Goodson comes often to eat the free lunch and to read the Bible verses on the walls. "It's the closest I can get to God right now. Once you walk out of the building it's all over. Nobody cares. Nobody's trying to help you."
Government officials say that funding cuts to these programs are painful but inevitable in an era when state and Federal politicians are struggling to balance their budgets.
Lynne Lemmer, controller of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's emergency food program, said: "Last year, Congress authorized a $130 million award. This year it's $100 million. We're just passing the cuts along."
That means New York City will most likely receive $3.6 million in 1996, she said, 26 percent less than this year. And the city's share of another Federal program, the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program, is expected to shrink by 9 percent.
"They'll just have to gear back what they're doing," Ms. Lemmer said. "They just won't service as many people."
Advocates for the hungry say that the state budget proposed by Governor George E. Pataki would hit the city's agencies even harder. Last year, the budget allocated $10.8 million to the state food programs. This year, it allocates $6.3 million.
The change would mean a 41 percent decrease in New York City's share of the funds, advocates say, leaving soup kitchens with $3.15 million, which they say is far too little to feed the hungry.
A spokesman for the State Department of Health, which administers the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, said those numbers may change.
"Over the next couple of weeks, we have to figure out exactly what is needed," said Claudia Hutton, the department spokeswoman, who emphasized that the Governor does not want to hurt the food programs.
"If it turns out that our more recent data on expenditure patterns show that the number allocated is too low to maintain services," she said, "we'll make an amendment."
The proposed state budget would also turn over the nutrition program's money -- regardless of the amount -- to a general assistance fund to be administered by the Department of Social Services. That department would then distribute the funds in the form of block grants to the various counties around the state, for them to support their indigent communities as they see fit. The money would no longer be solely earmarked for food.
"By creating these block grants," Miss Hutton said, "the counties will be able to design programs that meet the needs of their population as opposed to the old cookie-cutter approach from Albany."
But advocates worry that the money will disappear and that private donations will not fill the gap.
"No white knights are coming through, riding on horses from major charities to give us that money for these people," said Liz Krueger, associate director of the Community Food Resource Center, which runs the Community Kitchen of West Harlem.
"We've been lucky enough to meet the needs of people who come to us," she said. "If all the cuts are approved, we will have to decrease the number of people we serve, and conceivably the number of days a week we're open. I don't believe we would close, but we would shrink."

HEADLINE: California Begins Easing Its Once-Strict Laws on Rent Control

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: SANTA MONICA, Calif., Dec. 30

 BODY:
 New Year's Day will bring a loosening of rent control in this bayside city and four other California cities, under a state law that takes effect on Monday.
Santa Monica, whose nearly 90,000 residents are nearly 80 percent renters, has offered cheap apartments with cool breezes and ocean views since voters approved a 1979 ordinance that controlled the rents of 31,600 apartments here. 
 Under this ordinance -- one of the strictest in the nation -- Santa Monica landlords could raise rents only once a year, and then at by only about half the inflation rate. This meant, landlords complained, that they were not getting a fair profit.
Under the new law, which also affects Berkeley, Cotati, East Palo Alto and West Hollywood, landlords will be able to raise rents on new tenants by 15 percent. Although landlords can take this increase only twice during the next three years, beginning in 1999 they can raise rents on vacant units to whatever the market will bear.
"We didn't want Santa Monica to be a rich, yuppie city; we wanted diversity," lamented Nancy Greenstein, who heads Santa Monicans for Renters Rights, a tenant advocacy group that has made rent control the core of local politics by backing candidates who support it. "It doesn't seem right that representatives from the rest of the state can take it away from us."
The California law is the latest in a series adopted by state legislatures that weaken or eliminate rent control. In recent years, the New York Legislature has eliminated rent regulation of vacant apartments that would rent for more than $2,000 a month and on occupied apartments that rent for more than $2,000 and whose tenants earned more than $250,000 in the previous two years. Moreover, an advisory panel last year recommended to Gov. George E. Pataki that rent regulation be phased out completely.
Only California, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and the District of Columbia retain some form of rent control, although Massachusetts will phase out all rent controls by the end of next year.
Joan McDowell, who lives in a $450-a-month, one-bedroom apartment just two blocks from the beach in Santa Monica, says rent control enabled her to stay in the Los Angeles area, where she has lived for most of her 67 years. "I never thought I could continue to live in Southern California because the cost of living was so high and I had to live on my retirement income," she said.
While landlords and tenant advocates rarely agree, they both say that Santa Monica apartments rent for $200 to $500 less than they would without rent control.
But landlords have long argued that rent control benefits upper-income renters, rather than those who need it, and discourages maintenance and new construction because of limited rental profits.
Supporting that contention, Moody's Investors Service recently raised Santa Monica's bond rating, predicting that the new law would lead to "significant new investment in the city's rental housing stock."
John M. Rodriguez, a landlord and vocal critic of rent control, says the new law will bring additional revenue for landlords, more construction and maintenance jobs for local residents, and more taxes for state and Federal coffers. Under rent control, he said, "We all lose."
State Senator Thomas E. Hayden, who represents Santa Monica and was propelled into the Legislature by the coalition of voters who supported rent control, says liberals failed to mount an aggressive campaign to preserve it. Liberal Democrats, he said, have become "less interested in bread-and-butter issues."

HEADLINE: Ellis Island May Have Been Made for You and Me, but Who Owns It?

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

 BODY:
Judith T. Kramer has a lot of dirt on her mind these days. So does Joseph L. Yannotti.
They are both lawyers, and they are girding for the New Jersey-versus-New York showdown before the United States Supreme Court for control over the dirt in question -- Ellis Island. 
 The Supreme Court decision that emerges from the hearings and legal maneuvering over the next five months should finally put to rest about 200 years of sparring between the states over the island. In the tart haggling over what evidence is admissible and what is not, who is an expert and who a flimflam artist, it seems that the legal stampede for historical evidence has kicked up enough documents to create another island.
The dispute actually swirls around the title to the landfill portions of the island, or roughly 24 of the total 27.5 acres. (New Jersey accepts that the original chunk used to buttress various pieces of landfill, sometimes referred to in court documents as "prototypical Ellis Island," belongs to New York.)
Although the antagonists are marshaling obscure annals of history, law, immigration, geography, tidal flows and marine biology in their arguments, the basic fight boils down to who has the right to tax tourists.
New York, resting its case largely on longstanding historical ties between New York City and the island, has dredged up just about any agency or resident ever linked to the place. The varied players include the New York State Board of Lunacy, the poet Walt Whitman, the anarchist Emma Goldman and a man who appears to be one of the first serial killers executed by the state.
"What are we supposed to do -- carve up the island and free-float the bits?" rumbled Ms. Kramer, a New York assistant attorney general, occasionally glancing out her Manhattan office window at the island as if seeking reassurance that it was all still there. "They are creeping up. What more do they want? Next they'll want the Empire State Building. They can't have it."
New Jersey's case is grounded more on the intent of the initial effort to resolve its unhappiness with colonial charters. These set the border between the states on its bank of the Hudson River. An earlier unresolved Supreme Court case prompted an 1834 agreement to redraw the border line down the middle of the Hudson River. But New York retained jurisdiction over Ellis Island even though it was west of the line, while New Jersey got the underwater rights.
"We consider the filled portion of Ellis Island part of New Jersey," said Mr. Yannotti, a New Jersey assistant attorney general, "and we want that to be established."
The Federal Government took possession of Ellis Island for the famous immigration processing center built in the 1890's and started a massive landfill in the early 1900's to create an area for a hospital. At the time, New Jersey demanded that its stake be recognized; the Government paid it $1,000 for the right to complete that landfill, which constitutes the southern portion of the U-shaped island.
The question now is which state gets to exercise administrative and political jurisdiction over the various landfill bits. At present, New York gets all of the tax revenue, as well as almost exclusive use of the main symbol of the American immigration experience.
The sales tax from food and souvenirs amounted to $430,000 last year, said Richard Wells, a Federal parks official on Ellis Island. Court documents indicate that in 1993, employees paid $1.2 million in income taxes; New York has also collected tens of thousands of dollars in corporate franchise taxes for construction.
The sums at issue now are relatively small. (If New Jersey won, for example, it could claim only the sales tax from cash registers believed sitting on landfill.) But New Jersey wants to stake a claim to future economic benefit if long-postponed restoration plans lead to a hotel or convention center on the island. Winning would also strengthen New Jersey's hand in trying get a pedestrian bridge built, thereby siphoning off a larger share of the three million annual visitors to Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty.
The Supreme Court, mandated to settle territorial disputes between states, appointed a law professor, Paul R. Verkuil, to make a recommendation in the case. Hearings are to start May 6 on the island itself. They were initially set for November, but were postponed largely because of the Alpine proportions of the documents.
The teams pawed through thousands of pages of old deeds and maps and lists in the National Archives, The New-York Historical Society, The New York Public Library, and the New Jersey Historical Society, plus at least half a dozen university collections.
"None of the participants are around anymore," Mr. Yannotti said, "so essentially this whole story is going to be told through the documents."
Interested in royalty? Read the June 24, 1664, charter from the Duke of York granting what is now New Jersey (sans islands) to two men, Lord Berkeley and Sir George Carter. Like maps? Pore over dozens, including the 1776 Ratzer Map published in London showing the islands within New York's boundaries or the early 20th century maps from the U.S. Department of War titled "Ellis Island, N.J."
No agency is too obscure, no detail too small.
New York's evidence includes excerpts from the Walt Whitman poem "Mannahatta": "The flowing sea -- currents, the little islands, larger adjoining islands,/ the heights, the villas,/The countless masts . . . City nested in bays! my city." Supposedly further buttressing New York's claim is that it used Ellis Island to hang a felon named Charles Gibbs after a life of pirate crime that included 100 murders.
Marriage licenses, death certificates, psychiatric exams, voting rolls -- even the view is part of the fight. New York argues that incoming immigrants stared almost exclusively toward its skyline. "Those looking at New Jersey were few and far between," its court papers say. And those being booted out via the island, like Emma Goldman, tried to block their expulsion through Federal District Court in Manhattan.
The basic documents from New Jersey fill twin binders, each as thick as the combined Manhattan yellow and white pages. A United States Government letter dated May 17, 1808, that was extracted from the archives at the Ruth Lilly Medical Library at Indiana University ridicules the idea of paying $10,000 for an island worth $4,500 at most. Pages and pages detail a decision during the Depression to hire bricklayers and other laborers from New Jersey for work on the island. And when anyone died, the undertaker came from New Jersey.
New Jersey is a little bit secretive about its case, agreeing to detail only a few greatest hits in its evidence and barring a reporter from listening to the cross-examination of the 10 expert witnesses. New Jersey is also a little bit dismissive about all the New York documents.
The lawyers often played counterintelligence games in the archives, scouring lists to see where their opponents searched and then digging through the same boxes.
Ms. Kramer went so far as to try to prove that the actual dirt in the landfill was part of New York City, excavated during the construction of the subway system. She could find no proof for what seems to be a long-cherished piece of urban folklore. The lone reference she uncovered was a speech by a Federal official poetically describing the landfill as ballast from the ships of many nations.
"What bunk!" Ms. Kramer said. "What bunk! He makes this speech like it is mud from France and mud from Italy and lava from Mount Vesuvius and I don't know where."

HEADLINE: Times Change. Times Square, Too.

 BODY:
The ball that drops above Times Square at midnight to mark the New Year will be sparkling new for this occasion. Down below, America's best-known intersection is undergoing a renewal of its own, from run-down seedy to modern glitz.
Mayors and urban esthetes have yearned for years to spruce up the area -- where Broadway intersects with Seventh Avenue in mid-Manhattan -- but only now is the transformation visible to the naked eye. Some people, no doubt, regret the passing of the tawdriness and sleaze, but even those elements survive in limited quantity. More people will be attracted to the brighter lights, bigger spectacles and cleaner, safer streets. 
 New Year's Eve is a key moment. Weather permitting, or even if it is forbidding, upward of a quarter-million people typically jam the blocks north of 43d Street to watch a lighted ball slide down a pole on the roof of No. 1 Times Square. One-quarter of them will hail from foreign lands, such is the lure of New Year's Eve in Times Square, and millions of would-bes will watch on TV.
The ball belongs to the building, but the 90-year-old midnight ritual is now in the hands of the Times Square Business Improvement District, a neighborhood coalition of businesses -- including this newspaper -- and real estate interests. This year the ball will glitter and gleam as never before.
The principal forces behind the Times Square upgrade are the state and city governments, the Times Square B.I.D. and a burst of new enterprises. The newcomers are as small as a candy store, as big as Walt Disney and as theme-driven as the Official All Star Cafe, a big sports restaurant and gift shop that opened just before Christmas.
 Alas, there are some obstacles to ideal development, among them the 50-year-old armed forces recruiting office -- an eyesore that squats on an island in the middle of the square. The Pentagon plans a new, livelier design. Better it should yield the site entirely and unclog the square.
The New York Convention and Visitors Bureau is planning a new tourist information center that will clog the same island. It will be so small -- 1,000 square feet -- that any visitor might well ask why the self-styled "capital of the world" cannot do better. It can and should, by arranging for a bigger space alongside, not in the middle of, the square. That requires more money, either from City Hall or private contributors. The city gives the bureau only $3 million a year, a paltry contribution for an economic sector that generates billions for business and hundreds of millions in taxes.
The need in Times Square is clear. The interested parties, including City Hall, should join in planning what should be where, rather than making decisions piecemeal. Open space among the skyscrapers is too precious to be cluttered with kiosks.
The new Times Square is not the old one that lives in memory, and never will be. The new showiness will inevitably drive up rents and drive out some good neighbors along with the crummy ones. But any urban conversion as massive as this one is bound to be imperfect. The city, the state, the private developers and the businesses and theaters in the neighborhood must take care to see that the essential excitement is not dimmed and, above all, that Times Square is a welcoming place.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
14 Big Macs Later . . .

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
This ends my first year as foreign affairs columnist, a wonderful job for which The New York Times actually pays me to be a tourist with an attitude. Reflecting on this past year (during which I ate McDonald's in 14 different countries and can report that they all REALLY DO taste the same), I have a few impressions:
Free trade and an integrated global market are inevitable, but they spread their blessings unevenly: When I was last in Mexico City, I kept seeing a man and his two children dressed in clown outfits, entertaining motorists at a stoplight and begging for handouts. I wondered: What could be more degrading? That man represents for me all of the "left-behinds" -- all those who have not shared in the benefits of the global marketplace. 
 The brutal global competition for investment dollars and trade is forcing companies and workers to tighten their budgets and constantly upgrade their skills in order to compete. Those who have the savvy to keep up are thriving; those who don't are panhandling at stoplights. Unfortunately, this same global competition is also forcing governments to downsize, and they are doing it by shredding their social safety nets and junking their welfare programs. So the left-behinds are left in free fall.
The political resurgence of the Communists in Russia and Poland, the Welfare Party in Turkey, the unions in France, the unemployed in China, are all signs that the left-behinds are starting to challenge the winners. In other words, now that the free market is triumphing on a global basis, the most interesting conflicts are between the winners and losers within countries. It is these internal battles that will increasingly shape international affairs.
Never trust a country with high walls and tinted windows: One of the most striking things about Mexico and Haiti is how the wealthy live behind high walls with tinted windows. What those walls and windows say is not only "Keep Out." They say, "I don't care about you on the other side." That absence of a sense of community, that absence of a sense that we are all in this together, is going to seriously inhibit these states from developing into stable democracies -- particularly as economic forces widen the gap between their winners and losers.
Democracy is great, but trees are better: Haitians are so poor they chopped down most of their forests for firewood. This resulted in massive land erosion, which filled the Haitian coastline with silt and ruined the fishing. Treeless, the Haitian mountainsides heated up more quickly and that altered the weather. Rainfall patterns changed and rivers dried up.
During the recent Haitian elections, I watched a Haitian man slaughtering a pig outside a voting booth. He wasn't the least bit interested in voting. He was interested in selling his pig. It's great that the U.S. is promoting elections in Haiti, Bosnia and Gaza, but what these people need just as badly are pigs to slaughter and trees to plant. If we don't invest in their economic development, these new democracies will erode as fast as a Haitian hillside.
No country heals in a year: During the cold war Americans were ready to sacrifice for foreign policy because its aim was fighting Communism, which was both a vital interest and an idealistic cause. Increasingly, though, U.S. foreign policy has focused on healing failed states -- Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Mexico -- where we have some important interests, but where we are driven more by an idealistic impulse to help others in distress at a time when America alone has the power to make a difference.
To sell this new mix of realism and idealism to an ambivalent U.S. public, the Administration has said it would only send some soldiers or some money for a year or so, to give these states a chance to straighten themselves out. Then the U.S. will leave -- whether they succeed or not. That approach was easy in far-away Somalia. But Haiti, Bosnia and Mexico are different. You can't just give them the old college try and walk away: Haitians can sail to Florida, Mexico owes us $12.5 billion and Bosnia is now a huge NATO issue. In 1996 Americans will discover that 12 months isn't enough time to make a lasting difference in these ailing countries, but walking away isn't an option either. That's why how to help these countries over the long term, at a price the U.S. public will tolerate, will be the next big U.S. foreign policy debate.

A Big Purple Haze Covers Hollywood

BYLINE: By TOM FRIEND 

DATELINE: PASADENA, Calif., Dec. 30

 BODY:
They have sportcoats, E-mail and no suntan. Northwestern will not be playing its look-alike in the Rose Bowl; Harvard isn't eligible.
The Wildcats are here for the first time in a half-century, thanks to either running back Darnell Autry or their longtime alum, Moses. A year ago this week, one of their leading tacklers was giving Penn State a Disneyland tour; a year ago this week, the school had only a top 5 ranking in theater and communications; a year ago this week, the city of Beverly Hills was not painted purple. 
 "A year ago, we'd take a lot of back-handed slaps," said the junior defensive end Casey Dailey. "Like, 'Northwestern -- by the national anthem, they're already down two touchdowns.'
"Of course, now I hear they're calling this Rose Bowl, 'Revenge of the Nerds.' "
Alumni are not only coming out of the woodwork for Monday's game against Southern California, they are coming out of Mount Sinai. Charlton Heston, the star of "The Ten Commandments" who spent two years at Northwestern before enlisting in the armed forces in World War II, parted the Red Sea again Thursday, especially for the team.
The Northwestern players were touring Universal Studios that day, found their tram stranded in front of a man-made lake and heard a voluminous voice.
"Fear not, old Wildcats!"
Heston appeared, once again portraying Moses, and actually carrying the original staff from the movie. "Let my Wildcats go," he said, and, on cue, the lake parted (Universal does this five times a day) and turned purple.
The actor subsequently presented Coach Gary Barnett with a stone tablet, inscribed with a play from scrimmage and a commandment.
"Thou shall not lose," Heston told him.
"I should bring this to practice," the coach answered.
Heston, later mobbed by reporters, revealed he had not seen a Northwestern game in person since Otto Graham was the quarterback and was even posed a question as Moses.
"If God can help Northwestern win," Heston was asked, "can he make Nebraska and Florida tie?"
Actually, there is an overtime provision for this year's bowl games. But the Northwestern players were amused, although, by now, they already knew they were Hollywood's team. The city of Beverly Hills had earlier organized a Northwestern Day, and, it turns out, half of the Screen Actors Guild seems to have a tie to Evanston. For instance, David Schwimmer, an alum and star of the sitcom "Friends," attended a Rose Bowl practice, and Cindy Crawford, the model, was featured on a team highlight film.
"On tape, she wished us, 'Good luck,' " Dailey said. "Seriously, she went to Northwestern for a while. I think she took one econ course and decided enough was enough. She figured out supply and demand and bailed. I mean, she realized her earning potential at Northwestern didn't compare to being a supermodel. I'd be gone, too."
The team, meanwhile, has persistently treated Dailey as a tour guide because he is one of their few native Californians. Last December, in fact, he was working part time at Disneyland when Penn State arrived there for its Rose Bowl festivities.
"I was dressed up like Indiana Jones," Dailey said. "Um, I didn't exactly make it known I played for Northwestern."
Other than two-a-day practices here, the team has been preoccupied mostly with eating and O. J. Simpson.
They attended the 40th annual Beef Bowl at Lawry's Prime Rib restaurant, where they outate and outdressed U.S.C.
"I must say," said the restaurant executive Richard Frank, "I don't think I saw one suit and tie on any of U.S.C.'s players."
The team was also fascinated to know that Marcia Clark, the prosecutor in the Simpson case, used to be a Lawry's waitress. Half of them, earlier in the week, had already stopped by the Simpson crime scene on Bundy Drive and by Simpson's home in Brentwood.
Because it is semester break, no one brought any books -- not even the team academic, Ryan Padgett. The players unanimously voted the senior guard as most likely to be a brain surgeon, and Padgett does not dispute them.
"They think that because I don't go out with them at night most of the time," Padgett said. "Because I don't play Sega 24 hours a day with them."
But every team member is definitely computer-fluent -- or else.
"Are you kidding me?" outside linebacker Geoff Shein said. "At Northwestern, if you don't have E-mail, you might as well not go there. They won't even admit you."
Which is why when they were on the road this season, Michigan fans suggested they accept a bid to the Brain Bowl.
"I'd rather be called brain than hooligan or convict," linebacker Pat Fitzgerald said.
Nevertheless, they are 10-1, ranked No. 3 nationally and still underdogs to an underachieving 8-2-1 U.S.C. team. They own road victories over Notre Dame and Michigan, but the miracle label apparently cannot be removed without surgery.
"You know," Barnett said, "they gave us a T-shirt that said, 'Do you believe in miracles?', and it had 'Notre Dame 15, Northwestern 17' on it. Well, we immediately took those shirts and put, 'This was no miracle' on the back. That's how we feel."
On the other hand, since Moses is already here and has a front-row seat, the players do have a simple request.
"Think he can part the U.S.C. defense, too?" Dailey said.

Yanks Give Rogers Rich Deal For 4 Years

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Evidently opting for age over economics, the Yankees yesterday added Kenny Rogers to their starting pitching rotation in an attempt to keep pace with the busily building Baltimore Orioles.
The Yankees announced no terms, but they are believed to have given Rogers a package in the neighborhood of $19.5 million for four years plus an option for a fifth year. 
 The fifth year will become guaranteed, it was believed, for $5.5 million if Rogers pitches 200 innings in the fourth year. That's the type of formula the Yankees put in David Cone's $19.5 contract for a fourth year, and that's the provision the free agent Rogers had sought from his previous employer, the Texas Rangers.
In reaching agreement with the 31-year-old left-hander, the Yankees eschewed the opportunity to sign another free agent left-hander, Chuck Finley. Finley would have cost less, $14 million for three years, but he is two years older than Rogers.
"I was flopping back and forth," Manager Joe Torre said in a telephone interview when asked why the Yankees chose Rogers over Finley. "I had plus things on both sides. There was two years age-wise but leadership qualities on the other side. A guy like Rogers has a lot of weapons to go after you with. Chuck has been a mainstay on that staff, a grinder. It was a tough call."
Rogers immediately becomes the No. 2 starter in Torre's rotation behind Cone. Andy Pettitte, Dwight Gooden and Scott Kamieniecki will be the other starters, with Jimmy Key and Melido Perez looking for spots when they prove themselves fully recovered from injuries.
George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, set out determinedly to get another pitcher after the Orioles snatched David Wells, whom he wanted, in a trade with the Cincinnati Reds last week.
Negotiating with Rogers's agent, Scott Boras, Steinbrenner, according to a member of his cadre of advisers, quickly offered four years, a term Boras had been seeking in an era when few clubs will give a pitcher four years, let alone a reachable five.
Eighteen other starting pitchers have signed new contracts as free agents, and none gained more than three years. It was questionable that anyone else would have given Rogers four years.
The Rangers, for whom Rogers has played his entire seven-year career, offered four years and $17.5 million earlier this month, but Rogers and Boras rejected it, countering with a request for $19.25 million for four years plus an option for a fifth year that would vest for $5.5 million at 200 innings pitched in the fourth year.
According to the Steinbrenner adviser, the owner made a mistake offering four years so quickly, but he certainly caught the attention of the pitcher and the agent, who spent three days in Tampa, Fla., while they hammered out the deal.
The adviser said negotiations with Boras became tense at one point and threatened to break down.
Finley and his agent, Randy Hendricks, also met with Steinbrenner but left Tampa on Friday night. At the time Hendricks left, he had apparently not been told that the Yankees had made their choice. Later in the evening, Boras said the Yankees told him they no longer were negotiating for Finley.
Hendricks did not return telephone calls seeking comment on the talks or the Yankees' decision. Steinbrenner and General Manager Bob Watson also did not return calls.
Just before leaving Tampa to return home yesterday morning, Boras acknowledged the two sides had a "central theme worked out" but said some issues remained to be resolved. He said they probably wouldn't talk again until Tuesday or Wednesday.
One of the matters that remained or was the last item worked out was the deferral of part of Rogers's salary in the first couple of years of the contract.
Rogers was basically a relief pitcher for most of his seven years in the minor leagues and his first four years in the majors. But he became a full-time starter in 1993 and has compiled a 44-25 record and 3.95 earned run average in his three years in that role.
Last season, he had a 17-7 record and a 3.38 e.r.a., fifth lowest in the American League and his first sub-4.00 e.r.a. as a starter.

Budget? What Yankees Budget?

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Damn the payroll, full speed ahead.
Taking a cue from Admiral David Glasgow Farragut, who was associated with ships about 100 years before he was, George Steinbrenner sent that signal late last week as he took off in full-blown, high-speed pursuit of a free agent left-handed pitcher. 
So what if signing Kenny Rogers will cost $5 million a year or close to it? If that's what it would take to keep up with the Angeloses and the Gillicks, so be it.
Payroll, after all, is in the pocketbook of the spender. The owner or general manager who says his team can't afford this player or that most often means he doesn't want to spend that kind of money.
A few weeks ago, Bob Watson, the Yankees' general manager, said the club didn't have enough money to sign both David Cone and Jack McDowell. A flurry of Baltimore Orioles moves later, the Yankees have enough money to sign Cone and Rogers.
The other day, when the Yankees announced the acquisition of Tim Raines, Watson was asked if he had reached his budget. "I'm close," he said. Evidently, he was speaking in relative terms. Moreover, he never has said what his budget is. The Yankees apparently have enough room in the budget for another $5 million pitcher.
That's why, when he was asked if the Yankees would seek another starting pitcher, Watson could say, "If it makes good baseball sense, good economic sense, I'll listen." And when he was asked if the Yankees would pursue another free agent pitcher, he could say, "I won't rule out anything."
When Watson was answering those questions, Steinbrenner already had met with Rogers and his agent, Scott Boras, in the Yankees' winter headquarters in Tampa, Fla. General George Washington at Valley Forge; General George Steinbrenner in Tampa. Admiral Farragut at Mobile Bay; Admiral Steinbrenner in Tampa.
Last season, the Yankees had a baseball-record $55 million payroll. Realistically, it was $6 million less because Cone's two months cost the club only about $2 million, not the $8 million that was attributed to the Yankees under the method used by the clubs and the Players Association to compute payrolls.
The 1996 payroll has reached $37 million for 14 players, including Jimmy Key, whom the Yankees expect to be on the disabled list at the start of the season. The five players eligible for salary arbitration are expected to emerge with salaries totaling $8 million to $9 million, raising the total to about $46 million for 19 players.
Throw in $1 million or slightly more for six younger players, like Andy Pettitte and Derek Jeter, add $5 million or so for Rogers, and the payroll, without bonuses earned during the season, will be about $52 million, or $3 million more than the end of the season payroll less the inflated Cone charge.
"We had the highest payroll in baseball and lost a lot of money," Steinbrenner said earlier this month. "That's O.K., but you don't want to keep doing it forever."
The owner's all-out effort to add a pitcher surprises no one; executives from other clubs predicted it as soon as the Orioles beat the Yankees to David Wells last Tuesday. But the puzzling part of the Yankees' off-season pitching plans is the way they shunned McDowell.
"This one was a decision made by the baseball people," Steinbrenner said. "The business side entered into it some."
The Yankees, according to a club official, didn't want to offer McDowell more than one year because they felt he had a chronic hip problem that eventually could undermine his pitching ability. But if they had offered him salary arbitration, the worst scenario they would have faced was his acceptance.
In that event, they wouldn't have had to sign him for more than one year, and his salary most likely would not have exceeded his 1995 pay of $5.4 million by much. That one-year salary would have been far cheaper than the long-term commitment they are making to Rogers.

 
 
Raines vs. Henderson
 Tim Raines, who long has felt he has taken an unwarranted back seat to Rickey Henderson, laughed but was offended the other day when a reporter on the Yankees' conference call announcing Raines' acquisition mentioned that Henderson was a couple of years younger than Raines.
Henderson, in fact, observed his 37th birthday on Monday; Raines won't put that number next to his name until Sept. 16, two weeks before the end of next season. The Yankees could have pursued Henderson, a free agent, to play left field but opted to put Raines there.
Henderson is the career stolen base leader with 1,149. Raines is fourth (post-1900) with 777.
"Tim's a switch-hitter," General Manager Bob Watson said, explaining his reason for choosing Raines. "He's a better fit in our lineup. I did not seriously consider Rickey mainly because I didn't think it would fit budget-wise."
Henderson, who has played his entire 17-year career in the American League, has $4 million guaranteed contract the next two years with his new team, the San Diego Padres. The Yankees have guaranteed Raines $2.8 million for the next two years.

 
 
Praise for Ochoa
 Livan Hernandez, who defected from Cuba last summer, is the most attractive 20-year-old free agent pitcher looking to begin his professional career in the United States. With a fellow defector, also a pitcher, he has been visiting cities of prospective teams.
When Hernandez was at Yankee Stadium on Friday, he said, in response to a question, that when he was pitching in the Dominican Republic winter league the past month or so, the most difficult hitter for him to get out was Alex Ochoa, the 23-year-old outfielder the Mets obtained from Baltimore in the Bobby Bonilla trade on July 28.
"He is a very intelligent contact hitter with power," Hernandez said through an interpreter.
Ochoa batted .297 in 11 games with the Mets in the last two weeks of the season but had only one extra-base hit, a double, among his 11 hits.

 
 
A Different Pitching Rotation
 The game of musical free agent pitchers is in full swing.
Randy Myers, the Chicago Cubs' closer, moved to Baltimore; Doug Jones, the Orioles' closer, signed with the Cubs.
Al Leiter left Toronto for Florida, and when Boston signed Tom Gordon of Kansas City, Erik Hanson, who worked for the Red Sox last season, went to Toronto.
Cleveland signed Jack McDowell instead of re-signing Ken Hill so Hill signed with Texas when the Rangers were unable to sign Kenny Rogers, who now will move to the Yankees.
Pitching clients of Scott Boras always seem to be changing dugouts. This off season, Kevin Brown has moved from Baltimore to Florida and Andy Benes from Seattle to St. Louis. Rogers is on his way to New York, Jim Abbott is a week away from having his negotiating rights expire with the California Angels, Seattle has let Tim Belcher leave and the Orioles did not tender a contract to Ben McDonald.
Often Boras's pitchers change teams in their -- or his -- quest for top dollar. That, of course, is their prerogative, but the philosophy doesn't always work to the pitchers' benefit.
Three years ago, when Abbott was two years away from free agency, the Angels offered him $16 million for four years, but Boras rejected the offer and sought another million or two. The Angels, instead of continuing to negotiate, abruptly traded a stunned Abbott to the Yankees, where he didn't want to be.
Abbott had two disappointing seasons with the Yankees, then split the past season with the Chicago White Sox and the Angels after the Yankees chose not to tender him a contract.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Tracking the Dow, but Trailing Its Gains and Lacking Investors

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
GIVEN the popularity this year of index funds, several dozen of which mimic the broad United States stock market, an index fund linked to the Dow Jones industrial average sounds like a sure hit.
And an entrepreneur with that slice of the market almost to himself sounds lucky indeed. 
 Not so, says a rueful Steven H. Adler, who runs the struggling ASM Fund in Tampa, Fla. The tiny fund, whose name is an abbreviation for America's Stock Market, bills itself as the only mutual fund to mirror the Dow industrials, the gauge that's almost always invoked when somebody asks "How's the market?"
ASM's strategy is simple, to buy an equal number of shares in all 30 industrial companies in the Dow Jones average; its minimum investment is very modest, $500 or $1,000, and it has no sales fees.
After nearly five years, though, the fund has yet to attract a significant following. Even at the end of a year in which the Dow average soared, ASM needs to swell to five or six times its $13 million in assets just to break even and end the need for subsidies from Vector Index Advisors, controlled by Mr. Adler. ASM has been much larger -- with up to $85 million in assets -- but most of that growth came in the form of hot money from investment advisers who put clients into the fund for short spells. When the money fled, it proved disruptive and costly to the fund. Now ASM imposes a stiff fee -- 0.75 percent on the first $100,000 -- on anyone who makes more than six exits a year.
Despite being largely ignored, Mr. Adler has hopes of making his company into a mini-version of the Vanguard Group, of Valley Forge, Pa., the huge funds complex that is known as an indexing pioneer.
While the fund industry's main trade group, the Investment Company Institute, counts some 70 index funds, the Vanguard Index Trust 500 Portfolio dominates the category, with more than $17 billion of assets, and has attracted a rush of money this year. The fund is tied to the Standard & Poor's 500 index, composed of leading companies in each industry and weighted by their market capitalization.
"We really consider Vanguard the only other active fund company looking for index business," Mr. Adler said in an interview. Charles Schwab & Company, the discount brokerage firm, has created its own index of 1,000 stocks, but the industry in general frowns on indexing because it undermines the marketable notion that smart managers can outperform robots.
Mr. Adler, whose early training was as an actuary, certainly makes no claim of being able to "outfox" the market, as he puts it. But he says he thinks he has found in the Dow industrials a useful, even superior, alternative to the S.& P. 500. He figures the 30 Dow stocks operate in some 70 industries and get about half of their sales from abroad, providing plenty of diversification.
The Dow and the S.& P. have a 95 percent statistical correlation, Mr. Adler said, meaning that only 5 percent of the time they move in opposite directions. But over time there is a less than a percentage point of difference in their performance, an amount he considers trivial. With that in mind, the Dow should be favored, he said, in part because it is less volatile in the short run.
A related attraction of the Dow industrials, which now include service companies like American Express, Disney and J. P. Morgan, is that the index enjoys what Mr. Adler calls a "qualitative edge," because it is periodically updated with thriving companies. Although the composition of the S.& P. 500 is also fluid, its changes are based chiefly on market capitalization.
Gus Sauter, who oversees Vanguard's equity index funds, contends that indexing to the Dow means an arbitrary allocation of the investment by price, reflecting the fact that more money goes into high-priced stocks than into cheaper ones.
Moreover, he says, "There is the necessity to rebalance whenever there's a stock split or spinoff, thereby creating artificial turnover for no clear portfolio objective."
Mr. Adler counters that splits are easily handled and that neither gauge is more arbitrary than the other.
When ASM accumulates enough money to buy 100 shares of each stock in the Dow average, now about $170,000, it buys. Because the average is weighted by price, a $1 rise in I.B.M. at $92 has the same impact on the average as a $1 rise in Bethlehem Steel at $14.
ASM did trail the Dow in 1995, however, posting a gain of about 27 percent (28.5 percent with dividends reinvested), compared with the Dow's 33 percent advance.
Mr. Adler attributed the drag to relatively high expenses, because the puny fund lacks the economies of scale of a bigger fund, and to the portion of money uninvested -- at one time 5 percent, but now 2 percent -- to meet possible redemptions. Expenses now total 1.1 percent of assets, but at $50 million in assets, Mr. Adler says, the fund's expenses would fall to 0.75 percent.
Marketing has been hampered by the fact that Dow Jones & Company does not permit others to use its averages or to market a Dow Jones Fund. Mr. Adler has also resisted adding a sales charge that would give brokers an incentive to sell the fund's shares to investors.
A native of Jersey City, Mr. Adler, 57, sold his New York pension consulting firm in 1983 -- because of "the cold, the noise and the hassle" -- and moved to Florida. After a brief stint with brokerage houses that have since vanished, he decided in 1989 to create a fund tracking the Dow industrials.
He was not the first to do so. One Dow-oriented fund, sponsored by Templeton, carried a hefty sales charge and was liquidated a decade ago. Another, Lexington Corporate Leaders, has been around for half a century but still has the same companies that were in the Dow 50 years ago. A third, sponsored by Van Kampen Merritt, buys the 30 Dow stocks but puts an equal number of dollars in each company instead of buying an equal number of shares, meaning it does not exactly track the average, Mr. Adler said.
Before long, Mr. Adler plans to offer other indexed products, probably one to track medium-term Treasury securities followed by one for foreign stocks.
First, though, he needs to make ASM a success. "I've got to get one up on its feet," Mr. Adler said, "before I start adding."

BANKING
Tough Talk in Tokyo
The Ministry of Finance announced changes in how Japanese banks are regulated, hoping to end a series of financial disasters and restore foreign confidence. The guidelines call for banks to bolster their internal inspection and control systems and to draw up more detailed policies for risk management and control. Announced by the Finance Minister, Masayoshi Takemura, the guidelines also address how much of a bank's assets can be lent to a single borrower.
 In New York, a Federal grand jury indicted the former manager of Daiwa Bank's New York branch, Masahiro Tsuda, on charges that he had conspired with other bank officials to defraud the Federal Reserve by concealing trading losses. Federal and New York State regulators had previously ordered Daiwa to shut its United States operations.

The constant sales, the promotions, the ferocious competition of every sort for shoppers' attention and dollars left retailers with a holiday season they'll be happy to forget. Indeed, industry watchers said it was the worst holiday season in years, maybe decades. And the salvation, they said, will come only when shoppers have fewer choices. "The nation is clearly over-stored," one consultant said.
 
LOSSES
'Inappropriate Trades' at Pier 1
One of the few retailers to enjoy a strong year through its sales of wicker chairs and other decor, Pier 1 disclosed that it had lost $20 million from an outside consultant's "inappropriate trades." The company declined to name the consultant, but a lawyer for Capital Insight, a money management firm in Beverly Hills, Calif., said it was the firm in question. By week's end, Capital Insight and its president, Jay Goldinger, were telling clients they were going out of business.
 
ALTERNATIVE ENERGY (I)
Setback for Electric Cars
California is backing away from a requirement that 2 percent of all cars sold within the state by 1997 be electrically powered. The auto industry hailed the change as a recognition that market forces were more efficient at setting standards than government regulation; air-quality advocates called the proposal a sellout to the oil and auto industries.
 
ALTERNATIVE ENERGY (II)
In the Doldrums
Once the proud symbol of the coming age of wind power, Kenetech, the largest builder of wind turbines, has been battered. Problems range from blades snapping off its wind turbines to shareholder suits asserting that corporate officers misled analysts.
 
MANAGEMENT
Skipping Grades
Toyota said younger staff members would find it easier to gain promotion, a step that was widely interpreted as a test of whether seniority could become less important in choosing the auto giant's leaders. The change was part of a restructuring announced four months after Hiroshi Okuda was named president and was asked to deal with Toyota's falling share of the domestic auto market and the harm that a strong yen was doing to sales abroad.
 
ACQUISITIONS
Betting on Annuities
GE Capital Services agreed to pay $960 million for the Life Insurance Company of Virginia, a subsidiary of Aon. The acquisition would make GE Capital one of the five largest sellers of annuities.
 
LANDMARKS
Shuffling Out of Buffalo
The Corn Exchange of Buffalo, once a key inspection point for American agricultural trade, will be closed in early 1996 after 150 years in business. The St. Lawrence Seaway, which was expected to bring boom times when it opened in 1959, wound up providing ships with a means to bypass Buffalo.
 
THE BUSINESS PRESS
Bill Who?
Striving to provide broad and deep coverage of high technology, The Wall Street Journal mentioned the Microsoft Corporation in 1,033 articles during 1995 (an average of 2.8 articles a day). The New York Times had only 868 articles (2.4 a day) mentioning Microsoft, but had more articles bearing the name of William H. Gates, the company's chairman -- 168, compared with 149 in The Journal. By contrast, the chief executive of General Motors, appeared in only 26 articles in The Journal and 21 in The Times. His company was mentioned in 910 articles in The Journal and 666 in The Times.

HEADLINE: Visions of New York's Future

 BODY:
Of course, New York isn't the only city that attracts dreamers. But having organized its port a century-and-a-half ago with a savvy and ruthlessness that left Boston and Philadelphia dazzled in defeat, New York perhaps has a birthright to predict the future.
Ask for visions and themes emerge. The computer is a major focus, as if it were a torpedo thrust at our vanity and our reason to be -- physical proximity. There is fascination with the future shape of the city. Will it be vertical? Will our waistline center remain the inland of Manhattan, or will development move toward the rivers, or even skip over the waters, into Queens and the South Bronx? 
 Some fear a loss of idiosyncrasy; others see fringe groups gaining more influence in an information age. There is intense concern about racial and class fragmentation and the uneducated in a city that will demand more education. There is also hope and excitement.
 
THEATER TRAUMA
 
George C. Wolfe
 Artistic Director of the Public Theater
The nightmare version is that New York City becomes one giant Andrew Lloyd Webber theme park with theaters showing all Andrew Lloyd Webber shows, with tubes connecting the theaters. Oh yes, and revivals -- maybe in the tunnels you could pass the revivals as you go from one Andrew Lloyd Webber show to the next.
Now, my fantasy is there is no concept of uptown and downtown theater, but just theater showing extraordinary American plays by playwrights that reflect of all American realities, and people trying to reinvent the musical form and that the New York audience looks like all of New York City, because right now it doesn't.
It's a very bleak time. At this point in time there are people in power who don't understand why culture is important, and that's scary because it's become cultural survival of the fittest.
There's a Russian proverb that goes: you must support the most talented people because untalented people will support themselves. And that's important. Right now the biggest challenge is economic; theaters are just going to die. The ecology of New York theater is intricate. Off Off Broadway houses -- the theaters that tend and grow playwrights and artists for a year or two before a larger theater like the the Public or Lincoln Center can help -- a lot of those theaters could conceivably die.
If that does happen, the nightmare I described is more likely to happen. And if you continue to nurture, then my fantasy will happen.
 
Meredith Monk
 Performance Artist
I do think you'll see decentralization. I've had this vision of being an art farmer, where I'd plant my seeds and do my gardening elsewhere, and then just come into city at the harvest. I don't know if artists have to be here to do the work itself, but you need the city, the audience to share the work. To have the experience of the city in reality will always be part of the artists' lives, but it may not be the only way of going.
One thing I sense happening now is that because of adversity, young people coming here have to have a lot more imagination. When I first came in '64, there was a lot of energy, a lot of performing spaces opening, but the financial aspect wasn't the prime aspect. But now it's very hard for young people. What would be ideal would be all kinds of gathering places where there would a kind of energy and exchange. Maybe take down some buildings and put down some grass. Sometimes I feel like a Luddite. "Get out that hammer for the computer!"
The dystopic view is that everything closes down and the gatekeepers become more and more powerful and the young people get so discouraged they leave and then there'll be no energy or imagination. You have to build the courage to take the risk. Past, present, the future. That's the beauty of art, to risk the unknown.
 
VERTICAL CITY?
 
 Hugh Hardy
 The architect who restored the New Victory Theater, the New York Botanical Garden, the Rainbow Room and Windows on the World.
One of the things that is lasting about New York is the vertical density. Things are squashed together here by the 19th, well it's really an 18th century street grid. So it won't be possible to change that. And this will always make New York a great place with a lot of elbowing and shoving. Even virtual reality can't do that for you!
Wall Street has to be reinvented because its role as a financial center is changing. With computers there has been an enormous shift in the daytime population downtown. In the future, lower Manhattan will be a place where people live, work and play. The city is actually encouraging this with tax abatements.
I think about what the city will look like all the time. I do think there will be fanciful large structures made with new technology. Buildings will be built, for instance, with glass that changes opacity with the sunlight. So you will be able to see into them when it's dark and not when it's light. And there will be ever greater extremes between the old and the new. No architect in town has challenged the visual status quo much, but they will.
For one thing there won't be the need for large, boxy buildings with many workers in the future. In the 1980's people built large buildings with open floors. There will still be large buildings but they will be mixed use between residential and business. Or many businesses. The era of the single-owned office building is ending.
I can well imagine new subways completed and a connection to the airports constructed. And there might be water taxis to the airports. How funny! An old idea adapted to new technology. We won't have jet packs, but I can imagine a trolley system on the streets. Americans always want the future to be made out of something they have never seen before, but I think the future could be using old things in a new way.
 
Kevin Kelly
Executive Editor of Wired magazine
My suspicion is that in the short term it's bad news for a place like New York City. Skyscrapers are over. There's so little reason for them because people don't need height. The question is going to be what to do with all those tall buildings. People don't need to be that tight anymore. Skyscrapers were emblematic of achievement, but we don't believe in that kind of progress any more. It was high-tech because we could do it, with telephone and elevators, but there are other kinds of technology now -- fiber optics and overnight delivery, so you're going to end up with something that more resembles edge cites. Skyscrapers might end up as storage units or something.
The future of New York City may be an inversion, with the outskirts being the engine, driving the city. And the intellectual and cultural centers might move to places that are not that dense. I mean, people write off the Bronx, or write off Queens, that nothing consequential is happening there. But I could imagine in 25 years something happening like in San Francisco, where what to do with downtown is a problem. Maybe they become the projects; Manhattan as the projects and Queens as a multi-media alley or multi-media gulch.
Cities will live on as long as meeting someone face to face is more powerful than an electronic encounter.
 
FITNESS
 
 Doug Levine
 Owner of Crunch, the fitness conglomerate
 In two to three years the gyms will be full of virtual reality technology. It's going to be huge. You're going to be able to get on a bicycle and say, "I'm going to race the second day of the Tour de France," and depending on your mood you can race against Greg LeMond and be able to say "Greg I'm going to beat you," and he'll answer you back.
There will be a screen surrounding you on the bicycle on three sides. This will immerse you in the image.
Right now there is virtual reality, but the simulators that are out there are very crude. It's like looking at a television screen. It's developing, it's about two to three years away until it's cool.
The second thing that is going to happen much sooner is that boxing, which started as a fad two years ago (when white-collar boxing and women for the first time entered the sport), will become mainstream. Boxing used to be a sport full of cigars and corruption and all of sudden it started to be cool to do martial arts and to box. Now it's past the cool stage and it's become a legitimate exercise category with people hitting speed bags, heavy bags and jumping bags.
And, there will be a molding of entertainment and fitness, where you're going to see people watching first-run movies while running on a treadmill.
The whole population has moved from working 9 A.M. to 6 P.M. to 9 to 9 and they are stressed out. I think there will be a return to the eastern disciplines like Yoga, Meditation and Pilates, an old system of posture developed by a dancer to teach people alignment.
In New York you're going to see -- as the paths along the river develop -- people will be using the waterfront more. You're going to see people skate boarding, roller-blading and running and biking around all of Manhattan.
 
FASHION
 
Carolina Herrera
 Fashion designer
 I think New York has taken over a lot, especially now that all the fashion shows are in one place in Bryant Park, and everyone doesn't have to run around.
New York fashion is going to go very far. If we keep it together, New York will become a real competitor with Paris. Well, it already is, but Paris is still the fashion capital of the world.
In New York, there's a lot of talent. A lot of the main European designers are inspired by the sportswear of the Gap and Banana Republic. It's very American. The designers are inspired by the running shoes, the T-shirts, the jeans and khakis. It's very New York. As for all the black clothes in New York, it's very international. It's a sea of black.
Still, it's very difficult for New York fashion designers to be accepted in Europe. Ralph Lauren is an exception.
I think New York is fantastic. All the European designers want to do business in New York -- that's what they aspire to.
Clothes are going to continue to be timeless, classic but with a modern twist. The younger generation is getting more elegant and more fashionable. There will be a return to classic elegance. People will try to look less grungy.
Hopefully there will be less of the tennis sneakers with the skirts in New York. That's so unflattering, as are those leggings that everyone wears with the big jackets. Unless you're very young and have a great figure, you're simply a fashion victim.
There will be a lot of sportswear in the day but the young women will be more elegant and glamourous at night.
There will be less excessive makeup. Women look so much better when they don't wear too much makeup. I hate everything that is in excess.
Americans are getting better looking, great figures, great looking.
 
DEVELOPMENT
 
 Arthur Imperatore
 Developer and chairman of the board of NY Waterway.
I believe there will be a great impetus, a kind of a wave of future growth in ancillary mass transport. New ways just to get to the highways, to the tunnels, to the bridge networks, to park and rides. Lots of ferry locations on the Hudson, on Staten Island -- in places like Kill Van Kull, and in places like South Jersey, where you wouldn't think. . .
And where this happens you're going to engender development, you're going to see a change in quality of life, in improved property value and commercial development in those areas, and it will open the economy of the region.
For example, Kill Van Kull is not the most picturesque place, but 50 years from now the old industrial sites will likely change into sites for recreation, and residential housing. I see that. You have to envision a whole change in the transportation pattern.
There will be an increased emphasis on intermodality -- buses to boats, rails to buses. People will change modes; we've proven that. And transportation is the catalyst that has to precede any sort of development.
Even in Queens, for example, and in Manhattan, in the TriBeCa area, you're seeing everyone building out toward the river. The city 150 years ago was different -- they filled the river and land area was made. The sites were operated by major transportation sources, seagoing commerce. But that's all changed. I anticipate development building toward the river and utilizing land that had been unavailable. Twenty-five, 50 years in the future you'll have office buildings on what is now the edge of river. Look at Battery Park.
It will be an evolution of uses and zoning and economic opportunities used to gentrify many parts that are in disuse. The South Bronx could be a wonderful opportunity, cheap land taken over by the city. I think you'll see new hubs in Queens, and redevelopment of parts of Brooklyn.
I see service big time on the East River, stops at 78th Street, 61st Street, 51st Street, 34th Street, all up and down the East Side, with boats going down to the financial district. Communities -- you bet they'll grow.
It's the enhancement of travel. Incrementality, interconnectivity, intermodality, those are the key words.
 
CLASS, RACE, SECURITY
 
 
 Sharief Shabazz
 Nation of Islam community security force
 Bedford-Stuyvesant
 I see the future as economically worse. The future looks very chaotic. People are walking around with no hope, despair. They are walking time bombs. Two years from now it will be worse. Race relations will be worse. There used to be economic programs for black people back in the 60's. Now there are no more programs. Black people have nothing. Do not be shocked in a year or so. Blood will be running in the streets like water from that fire hydrant. It's reality.

 John Devine
 Adjunct Professor of Education at New York University.
 Expert in troubled schools
 If the present trend continues, you're going to find more and more schools with metal detectors. The security guard force is going to get bigger and bigger. If you look at it, it's a straight line curve going up; in 1969, we had zero security guards. Now, the present number, last time I counted, is 3,000 plus and growing, which is slightly less than the entire police force in Boston. It would be the ninth largest police force in the country. More metal detectors are going to be moving up to the middle-class schools, to the more integrated high schools. The knee-jerk reaction is going to be metal detectors.
 The public space in these schools, and by public I mean everything but the classroom, is being patrolled by security guards. More importantly, and significantly, there's been a change in the role of the teacher outside of classroom space. There's the absence of the superiority gaze. That role has been taken over by the guards. Guards have an influence that can surpass that of the teachers, both positively and negatively.
 The security guards are mostly community people, but the trend has been to have them just thrown into a school. They are the dominant adults in the public spaces -- they're hanging out with the kids; they are much closer to them in a human way than most of the teachers are. They're giving kids guidance, preventing suicides, giving religious advice. Maybe in the future they should be trained as counselors. But educators are not focused on this. It's not chic to run programs for security guards. Most advanced thinking thinks that they should be trained by police.
 
Saskia Sassen
 Professor of urban planning at Columbia University, and author of "Cities in a World Economy" (Pine Forge-Sage, 1994)
 This is no longer the era of an imperial capital, like Amsterdam in the 1600's, and London in the 1800's or New York after World War II. Things have really changed. Its going to be a while before these new ways of thinking come about. The fluidity of this time is immense. In the last 10 years there's been a radical reconfiguration. That's not going to be easy for New York -- not being No. 1 any more. That doesn't mean there's another city that's No. 1, but this is an era of the network. This is the era of telecommunications, of highly mobile culture.
 I'll tell you the weak point. It doesn't lie at the top, it lies at the middle and the lower middle. In New York, you can get the best, and you can also get the low-wage dirty work. The immigrants do that work and they will work, hard, hard, hard. What you don't have enough of is the solid middle. This is what you hear employers say again and again. The Achilles heel might well be in the public education sector. That whole infrastructure, public education, that allows lower- and middle-class to survive in the city needs far more resources, more attention. It creates a real void in the middle of this labor market -- you need good secretaries, good workers, good service and administrative workers in the middle, and they're likely to come out of the public schools.
 My gut feeling is that I've been in enough meetings with business managers to know there is a growing awareness, in elite business sectors, that the lower half of the city matters, that public education matters. But recognition is one thing; doing it is another. The whole civic milieu needs to be mobilized.
 
THE FAMILY
 
Tom Stoddard
Law professor, civil libertarian and AIDS patient.
 I'm certain gay marriages will be fully recognized. In fact, the state will recognize all forms of family. Families will be defined by the people living in them. Say, two senior citizens living together. Or two men or two women will be a family. Whatever form of relationship nurtures and promotes love. The statutes will have to be rewritten, so that family isn't just a matter of blood or marriage.
 We will evolve to a kinder, more realistic world by 2010.
 The media dominates everything, and it will even more so. By 2010, we'll do all our communication by computer. And we'll have many more voices than now. I think it'll make the world more democratic.
 By 2010, we will have reached such a crisis in health care that it will have to be totally reconfigured. The crisis will be the inability of most Americans to receive the kind of care they need. That's what managed care will bring them. Middle-class people will face the kind of problems that poor people face: not being able to go to the doctor of their choice, not being able to obtain necessary services, having to pay for their own medication. Plans won't include some medicines, or mammograms.
 We'll have a cure for AIDS before 2010. The progress is incremental, so it's hard for people to see how much progress has been made. The progress over the last six months has been amazing. I'm in much better shape than I was six months ago.
 Isn't that the great irony? Our health care will become less accessible just at the moment that medical knowledge is exploding beyond our wildest dreams.
 
 Bill Hartgrove
Night manager, Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel
 One thing I see, and I know it's going to be a growing idea: a lot of people are coming in to preplan, prearrange and prepay their funerals.
 It's beginning to be very important to people to say, down the line, things might be different. Many times, the people are sick for a long time, or their financial situation changes. They think, "I have the opportunity now to pay for what I want," and then the price is frozen.
 People are becoming more accepting of death. I think they know, in our world today, that people are all over, that families aren't together anymore. You have the older people moving to Florida, and they have to think: What are we going to do? You used to stay within the family, and the family took care of things.
 As far as where people will be buried, there's still a lot of land around when you get out of the city. You might go to cemeteries in Westchester, Long Island and New Jersey. And many cemeteries are building mausoleums and crypts. So there is space.
 
INFORMATION, THE SOCIAL CITY
 
Robert J. Lifton
Distinguished Professor of Psychology and Psychiatry at City University
The availability of information is going to increase, so everybody in New York City is going to have even more opinions. That's sort of a scary idea. The mass media technology, including computers, changes the setting of the city. You can't isolate groups -- groups that are suffering can be more quickly outspoken, and more quickly heard. It's not clear where that leads; everything is open-ended. It depends on what we do with it.
The city will continue to be part of the nerve of America, a nerve that's easily irritated and can lead to nasty behavior, but it's an active nerve nonetheless.
One of my more recent books, "The Protean Self: Human Resilience in a Time of Fragmentation," talks about the relatively more flexible many-sided self that each of us has much of, that we somehow make work. That's in opposition to the fundamentalist self, the sort of all or nothing self. New York has a lot of the Protean, collectively and individually. It's there in the literature and art. And while many artists and writers have moved away, they still have a foot or a hand or an easel or a computer in New York, I mean some form of connection with New York.
I hear it again and again, from friends from Europe, and friends from Japan. They say they feel more alive in New York than everywhere else. Something is touched or awakened or threatened -- all of that -- by its very intensity.

 Judith Regan
 Head of Regan Books
 Publisher of Howard Stern's "Miss America"
The publishing business is centered in New York, and it's not going to change anytime soon. All the talent is in New York. Book publishers and editors are going to act as readers for the film and television industry. We're the ones who will be doing the hard labor. Our own little world is coinciding with all these other worlds.
I think the publishing industry is going become more marketing-driven. Books will be more celebrity-driven. But try to find people to write! Try to find people who can work in publishing houses. People graduating from college don't know anything. It's very shocking. They can't read, and they can't write. The level of writing has gone down and down.
I think that this is going to change because our values are becoming more conservative, and instead of doing what feels good there's going to be restructuring of the education.
Yes, the Internet will be a presence, but the Internet is the written word. You still have to sit there and read. The old news is the new news. What it comes down to is the story. It's whether you have a good story or you have important information to tell.
 
Michael Musto
Gossip columnist for The Village Voice
I see no reason why gossip mania won't continue to grow, to the point where, in 2010, it will not only have supplanted hard news, it will have obliterated it.
The Post will have news only on Page 6, and gossip on every other page. And we will know more about celebrities than celebrities will know about themselves. Recently the meaning of the word celebrity has broadened to include somebody who crashed on the couch of someone who's tried for double murder. Celebrities can now be ordinary, or subordinary, people who fall into extraordinary circumstances. And that trend will continue.
 
 Deb Parker
Co-manager of the Beauty Bar, on East 14th Street
In 10 years, if I'm still in New York, New York might be the most pathetic city around. All the coolest people are moving away; all my friends are moving elsewhere, to smaller towns. So New York might get to be like a bunch of little small towns, too. Nobody ever goes beyond a 20-block radius anyway.
The city will probably be really expensive to live in, so the only people living here will have some scam, like a $200 apartment or great windfalls of money.
In 10 years, it'll be a city of people who were something, has-beens, and people starting to come up. And I'll have 'em all in my bar. Some are going to be slumming, and some are going to come in to ask me questions. And I'll still be there, making money. I'll have the Donald Trumps and the coked-out strippers. That's what I like -- a mix. That's what New York is good for.

ALL ABOUT HOLOGRAPHY
"The Nature of Holography," which opened yesterday and will continue through Feb. 11 at the Art Cellar in Clinton, features more than 40 holograms and 15 panels explaining how this three-dimensional, laser-produced imagery works. 
 It started back in 1947 when Dennis Gabor, a Hungarian physicist, was working on the potential of focused light. But it was not until the invention of the laser in the 1960's that holography began to mature.
Twelve images in one section of the display are of flowers, birds, insects and other small natural species. Pulsed laser holograms of lion cubs, a python, tiger and other wildlife creatures are in a second sector. The third and final section contains the 15 explanatory panels.
Admission is $3 for adults, $1 for children under 13, free for pre-schoolers. The gallery, in the Clinton Center Mall on Route 1, is open Tuesday through Saturday from 11 to 4 P.M.; Sunday from 1 to 4 P.M., and Thursday evenings until 9 P.M. The number for more information is 860-669-1235.
 
FIRST NIGHT DANBURY
Not all First Nights in Connecticut have survived, but Danbury will celebrate its seventh alcohol-free birthday today from 4 P.M. to midnight.
The afternoon is devoted mainly to children, with an entertainment lineup that includes Bubble-Mania, Dr. Rock's Dinosaur Rock Revue, Juke Box Mania, Gale Alexander's magic, Ted Lawrence's mini-circus and lots of music and dance.
There is a train exhibit at The Galleria, and Zero Gravity's play gym is open for children up to age 12, featuring a super bouncer, amazing maze and balloon typhoon.
The First Night Resolution Wall on the green is up again for those dauntless souls who are willing to record their 1996 New Year's resolutions in public, and a Midnight Finale starts at 11:30 P.M. with music, dancing, street performers and a surprise as the year turns over.
Art exhibits are at the Women's Center, West Street Co-Op and Gallery 13, other exhibits are at the Scott-Fanton Museum, and a roster of entertainers includes the Danbury Opera Campany, Danbury Actors Repertory Company, Blue Ribbon Cloggers, Amy Gallatin and Stillwater country duo, Salt and Pepper gospel ensemble, the comic Bob Stanhope, Vinny and Ray Orchestra, and the Greg Wall Klezmer Band.
Admission to all events is by First Night Button, which costs $10 for adults, $7 for children under 12 and adults over 62, available at numerous downtown locations. The number is 792-5095 for more information.

BRITISH PRINTS
Photography buffs will want to stop by the Yale Center for British Art in New Haven to see its exhibition of contemporary British printmaking by the Paragon Press, on display through Feb. 4. Founded in 1986 by Charles Booth-Clibborn, Paragon established a reputation as a prodigious and innovative publisher of 34 portfolios of images by British artists.
Emphasizing suites of related material rather than individual prints, and giving artists free rein to set up the sequences in collaboration with studio printers, Paragon has been credited with reinvigorating British printmaking. Richard Long's "Rock Drawings" (1994) exemplifies that process.
About 150 works are on view, some by artists who had not previously been involved in prints. Examples are Antony Gormley's various body parts in his collection "Body and Soul" (1990) and Victor Burgin's "Fiction Film" (1991), a video-computer originated work.
Established Scottish figurative painters like Stephen Campbell and John Bellamy are represented, as well as British school painters including Hamish Fulton, Therese Oulton, Christopher LeBrun and Anish Kapoor.
The exhibition was organized by the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh, where Paragon Press was originally located before moving to London, and the Yale Center for British Art.
Hours are 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tueday throguh Saturday, and noon to 5 P.M. Sunday. The center is located at 1080 Chapel Street and the phone number for more information is 432-2850.
 
FOREIGN POLICY
This season's Darien Community Association Academic Lecture Series focuses on "Election 1996: Perspectives on Foreign Policy." The talks will be given on four consecutive Thursdays beginning this week at 10 A.M. in the association's headquarters, 274 Middlesex Road.
Stanley B. Greenberg, the author of "Middle Class Dreams: The Politics and Power of the New American Majority," will speak on "Overview: Defining the Current International Issues and Voter Reactions for the 1996 Elections."
Derek Boothby, director of the European division of the United Nations Department of Political Affairs will speak on "Global Hot Spots: The Challenge to Peacekeeping" on Jan. 11; and on Jan. 18 Peter Skerry, visiting fellow in governmental studies at the Brookings Institution will explore "The Immigration Debate: An Economic, Political or Human Rights Crisis?"
The final lecture, titled "Issues in International Trade and Finance: Why Every Voter Should Care," will be given by Richard C. Breeden, chairman of international financial services of Coopers & Lybrand.
Series tickets are $40, individual lecture tickets are $10 and $12 at the door, and $4 for students. Baby-sitting may be arranged by advance registration. The number for more information is 655-9050.

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS;
Mrs. Whitman So Far: Good, With an Asterisk

BYLINE: By Iver Peterson; Iver Peterson is Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Today is the last day the state may legally withdraw money from the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund to help pay the hospital costs of the working poor, and it also brings to a close the first half of Christine Todd Whitman's remarkable term as Governor. Charity care is an obscure issue, but one anchored in the muck of the law, while the anniversary is evanescent. It is too bad that the legal problem is likely to overshadow the celebratory one as we go into the new year.
When the Governor began her campaign in the early summer of 1993, she disdained the idea of pledging a tax cut. The idea was raised by some Republicans who were aware that, by then, the "no new taxes" promise had begun to lose some of its strength as a philosophy and that more potent medicine was needed. 
 When her campaign seemed to be stalled and the voters were looking for reasons to vote for this likeable woman (and against Gov. Jim Florio), Mrs. Whitman relented and took the pledge, and the rest is history: she rocked the state in her inauguration by making part of the cut retroactive, and the next year completed the full 30 percent cut in income taxes a year ahead of schedule. The National Republican party loves her, latecomers to the tax-cutting scene call themselves Whitman Republicans, the party leaders in Washington court her support.
So is tax cutting the real history of the Whitman administration at half time? Would we have anything else to talk about today if they had not happened? If Mrs. Whitman had never cut a tax, we would still be talking about how she confronted New Jersey's preposterously expensive state and local government and educational apparatus, one that has given the state the second-highest property taxes in the country, in the name of home rule. No Governor took on this juggernaut of the status quo as aggressively as she, by conducting public audits of local books, by penalizing wasteful school districts, and, yes, by starving many prosperous, high-spending communities of state funds that had for years been taken for granted.
We would be talking about how the Governor used her national prominence to sustain the Republican Party's traditional Eastern wing, with its moderation, its polite and tolerant regard for others, against the rough-and-tumble types beyond the Delaware Bay.
And we would be talking about how Christie Whitman and a generally distinguished cabinet managed to connect state government to the voters to an extraordinary extent, using public appearances, radio and television call-in shows and the hearings on issues like school funding and juvenile crime to open government up to public comment.
No moment summarized Mrs. Whitman's rare public touch more perfectly than at the rally held in memory of Megan Kanka, the murdered 7-year-old from Hamilton, when the Governor instinctively enfolded Megan's weeping mother in her arms and held her in the name of a grieving state.
It is a pretty good record to build on, a principled, foundation-laying first two years that has put down the base for two more years, or six more years, to hear the Governor talk, of moderate, incremental reform. But first the Whitmanauts have to weather the charity-care issue, and its unwelcome echoes of the tax-cutting promise.
For it was largely on the strength of a diet of anti-tax sentiment from the Governor that prompted her own Republicans to reject her preferred solution, an increase in cigarette taxes and a continued but diminishing raid on the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund.
The Republican leadership, grown bold on the Governor's own anti-tax rhetoric, refused even to vote the bill out of committee.
Meanwhile, Mrs. Whitman overplayed her hand with the Democrats who, after four years in the minority in both houses, were in no hurry to carry water on a tax increase for Republicans.
The Democrats' resistance was, if anything, hardened when the Republicans argued that because many charity hospitals are in urban (read Democratic) districts, the Democrats had a greater obligation thant suburban Republicans to support a tax increase.
"We told the Governor, 'You have 53 votes in the Assembly, you only need 41, why aren't your people voting for your tax package?' ", said Neil Cohen, a Union County Assembly Democrat and minority whip. The unspoken answer is that taxes are anathema in New Jersey these days, thanks to the Governor's campaign pledge. The irony is that charity care taxes, more than any subject, will overshadow the celebrations and commemorations of a new Assembly term on Jan. 9, and the start of the second half of the Whitman governorship.

HEADLINE: ROAD AND RAIL;
Toward Greater Efficiency and Safety in a State Perpetually on the Move

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
Few issues stir as much passion in so many communities as the simple act of moving from place to place: from home to work to the mall and home again. So 1995 brought sharp disputes, in cities, towns, counties and the state as a whole, over a host of transportation issues: new highway construction, train connections, light-rail plans, pedestrian access, employee car pools, the 55-mile-per-hour speed limit.
But there was not much controversy over a technical but major change in the way the state pays for transportation. In November, voters overwhelmingly approved the dedication of a bigger portion of the gas tax to the Transportation Trust Fund, the pool of money from which the state pays for highways and mass transit projects. 
 As a result, 9 cents of the gas tax, up from 2.5 cents, will find its way to the fund, which provides half of the $1 billion a year needed to build and maintain New Jersey's transportation infrastructure. Passage was crucial, transportation advocates said, because the trust fund was running low on cash.
"Transportation can be a huge drain on the state budget, and for that reason, it needs to have a stable base of funding," said Janine Bauer, executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a coalition of environmental and planning groups. "This is just good planning and sound fiscal policy."
The state also issued a blueprint for transportation, identifying eight initiatives to guide the state over the next two years. The North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority, responsible for approving federally financed projects, outlined the needs and problems of 13 northern counties in the face of chronic congestion and increasing commuter traffic over the next 20 years.
To discourage inefficient travel, the Department of Transportation opened a car-pool lane on Route 287 this month; it was five miles long and is eventually to expand to 20. Even so, motorists will no Even so, motorists will not be able to drive any faster: despite the repeal of national maximum speed limits, and the recent moves by New York and Pennsylvania to raise the limit to 65 m.p.h. on many rural stretches of major highways, Governor Whitman remains committed to the 55-m.p.h. limit, citing the state's density and safety concerns.
Safety concerns also gained in several other areas. The Department of Transportation released a bicycle and pedestrian master plan that was praised by the department's usual critics. More municipalities tried to pamper pedestrians, adding zebra-striped crosswalks, brick markings and signs to remind drivers that pedestrians have the right of way.
The train should be a better alternative in North Jersey soon. This year, construction began on the Kearny Connection, a $69 million rail link that will offer direct access to New York City and shave an average of 17 minutes off the trip; the link should be finished by spring. And this month, New Jersey Transit bought 29 commercial and residential properties in Montclair to clear the way for the long-awaited Montclair Connection, which would connect the Boonton Line and the Montclair branch of the Morris and Essex Line.
Both projects have met some opposition: Kearny for its plans to add thousands of parking spaces in towns like Maplewood and Summit; Montclair for its impact on the esthetics and property values of the surrounding neighborhoods.
Ground was broken for a park-and-ride in Jersey City for the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail Transit System, a $1.3 billion project that would send trolleys from Bayonne along the Hudson River waterfront to the Vince Lombardi park-and-ride in Ridgefield. The 20.5-mile system would be built in two stages; the first, from Bayonne to the Hoboken train terminal, could be completed by 1999.
Wider-ranging in scope was a plan unveiled by Chester P. Mattson, Bergen County's director of planning and economic development. In November, he produced a plan, five years in the making, that would integrate trolleys, trains, ferries and existing rail lines to connect most of Bergen County. The estimated cost would be $1 billion; the timetable is uncertain.
In South Jersey, the Department of Transportation intends to decide what to do about mass transit linking the suburbs in Gloucester County to Philadelphia via Camden, with a possible extension to Burlington County later. There are two major options: one would offer direct service to Philadelphia as a branch off the existing Patco line, which now runs through the Camden County suburbs; the other would feature a light-rail system winding along the Camden waterfront and require a transfer. Either way, the project is considered crucial for the area, which has not had commuter rail service in 25 years.
There will also be decisions on rail service to Atlantic City; Amtrak pulled out in 1995 after six years of service, but New Jersey Transit has so far picked up the slack. And there will most likely be a decision on the West Shore Line in Bergen County. New Jersey Transit is studying plans to restore service along a 30-mile stretch from West Nyack, N.Y., to Hoboken by building new tracks along the old right of way, now used by Conrail for freight.
As with most transportation projects, though, the West Shore must resolve questions of financial viability. Initial estimates are that the line could cost $500 million; as a result, the line may have to be built in stages, with the first most likely to run to the Meadowlands sports complex.
For all the plans, financing prospects and talk about transportation, one thing commuters may notice next year is the introduction of more advanced technology to the highway system. In 1996, the state plans to introduce an electronic system on the state's three toll roads that would allow vehicles to zip through tollbooths and have money automatically deducted. The technology should be in every toll barrier by 1998.
"It was an extremely busy and productive year for us," said Frank J. Wilson, the State Commissioner of Transportation. "There's a sense of urgency to get things done."

HEADLINE: THE GREAT OUTDOORS;
Several Strides Forward, and an Explosive Setback, for the Environment

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

 BODY:
Not nearly as bad as it could have been: that's how environmental groups in New Jersey summed up 1995, even as a national trend toward deregulation threatened to weaken the programs responsible for much of the drop in pollution (and proliferation of red tape) of the past two decades. Here are some environmental developments in the last year.
 
DEVELOPING THE MEADOWLANDS In April, officials proposed a new management plan for one of the state's most bitterly contested environmental battlefields, the 20,000-acre Hackensack Meadowlands. The new plan calls for filling in 840 acres of marsh to build several large commercial projects, with the developers paying for the restoration of 3,400 acres of damaged wetlands. 
 Although the 840 acres to be filled is less than half the amount earmarked for development in the existing 1972 master plan, environmentalists argue that there is no reason to fill in any of the region's precious open space when nearby cities -- Newark, Jersey City, Elizabeth -- are starved for economic development. The proposed plan is still under discussion.
EXPLOSION IN LODI An April 21 explosion at the Napp Technologies chemical factory in Lodi killed 5 people and injured 41. Phenols in the runoff from firefighting scoured all life from a three-mile stretch of the Saddle River. Napp was later fined $127,000 by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, a figure that officials said would have been much higher if Federal safety standards had specifically warned against mixing the two chemicals that caused the explosion.
GOLF COURSE DENIED Governor Whitman killed a proposal to build a 150-acre golf course in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty. Although revenue from the course would have been used to open up some of the 400-plus acres of the 578-acre Liberty State Park that are contaminated and off-limits to the public, course opponents argued successfully that dedicating a third of the park to golfers was too high a price. The Green Acres bond passed in November included $10 million for improvements in the park.
NEW TEST FOR CARS A tough auto emissions bill was passed to help bring New Jersey's smoggy, ozone-laden air into compliance with Federal standards. The inspection program, which officials said would result in the single largest improvement ever in the state's air quality, includes testing for nitrogren oxide, which causes smog. Officials estimate that 50 percent more cars will fail the new test than the current one.
LOOKING AT ANTI-POLLUTION LAWS Governor Whitman's 1996 budget cut $11.5 million and eliminated 219 jobs in the Department of Environmental Protection. The Governor also signed an executive order requiring state agencies to conduct cost-benefit analyses to justify any regulations that are tougher than minimum Federal standards. Many of New Jersey's anti-pollution laws exceed Federal standards.
A LONG DRY SPELL New Jersey's worst drought since 1985 shriveled reservoirs, crops and wildlife and prompted water restrictions in the northern half of the state for six weeks in September and October.
GREEN ACRES The $340 million Green Acres bond issue approved overwhelmingly by the voters in November was the largest ever. More than $60 million will be used by the state to purchase land for conservation, with another $50 million to pay for farmland preservation. The bonding gives local governments $120 million to buy and improve open space.
The bond also sets aside $15 million to buy 250 houses along the flood-prone Passaic River. The Army Corps of Engineers wants to build a $1.9 billion, 21-mile tunnel from Wayne to Newark Bay to prevent flooding, but environmentalists and Governor Whitman say it would be cheaper and more environmentally sensible to let the river run its course and buy out those who built alongside it. The corps produced figures showing that the flood tunnel would be cheaper in the long run, but the Whitman administration has rejected them.
SLUDGE DUMPING A Federal judge in Newark ruled that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey may not dump contaminated sludge dredged from Port Newark and Port Elizabeth shipping channels in the Atlantic Ocean off Sandy Hook.Even before the ruling, a panel appointed by the Governor proposed burying the sludge in underwater clay pits in Newark Bay instead, a plan endorsed by environmentalists and shippers.
WETLANDS REDEFINED Many of the government actions likely to have the biggest impact on the state happened not in Trenton but in Washington. Proposed changes to the Federal Clean Water Act, for example, would redefine "wetlands" in such a way that as much as half of New Jersey's wetlands would no longer be protected, the New Jersey Audubon Society said. Wetlands cover nearly a fifth of the state.
The Congress's favored tactic, however, was to reshape policy simply by cutting budgets.
"When the endangered species program takes a 38 percent hit and the Environmental Protection Agency takes a 21 percent hit, this is a procedure that weakens laws without debating their merits in the legislative forum," said Richard Kane of the state Audubon Society. The society said that a huge cut in allocations to the Federal Land and Water Conservation Fund meant that 30,000 acres adjoining wildlife refuges in New Jersey that were supposed to be purchased this year were not.
The only encouraging news out of Washington came earlier this month when Speaker Newt Gingrich endorsed a plan for the Federal Government to help buy Sterling Forest, a pristine 20,000-acre tract just north of the New Jersey border in New York that supplies a quarter of New Jersey's drinking water. For years, the states had been searching for a way to raise about $50 million to buy out the forest's owners, who wanted to build a community of 13,000 homes, commercial buildings and golf courses. Governor Whitman had pledged $10 million to buy land in New York, a move environmentalists hailed as far-sighted.
But New Jersey's gain was another region's loss: to raise the $20 million to buy Sterling Forest, the Government wants to sell 56,000 acres of Oklahoma grasslands.

In Trenton: Cut Now, Pay Later?

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Governor Whitman began 1995 with a triumph: she delivered on a campaign promise to cut state income tax rates by 30 percent in two years instead of three. By doing so, she bolstered her standing in the Republican Party and surprised some New Jerseyans by becoming a politician who keeps her word.
By year's end, however, Mrs. Whitman was confronting some of the fiscal perils that her adversaries had warned lay ahead. To help replace the state's present system of using unemployment insurance funds to pay for hospital care for the poor, she proposed a tax increase on cigarettes. The tax, which the Governor calls a "user's fee," failed to win support in the Legislature, and in the last few weeks Mrs. Whitman has found herself portrayed in an anti-tax group's radio campaign as just another tax-and-spend politician. 
 Until now, the Governor, who paid for much of the tax cut by reducing the state's contribution to the pension fund, has been able to avoid some of the tough political choices that often accompany tax cuts. She has not had to reduce state spending sharply, and she has deflected criticism about rising property taxes by suggesting that municipal officials need to better manage their budgets.
Working with the Legislature, she signed several significant bills into law: a package of tort reform law that would place a cap on punitive damages in civil liability cases; mandatory life sentences for repeat violent offenders, and the creation of a new juvenile justice commission and other juvenile justice programs, like a military-style boot camp for young offenders. The Governor was also able to win some health care concessions from the state's largest public employee union. Both Mrs. Whitman and her husband, John, who was appointed to work out the details, can also share the credit for helping to keep the Stanley Cup champions, the New Jersey Devils, in the Meadowlands.
The Governor and the Legislature reduced some environmental regulations, as promised, and eliminated a surcharge on the corporate business tax and the sales tax on advertisements published in telephone directories.
But the contentious debate and the failure of the Governor and the legislators to reach agreement on how to come up with $400 million to pay for the state's charity-care program are signs that 1996 is not going to be easy.
In the new year, leaders will also try once more to settle the question of how to fairly distribute school funds so students in rich and poor districts alike can receive the "thorough and efficient" education the state constitution says they deserve. In more than two decades, no Governor has succeeded.
With no burning statewide issue to capture voters' attention, the off-year Assembly election Assembly produced the lowest voter turnout in almost 20 years. Democrats picked up a couple of seats, but the Assembly remained firmly in the hands of Republicans, who also control the Senate.
Voters did, however, approve a constitutional change that requiring the Legislature and the Governor to provide money to local governments to cover the costs of putting state laws into effect. For example, the state recently considered legislation requiring playgrounds around the state to meet tighter safety guidelines. Once the new law takes effect, the state will have to provide school districts and municipalities with money for new playground equipment to comply with the state law.
Senator Bill Bradley's announcement in August that he would retire at the end of 1996, after three terms, didn't surprise veteran political observers who noted earlier in the year that he was not aggressively raising campaign funds. Saying he was weary of party politics, Mr. Bradley, a Democrat, did not rule out a 1996 Presidential bid. His retirement, meanwhile, allowed the state Democratic Party to shuffle its deck.
Now, Representative Robert G. Torricelli of Bergen County is seeking the Democratic nomination. He has already raised $1.4 million, and since he doesn't have to worry about a primary contest, he can spend most of it in the general election.
Representative Dick Zimmer, a Republican from Hunterdon County, is leading the pack in his party. Mr. Zimmer's challengers are Richard DuHaime, a Freeholder from Passaic, and State Senator Richard J. La Rossa, a Republican from Mercer County.
In 1996, New Jerseyans will get the answer to one of the most frequently asked questions in Trenton: will she or won't she? Will Governor Whitman be asked to join the Republican standard-bearer as a vice presidential candidate? And if so, what will she say?
Mrs. Whitman, who last month endorsed Senator Bob Dole of Kansas for the nomination, dismisses such talk, saying that she wants to serve two terms as Governor. She did say, however, that she believed a moderate Republican would help Mr. Dole win in November, and she offered to try to persuade Colin Powell to sign on.

Widespread confidence in the state's economy prevailed last January as many businesses celebrated their most robust gains since the recession. But the beginning of 1996 will be marked by uncertainty in New Jersey as a recent series of mergers and restructuring threaten thousands of jobs in banking, insurance and communications.
Probably the most significant business development to affect New Jersey came in September, when AT&T, based in Basking Ridge, announced that it would break into three smaller companies to cut costs and simplify its operations. By 1997, the communications giant is to divide itself into a long-distance telephone company, an equipment company and a computer manufacturer. 
 Initially, it seemed that the change would not threaten most of the 50,000 New Jersey residents employed by AT&T. But in November, AT&T sent severance packages to 77,800 managers nationwide -- half of the company's supervisory work force. Not nearly enough people have accepted the buyout, and AT&T is expected to announce in January how many jobs it will have to eliminate to prepare for the restructuring.
As AT&T was planning the largest dismantling of a corporation in American history, several bank corporations were merging in New Jersey, raising the possibility of several thousand layoffs at banks around the state. In June, the North Carolina-based First Union bought First Fidelity Bank Corporation in Newark. A few weeks later, PNC Bank Corporation of Pittsburgh acquired Midlantic Bank, based in Edison. And in November, UJB Financial Corporation, based in Princeton, bought Summit Bancorporation, based in Chatham. It is still unclear how many jobs will be lost in the mergers, but Midlantic has said it will cut about 1,600 jobs in New Jersey.
"With all these changes, the immediate impact is going to be painful," said Chris Biddle, a spokesman for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association. "Anyone who works for a large corporation has got to be feeling very nervous because a lot of companies are going through more than one restructuring."
Although New Jersey economists are forecasting some growth in 1996, they say it will not rival that of 1995, when almost every sector of the state economy expanded. Mr. Biddle predicted that about 40,000 private-sector jobs would be created in 1996 but said overall growth would be sluggish. Companies with 50 to 90 employees will probably experience most of the growth, he said, while the largest and smallest businesses will either stagnate or cut back.
The hospital, communications, manufacturing and utilities sectors are expected to suffer the most next year, according to the Rutgers Economic Advisory Service.
Mr. Biddle said that in a recent survey conducted by his association, about 32 percent of about 2,000 companies surveyed said they expected economic conditions to improve in the first half of 1996, compared to 46 percent last year. In addition, 44 percent expect conditions to stay the same, and 25 percent expect them to get worse.
While the short-term forecast is not dazzling, Mr. Biddle said many business leaders had high hopes for the next five years as Governor Whitman's regulatory reforms take effect. Last summer, after Mercer County alone lost more than 5,000 jobs as a result of corporate and government retrenchment, the Governor signed bills to attract new companies to New Jersey by making it easier for them to obtain loans and capital and by easing environmental and other regulations.Although that legislation has not yet brought any windfalls (witness the last-minute decision of the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange to stay in Manhattan rather than relocate to Jersey City, a move that would have brought 3,500 jobs), Mr. Biddle said it will probably help retain and attract dozens of businesses in the next two to five years.
One place where deregulation has made a difference is Atlantic City, where the gaming industry continued to thrive last year and the outlook for 1996 is even more promising.
In January, Mrs. Whitman signed a casino deregulation bill that ended state supervision of hundreds of non-gambling functions. Now, a $270 million convention center is under construction, financed by the state's Sports and Exposition Authority. A group of casinos is spending $580 million to add 3,000 hotel rooms and build new parking and retail space. And Steven Wynn, the chairman of Mirage Resorts, who left Atlantic City eight years ago because of local and state regulations, is returning to build a $1 billion two-casino complex.

HEADLINE: NEWS AND TOPICS: DEVELOPMENT;
'Big Boxes' Are Going Strong; Homes and Offices Barely Pass the Gate

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
It was a slow year for development in New Jersey, the latest in a string that began during the recession of 1991-92, from which the state has never fully recovered.
After a frantic boom in the mid- and late 1980's, new housing slowed to a crawl, and office complexes sprouted "for lease" signs by the dozens. Only in 1995 did development start to pick up a bit, thanks in part to a recovering economy, lower mortgage rates and changing consumer demands. But there are no predictions of a boom anytime soon. 
 To some, the long slowdown has been a useful respite. "I think this is a good time," said Eileen Banyra, principal of EFB Associates, an environmental and community planning group in Hoboken. "I think it gives everybody a bit more chance to be smarter and more thoughtful about the developments being proposed."
In 1995, the retail sector made the most noise -- not so much for what was completed, but what was approved or started. "You're talking about millions of square feet of retail space that's going to be built in '96 and '97, so they must have a lot of confidence in the market," said Richard J. Brunelli, the president of R. J. Brunelli & Company, a retail leasing concern in Old Bridge.
Especially prominent were "big box" retailers, giant stores that exceed 15,000 square feet and offer discount prices and no frills. At the same time, older, smaller discount stores struggled to hold their own against Wal-Mart, Home Depot and other big boxes: witness the liquidation of Jamesway and the bankruptcy filings of Caldor and Bradlees.
In the office sector, new construction was minimal. But vacancies dropped. Last year, there was a net gain of four million square feet of office space filled; this year, there figures to be five million, predominantly by small service companies, said David T. Houston, president of Colliers, Houston & Company in Bloomfield. There is still a surplus of 20 million square feet -- a product of the speculative overbuilding of office space in the late 1980's -- but the numbers are decreasing.
"We thought the oversupply would last into the next century; now it looks like there's going to be a demand for space within this decade," said Jeffrey A. Horn, executive director of the New Jersey chapter of the National Association of Industrial and Office Properties, in Edison.
In the housing market, though, the numbers were less encouraging for builders. In 1986, a record 57,000 homes were built in New Jersey; this year, that number was be about 25,000.
"It's sort of puzzling because mortgage rates are as good as they've been," said Peter S. Reinhart, senior vice president of K. Hovnanian Enterprises in Red Bank, the state's largest construction company. He attributed the sluggish results, in part, to the long approval process most municipalities require, but he said he hoped some regulations would be standardized in 1996.
Of the areas that did construct or approve new housing, Ocean, Middlesex and Morris Counties led the way, and Dover Township in Ocean County was the busiest municipality, with 574 housing units approved in 1995.
But far from acceding to suburban sprawl, more residents are pining for a small-town feel that incorporates sidewalks and public spaces. And they are becoming more involved.
"We're finding more and more municipalities updating their master plans and working through a public participation process," said Tom Dallessio, public affairs manager for the Office of State Planning. "In particular, we're finding that the marketplace is requiring smaller lots and that people want the amenities of smaller towns. What we're strongly suggesting is that municipalities and developers looking at today's site plans anticipate tomorrow's needs. The parking lots of today may become the urban space or pedestrian plazas of tomorrow."

HEADLINE: THE LIVES THEY LIVED: JAMES RESTON;
A Reston Sampler

 BODY:

ON THE COLD WAR - I have no doubt whatsoever about the outcome of the cold war. No handful of men in the world are smart enough to run this vast Communist empire. The thing is against human nature, and its inner contradicions will bring it down if we are strong, vigilant and patient.
 But this is a marathon, and we're running it like a hundred yard dash. (Feb. 22, 1955)
 
ON J.F.K. - The irony of the President's death is that his short Administration was devoted almost entirely to various attempts to curb this very streak of violence in the American character.
 When the historians get around to assessing his three years in office, it is very likely that they will be impressed with just this: his efforts to restrain those who wanted to be more violent in the cold war overseas and those who wanted to be more violent in the racial war at home. (Nov. 23, 1963)
 
ON RACIAL INTEGRATION - On the tenth anniversary of the Supreme Court's public-school-integration decision, the paradox and the tragedy of the American Negro are fairly clear. He is gaining legally but falling behind economically. He is slowly getting the rights but not the skills of a modern computerized society. He is getting a better chance at unskilled jobs, but unskilled jobs are being wiped out by the new bossman, the machine...
 This is the problem. History is both the Negro's friend and his enemy. (May 15, 1964)

HEADLINE: A Course to Fulfill Students' Dreams

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG 

DATELINE: VALHALLA

 BODY:
THE notebooks and briefcases of the half-dozen adults sitting in a Westchester Community College classroom here weren't merely filled with homework. What was on display in presentations to their instructor and colleagues were their dreams.
Visions of selling Mary Kay cosmetics danced in their heads as did visions of computer learning centers for children or starting a collectibles store. 
 The students were taking part in a program called "The American Dream Series," offered under the auspices of the Westchester Center for Training and Development, a White Plains-based organization that provides workshops and classes in employee training, youth leadership and entrepreneurial skills. The program, targeted to women and minorities (although other students are welcome), is designed to help entrepreneurs start businesses.
In an economic climate characterized by corporate layoffs, restructuring and downsizing, owning a business is seen as an alternative to being at the mercy of a corporate boss. According to the Small Business Administration, there are 21.5 million small businesses in the country, which account for 52 percent of all sales; employ 54 percent of the private work force and produce half of the private gross national product.
"Our instructors are all entrepreneurs," said Carole A. Jones, founder and executive director of the Westchester Center for Training and Development. "By being business owners themselves, they will be giving participants inside information. We're especially encouraging women and minorities because they usually don't have the background or information they need. Many times, they get a business up and running, but the businesses fail. We can give them information on resources they will need to help them get capital for their businesses."
As part of the eight-week course, offered at the campus here and in Yonkers at 525 Nepperhan Plaza, students cover topics like developing a business plan, designing a marketing program, learning how to obtain loans and understanding how to hire, pay and dismiss employees.
For Judy Douglas, a Greenburgh resident who works as a sales representative for the Omni Berkshire Place Hotel in Manhattan, the course provides insights she can use to develop her own business, Baskets Beaucoup, featuring Caribbean gourmet gifts. "I'm finding that natives don't want the stuff," said Ms. Douglas, who already has the Jamaican Tourist Board as a corporate client. "My market is tourists."
The course's practical applications caused Ann Kessler to rethink what she admits were vague concepts of her own business. "I came in really blind," said Ms. Kessler, who works for Nynex. "I have a burning desire to do my own business. I was thinking of running an organizing service, but I really didn't know what was involved. I didn't know anything about the accounting part, doing a business plan or selecting a location. There's a lot to reconsider. I'm learning what it is to run your own business. I still want to do it, but now I'm thinking more of doing a specialty shop."
The instructors don't play down the difficulties of pursuing an entrepreneurial path. "You have to want to compete," said Dr. Shirley Munoz, a senior partner in the Cora Group, a Manhattan-based consulting concern, who gave a presentation on marketing and selling to one class. "It is going to be tough because you are going to lose lots of times. You should understand your competition. To be in your own business is to test yourself all the time. You've got to learn how to brag."
More information about the next series of classes can be obtained from Ms. Jones at 949-2104.
 
Where Women Network
 
WHITE PLAINS
IF successful entrepreneurship depends in part on successful networking, a recent Women's Services Fair at the Y.W.C.A. here offered an opportunity for women in various organizations to share resources and information.
"This was an outgrowth of the Women's Table that started last year," said Dale Wang of the Westchester Jewish Community Services' organization, which was a co-sponsor of the Nov. 16 event, in cooperation with the White Plains Y.W.C.A., the Westchester County Office for Women and Women's News, a local publication. "There are a lot of organizations that are doing a lot of different things, but we didn't know what we were all doing or providing for women in the county. The purpose is to make our constituents aware of what's out there."
Thirty-five organizations sent representatives to the event. Among the participants were health organizations, government agencies, political groups, social services providers and self-help organizations.
"It's really a symbiotic situation," said Susan Pollet, president of the Westchester Women's Bar Association. "Many of our members already serve these organizations. This is a good opportunity to have some knowledge of what these other organizations do."

HEADLINE: Optimism Tempered by Uncertainty

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
PROSPERITY or peril? At year's end, seven business leaders peering at the economy through a crystal ball, see reasons for optimism, tempered by a shadow of uncertainty.
Here are their answers to the question, From your vantage as an industry leader, how would you rate Westchester as a place to do business in 1996?
Carl DiMaio, president of the Builders Institute of Westchester and the mid-Hudson region, a 1,200 member building management professional organization:
Despite lowering interest rates, the building and construction industry will find 1996 a difficult year. Dollar-value building estimates range from $500 million to $700 million, a poor year by pre-1990 standards. Underemployment among the building trades will be about 10 percent higher in May 1996 compared to 1995. 
 With the state and the Federal Government in the midst of fiscal-policy debates, the result is likely to be less money for local projects, including infrastructure. While vacant commercial space is showing signs of a mini-rental resurgence, it may still be four or five years before new commercial buildings are built in volume.
On the positive side, demand for housing, both owner and rental, remains strong, and projects are being proposed in numbers not seen since the early 1970's. Job growth in the state, as well as Westchester, also bodes well for the future. The state's economic development agencies have been restructured to improve services, and the net result should benefit new and existing businesses. State tax cuts and regulatory reforms have contributed to job growth, and more can be expected. On the negative side, restrictive land-use regulations and local government and environment excesses continue to dampen building production.
Westchester and the New York area still have impressive strength in the concentration of large corporations, international trade and technological resources. But from a building and development point of view, real growth in 1996 will be elusive.
Norman Sherman, president of the Hudson Valley chapter of the American Society of Travel Agents and a co-owner, with his wife, Vera, of the Suburban Travel and Cruise Center in Larchmont:
For an objective answer, I would have to ask, "Compared to what?" One year ago there were 231 authorized travel agencies in Westchester. The airlines and cruise lines rate Westchester among the most affluent markets in the country for leisure and business travelers. In spite of this engaging domain, at last count, due to closings, acquisitions and mergers, there were only 203 travel agencies still in business.
We are faced with the reality that new times also bring business perils. Westchester is no longer detached from New York City with a captive clientele. Old-fashioned customer loyalty is fading, and as with most of suburbia, two-income city commuting families, discount malls, saturation national advertising and promotional sales gimmicks have all resulted in diverting local clientele. For example, our travel agency is experiencing a surge of pseudo travel agents and seemingly attractive but fraudulent telemarketing.
Prosperity, more than ever, is predicated on personal service, established local reliability and availability.
Westchester, compared to most areas, can continue to be a desirable place to do business to prosper in today's economy. It is a matter of adjusting and coping with a rapidly changing world.
Steven Cohen, president of the Westchester Bankers Association and vice president of the Republic National Bank Yonkers.
With downsizing and bank mergers, the most recent being Fleet Bank, and taking over NatWest, which will eliminate jobs and branches in Westchester, more and more people are looking to start their own businesses. We see the Small Business Administration working with banks to offer guaranteed loan programs for start-up and financing of small businesses.
As we look toward 1996, we will see that these programs have a positive effect on the small-business community in Westchester County. Small businesses in 1996 will stimulate and drive the economy as well as create new jobs.
In September, the United States Export Assistance Center opened its new office in Westchester County. This office helps business with export marketing and trade finance assistance throughout Westchester. Most people don't know that companies like Federal Express and Intel started out as small businesses with the assistance of the S.B.A.
As we enter 1996, we will probably see more banks merging, but if 1995 was an example of how banks were doing with regard to profitability, I'm sure that 1996 will also show record profits.
Brad W. Berger, president and chief executive officer of the Robert Martin Company, Elmsford.
Westchester, along with the rest of the country, experienced a commercial real estate depression from 1989 to 1993. During 1994 and 1995, the market improved significantly; 1996 looks promising as employment and productivity are high, interest rates are low, the stock market is booming, many large companies are hiring again and start-up companies are abundant.
The residential, retail and hotel sectors have already shown dramatic improvements. We believe the office and industrial markets will follow suit because vacancy rates are down, financing is both inexpensive and plentiful and rental rates have strengthened in both New York City and Fairfield County, two contiguous markets with which Westchester competes.
Robert Martin believes that the commercial real estate market will continue to improve in the 90's. We intend to be a significant player in this area as we grow our core business of high-end flex, industrial and office properties via development, construction and acquisition.
Carl Austin, president, Austin Corporate Properties, White Plains.
I see prosperity ahead, as our own company's recent activity would indicate. For example, this past year we were the broker in a number of significant transactions, namely Ciba relocation from Ardsley to Tarrytown.
And this month we are completing the acquisition as broker of 322 acres for Centennial Golf Properties in Putnam County, on the Westchester border, for a 27-hole golf course development.
We are also the broker in the acquisition by Reckson Associates Realty of Halpern Enterprise Realty Corporation on a $83 million transaction. These deals are symbolic of renewed energy and growth in the greater Westchester market, which I feel confident will continue in 1996.
Antoniette A. Emerson, president, Westchester County Board of Realtors, and a realtor at Houlihan Lawrence in Bedford.
Many areas of our state and country continue to feel the effects of these vast changes in somewhat uncertain times. And so do we in Westchester, but to a lesser extent.
Why? Because of the diversity of jobs within the county and nearby areas, the variety of housing options, the excellent educational facilities and the quality of life.
Be it city, suburban or rural, Westchester remains a place where people want to stay if they live here, or to move to if they don't.
Helped by low interest rates, all this has created a stable and growing real estate business. We have experienced three consecutive years of record-breaking residential real estate sales, and we can expect the momentum to continue during 1996.
Marcia Dmochowski, president of the Westchester County Hotel Association and executive manager of the Tarrytown Hilton, Tarrytown.
Nineteen ninety-six should be a healthy year for Westchester. After three to five years of little growth and corporate downsizing, Westchester is now attracting new companies to the area, such as Mastercard and Heineken's.
As such organizations as the Westchester County Association and the Westchester Business Partnership continue their successful efforts to lure more companies to Westchester, the growth trend should continue.
Tourism will also continue to grow through efforts of various organizations to sell Westchester as a leisure destination and an alternative to New York City.

HEADLINE: VIEWPOINT;
Next Stop, the Statehouse

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN J. STEIN; Benjamin J. Stein, a lawyer and economist, teaches law at Pepperdine Law School in Malibu, Calif.

 BODY:
NOW for a few words about the limits of federalism.
Capping one of the most successful lobbying campaigns in the history of the Republic, the accountants and high-tech companies of America received the ultimate Christmas present this month. Congress passed into law -- over President Clinton's uncertain-trumpet veto -- their beloved "tort reform" as it applies to stockholders' lawsuits contending securities law violations. The accounting firms and high-tech companies asserted that they had been beaten down by meritless lawsuits, and their stupendously effective campaign has resulted in changes in Federal law that largely undo the disclosure requirements and antifraud rules of the last 62 years. 
 Under the new legislation, public companies have the explicit ability to omit material facts in forward-looking statements about their companies' prospects. Accountants are largely freed of liability for approving a company's fraudulent statements, even if those statements cost stockholders their life savings (unless it can be proved that the accountants knew of the fraud). There are also requirements in the law for courts to consider punishing law firms that sue and lose, and drastic cutbacks on what can be discovered by lawyers in early stages of a lawsuit against supposedly transgressing managers of public companies.
So now you might think, it's a big country -- if we can't sue in Federal courts, at least we can sue in state courts. There, we can still find antifraud laws that require full disclosure, no misleading statements or material omissions of fact, and the panoply of protections we assumed were part of American securities law. So what's the problem?
It is twofold. First, Federal courts often have more knowledgeable judges than state courts, and litigants usually want the smartest, best-informed judges possible.
Second, the same juggernaut that gave us Federal restrictions on securities tort cases is now moving to the state level. Flush with the knowledge of what organization, money and publicity can achieve, the accountantsand the high-tech lobby have succeeded in getting a measure, euphemistically called the Shareholder Litigation Reform Initiative, placed on the ballot here in California. If enacted, it would place even worse limits on California state securities litigation than those found in the Federal law.
The initiative would institute loser-pays provisions, thus drastically penalizing stockholders who dare to sue management and fail for any reason -- including running out of money to litigate. The loser-pays arrangements would even more radically inhibit plaintiffs' securities firms that dare to take on entrenched management -- the management fighting the stockholders, as always, with stockholders' money.
This litigation "reform" is widely believed to have an excellent chance of passage. If enacted, it will firmly shut the doors on most securities cases in state courts in California except the most unlikely ones -- in which a defendant admits up front that he maliciously lied, for example, or an accounting firm confesses to having knowingly committed fraud.
Such a law would be an invitation to accountants in other states to mount the same effort. As these laws become a national phenomenon, the field will become hopelessly tilted against the small investor. Most important, the accountants' paradox will have been established: accountants will no longer be fully accountable.
THIS anti-investor movement at the state and Federal levels comes as Social Security looks fragile and Americans increasingly fret about putting more money into savings and investments and worry whether their money is being fairly managed. It comes as the supposedly wounded high-tech companies attract huge capital to their projects. It comes as corporate profits boom. In other words, it comes just as investors need a leg-up most and management needs it least.
Two weeks ago in Tucson, Ariz., at a conference of securities lawyers discussing tort reform, a study revealed that payments to stockholders for Federal securities fraud cases of the last 25 years totaled about $2.5 billion, while corporate profits in the same period were roughly $5 trillion. As I pointed out to the conference, the $2.5 billion is such a relatively small sum to make stockholders whole that it hardly seems worth the fuss.
"It's not small to the accountants," answered one of the authors of the study. And thereby hangs the whole tale. To save accountants from being held accountable, the whole national structure of securities laws is under a highly successful attack. Money talks, especially when it is talking the language of campaign contributions. At the end of 1995, it drowned out the voices of the savers and investors of America -- and it's getting louder.
